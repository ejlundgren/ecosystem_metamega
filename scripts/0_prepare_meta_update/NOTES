I have noticed some errors in teh data collection. AFTER creating all the files

Editing means, etc, is fine. But changing row numbers breaks the data point ID

So no adding new effect sizes...Unless it's really bad. And then well have to output a
file with the current data_point_IDs and responses merged in. And reorganize entire
file structure
