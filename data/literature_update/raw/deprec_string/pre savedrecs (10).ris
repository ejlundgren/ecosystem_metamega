AB  - The tiger (Panthera tigris) is a charismatic megafauna species that originated and diversified in Asia and probably experienced population contraction and expansion during the Pleistocene, resulting in low genetic diversity of modern tigers. However, little is known about patterns of genomic diversity in ancient populations. Here we generated whole-genome sequences from ancient or historical (100-10,000 yr old) specimens collected across mainland Asia, including a 10,600-yr-old Russian Far East specimen (RUSA21, 8x coverage) plus six ancient mitogenomes, 14 South China tigers (0.1-12x) and three Caspian tigers (4-8x). Admixture analysis showed that RUSA21 clustered within modern Northeast Asian phylogroups and partially derived from an extinct Late Pleistocene lineage. While some of the 8,000-10,000-yr-old Russian Far East mitogenomes are basal to all tigers, one 2,000-yr-old specimen resembles present Amur tigers. Phylogenomic analyses suggested that the Caspian tiger probably dispersed from an ancestral Northeast Asian population and experienced gene flow from southern Bengal tigers. Lastly, genome-wide monophyly supported the South China tiger as a distinct subspecies, albeit with mitochondrial paraphyly, hence resolving its longstanding taxonomic controversy. The distribution of mitochondrial haplogroups corroborated by biogeographical modelling suggested that Southwest China was a Late Pleistocene refugium for a relic basal lineage. As suitable habitat returned, admixture between divergent lineages of South China tigers took place in Eastern China, promoting the evolution of other northern subspecies. Altogether, our analysis of ancient genomes sheds light on the evolutionary history of tigers and supports the existence of nine modern subspecies.
   Phylogenetics and population genetics analysis of ancient tiger genomes inform tiger evolution and suggest post-glaciation admixture of divergent tiger lineages in China.

AB  - Wildlife crossing structures (WCSs) are an important measure to protect biodiversity and reduce human-wildlife conflict, especiallyfor bundled linear infrastructure. The aim of this study was to evaluate two "management and behavioral" factors (salt blocks and feces) in relation to two "structural factors" (underpasses'dimension and distance of bundled linear infrastructure) along Qinghai-Tibet bundled linear infrastructure (Qinghai-Tibet railway alignment runs parallel to the Qinghai-Tibet highway) and Gonghe-Yushu bundled linear infrastructure (Gonghe-Yushu expressway is parallel to the Gonghe-Yushu highway) using infrared cameras. Eight underpasses were monitored in the Qinghai-Tibet railway and six in the Gonghe-Yushu expressway, with half of the induced experimental group and half of the control group in each area. The monitoring shows that the Qinghai-Tibet railway area has richer species diversity than the Gonghe-Yushu expressway area. Salt block and feces induction experiments showed that the relative abundance index (RAI) of the experimental and control groups did not reveal significant differences in both areas. In addition, we found that the wider the width of the underpasses, the higher the utilization rate of kiang ( Equus kiang) and wolly hare ( Lepus oiostolus). And the distance from the adjacent linear infrastructure was positively correlated with the frequency of wolly hare, while no correlation was found with other species. In summary, this study found that salt block and feces induction could not improve the utilization rate of ungulates to underpasses of bundled linear infrastructure on Tibetan Plateau, and preliminary understood the factors affecting the utilization rate of underpasses.

AB  - Transhumance is one of the oldest traditional agricultural practices in Val Senales (Italy) and the Western Pontic Mountains (Turkey), playing a crucial role in shaping alpine ecosystems. This study examines the impact of traditional pastoral management on the distribution of dominant plant species and phytomass levels in summer grazing areas. Grazing routes were analyzed using NDVI values derived from drone-based orthophotos captured at an altitude of 35 m during the peak of the transhumance season in June, allowing for the quantification of vegetation cover and dominant species composition. Ethnographic fieldwork with local shepherds in Finailhof and the Vercenik Valley provided insights into traditional ecological knowledge related to pasture management and seasonal flock movements. Additionally, herbarium methods were employed to identify grazed plant species along the grazing routes. Although both regions share similar alpine climatic conditions, their distinct socio-cultural contexts and land-use histories result in different patterns of grazing impact and phytomass distribution. This bi-disciplinary research examines the relationship between NDVI values, phytomass variation, and dominant plant species in both study sites. The findings highlight the significance of integrating traditional ecological knowledge with remote sensing and ecological field methods to support sustainable pasture management and inform alpine policy frameworks. By combining ecological and ethnographic perspectives, the study contributes to a deeper understanding of the interdependent dynamics between cultural practices and environmental processes in pasture management of high-mountain landscapes.

AB  - Large carnivores are recovering in many landscapes where the human footprint is simultaneously growing. When carnivores encounter humans, the way they behave often changes, which may subsequently influence how they affect their prey. However, little research investigates the behavioural mechanisms underpinning carnivore response to humans. As a result, it is not clear how predator-prey interactions and their associated ecosystem processes will play out in the human-dominated areas into which carnivore populations are increasingly expanding.We hypothesized that humans would reduce predation risk for prey by disturbing carnivores or threatening their survival. Alternatively, or additionally, we hypothesized that humans would increase predation risk by providing forage resources that congregate herbivorous prey in predictable places and times.Using grey wolves Canis lupus in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, USA as a study species, we investigated 170 kill sites across a spectrum of human influences ranging from heavily restricted human activities on protected federal lands to largely unregulated activities on private lands. Then, we used conditional logistic regression to quantify how the probability of predation changed across varied types and amounts of human influences, while controlling for environmental characteristics and prey availability.Wolves primarily made kills in environmental terrain traps and where prey availability was high, but predation risk was significantly better explained with the inclusion of human influences than by environmental characteristics alone. Different human influences had different, and even converse, effects on the risk of wolf predation. For example, where prey were readily available, wolves preferentially killed animals far from motorized roads but close to unpaved trails. However, wolves responded less strongly to humans, if at all, where prey were scarce, suggesting they prioritized acquiring prey over avoiding human interactions.Overall, our work reveals that the effects of large carnivores on prey populations can vary considerably among different types of human influences, yet carnivores may not appreciably alter predatory behaviour in response to humans if prey are difficult to obtain. These results shed new light on the drivers of large carnivore behaviour in anthropogenic areas while improving understanding of predator-prey dynamics in and around the wildland-urban interface.

AB  - 1. The impacts of natural disasters on marine mammals are poorly understood and difficult to study, which can hamper management responses following such events.
   2. This study provides the first distribution and abundance assessment of New Zealand fur seal (NZFS: Arctocephalus forsteri) colonies around Kaikoura, New Zealand, since a 7.8 magnitude earthquake in November 2016 caused substantial changes to both the local marine and terrestrial environments, and led to the reconstruction of a major highway that runs adjacent to NZFS colonies.
   3. Mark-recapture and direct counts in the 2022-2023 breeding season estimated pup production for NZFS breeding colonies along the Kaikoura coast. Using established multipliers, pup estimates were used to provide the first comprehensive population estimate for Kaikoura's NZFS population since the earthquake.
   4. Three new colonies and three new subcolonies were assessed and recorded, additional to reassessments of two established colonies. Overall, Kaikoura's NZFS population has grown and spread post-earthquake, with an upper total population estimate of between 21,560 and 28,327 animals in the 2022-2023 breeding season. Some sites, such as Lynch's Reef, appear to have benefited from earthquake-induced coastal uplift, with pup production increasing. Contrastingly, the estimated 2,401 (+/- 99) pups produced at (O) over bar hau Point in 2023 is similar to preearthquake estimates. This indicates that the earthquake has disrupted previously documented growth at this site. The distribution of NZFS breeding at (O) over bar hau Point has also changed substantially since the last pre-earthquake assessment.
   5. From these findings, alterations to the (O) over bar hau Point New Zealand Fur Seal Sanctuary and similar protections at other locations on the Kaik (o) over bar ura coast are suggested, as greater numbers of NZFSs are now accessible to human interaction and disturbance. The results demonstrate both how natural disasters and subsequent infrastructure modifications can impact coastal species and how conservation measures may need to be amended accordingly.

AB  - An associated microbiome of any host helps it in different metabolic processes ranging from the decomposition of food to the maturation of gametes. Organisms with a parasitic mode of life, though present at nutritious sites inside their host, maintain their own microbiome. Nevertheless, the comprehensive characterization and functionality of microbiome in parasitic organisms remain understudied. We selected two nematode parasites of Kashmir Merino sheep viz; Haemonchus contortus and Trichuris ovis based on their higher prevalence, difference in mode of nutrition, habitation site and effect on host. The objective of the study was to explore the bacteria associated with these parasitic nematodes of sheep. We adopted a 16S rRNA metagenomic sequencing approach to estimate and compare the bacterial communities present in these two nematode species. Nematode parasites from Kashmir Merino sheep were identified morphologically and confirmed with DNA characterization. H. contortus was dominated by phylum Proteobacteria (57%), Firmicutes (25%), Bacteroidota (15%) and Actinobacteriota (3%). Conversely, T. ovis showed Proteobacteria (78%) followed by Firmicutes (8%), Bacteroidota (8%), Actinobacteriota (1%), Fusobacteriota (1%) and other phyla (4%). This study provides a comprehensive account of the microbiome composition of H. contortus and T. ovis, both of which are highly prevalent among Kashmir Merino sheep. Additionally, T. ovis exhibited a greater bacterial diversity compared to H. contortus. Notably, these nematodes were found to harbor certain pathogenic bacteria. This study can further be carried forward in gaining insights into the complex relationship between the microbiota of a parasite and its pathogenicity, reproductive potential and host microbiome modification.

AB  - We investigated intraerythrocytic Babesia parasites in 21 Japanese wild boars, Sus scrofa leucomystax, captured in Wakayama Prefecture on the mainland from 2008 to 2009 and in 31 Japanese wild boars from 2011 to 2013 in Kochi Prefecture on Shikoku Island, Japan. We detected small subunit ribosomal RNA (18S rRNA) gene (SSUrDNA) fragments of a Babesia species in 17 boars from Wakayama and 18 boars from Kochi. The nearly full SSUrDNA sequence (1669 bps) of this species was determined. A FASTA search revealed that the SSUrDNA sequence of the Babesia sp. in Japanese wild boars was the most homologous to those of several Babesia isolates reported as Babesia gibsoni. Phylogenetic analysis showed that the Babesia sp. found in Japanese wild boars was the closest relative to B. gibsoni but made a different clade from B. gibsoni. The Babesia sp. in Japanese wild boars was completely different from Babesia sp. Suis found in a European domestic pig, Sus scrofa domesticus. By microscopic examination, ring-shaped, oval and pear-shaped small sized intraerythrocytic parasites were observed on blood smears of 12 of 18 Japanese wild boars whose blood smears could be examined in Wakayama. We also detected SSUrDNA fragments of a Hepatozoon species in 6 of the 21 wild boars from Wakayama.

AB  - This research concerns the impact of air and soil pollution on the health status of selected tree species in parks and urban forests. The analysis was carried out over a decade, which allowed for creating the best models illustrating the impact of selective factors related to air and soil pollution on the health status of small-leaved limes, maples, oaks, and chestnut trees in the city. (1) Background and Objectives: The research aimed to identify the environmental factors that have the greatest impact on the health condition of trees in urban conditions and show which species are the most resistant to pollution in urban areas. The research object was 2441 individuals of four tree species inhabiting 11 parks and urban forests in Poznan. We assessed the trees in terms of dendrometric parameters and health status. Tree-stand soils were tested for P, K, Ca, Mg, and Na content using various analytical methods. Air data were obtained from a generally accessible WIOS website. The above data were statistically analyzed using one-way ANOVA and canonical correlation analysis (CCA). Our research has shown that unfavorable environmental parameters impact the health status of trees growing in urban areas. The most significant negative impact of O-3 on the health of three out of four examined tree species was demonstrated. Other pollutants that affect the trees health include Mn (in the soil) and NO, NO2, CO, and C6H6 (in the air). Oak turned out to be the most resistant species to urban pollution. The area where chestnut trees grew turned out to be the most Fe, Mn, Na, and Pb soil-polluted and air-polluted with most of the substances recorded. The permissible concentration levels were exceeded in the case of tropospheric NOx, PM10, PM2.(5), and Pb.

AB  - Herbivore management is an important tool for resilience-based approaches to coral reef conservation, and evidence-based science is needed to enact successful management. We synthesized data from multiple monitoring programs in Hawai'i to measure herbivore biomass and benthic condition over a 10-year period preceding any major coral bleaching. We analysed data from 20 242 transects alongside data on 27 biophysical and human drivers and found herbivore biomass was highly variable throughout Hawai'i, with high values in remote locations and the lowest values near population centres. Both human and biophysical drivers explained variation in herbivore biomass, and among the human drivers both fishing and land-based pollution had negative effects on biomass. We also found evidence that herbivore functional group biomass is strongly linked to benthic condition, and that benthic condition is sensitive to changes in herbivore biomass associated with fishing. We show that when herbivore biomass is below 80% of potential biomass, benthic condition is predicted to decline. We also show that a range of management actions, including area-specific fisheries regulations and gear restrictions, can increase parrotfish biomass. Together, these results provide lines of evidence to support managing herbivores as an effective strategy for maintaining or bolstering reef resilience in a changing climate.

AB  - The white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) contributes indirectly to the enzootic circulation of the Lyme disease pathogen, Borrelia burgdorferi by serving as the primary reproductive host for adult-stage blacklegged ticks (Ixodes scapularis). The role of white-tailed deer as a host for juvenile life stages is less well understood, in part because their periods of activity typically fall outside of most white-tailed deer hunting seasons. We inspected 22 road-killed deer for all stages of blacklegged ticks in Rutland County, Vermont from May to August in 2020, 2021, and 2024. Adult-stage blacklegged ticks were found attached to ten deer in May and early June. Larval-stage ticks, including ones that were partially engorged, were found on 3/5 deer inspected by hanging the head, hide, and legs over water for approximately 24 hours. We directly observed 7 nymphal-stage ticks attached to one additional deer. This study adds to a growing body of evidence that the role of juvenile feeding on white-tailed deer may be underestimated and demonstrates that the study of road-killed deer may improve our understanding of how populations of blacklegged ticks are maintained among wildlife communities.

AB  - The distribution of the threatened fern Ophioglossum vulgatum L., a plant with extremely small populations (PSESPs) in Sardinia, is characterized by small disjunct populations with only a few individuals, and little is known about its status in the wild. To provide information for the conservation of O. vulgatum and with the aim to develop an in situ conservation strategy, we investigated its distribution, population size, and habitat. Field surveys confirmed that the species grows in only five localities. Two representative populations were selected for this study (Funtanamela and Gedili), and in each population, all plants were mapped and monitored monthly from April to August over an 8-year period. During the study, the populations had a very low number of reproductive plants and the populations appeared to be in decline, with the total number of plants per population slightly decreased in Gedili while a sharp reduction was recorded in Funtanamela due to wild boar threat. A fence was built in order to protect the site from further damage, but no noticeable signals of recovery were observed. The most urgent conservation requirement for this species is to preserve the threatened habitat of the remnant populations. Further field surveys and research are also required for an improved understanding of the species' status.

AB  - Caprine overbrowsing is a main threat to trees of pastoral mountain woodlands in the Mediterranean region of Europe. In this study, we assess the impact of browsing exclusion on the growth and regeneration of the en-dangered Zelkova abelicea, a Paleogene relict tree endemic to Crete (Greece). Shoot elongation, height growth and natural regeneration were monitored during two to five years in 31 fenced plots across the distribution range of the species. We found that in the absence of browsing pressure, Z. abelicea produces shoots on average two times longer than when browsed, therefore clearly demonstrating the negative impact of current browsing pressure on the growth performance of the species. Shoot elongation and height growth were maximal in most plots during the first two years following fencing, after which growth rates decreased. The proportion of trees that reached a height considered out of reach of caprine browsing had more than doubled already after four years, although this was dependent on initial tree height. Shoot elongation and height growth were positively correlated with tree height, and smaller trees took more time to reach a specific height. Seedlings were only found in three fenced plots as well as in two control browsed areas during a single year and only in western Crete. This underlines the possible strong and concerning impact of climatic factors on seed formation as well as on seedling growth and survival, although site specificities such as stand structure and micro-topography should also be considered. Our findings have important implications for conservation actions, as they can help choose which stands and which individuals to fence in priority for efficient long-term conservation.

AB  - Amid ongoing habitat degradation and fragmentation, along with the disruption of traditional moving routes, the Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework underscores the urgent need to enhance species connectivity to improve their adaptability to climate change. Recent instances of long-distance movements by Asian elephants (Elephas maximus) have raised concerns about the potential for such events to become more frequent under future climate scenarios. A landscape adaptation strategy is urgently needed to improve the connectivity and integrity of Asian elephant habitats to meet their long-distance movement requirements. However, large-scale ecological networks for Asian elephants that incorporate long-distance corridors remain lacking. This study employs species distribution models and minimum resistance models to construct current and future multi-scenario ecological networks, aiming to elucidate key features of climate adaptability and priority corridor strategies for Asian elephants. Our findings indicate that long-distance corridors identified under future climate scenarios play an integral part in maintaining connectivity within the priority network. The study identifies 162 priority long-distance corridors, accounting for 25.5% of the overall network, whose lengths and importance are expected to increase. Additionally, 37.2% of these priority corridors pass through protected areas, providing guidance for optimizing existing reserves and addressing conservation gaps that cover 61.2% of the study area. The study highlights the need for habitat conservation strategies for Asian elephants to fully consider the uncertainties of dynamic spatiotemporal changes. It emphasizes the global significance of macro-scale ecological network design and the critical role of constructing long-distance corridors. Furthermore, the integration of protected areas with long-distance ecological corridors is identified as a key measure to address future uncertainties and achieve lasting biodiversity conservation.

AB  - Anthropogenic activities such as mining and road construction pose significant threats to ungulate species in the central Iranian plateau. We conducted a comprehensive study focusing on three key ungulates: wild goat (Capra aegagrus), urial (Ovis vignei), and jebeer gazelle (Gazella bennetti). These species rely heavily on migration corridors for functional connectivity, making them vulnerable to the habitat fragmentation caused by human development. Our research integrates ensemble habitat suitability modelling and connectivity analysis to assess the impacts of mining and road construction on the core habitats of these ungulates and their habitat connectivity. Ensemble models predicted large suitable habitats for all three species; however, a considerable portion of these habitats was compromised by the development of mining roads, highlighting the urgency of conservation actions. We found that wild goat habitats were patchy and fragmented, whereas urial and jebeer habitats were more expansive and better connected. Analysis of core habitats identified critical areas for the species survival. For instance, an important core area for wild goats was located in the central part of the landscape, whereas the core habitat for urials was situated in the eastern part. Multiple core areas were identified for jebeer gazelles, highlighting the diverse habitat preferences of the species. We found extensive overlap between the core habitats of the three species and conservation areas (approximately 80%). Connectivity simulations revealed strong conservation network coverage (between 81 and 91%), emphasizing the importance of conservation areas. Our findings underscore the immediate need for conservation interventions to mitigate the impacts of road development on ungulate habitats and migration corridors in central Iran. This research contributes vital information for informed decision-making in conservation planning and sustainable development in the region.

AB  - Mammalian body size diminution across the Late Pleistocene-Early Holocene transition in the southern Levant has been much researched, with special focus on gazelle in Levantine Mediterranean zones. Explanations of body size diminutions in those cases include temperature increase and anthropogenic factors. This study examines body size shifts in three mammalian taxa - Gazella (gazelle), Lepus (hare) and Vulpes (fox) - between 24,000-7500 cal BP, in the steppic Azraq Basin of northeast Jordan. Osteometrics derive from 19 archaeological sites through the Late Pleistocene-Early Holocene sequence. We use a 'Z-score' index of relative body size, and time-series analyses, to track body size shifts. All three taxa show relatively larger body size in the Late Pleistocene compared to the Early Holocene, with smallest Late Pleistocene sizes seen between 12,000-11,500 cal BP, during the Younger Dryas. While gazelles and hare recover size in our Early Holocene samples, they both show smaller sizes after 9000 cal BP. Similarity in size trends leads us to reject the influence of anthropogenic factors alone, in favour of ecological and climatic factors. We attribute the sharp size decrease in gazelles in the Late Neolithic, 9000-7500 cal BP, to inter-specific size change, and the addition of a smaller Arabian species better adapted to the warmer arid post 8.2 kya conditions. Patterns for fox, albeit on small sample sizes, also hint at species turnover but in the Late Pleistocene. For hare, we track size decrease between the Late Pleistocene and Early Holocene as possible intra-specific diminution. Combined results argue for mammalian taxa experiencing complex responses to shifting ecological conditions in the Late Pleistocene-Early Holocene. Body size trends in the Azraq Basin appear counter to the expectations of Bergmann's rule of thermoregulation. We propose instead that forage conditions, and resource availability and limitations are better fit drivers of mammalian body size adaptations and turnover (including species distribution shifts) in this semi-arid case study region.

AB  - Predator-prey dynamics are an important aspect of community ecology, but predation events are often difficult to observe. Among African primates, observations of mammal predation are particularly uncommon and generally restricted to a few ape and cercopithecoid species. I report five observations of mammal predation by golden-bellied mangabeys (Cercocebus chrysogaster) living in rainforest at the LuiKotale study site, Democratic Republic of the Congo. Over 46 all-day follows, mangabeys from one group caught and consumed four duikers (Cephalophinae spp.) and one Alexander's cusimanse (Crossarchus alexandri). Individuals begged from the feeding individual in three of five observations. I observed one successful attempt at begging, which resulted in an adult female tolerating removal of blue duiker by a juvenile. These are the first detailed observations of mammal predation and food sharing by Cercocebus mangabeys and suggest mammals that feed alongside mangabeys may balance predation risk against social foraging benefits. Food sharing is rarely observed in most cercopithecine monkeys and could provide a useful metric to examine socio-ecological patterns of food acquisition.

AB  - This study examines the perceived influence of corruption on the practice of trophy hunting in South Africa, the largest trophy exporter in Africa. Corruption is a major problem in South Africa, where it takes the form of bribery and embezzlement. To investigate its perceived effects on the practice of trophy hunting, semi-structured interviews were conducted with 15 trophy hunting stakeholders in South Africa. Interviews were conducted via Zoom, recorded, transcribed, and coded using a qualitative content analysis. Six of the 15 respondents had personally witnessed corruption in the trophy hunting industry in South Africa, and 13 respondents had heard accounts of corruption witnessed or experienced by others. Respondents identified several perceived problems caused by corruption in the trophy hunting industry and suggested ways to mitigate corruption. Based on these results, a multi-pronged approach for addressing corruption within the trophy hunting industry in South Africa may be necessary.

AB  - Growing evidence suggests that complex spatial structure occurs within the Scotian Shelf and southern Grand Banks (SSGB) Atlantic halibut stock, yet large knowledge gaps remain about diversity of migratory and spawning behaviors. Here, 71 popup satellite archival tags were deployed on large Atlantic halibut (FL: 87-166 cm) between 2012 and 2020. Migration tracks were successfully reconstructed for 43 fish using a hidden Markov geolocation model, and temperature and depth time series were available for an additional nine fish (total n = 52). Five migratory behavior categories were identified: shelf residency, slope residency, shelf-channel migration, shelf-slope migration, and dispersal. High-resolution data for four of 20 physically recovered tags provided evidence of putative spawning behavior in deep channels on the continental shelf and along the continental slope between January and February. Additionally, four halibut displayed previously undocumented periods of sustained, oscillatory vertical movements along the continental slope between November and February. The high migratory diversity observed in this study provides support for the existence of multiple resident and migratory contingents in the SSGB stock in the apparent absence of significant genetic structure.

AB  - Simple Summary Mass outbreaks of the pine sawfly Diprion pini can cause severe damage to pine forests. The larvae of this herbivorous insect feed selectively on the needles of pine trees, notably Pinus sylvestris. During mass outbreak periods, the females release large amounts of sex pheromones. A prior study revealed that the survival rate of sawfly eggs laid on pheromone-exposed pine needles was lower than that of eggs on unexposed pine. In our study, we found that D. pini females avoided oviposition on pheromone-exposed pine, possibly as a counter-adaptation to the enhanced defenses of previously pheromone-exposed trees against sawfly eggs. The females only discriminated between pheromone-exposed and unexposed trees when they had the chance to touch the needles, but not when exposed to the odor of these types of trees. However, the performance of larvae did not significantly differ on pheromone-exposed and unexposed trees. These results underscore the complexity of the chemical ecology of sawfly-pine interactions and highlight the nuanced roles that pheromones play in shaping the relationships between herbivores and their host plants.Abstract Insect pheromones have been intensively studied with respect to their role in insect communication. However, scarce knowledge is available on the impact of pheromones on plant responses, and how these in turn affect herbivorous insects. A previous study showed that exposure of pine (Pinus sylvestris) to the sex pheromones of the pine sawfly Diprion pini results in enhanced defenses against the eggs of this sawfly; the egg survival rate on pheromone-exposed pine needles was lower than that on unexposed pine. The long-lasting common evolutionary history of D. pini and P. sylvestris suggests that D. pini has developed counter-adaptations to these pine responses. Here, we investigated by behavioral assays how D. pini copes with the defenses of pheromone-exposed pine. The sawfly females did not discriminate between the odor of pheromone-exposed and unexposed pine. However, when they had the chance to contact the trees, more unexposed than pheromone-exposed trees received eggs. The exposure of pine to the pheromones did not affect the performance of larvae and their pupation success. Our findings indicate that the effects that responses of pine to D. pini sex pheromones exert on the sawfly eggs and sawfly oviposition behavior do not extend to effects on the larvae.

AB  - Human-elephant conflict (HEC) poses a serious problem in Africa for both local livelihoods and elephant conservation. Elephant damage is the price local people pay for coexisting with this species, and is assumed to reduce tolerance for elephants. However, conservation-related projects, through the benefits they offer may enhance local tolerance toward elephants. This study aimed to examine how crop damage by elephants and the benefits gained from conservation activities affect local people's tolerance toward elephants around Moukalaba-Doudou National Park in southwest Gabon based on long-term ethnographic research and interview surveys in two periods (2010 and 2019). Based on the results, crop damage by elephants had a significant negative impact on the local social economy, leading to a decrease in human population in the area and making local people highly resentful of elephants. However, in one of the villages where employment from research and conservation activities was concentrated, many acknowledged the benefits associated with wildlife and expressed high tolerance for elephants. These findings suggest that benefits from conservation activities can increase tolerance toward elephants, which is negatively affected by the crop damage they cause. However, it should also be noted that externally generated projects have limitations and drawbacks. It is important to establish a system in which the benefits of conservation are shared widely and distributed appropriately, and wherein income resources are diversified. Multisectoral interventions focusing on local socio-ecological vulnerability are needed to mitigate human-elephant conflict and advance the conservation of African elephants.

AB  - This study explored the role of the hydrological regime as a trigger factor for wildlife roadkill along a 22 km road crossing the Taim Wetland, a Ramsar site of international importance in South Brazil. The north-south crossing of BR-471, a federal highway, causes fatalities to numerous animals due to collisions with vehicles. An 11-year long-term time series study encompassing monthly roadkill incidents, water level, and rainfall was analyzed by considering three different periods related to a Wildlife Protection System (WPS): (i) 3 initial years before the WPS implementation (BWPS); (ii) 4 intermediate years after the WPS implementation (AWPS), which includes fences, fauna tunnels, cattle guard stocks, bumps, and speed control; (iii) 4 final years during partial destruction of the WPS (PDWPS). A pseudo-2D full hydrodynamic cell model was employed to fill missing water level data. The model had a good to very good performance (NSE: 0.73 to 0.87; R-2: 0.79 to 0.90). The relationship between roadkill incidents and the WPS periods (BWPS, AWPS, and PDWPS) was modeled using Generalized Additive Models for Location, Scale, and Shape (GAMLSS), considering rainfall and water level as predictor variables. The analysis revealed a higher incidence of wildlife roadkill in BWPS compared to AWPS and PDWPS, suggesting the effectiveness of the implemented measures. Critical season and interplay between water levels, rainfall, and the roadkill were assessed. Mammals was the most common roadkill class identified (similar to 92%), followed by reptiles (13%) and birds (2%), with no change in these percentual in the BWPS, AWPS, and PDWPS. Among mammals, capybara (Hydrochoerus hydrochaeris) and coypu (Myocastor coypu) were the most frequent victims (similar to 93% of mammals). Winter, followed by autumn, recorded the highest number of roadkill incidents (> 60%), and this pattern remained consistent during the three periods. While rainfall did not emerge as a determining variable for roadkill, water levels above certain thresholds (> 3.3 m) drastically diminished the effectiveness of the WPS, mainly due to fauna tunnel submersion. These findings offer valuable insights for enhancing wildlife conservation strategies in this protected area by incorporating hydrological information providing a baseline for designing WPS in similar environments.

AB  - Plants growing outside their native range may be confronted by new regimes of herbivory, but how this affects plant chemical defence profiles has rarely been studied. Using Plantago lanceolata as a model species, we investigated whether introduced populations show significant differences from native populations in several growth and chemical defence traits. Plantago lanceolata (ribwort plantain) is an herbaceous plant species native to Europe and Western Asia that has been introduced to numerous countries worldwide. We sampled seeds from nine native and 10 introduced populations that covered a broad geographic and environmental range and performed a greenhouse experiment, in which we infested half of the plants in each population with caterpillars of the generalist herbivore Spodoptera littoralis. We then measured size-related and resource-allocation traits as well as the levels of constitutive and induced chemical defence compounds in roots and shoots of P. lanceolata. When we considered the environmental characteristics of the site of origin, our results revealed that populations from introduced ranges were characterized by an increase in chemical defence compounds without compromising plant biomass. The concentrations of iridoid glycosides and verbascoside, the major anti-herbivore defence compounds of P. lanceolata, were higher in introduced populations than in native populations. In addition, introduced populations exhibited greater rates of herbivore-induced volatile organic compound emission and diversity, and similar chemical diversity based on untargeted analyses of leaf methanol extracts. In conclusion, the geographic origin of the populations had a significant influence on morphological and chemical plant traits, suggesting that P. lanceolata populations are not only adapted to different environments in their native range, but also in their introduced range.

AB  - Dermatemys mawii is a critically endangered freshwater turtle endemic to Central America. In the wild, these turtles are thought to be wholly herbivorous as adults and feed on a variety of vegetation; however, no studies have quantitatively assessed potential dietary differences based on biotic and abiotic factors. The purpose of our study was to describe and quantify the wild diet of D. mawii and assess differences based on habitat, maturity, and sex. We evaluated the stomach contents of 66 turtles legally harvested by local hunters for personal consumption throughout the country of Belize. Percent volume (by displacement) and percent frequency of each stomach item were used to calculate an index of relative importance (IRI). One algal and 6 plant families contributed to an overall diet composition consisting of leaves, flowers, stems, seedpods, seeds, and fruit. Rocks and invertebrates were also consumed, although we believe these to be incidental consumption. The leaves of the riparian tree Inga edulis were present in 73.1% of turtle stomachs and accounted for almost half of the total volume of all stomach contents combined. We used Spearman rank correlation coefficients to test the null hypothesis that there was no correlation in the rankings of stomach items (i.e., there were differences) when comparing turtles by habitat, age, and sex. There were significant differences in the ranking of food items between river and lagoon habitats, with lagoon turtles relying heavily on the algae Nadia sp.; however, the stomach contents from both habitats were equally diverse (H-rivers = 1.68, H-lagoons = 1.64). There were no differences in IRIs between adults and juveniles or between males and females. Our results emphasize the importance of habitat in D. mawii diet selection and the importance of leaves from riparian plants species that are shed into their aquatic habitats.

AB  - Pontechium maculatum is a western Palearctic forest-steppe element. In this study, the ecological conditions of this species were analysed, along with updating its distribution data in Romania. Distributional data for P. maculatum were taken from herbaria, literature records and field surveys. Following the analysis of the species, a map showing its distribution in Romania was provided. In addition, certain considerations regarding the ecology of the species were presented. Our results indicated the presence of 80 populations of P. maculatum (38%) out of the 210 previously mentioned in the literature, with some new observations. These populations were distributed in the Banat, Bucovina, Crisana, Dobrogea, Moldova, Muntenia, Oltenia, and Transylvania regions. The highest density was recorded in Transylvania and the lowest in Crisana and Dobrogea. In Romania, the total number of individuals from all the studied sites is approximately 6461. Pontechium maculatum was recorded in moderately acidic to weakly alkaline soils, rich in potassium and phosphorus. Precipitation and annual mean temperature in the studied areas are moderate. Comparing these results with data from the literature, we observed a decline in the number of P. maculatum populations in Romania. The limiting factors affecting the species include sheep and cattle overgrazing, intensive agricultural practices, fires and the succession of forest vegetation over grasslands caused by the abandonment of traditional silvopastoral systems. The long-term viability of the species can be secured through sustainable management of the grasslands where the species is present, primarily by regulated grazing. The study underlines the urgent need for targeted conservation measures to protect the species.

AB  - Pharmaceutically active compounds (PhACs) released into the environment have an adverse impact on the soil and water ecosystem as well as human health. Sorption of PhACs by soils and its potential modification through introduced DOM in the applied animal manure or treated wastewater (TWW) determines the mobility and environmental relevance of PhACs. Sulfadiazine, caffeine and atenolol were selected as target PhACs to investigate their sorption behaviors by five selected arable soils in the absence and presence of pig manure DOM. Sulfadiazine was least sorbed, followed by caffeine and atenolol according to the Freundlich sorption isotherm fit (soil average K-f [mu g((1-n)) mL(n) g(-1)] 4.07, 9.06, 18.92, respectively). The addition of manure DOM (31.34 mg C L-1) decreased the sorption of sulfadiazine and especially of caffeine and atenolol (average K-f 3.04, 6.17, 5.79, respectively). Freundlich sorption isotherms of the PhACs became more nonlinear in the presence of manure DOM (Freundlich exponent n changed from 0.74-1.40 to 0.62-1.12), implying more heterogeneous sorption of PhACs in soil-DOM binary systems. Sorption competition of DOM molecules with sulfadiazine and caffeine mostly contributed to their decreased soil sorption when DOM was present. In contrast, the formation of DOM-atenolol associates in the solution phase caused the largely decreased soil sorption of atenolol in the presence of DOM. It is suggested that DOM concentration (e.g., >= 60 mg C L-1) and its interaction with PhACs should be taken into consideration when assessing the environmental impact of land application of animal manure or irrigation with TWW.

AB  - An assembly of dung beetles from sheep droppings in the northern spurs of the Manchurian-Korean Mountains (Primorsky krai) has been studied. Data on the species composition, population dynamics, abundance, and biomass of dung beetles are presented. A comparison of assemblies of dung beetles inhabiting sheep droppings of the northern spurs of the Manchurian-Korean Mountains and the South Sikhote-Alin Mountains shows that, despite the fact that both groups were formed based on one local fauna and have the same number of species, their taxonomic structure and dynamic (seasonal) aspects are quite different. Differences in the species composition and composition of trophodynamic groups are due to specific features of the geographic location, different weather and climatic conditions, grazing regimes, differences in the composition of animals being grazed, as well as historical factors of the formation and dynamics of beetle assemblies. Weather conditions, as a factor influencing the rehydration of sheep droppings, determine dynamic processes in assemblies and limit the penetration of certain species into the Sikhote-Alin Mountain system. The small size of sheep excrements, which are both trophic and topical resources, determines the high transformation rate of the substrate and the distribution of species according to the hypothesis of niche overlap. The overlapping of niches in species from the same trophodynamic groups leads to a shift in the timing of the imaginal activity of certain species.

AB  - Western Eurasian Neogene tapirids are an intriguing but poorly known and poorly documented group of mammals. As the Western Eurasian Tapiridae are mainly represented by scanty and fragmented remains, their systematics have been the subject of debate. Here, we describe exquisite tapirid material from the late Pliocene locality of Camp dels Ninots (CN), North-East Iberia, providing new information on the taxonomy, morphological and morphometric variability, and phylogeny of fossil species. The material studied comprises five crania of different ages, shedding new light on the ontogenetic patterns of fossil European tapirs and their variability. The adult specimens from CN are morphologically similar to other latest Pliocene tapirs from Vialette (France) and Villafranca d'Asti (Italy), and are referred here to the species Tapirus arvernensis. Further, the differences detected among the animals of different ages shed light on the variability of some features and aid in reconsidering the validity of some fossil species. A new cladistic analysis of fossil Tapiridae suggests T. arvernensis is closely related to T. indicus, and is probably an Asian immigrant. Other latest Miocene fossil species, Tapiriscus balkanicus and Ta. pannonicus, are resolved sister taxa and probably represent endemic species of Europe that were replaced by T. arvernensis.

AB  - The decomposition of organic waste by Black Soldier Fly (BSF) plays a potential role in plant growth promotion and soil nutrient enrichment. This study investigated the effect of different compost from food waste, vegetable & fruit waste, cow manure, pig manure, poultry manure, TNPL (Tamil Nadu Newsprint and Papers Limited) bio sludge and combinations of these materials induced varied growth promotion on groundnut. A pot culture experiment evaluated shoot length, root length, germination percentage, plant biomass and vigour index. The best results were observed in the treatment combining hostel food waste and vegetable waste (50 %) with poultry manure (50 %) (T-7), showing a shoot length of 20.34 cm, vigour index of 3629, plant biomass of 24.3 g, and germination percentage of 93.33%. Other treatments, such as food waste (T-1) and vegetable and fruit waste (T-2), showed vigour indices of 2561.6 and 2692.9, respectively, while the untreated control had the lowest vigour index of 900.4. Nutrient analysis of T-7 compost revealed high levels of nitrogen (462 kg/ha), phosphorus (375 kg/ha), potassium (320 kg/ha) and micronutrients like iron (29.04 ppm) and zinc (7.58 ppm). GC-MS analysis identified growth-promoting compounds like Cyclohexanol (64.3 %), Glycerol (3.9 %) and Dibutyl phthalate (1.49 %). Metabolite set enrichment analysis (MSEA) highlighted pathways like fatty acid biosynthesis and glycerolipid metabolism, which support root development and stress tolerance. The results indicated that BSF compost, especially from food and vegetable waste with poultry manure, significantly enhances soil fertility and plant growth, providing a sustainable solution for organic waste management.

AB  - Model systems in biology expand the research capacity of individuals and the community. Closely related to Arabidopsis, the genus Boechera has emerged as an important ecological model owing to the ability to integrate across molecular, functional, and eco-evolutionary approaches. Boechera species are broadly distributed in relatively undisturbed habitats predominantly in western North America and provide one of the few experimental systems for identification of ecologically important genes through genome-wide association studies and investigations of selection with plants in their native habitats. The ecologically, evolutionarily, and agriculturally important trait of apomixis (asexual reproduction via seeds) is common in the genus, and field experiments suggest that abiotic and biotic environments shape the evolution of sex. To date, population genetic studies have focused on the widespread species B. stricta, detailing population divergence and demographic history. Molecular and ecological studies show that balancing selection maintains genetic variation in similar to 10% of the genome, and ecological trade-offs contribute to complex trait variation for herbivore resistance, flowering phenology, and drought tolerance. Microbiome analyses have shown that host genotypes influence leaf and root microbiome composition, and the soil microbiome influences flowering phenology and natural selection. Furthermore, Boechera offers numerous opportunities for investigating biological responses to global change. In B. stricta, climate change has induced a shift of >2 weeks in the timing of first flowering since the 1970s, altered patterns of natural selection, generated maladaptation in previously locally-adapted populations, and disrupted life history trade-offs. Here we review resources and results for this eco-evolutionary model system and discuss future research directions.

AB  - It has long been proposed that during Pleistocene climatic perturbations the Balkan peninsula sustained refugial areas for fauna, flora, and potentially, hominins. In this study, we explore Middle Palaeolithic subsistence at the peninsula's southern end, Greece, and discuss how the evidence contributes to our understanding of the region's character as a refugium. We present new data from the recent reanalysis of the fauna from Asprochaliko rockshelter and the ongoing zooarchaeological investigations at Lakonis Cave 1 and compare them with published analyses from Klissoura Cave 1. We employ taxonomic abundance and diversity indices, as well as mortality profiles, to investigate hominin prey choice. Additional taphonomic observations provide further information on carcass exploitation. We examine changes in the faunal composition of the three sites in an attempt to identify the extent to which climate might have influenced resource availability and diversity in the region, stimulating resource intensification or diversification processes. Our results suggest that Middle Palaeolithic hominins consistently acquired high-ranked prey through time. However, interregional differences in resource exploitation indicate that local topography and microclimate mediated prey choice and availability.

AB  - Everglades of south Florida, USA, is a unique natural wildlife area, which is home to a diverse array of native herpetofaunal species. The Everglades have undergone transformations fueled by ongoing habitat loss and fragmentation, hydrological modification, a deluge of introduced exotic and invasive species, and the implementation of various ecosystem-wide restoration projects. Here, we analyzed trends in the herpetofaunal research over a 20-y period between 2001 and 2021 by conducting a review of the published scientific literature. We conducted a separate review of unpublished abstracts from the Greater Everglades Ecosystem Restoration Conference (GEER) to compare localized research trends and to include research that may not have been published in a peer-reviewed journal. We included 235 papers in our literature review of published articles and 150 poster and paper presentations from the GEER meetings from 2001-2021. We found a significant positive trend in the number of studies on Everglades herpetofauna over this period, driven primarily by an increase in research focused on invasive species. In addition, there are taxonomic biases in the literature, with Crocodilians being significantly over-represented relative to their taxon diversity and Caudates completely absent. Studies on a single invasive species, the Burmese Python (Python bivittatus), account for 22% of all published literature during this period and 30% of all GEER presentations. This review highlights both broad trends and large gaps in the Everglades herpetofaunal research and offers direction for future studies seeking to provide a more complete assessment of Everglades reptiles and amphibians.

AB  - Little is known about potential cascading effects of climate change on the ability of predators to exploit mobile aggregations of prey with a spatiotemporal distribution largely determined by climatic conditions. If predators employ central-place foraging when rearing offspring, the ability of parents to locate sufficient prey could be reduced by climate change. In the Serengeti National Park, Tanzania, migratory species dominate mammalian herbivore biomass. These migratory herds exploit nutrient-rich vegetation on the southern plains in the rainy season and surface water in the northwest in the dry season. Female spotted hyenas Crocuta crocuta breed throughout the year and use long-distance central-place-foraging "commuting trips" to migratory herds to fuel lactation for >= 12 months. Changes in rainfall patterns that alter prey movements may decrease the ability of mothers to locate profitable foraging areas and thus increase their overall commuting effort, particularly for high-ranking females that have priority of access to food resources within their clan territory and thus less commuting experience. In hyena clan territories, this may be reflected by a decrease in migratory herd presence and a decrease in the presence of lactating females, as maternal den presence represents the opposite of commuting effort. We investigated the strength of the relationship between rainfall volume, migratory herd presence in three hyena clan territories, and the responses of lactating females to this climate/prey relationship in terms of maternal den presence, using an observation-based dataset spanning three decades. The probability of migratory herd presence in hyena clan territories increased with the amount of rainfall 2 months earlier, and maternal den presence increased with migratory herd presence. Rainfall volume substantially increased over 30 years, whereas the presence of migratory herds in hyena clans and the strength of the relationship between rainfall and migratory herd presence decreased. Hyenas thus adjusted well to the climate change-induced decreased the presence of migratory herds in their territories, since maternal den presence did not decrease over 30 years and still matched periods of high prey abundance, irrespective of female social status. These results suggest a high plasticity in the response of this keystone predator to environmental variability.

AB  - Sea urchins are important herbivores that can graze macroalgae, creating 'barren' areas. These barrens are believed to offer little food for urchins due to the absence of attached macroalgae, leading to malnourishment as indicated by a low urchin gonad index. To investigate the diet and resultant gonad index of the long-spined sea urchin Centrostephanus rodgersii in New South Wales, Australia, we dissected 100 C. rodgersii individuals collected in macroalgae and barrens habitats along >470 km of SE NSW coastline. Diverse items were present in the digestive tracts of urchins from all habitats. These items included brown (42% barrens, 46% macroalgae), green (28% barrens, 42% macroalgae) and red algae (15% barrens, 12% macroalgae) and corallines (29% barrens, 37% macroalgae), molluscs (28% barrens, 29% macroalgae) and crustaceans (26% barrens, 22% macroalgae). There was no difference in urchin gut fullness between habitats (85% barrens, 90% macroalgae). Importantly, the gonad index only differed in macroalgae compared to barrens habitats at one location, with no differences detected at the other 4 locations. These results suggest that C. rodgersii has a diverse diet that is similar in both habitats, which could explain the similarities in gut fullness and gonad index. Our results suggest that C. rodgersii eat a broad diet including invertebrates and drift algae, and hence may not be malnourished in barrens. The finding of comparable gonad index between barrens and macroalgal areas further supports this conclusion. These findings challenge the prevailing perspective, indicating that sea urchins have sufficient food to survive and reproduce in different habitats.

AB  - Analysis of spatiotemporal partitioning is pivotal to shed light on interspecific coexistence. Most research efforts have involved large-sized carnivores and their prey species, whereas little attention has been given to ungulate in the predator-free ecosystems. We assessed seasonal activity patterns and spatiotemporal overlap among the Siberian roe deer (Capreolus pygargus tianschanicus) and its sympatric species through camera-trapping from October 2017 and September 2020 in Jeju Island, South Korea. Trap events when compared seasonally, roe deer show higher activity in summer (34.9%), a pronounced low in winter (14.1%), and a moderate in autumn (23.8%) and in spring (26.9%). Roe deer exhibited bimodal activity patterns and had the highest spatiotemporal overlap and composite score with sika deer (Cervus nippon). Our results are among the few available data on the interaction of sympatric species and suggest strong overlapping with sika deer. This study provides important insight into species coexistence in predator-free habitats, which would be important for management initiatives.

AB  - Introduced herbivores often alter predator-prey dynamics between native organisms. We investigated whether the exotic mite Raoiella indica can interfere in the predation relationships between the predator Amblyseius largoensis and the native herbivorous mite Oligonychus pratensis and be favored as a result. Populations of A. largoensis were established in laboratory, one reared with exotic prey and another with native prey. For each population, of A. largoensis were evaluated for: egg-to-adult developmental time, oviposition rate, and feed conversion efficiency (FCE) of females. Also, to observe the interaction with prey, behavioral tests were conducted, evaluating the time to the first attack, oviposition site preference, and prey preference consumption. Regardless of prey offered, there was no prey effect on immature developmental time or female oviposition rate. However, A. largoensis showed superior FCE feed on exotic (11.4%) over native prey (3.9%). Both A. largoensis populations preferred to prey on eggs of native species and also tended to choose oviposition sites containing native prey eggs. Those reared on exotic prey attacked their first prey in less time than those reared on native prey. Therefore, the presence of R. indica affects both predator population growth and the feeding preference for native prey, which causes a risk of displacement of O. pratensis.

AB  - Biological monitoring in protected areas is essential for making management decisions, especially in small (<1000 km(2)), fenced reserves which require intensive intervention to maintain core habitat characteristics. Estimates of species richness and community structure provide important information for planning and evaluating conservation strategies. Majete Wildlife Reserve (MWR) is a small (691 km(2)), isolated reserve in southern Malawi in the Miombo Woodland Ecoregion. We investigated species richness and community structure of the terrestrial medium and large mammals at MWR through a standardised camera trap survey. During the 2018 dry season, 140 camera locations were sampled for 40 days each. Thirty-five mammal species were detected and Chao 2, ICE and Jackknife 1 and 2 richness estimators indicated between 36-41 species present which aligns closely with historic accounts. Non-detection of some species is attributed to species specialised habitat requirements not catered for in the systematic camera trap survey design. Mammal community structure, calculated from the camera detected species' relative abundance indices (RAI), was atypical for Miombo woodland, with an underrepresentation of elephants. Camera trap-derived RAI was positively related with 2018 aerial census species encounter data. These results can assist management in refining survey techniques and act as a baseline to monitor conservation efforts.

AB  - In temperate shallow lakes, submerged macrophytes facilitate zooplankton development by providing refuge against fish predation and, thereby, indirectly contribute to maintaining a clear-water state through enhanced zooplankton grazing. The role of macrophytes for zooplankton and their grazing potential is less clear for tropical lakes. We investigated crustacean zooplankton in a phytoplankton-dominated basin (algal basin) and two restored basins dominated by macrophytes (macrophyte basins) in the shallow Huizhou West Lake in tropical southern China. We found that copepods prevailed in all basins, but the dominant taxon differed, with omnivorous cyclopoids dominating in the algal basin and herbivorous calanoids in the macrophyte basins. Moreover, the biomass ratios of calanoid:copepod and zooplankton:phytoplankton were higher in the macrophyte basins than in the algal basin. Our results suggest that restoration measures involving macrophyte transplantation and fish removal lead to reduced fish predation on zooplankton, which help to maintain the clear-water state when macrophytes are established due to higher control on phytoplankton. However, unlike in temperate lakes, large-bodied Daphnia were generally absent and the zooplankton:phytoplankton ratio was overall low, indicating a weaker top-down control in tropical lakes, which is likely due to higher fish predation.

AB  - Many plant species can exhibit remarkable variation in leaf characteristics, depending on their abiotic and biotic environment. Environmental changes therefore have the potential to alter leaf traits, which in turn scale up to influence ecosystem processes including net primary productivity, susceptibility to fire, and palatability to herbivores. It is not well understood how consistent trait-environment relationships are among species, across sites and over time. This presents a fundamental challenge for functional ecology, because no study can measure all relevant species in all places at all times. Thus, understanding the limits of transferability is critical. We collected leaf trait measurements on 13 species of grass (family: Poaceae) across 11 sites and five years (n = 3091 individuals). Sites were arrayed along a spatial precipitation gradient in coastal northern California (annual precipitation of 590-1350 mm) with substantial interannual precipitation variability (from 60% below the 30-year average to 100% above average). Temporal and spatial linear relationships between precipitation and specific leaf area (SLA) appear at first idiosyncratic, with each species sometimes displaying positive and sometimes negative responses. However, this variation arises from sampling different portions of an underlying hump-shaped relationship, which was shared across most species. This hump-shaped relationship was driven primarily by changes in leaf tissue density. These results suggest the potential for transferability among species, as well as between space and time, as long as the gradients are sufficiently long to capture the nonlinear response. Future work could explore the physiological basis of the nonlinear SLA response, including the possibility that distinct physiological mechanisms are operating at the two extremes of the gradient.

AB  - Wild rusa deer (Cervus timorensis) are increasing in numbers and distribution in peri-urban eastern Australia. To effectively manage rusa deer, land managers need to know the extent of their movements to determine the appropriate scale of control through trapping and shooting. We found that in a subtropical peri-urban environment in South East Queensland, four rusa deer (three male, one female) with GPS collars annually ranged over areas of <400 ha with core areas of similar to 100 ha over a period of 10-17 months. Our limited data indicated their relatively small home ranges varied little in size and location from season-to-season, suggesting that these deer can be effectively managed at the local level.

AB  - The development of transportation infrastructure disrupts wildlife movement, leading to habitat fragmentation and roadkill. While the establishment of wildlife corridors is a global strategy to mitigate these impacts, research on the intersections between wildlife corridors and transportation networks in China, along with the verification of corridor sites, is limited. This study focuses on the Three-River-Source (TRS) region and Tibetan antelope (Pantholops hodgsonii), and proposes a wildlife corridor selection method consisting of the following four steps: evaluating habitat suitability, identifying wildlife corridors, determining conflict sites, and conducting onsite verification. By evaluating the habitat suitability of the Tibetan antelope and identifying wildlife corridors using circuit theory and the minimum cumulative resistance model, roadcorridor intersection areas and conflict sites are identified. Based on the findings, 14 corridor sites for Tibetan antelope are recommended, and the feasibility of Corridor 6 is successfully verified. The proposed method offers a valuable reference for selecting wildlife corridor sites in similar regions.

AB  - Simple SummaryThe biodiversity protection represents a challenge of the agenda ONU 2030 for Sustainable Development Goals (SDG). Autochthonous sheep breeds, including Altamurana, Bagnolese, Gentile di Puglia, Laticauda and Leccese, reared in continental Southern Italy, are strongly affected by extinction risk; thus, it is urgent to find new solutions to valorise their products and obtain sustainable and smart food from local farms. The objective of the present study was to assess the lamb carcass commercial quality, chemical and fatty acid composition of Altamurana, Bagnolese, Gentile di Puglia, Laticauda and Leccese autochtonous sheep breeds. Data on EU Mediterranean classification showed that the carcasses from both Bagnolese and Laticauda breeds were classified in the heaviest category C. Moreover, breed can influence the meat fatty acids profile, which is resulted rich in conjugated linoleic acid with good nutritional properties; thus, lambs' meat from autochthonous sheep breeds can be considered interesting for human consumption. The present study can help to protect the biodiversity of livestock heritage of Southern Italy and open a new field for the valorisation and promotion of their derived products.In the present study, the evaluation of the carcasses and meat quality, in terms of chemical composition and fatty acid profile, of lambs from five autochthonous sheep breeds (Altamurana, Bagnolese, Gentile di Puglia, Laticauda, and Leccese) reared in continental Southern Italy, were studied. All the carcasses were evaluated according to the EU Mediterranean classification system for carcasses weighing less than 13 kg. Meat chemical composition and fatty acids profile were assessed on both loin and leg commercial cuts. Fatty acid composition of loin resulted in differences among breeds, displaying lower values of saturated fatty acid in Altamurana, Bagnolese, and Leccese breeds and the highest content of polyunsaturated fatty acid in the Altamurana breed. Principal component analysis grouped lamb according to fatty acid content and to conjugated linoleic acid (CLA), omega n-3 and n-6 fatty acids; thus, Altamurana, Bagnolese, and Leccese breeds are characterized by the highest values of CLA content. Our data demonstrated that lamb meat from autochthonous breed has good carcass quality and the content of CLA, n-3, and n-6 was valuable for human consumption; therefore, the valorisation of local meat quality can help to avoid the extinction of the autochthonous breed offering to the market and consumer's high nutritive products.

AB  - Flowering plants are essentially sessile organisms that disperse their genes through pollination, expanding their areas of occurrence through seed dispersal. In orchids, seed dispersal is commonly mediated by air currents. Conversely, members of several genera have evolved seeds adapted to endozoochory. This is the case for Vanilla, the most economically important genus in the orchid family. The role of indehiscent fruits in the attraction and rewarding of Vanilla seed dispersers was investigated based on field observations, analysis of fragrances, reward substances, and investigation of seed viability through the digestive tract. Indehiscent Vanilla fruits are consumed exclusively by herbivores, i.e. agoutis. Besides providing nutritional rewards, the fruits are rich in polyphenols that are unpalatable to omnivores. The most dominant compound in fruits is attractive only to agoutis. This is the first study showing synzoochory in Orchidaceae and specificity of seed dispersal in orchids. Indehiscent fruits may have evolved early in Neotropical Vanilla in response to selection pressures mediated by large herbivores as the genus emerged ca. 34 Mya in South America, concomitantly with megafauna diversification in the Oligocene. Extinction of the megafauna during the Pleistocene has left agoutis as inheritors of seed dispersal in species with large fleshy fruits. Apart from the effects on omnivores, this study shows that indehiscent fruits of V. chamissonis are consumed exclusively by agoutis, providing the first evidence of target mutualism in orchid seed dispersal.

AB  - For 10,000 years humans have altered plant traits through domestication and ongoing crop improvement, shaping plant form and function in agroecosystems. To date, studies have focused on how these processes shape whole-plant or average traits; however, plants also have characteristic levels of trait variability among their repeated parts, which can be heritable and mediate critical ecological interactions. Here, we examine an underappreciated scale of trait variation-among leaves, within plants-that may have changed through the process of domestication and improvement. Variability at this scale may itself be a target of selection, or be shaped as a by-product of the domestication process. We explore how levels of among-leaf trait variability differ between cultivars and wild relatives of alfalfa (Medicago sativa), a key forage crop with a 7,000-year domestication history. We grew individual plants from 30 wild populations and 30 cultivars, and quantified variability in a broad suite of physical, nutritive, and chemical leaf traits, including measures of chemical dissimilarity (beta diversity) among leaves within each plant. We find that trait variability has changed over the course of domestication, with effects often larger than changes in trait means. Domestic alfalfa had elevated among-leaf variability in SLA, trichomes, and C:N; increased diversity in defensive compounds; and reduced variability in phytochemical composition. We also elucidate fundamental relationships between trait means and variability, and between overall production of secondary metabolites and patterns of chemical diversity. We conclude that within-plant variability is an overlooked dimension of trait diversity in a globally critical agricultural crop. Trait variability is actually higher in cultivated plants compared to wild progenitors for multiple nutritive, physical, and chemical traits, highlighting a scale of variation that may mitigate loss of trait diversity at other scales in alfalfa agroecosystems, and in other crops with similar histories of domestication and improvement.

AB  - Biochar application has been recognised as an effective way to improve soil functions. In this study, we investigated how adding biochar as an amendment affects soil biological and physico-chemical properties in grazed pastures in a one-year field-based mesocosm experiment conducted on two contrasting soils - a sil-andic Andosol and a dystric Cambisol. Each site had two pastures managed under different nutrient and livestock practices: with and without effluent under dairy cow grazing on the Andosol, and with either nil or high phosphorus (P) fertiliser input under sheep grazing on the Cambisol. The soil amendment treatments were: (i) willow biochar produced at 3508 degrees C (1% w/w); (ii) lime, added at the liming equivalence of the biochar application (positive control); (iii) no amendments (negative control). With few exceptions, after 12 months and compared with initial values and controls, biochar caused (i) an increase in soil total nitrogen (N) and Olsen P content (all P < 0.005) beyond those expected from the N and P added with biochar; (ii) decrease in soil bulk density (P < 0.005), on average by 7%, more than can be explained by the reduced density of the biochar added; (iii) increase in microbial biomass C (P < 0.005), and (iv) increase in root biomass by 6.9 Mg ha(-1) (P < 0.005). Lime addition increased pH values in both soils under all four management practices, and increased earthworm abundance compared with controls across all sites. In biochar-amended soils, earthworm abundance was higher only in the Andosol without effluent (P < 0.05), while Collembola abundance was significantly higher (P < 0.005) than the controls in all pastures; there was no effect on soil Oribatida and Gamasina populations. Adding biochar made from willow wood produced at low temperature to these pasture soils can positively affect the soil structure, nutrient cycling, and stimulate root growth, a key contributor to organic C input to the soil and the soil food web.

AB  - Human-carnivore conflicts have been a most important driver of carnivore population declines globally. We investigated patterns, costs, and drivers of human-leopard conflicts in Banna Valley, Pakistan during 2017-2018. Since topographic and environmental factors can influence the frequency of livestock depredations by leopards, we used leopard depredations to investigate if changes in topographic and environmental factors influenced depredations. We collected data from 150 respondents in 20 villages who lost 300 domestic animals to leopards. Leopards mainly killed goats (86 %), followed by dogs (8 %), and guarding strategies used did not reduce depredations. Depredations typically occurred in July-August (55 %) during 1300-1800 h (61 %) and 2200-0000 h (31 %), with 53 % of reported depredations outside of villages. More depredations occurred during summer (76.67 %, n = 115) than in autumn (12 %, n = 18), winter (10 %, n = 15), or spring (n = 2, 1 %). The overall estimated economic loss from livestock depredations during 2017-2018 was 87,818 USD, with an average annual loss per respondent of 292.7 USD (24.39 USD/month/respondent). Livestock depredations by leopard resulted in economic losses ranging from 8 % to 24 % of the average annual income of respondents. Most respondents had negative perceptions of leopards and did not support their conservation (90.6 %, n = 136). Respondents most frequently recommended lethal control (36 %) to mitigate human-carnivore conflicts. Our results showed that with increase in mean diurnal temperature range (Bio2), minimum temperature of the coldest month (Bio6), precipitation f the driest month (Bio14), distance to forest, distance to settlements, distance to protected areas and NDVI livestock depredation by leopard decreased. On contrary, with the increase in density of human settlements the livestock depredation by leopard increased in the study area. Encouraging continued use of corrals, increased guarding of livestock, particularly in the afternoon and during summer, altering the types of livestock kept (e.g., cattle) that experiences reduced risk of depredation by leopard, and restoring native prey species could reduce the frequency of livestock depredations and facilitate human-leopard coexistence.

AB  - To promote circularity in agriculture, the residual -streams from the production of insects as feed and food, such as insect exuviae (moulted skins), can be a sustainable novel organic soil amendment for crop production. Organic soil amendments can influence soil composition by providing nutrients and stimulating the growth of beneficial microorganisms. Soil composition significantly impacts plant growth and resistance against herbi-vores. However, little is known about the effect of soil composition on flower visitors and seed production. Here, black soldier fly (BSF; Hermetia illucens) exuviae was added to soil to investigate the effects on plant growth, plant resistance against two insect herbivores, and the consequences for attraction of pollinators and seed yield. Brassica nigra seeds were sown in field soil or in field soil mixed with powdered BSF exuviae. Three-week-old plants and the soil of each pot were planted in a common garden. The effects on vegetative and flower traits, interactions with flower visitors and seed yield were quantified. In addition, the performance of the leaf-chewing larvae of Pieris brassicae and the piercing-sucking aphid Brevicoryne brassicae were assessed. Brassica nigra plants grown on soil amended with BSF exuviae showed increased growth, had more flowers and flower visitors, and higher seed production. Herbivory neither affected number of flowers nor seed production, suggesting tolerance and compensatory growth responses to herbivory compared to plants growing in soil without the addition of BSF exuviae. After five weeks fewer aphids were found on plants growing in amended soil. Our findings show that BSF exuviae added to soil can positively affect tolerance to herbivory and seed production of B. nigra, an insect -pollinated plant species. Moreover, adding insect exuviae as soil amendment in the field benefits plant-pollinator mutualism and seed yield even during herbivore attack in the field. Use of by-products from insect production as soil amendment can contribute to sustainable agricultural practices along with the conservation of ecosystem services.

AB  - Human-elephant conflict is increasing across many parts of Asia and Africa. Mitigating elephant crop raiding has become a major focus of conservation intervention, however, many existing methods for tackling this problem are expensive and difficult to execute. Thus, there is a need for more affordable, farm-based methods. Testing these methods is key to ensuring their effectiveness and feasibility. In this study, we tested a novel olfactory deterrent, the "smelly elephant repellent", a foul-smelling organic liquid, on 40 farms in Uganda and Kenya. Our results show that the repellent was effective at deterring elephants from crop raiding. Over the study period, 82% of 309 elephant crop raids were deterred in Uganda. In Kenya, the repellent deterred 63% of 24 crop raiding incidents, and there was a significant effect of the repellent on test sites compared with control sites. The smelly repellent could be a helpful crop raiding mitigation tool for farmers, as this study showed it to be effective, relatively cheap, quick to produce from locally available ingredients, and communities have a positive attitude towards using it. Ongoing work is exploring the potential for a market-based approach to take this to scale in a financially sustainable way.

AB  - One of the major impacts of climate change is increasing global temperatures. Because warming is expected to affect plant morphological and chemical traits, it may therefore also influence plant interactions with other trophic levels, including herbivores. Here, we simulated a climate warming scenario of +2.7 degrees C in the field using open-top chambers and assessed the effects of warming on plant performance (growth, leaf area, and chlorophyll), leaf nutrients (nitrogen and carbon), and primary (amino acids and carbohydrates) and secondary (toxic aristolochic acids) metabolites in the plant Aristolochia chilensis. We performed untargeted metabolomics analyses for estimating general changes in foliar metabolites between ambient control and warming-treated plants. Bioassays were additionally conducted to evaluate how changes in host plant chemistry affected growth and nutritional parameters in first-instar larvae of the specialist lepidopteran herbivore Battus polydamas archidamas. We found that warming did not significantly affect plant performance, but did result in significant changes in leaf nutrients, and primary and secondary metabolites, although in opposite directions. While primary metabolites (specifically, nitrogen-containing compounds) decreased in response to treatment, aristolochic acids increased. Untargeted metabolomics analyses showed that, of a total of 824 features, 50 were significantly different between ambient control and warming-treated plants; some of these were identified by MS/MS spectra as amino acids. Larvae feeding on warming-treated plants, showed significantly enhanced growth, food conversion efficiency, and lipid concentration. Our study contributes to current understanding of climate change impacts on trophic interactions, showing that projected temperature increases lead to changes in the resistance phenotype of the host plant, favoring nutrition and growth of a unique specialist herbivore.

AB  - Native herbivory may be detrimental to plant fitness and thus can contribute a biotic resistance to exotic plant invasion. Eupatorium adenophorum, a non-native species, has formed dense monocultures in many southern Provinces of China. Because several native generalist insects feed on E. adenophorum, we evaluated whether the lower level of induced defences and greater compensatory growth contributed to successful invasion of E. adenophorum by comparison with a native congener E. heterophyllum. Early events in the jasmonic acid cascade and chlorophyll fluorescence, non-target metabolomic profiles and recovery in biomass compensation of E. adenophorum and its native congener E. heterophyllum were measured during mechanical wounding and herbivory by the generalist insect Helicoverpa armigera. Mechanical and simulated chewing damage immediately initiated defences in the two species. However, E. heterophyllum was more sensitive to tissue loss, and it produced more metabolic defensive compounds than invasive E. adenophorum. Although H. armigera feeding amplified the effects of mechanical wounding on defence induction, the biomass of E. adenophorum was only weakly affected, as its higher compensatory growth could offset the biomass loss and metabolic cost. Overall, our results suggest that H. armigera herbivory and mechanical wounding could induce different physiological responses, and are often specific to invasive E. adenophorum and native E. heterophyllum. Moreover, lower metabolic defences and higher compensation growth may contribute to the invasion success of E. adenophorum.

AB  - Chalakudy River is renowned for its pristine waters and rich ichthyofaunal biodiversity. The downstream area of the river is confronting a series of risks, including pollution, saline water ingression, sand mining, illegal and intensified fishing practices, and invasion of exotic and alien species. A mass balanced ecosystem model was constructed for the downstream region of Chalakudy River (DCR) using Ecopath with Ecosim (EWE), incorporating 12 functional groups to delineate the food web and network flow indices for the period 2020 to 2021. The trophic level (TL) of the ecosystem network ranged from TL-1 (detritus) to TL-3.4 (birds). High fishing pressure is one possible cause for the high ecotrophic efficiency values as evidenced by the fish groups. Both the grazing food chain and detritus food chain (detritivory: herbivory ratio 0.94) contributed more or less equal to the energy transfer between TL. Network analysis of the model indicated a mean transfer efficiency of 12%, with shares from primary producers (14%) and detritus (11%). A mixed trophic impact analysis demonstrated a strong positive impact of primary producers and detritus groups on most of the other ecological groups at higher trophic levels. The DCR model showed a high system throughput (32,464.7 t km(-2) year(-1)), low system omnivory (0.09), low connectance index (0.36), low Finn's cycling index (4.9), and mean path length (2.8), low relative ascendency (37.5%), and high system overhead (62.5%). These indices propound that DCR is an immature and developing ecosystem with moderate strength in reserve to resist external perturbations.

AB  - Introduction: Intercropping systems can be more productive than their respective monocultures and this positive net biodiversity effect is caused by complementarity and selection effects. While the complementarity effect is caused through resource partitioning or facilitation, the selection effect operates via the greater probability that a more diverse community contains a dominant and high-yielding species which will account for the majority of productivity in that community. Here, we investigated how light-use-related traits contribute to the net biodiversity effect via complementarity or selection effects and how these qrelationships change throughout an annual growing season.
   Materials and Methods: We conducted weekly destructive harvests to examine temporal dynamics of biodiversity effects in two crop mixtures (oat-lupin and oat-camelina) and their respective monocultures. We linked the biodiversity effects to traits related to light use (i.e., light interception, plant height, photosynthetic efficiency and photosynthetic capacity) and investigated how these relationships changed over time.
   Results: We found that the net biodiversity and selection effect increased over time in both mixtures, while complementarity effects increased only in the oat-lupin mixture. More intercepted light and taller plants in mixtures compared to monocultures positively contributed to biodiversity effects in both mixtures. Strategies for shade tolerance differed between the mixtures, that is, increased photosynthetic capacity and increased photosynthetic efficiency contributed to a positive net biodiversity effect in the oat-lupin and oat-camelina mixture, respectively.
   Conclusion: By linking the temporal dynamics of the net biodiversity effect and its two additive components to light-use-related traits in two different crop mixtures, this study demonstrates that complementary light use contributes to overyielding in intercropping systems. Such understanding is important for the design of effective intercropping systems and developing new crop cultivars suited to these environments.

AB  - The MHC is one of the most polymorphic gene clusters in vertebrates and play an essential role in adaptive immunity. Apart from pathogen-mediated selection, sexual selection can also contribute to the maintenance of MHC diversity. MHC-dependent sexual selection could occur via several mechanisms but at present there is no consensus as to which of these mechanisms are involved and their importance. Previous studies have often suffered from limited genetic and behavioural data and small sample size, and were rarely able to examine all the mechanisms together, determine whether signatures of MHC-based non-random mating are independent of genomic effects or differentiate whether MHC-dependent sexual selection takes place at the pre- or post-copulatory stage. In this study, we use Monte Carlo simulation to investigate evidence for non-random MHC-dependent mating patterns by all three mechanisms in a free-living population of Soay sheep. Using 1710 sheep diplotyped at the MHC class IIa region and genome-wide SNPs, together with field observations of consorts, we found sexual selection against a particular haplotype in males at the pre-copulatory stage and sexual selection against female MHC heterozygosity during the rut. We also found MHC-dependent disassortative mating at the post-copulatory stage, along with strong evidence of inbreeding avoidance at both stages. However, results from generalized linear mixed models suggest that the pattern of MHC-dependent disassortative mating could be a by-product of inbreeding avoidance. Our results therefore suggest that while multiple apparent mechanisms of non-random mating with respect to the MHC may occur, some of them have alternative explanations.

AB  - The carbon footprint of goat farms associated with the management type and the income sacrifice to switch to green goat farms are still not precise in the literature. Therefore, the objectives of this study were 1) to assess the environmental impacts of goat farming associated with management typology in Turkiye and 2) to explore the link between farm-level income sacrifice and the amount of greenhouse gas (GHG) reduction. Goat farm-level data were collected from randomly selected 284 goat farms through a questionnaire. Environmental impacts of goat farming associated with the management typology were examined using the life cycle assessment (LCA). The GHG emissions were calculated both for the whole goat farm associated with the management type and for individual goat products such as milk, meat, mohair, and replacement. The research results showed that Turkish goat farms emitted GHG emissions for the production of per kg of meat, milk, and mohair by 9.85 kg CO2-eq, 8 kg CO2-eq, and 0.28 kg CO2-eq, respectively. Goat farms in management type 1 emitted the highest GHG emission in a year, while that of goat farms in type 5 was the lowest. The research results also showed that the environmental impact and farm-level income sacrifice per kg GHG emission reduction to reach the level of environmentally friendly goat farms varied according to the management type of goat farms. Typical Turkish goat farms gained agricultural income by 2.47 USD per kg of GHG emission. The amount of agricultural income gained per kg GHG emission varied according to typology. Based on the research results, typical Turkish goat farms faced with an income sacrifice of 2.85 USD per kg GHG emission reduction to reach the level of environmentally friendly goat farms having minimum GHG emission in a year. Turkish goat farms emitted 0.49 kg CO2-eq per USD of agricultural production expenses. The study suggests switching from a conventional management type to environmentally friendly management type goat farms. Facilitating the accessibility of financial resources may enhance the switching process through benefiting investments in infrastructure, equipment, and research and development. Creating resource-efficient and environmentally friendly goat farms by subsidizing the goat farms may decrease GHG emissions.

AB  - Goat farming is an important production sector not only for Greece, but also for other Mediterranean countries, as it contributes to the family economy in rural areas. Despite the importance of goat farming, this sector has experienced economic difficulties due to poor management and increased production costs. The aim of our research is to determine goat farm profitability by surveying goat farmers for revenues, variable costs, and fixed costs of their farms. With the use of Principal Component Analysis, all economic factors contributing to overall production costs are examined, as well as their specific impacts on cost formulation. According to our results, goat farms in Greece are not profitable and they cannot survive without government subsidies. Farm economics and agricultural policies could be leveraged to improve community and environmental outcomes in order for farms to be economically and financially sustainable.

AB  - The balance between proliferation, differentiation and apoptosis is well-coordinated in spermatogenesis for the timely production of appropriate numbers of sperm in animals. Disruption or decrease in sperm production is due to many conditions, including changes in testicular cell fate balance. Interspecies hybridization of domestic yaks and cattle results in sterility in males because of spermatogenic arrest; however, the underlying mechanisms involved in sterility are still unclear. In the present study, we investigated the proliferation and apoptosis status during the development of yaks and crossbred cattle-yaks using immunohistochemistry of proliferating cell nuclear antigen and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick end labelling assays. Testicular tissues from yaks (immature: 1 year old, mature: 2-3 years old) and backcrossed hybrids (2 year old) were collected and used to investigate the expression of each parameter in testicular cells. During the maturation of yak testes, proliferation and apoptosis became active only in spermatogenic cells, and not in other somatic cells, such as Sertoli cells, myoid cells and Leydig cells. Furthermore, hybrid cattle-yak testes maintained proliferation ability but less apoptotic ability in spermatogenic cells when compared to yaks of the same age, suggesting that normal spermatogenic cell fate control is disrupted by changes in the balance between proliferation and apoptosis. In addition, Leydig cell proliferation rate was higher than apoptosis rate in the cattle-yak testes, indicating an increased number of Leydig cells, which may affect spermatogenesis through changes in steroidogenesis. Although epigenetic changes may be involved in cattle-yak testes, further studies are needed to clarify the modulation of proliferation and apoptosis to elucidate the mechanisms of infertility in hybrid cattle-yak males.

AB  - Understanding selection's impact on the genome is a major theme in biology. Functionally neutral genetic regions can be affected indirectly by natural selection, via their statistical association with genes under direct selection. The genomic extent of such indirect selection, particularly across loci not physically linked to those under direct selection, remains poorly understood, as does the time scale at which indirect selection occurs. Here, we use field experiments and genomic data in stick insects, deer mice and stickleback fish to show that widespread statistical associations with genes known to affect fitness cause many genetic loci across the genome to be impacted indirectly by selection. This includes regions physically distant from those directly under selection. Then, focusing on the stick insect system, we show that statistical associations between SNPs and other unknown, causal variants result in additional indirect selection in general and specifically within genomic regions of physically linked loci. This widespread indirect selection necessarily makes aspects of evolution more predictable. Thus, natural selection combines with chance genetic associations to affect genome-wide evolution across linked and unlinked loci and even in modest-sized populations. This process has implications for the application of evolutionary principles in basic and applied science.

AB  - Emotional responses to wildlife can guide human responses to wildlife conflicts. At the same time, responses to wildlife often relate to cultural contexts. In this study, emotions associated with wolves and wild boars were examined in two samples taken from Turkish (N = 637) and German (N = 415) university students. As expected, different patterns of emotional responses emerged in the two samples. For example, while negative emotions such as disgust and anger toward the wild boar were prevalent in the Turkish sample, positive emotions such as joy, surprise, and interest occurred in the German sample. Significant differences between the emotions associated with wolves and wild boars were revealed in both samples. In the Turkish sample, wolves caused stronger fear, joy, and interest, whereas wild boars caused stronger anger and disgust. In the German sample, wolves caused stronger joy, surprise, interest, and sadness, whereas wild boars caused stronger disgust. Fear, however, was expressed toward both wolves and wild boars in both samples. The predictive power of emotions on students' intentions to protect wild boars and wolves was examined as well as intentions to protect human interests against these animals. Disgust was the strongest (negative) predictor of a protection intention toward the wild boar in the Turkish sample. In the German sample, joy and interest were the emotions that best predicted conservation intentions (positive) for both animals.

AB  - Prey species can perceive and respond to spatiotemporal variation in predation risk to increase survival. In addition to adjusting spatial and temporal activity patterns to avoid predation, prey employ other antipredator behaviors, such as vigilance and fleeing, and these behaviors can be further modulated by intrinsic, environmental, and anthropogenic factors. However, few studies simultaneously examine multiple potential antipredator behavioral responses of prey or examine prey responses to multiple scales of risk. In the southeastern United States, coyotes (Canis latrans) have become established as the top predator of white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) populations mainly through fawn predation, and deer adjust behaviors in response to coyotes. Using passive camera trap data from summer 2019 to 2021, we simultaneously tested for evidence that deer adjust spatial activity patterns, diel activity patterns, and vigilance behavior in response to various abiotic and biotic factors including long-term and short-term coyote encounter risk. Overall, our results suggest that deer are unable to eliminate the risk of encountering coyotes by modifying their spatial activity and thus employ other demographic-specific behavioral adaptations to reduce coyote encounter risk. Deer nursery groups were significantly more diurnal than adult males or adult female deer traveling alone, likely in an attempt to reduce predation risk for fawns. Deer nursery groups increased spatial activity but decreased vigilance at sites the day following increased wild pig (Sus scrofa) activity, suggesting invasive competitors have impacts on maternal behaviors in deer. Adult female deer collectively increased vigilance at sites with greater long-term coyote encounter risk, and in support of the "many-eyes" hypothesis, were less vigilant when in larger groups. Spatial activity of adult female deer traveling alone was positively related to short-term coyote encounter risk, potentially indicating coyotes seek areas with increased doe activity to help locate fawn prey. The results of our study show that behavioral responses to predators and competitors are modulated by individual state (demography), grouping behavior, and habitat features. Our study highlights the need to analyze multiple potential antipredator behaviors and multiple scales of risk to gain a more complete understanding of prey responses to risk.

AB  - Previous human dimensions articles related to changes in perceptions about chronic wasting disease (CWD) have focused on psychological variables (e.g., risk, trust). We expanded the scope of comparison and included 27 CWD management-action variables. We obtained data from 2 mail surveys of resident deer hunters randomly sampled from the Illinois Department of Natural Resources' (IDNR) permit holders, administered first in 2012 (n = 5,663, response rate = 55%) and again in 2022 (n = 1,237, response rate = 43%). Hunters in 2022 were less aware of IDNR's management actions (e.g., increase the number of deer permits) than the 2012 hunters. Alternatively, the 2022 hunters were more supportive of actions the IDNR should pursue (e.g., use deer sharpshooting) than the 2012 hunters. Hunters in 2012 were more supportive of testing for CWD than the 2022 sample, although the differences were small. Conversely, the 2022 hunters were always more likely to believe that each IDNR action (e.g., use deer sharpshooting) was more effective than those during 2012. Statistical differences can be partially attributed to the large sample size as the average Cohen's d across all 27 items was only 0.159 (i.e., small). Overall, findings demonstrate the importance of tracking changes in beliefs over time, as such changes can influence an agency's management actions.

AB  - Illegal wildlife trade is considered one of the most serious threats to biodiversity worldwide, along with habitat loss/degradation and overfishing of wild stocks. Seahorses are considered at high risk as these fish represent an important component of traditional Chinese medicine but are also sold as curios and ornamental fish. On a worldwide level, illegal trade is controlled by numerous laws and regulations, but it seems to continue by assuming more dynamic routes. In the Mediterranean Sea, Hippocampus guttulatus formed one of the largest populations at Mar Piccolo di Taranto in South-Eastern Italy. During the routine monitoring of this population in 2016, a dramatic density decrease was observed. By using questionnaires and long-term datasets, the present study determined possible causes of this decline by investigating habitat changes, temperature trends and the existence of seahorse trafficking while also examining abundance trends during the last decade. The results indicated a sharp density decline starting from 2015, co-occurring with the period of high temperatures, while habitats remained almost constant. However, interviews with main stakeholders described both illegal and legal fishing activities as the main drivers for the declining seahorse density. Indeed, at one of the studied sites, which was under strict military control, seahorse abundance started to decline only after the intensification of fishing pressure in the basin. The study suggests that Mar Piccolo di Taranto could be one of the sources for international seahorse trade, thus highlighting the need for more intense and effective actions to prevent and combat illegal poaching, while threatened populations are requiring continuous and close monitoring. Due to unfavorable socio-economic conditions, a viable and thriving seahorse population at Mar Piccolo di Taranto could contribute to the revitalization of the coastal economy and the development of environmental awareness.

AB  - Tropical ageratum (Ageratum conyzoides L.) is a problematic weed frequently observed in association with commercially important crops in Australian agroecosystems. Knowledge of the germination response of A. conyzoides is crucial for proactively managing this weed species, especially when herbicide resistance is involved. Herbicide screening and metsulfuron dose-response experiments were conducted on two separate populations of A. conyzoides (referred to as Sugarcane and Roadside) in an open environment to identify a metsulfuron-resistant population. Based on the survival percentage in the metsulfuron dose-response experiment, the Sugarcane population was found to be 54 times more resistant compared with the metsulfuron-susceptible population (Roadside). Subsequent laboratory experiments were performed to investigate the differential germination response of the two populations. No germination or emergence difference was observed between the Sugarcane and Roadside populations under various thermal regimes (15/5 to 35/25 C with a 12/12-h photoperiod), salinity levels (0 to 320 mM), osmotic potentials (0 to -1.6 MPa), and burial depths (1 to 4 cm). However, different environmental conditions significantly impacted the germination and emergence of A. conyzoides. Ageratum conyzoides germinated over a wide range of temperatures, with the highest germination rate (>90%) occurring at 30/20 C. With increasing levels of salinity, osmotic potential, and burial depth, the germination/emergence of A. conyzoides declined and was completely inhibited at 300 mM salinity, -0.8 MPa osmotic potential, and a 1-cm burial depth. The data generated from this study will be useful in developing a model-based approach to predict the occurrence of this weed species and thus aid in designing ecologically sustainable integrated weed management protocols.

AB  - Over one-third of elasmobranch fishes (sharks, rays, and skates) are threatened with extinction, mostly due to overfishing, habitat loss, and habitat degradation. Understanding the daily and seasonal movement patterns of these species can inform when and where populations are most susceptible to these threats, but these data are often lacking for nearshore species that are not actively managed. Two such species are the shovelnose guitarfish Pseudobatos productus and California bat ray Myliobatis californica; this study quantified the broad- and fine-scale movement patterns of these species using passive acoustic telemetry. Twelve guitarfish (10 female, 2 male) were surgically implanted with coded acoustic transmitters at an aggregation site off La Jolla (San Diego County), California, USA, and tracked for 849.5 +/- 548.9 d (mean +/- SD). Six bat rays (all female) were also implanted with transmitters and tracked for 1143.8 +/- 830.9 d. These animals were detected at 187 acoustic receiver stations between Point Conception, California, and San Quintin, Baja California, Mexico. Both species exhibited annual philopatry to La Jolla, especially in July, after traveling as far north as Santa Barbara (221 km away; guitarfish) and San Miguel Island (259 km away; bat rays), California. Based on their movement patterns and known reproductive phenology, we hypothesize that both species utilize the La Jolla aggregation site as a gestating ground and possibly also a mating, pupping, and nursery ground. This site is within a no-take reserve, and we recommend that similar sites also be protected, given the increased susceptibility to anthropogenic stressors when aggregating.

AB  - Climate change-associated rise in atmospheric CO2 concentration has a wide range of both beneficial and detrimental effects on global food production. In C-3 plants, elevated CO2 concentrations enhance photosynthesis, growth, yield and abiotic stress tolerance, but reduce nutritional values and plant defense against certain pests and pathogens. Phytohormone ethylene is involved in many biological processes and also mediates responses to CO2. Elevated CO2 has been shown to increase, impede, or have no influence on ethylene production at various phases of plant growth and development. Recent studies have unveiled the importance of ethylene biosynthesis and signaling in elevated CO2-induced stress tolerance. Diverse and complex effects of elevated CO2 on ethylene production, stomatal behavior, photosynthesis and metabolic homeostasis mediate abiotic stress tolerance; whereas suppression of ethylene/jasmonate pathways by elevated CO2 attenuates plant defense against insect herbivores and necrotrophic fungal pathogens. Furthermore, treatments with high CO2 concentrations have been found advantageous for postharvest storage of a variety of fresh horticultural products. The senescence-delaying impact of CO2 is ascribed to its role as an ethylene competitor at the ethylene receptor site and on various metabolic pathways. In this review, we firstly discuss the impacts of high atmospheric CO2 concentrations on photosynthesis, stomatal movement, ethylene production and its relationship to plant growth, development, physiology and stress responses. We also expand the discussion to the effect of increased CO2 levels on commercially important plant organs, such as fruit, vegetables and flowers concerning its advantages and dis-advantages in postharvest management. As atmospheric CO2 concentrations will further rise, it is far more important than ever to know how plants react to high CO2 concentrations using cutting-edge molecular technology.

AB  - Background and aimsA long-standing ecological assumption posits that insect herbivory increases in warmer, more stable climates at lower elevations. However, this paradigm has been called into question in recent decades. Some studies suggest that differences in tri-trophic interactions, particularly the diversity, abundance, and activity of herbivore natural enemies, may explain inconsistent patterns in herbivory. Additionally, plant ontogeny significantly influences herbivore susceptibility, with adult plants being more apparent and thus more susceptible to herbivore attacks than saplings. These ontogenetic differences in herbivory might, in turn, determine changes in herbivore predation across elevations. Unfortunately, most research addressing these ecological assumptions has focused on aboveground tri-trophic interactions.MethodsHere, we investigated elevational differences in the activity of entomopathogenic nematodes (EPNs), known killers of soil-dwelling insects, and compared these patterns between young and adult oak (Quercus, Fagaceae) trees. We collected soil samples from rhizospheres of adult trees and saplings throughout the optimal elevational range (low, mid, and high) of 10 Mediterranean oak species in the Iberian Peninsula, estimating EPN activity through insect baiting with wax moth larvae.ResultsOur results showed higher larval mortality and EPN activity at lower elevations, with this effect being influenced by plant ontogeny; therefore, elevation-related variations were observed only in rhizospheres of mature trees. Additionally, we found that soil characteristics did not significantly affect these outcomes.ConclusionsOur study provides evidence that plant ontogeny influences belowground tri-trophic interactions along elevational gradients in oak species, emphasizing the minimal impact of abiotic soil factors on these processes.

AB  - Simple Summary
   Public awareness of animal welfare in livestock farming continues to grow all over the world, especially in Central Europe as well as in Australia and Northern America. Consequently, the ban on piglet castration without anaesthesia comes into force in Germany and France in 2021 and other European countries such as Norway, the Netherlands, Switzerland and Sweden have taken legislative actions against piglet castration without pain relief earlier. Hence, alternatives have to be established that prevent the occurrence of boar taint in male pigs. The aim of the present study was to examine the effect of dietary biochar on boar taint compounds (skatole and indole) in faeces and plasma as well as on performance parameters. The biochar was added to the feed whether two or four weeks before slaughter. Animals that received biochar during the last two weeks before slaughter had lower skatole concentrations in faeces at the end of the trial than at the beginning, whereas these results could not be confirmed when animals received biochar for four weeks. Nevertheless, the faeces was drier when animals were fed biochar and performance was not affected. Results indicate that more research is necessary to better understand the nonspecific adsorption capacity of biochar.
   The ban on piglet castration without anaesthesia poses a challenge for the meat industry since alternatives ensuring the production of flawless pork have to be established. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of biochar on skatole and indole concentration in faeces and plasma on a small scale in finishing boars to prove whether biochar was suitable for use in commercial pork production. Moreover, it was investigated whether biochar affects faecal properties or the performance. For a four-week trial period, 54 boars (bodyweight 97.2 +/- 6.88 kg) were divided into three groups. The control (BC0) received no dietary biochar, one group received a diet containing 4% coated biochar (corresponding to 2% pure biochar) for the final two experimental weeks (BC2), and another group for the entire four weeks (BC4), respectively, prior to slaughter. Skatole and indole concentrations were measured in faeces and plasma at the beginning, in the middle and at the end of the trial. Mean skatole concentrations did not differ between groups, but in BC2 faecal skatole was significantly decreased at day 26, whereas in BC4 initial and final faecal skatole levels did not differ. At day 15 and 26, the faecal dry matter content was significantly higher in pigs fed the biochar diet (p < 0.05).

AB  - Kacang (K) and Kacang Etawah (KE) cross goats are the major goat breeds that are important for farming livelihood and income and recognized for their tolerance to hot and humid tropical climates. As global warming progresses, the daily maximum temperature (T-max) is predicted to be continuously increased, which will challenge goat production in the future. The objective of this study was to evaluate the physiological and behavioral responses of the goats to the elevated T-max. Six K and six KE female goats were housed in a normal environment (average T-max: 33 & DEG;C; temperature humidity index (THI): 76 to 86) for 6 weeks and then in a hot environment (average T-max: 38 & DEG;C; THI: 76 to 92) for 7 weeks. During hot conditions, rectal, rectal surface, and skin temperature, respiration rate, hemoglobin, and cholesterol increased (p < 0.05), whereas glucose blood levels decreased (p < 0.01). Dry matter (DM) intake was lowered (p < 0.01), and DM digestibility was elevated (p < 0.01), whereas drinking water and body water retention were lowered but varied (p < 0.05) during hot weeks. Lying time increased during the hot weeks in both breeds (p < 0.01), whereas lying and ruminating as well as total ruminating time was longer (p < 0.05) in KE goats compared to K goats, which explain the greater (p < 0.05) DM digestibility in KE goats. The effect of the elevated T-max might be less severe since it also depends on the duration of the T-max and the variation of daily THI.

AB  - Climate change could increase pest pressure, due to changes in insect distribution and phenology, affecting herbivore-parasitoids interactions and consequently, the efficacy of biological control of crop pests. Elevated carbon dioxide (eCO2) concentration directly affects plant growth, physiology and biochemistry, subsequently influencing herbivore insects and higher trophic levels. In this study, we analysed the effect of eCO2 on the individual fitness of Aphis gossypii Glover (Hemiptera: Aphididae) and on the performance of its parasitoid Aphidius colemani Vierick (Hymenoptera: Braconidae), both reared for two successive generations on melon plants (Cucumis melo L., Cucurbitaceae), previous acclimated during two or six weeks to different CO2 levels, eCO2 (700 ppm) or ambient CO2 (400 ppm). There was a significant impact of eCO2 on aphid performance, prolonging its development time and decreasing its fecundity, negatively affecting the intrinsic rate of natural increase of the two generations of A. gossypii grown under eCO2. There was lower proportion of parasitoids emergence (i.e. pupal survivorship) in first generation A. colemani grown under eCO2. However, parasitism rate, emergence percentages by sex and the overall development time, remained unchanged due to the effect of eCO2 for the two generations of A. colemani. Our research suggests that the effects of eCO2 on the tritrophic interaction studied could reduce herbivore infestation by decreasing its growth rate. Despite the parasitism efficiency is maintained, in the long term A. colemani will not easily find A. gossyppi for parasitism and their populations could be compromised, although less than other parasitoids with greater host specificity.

AB  - Yak meat plays a significant economic role for yaks. The unique environment of the Qinghai-Tibet plateau profoundly impacts the meat production performance of yaks. Yet, the regulatory mechanisms influencing muscle growth and development in yaks within this plateau environment remain poorly understood. The study investigated the transcriptome gene expression in the buttock muscle tissue of yaks residing at varying altitudes. It revealed 516 differentially expressed genes in the buttock muscle tissue of yaks at high altitude (4500 m) and low altitude (3000 m). The Gene Ontology (GO) annotation indicated that these differentially expressed genes primarily function in RNA binding, identical protein binding, nucleotide binding, pre-mRNA branch point binding, unfolded protein binding, insulin receptor binding, fructose 1,6-bisphosphate 1-phosphatase activity, collagen binding, platelet-derived growth factor receptor binding, and sodium channel inhibitor activity. Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analysis revealed that the differentially expressed genes predominantly participated in pathways such as the spliceosome, aminoacyl tRNA biosynthesis, RNA polymerase, cutin, suberin, and wax biosynthesis, ribosome biogenesis in eukaryotes, plant hormone signal transduction, axon guidance, fructose and mannose metabolism, pentose phosphate pathway, and gastric acid secretion. This study unveiled the impact of the plateau environment on transcriptome gene expression in yak buttock muscle tissue, mapping out the gene expression profiles specific to yaks living at varying altitudes (3000 m and 4500 m). The findings offer crucial genomic insights into the mechanisms behind yak muscle adaptation to plateau environments.

AB  - Formosan serows are an endemic species in Taiwan. Alfaxalone, a gamma-aminobutyric acid(A) agonist, induces or maintains anesthesia in various veterinary species with reported potential adverse effects of respiratory depression and tachycardia. alpha 2-Adrenoceptor agonists exert sedative and muscle relaxation effects, along with substantial cardiovascular adverse effects. Here, we aimed to evaluate the anesthetic effects of alfaxalone combined with xylazine or dexmedetomidine (AX vs. AD, respectively) in Formosan serows. In this randomized, masked study, AX was administered to four serows, and AD was administered to five serows intramuscularly via blow dart. The time and score of induction and recovery were recorded. Post-intubation, isoflurane was administered for maintenance anesthesia. Heart rate (HR), respiratory rate (RR), peripheral saturation of oxygenation (SpO(2)), rectal temperature (RT), and end-tidal CO2 (EtCO2) were recorded every five to eight minutes. Atipamezole and tolazoline were administered to antagonize dexmedetomidine and xylazine post-procedure, respectively. Both combinations allowed smooth induction and recovery. The AD group exhibited significantly lower HR and SpO(2) and significantly higher RT and EtCO2 than the AX group (both p < 0.01). The AD-treated serows exhibited notable muscle rigidity after induction and significant hypoventilation and hypoxemia during the procedure. Although alfaxalone combined with dexmedetomidine or xylazine can produce satisfactory induction and recovery in Formosa serows, notable hypoxemia and hypoventilation are induced by the alfaxalone-dexmedetomidine combination compared to the alfaxalone-xylazine combination.

AB  - The ancient human footprints in valley-bottom sediments in Tularosa Valley, New Mexico, are fascinating and potentially important because they suggest interactions between Pleistocene megafauna as well as great antiquity. The dating of those footprints is crucial in interpretations of when humans first came to North America from Asia, but the ages have larger uncertainties than has been reported. Some of that uncertainty is related to the possibility of a radiocarbon reservoir in the water in which the dated propagules of Ruppia cirrhosa grew. As a test of that possibility, Ruppia specimens collected in 1947 from nearby Malpais Spring returned a radiocarbon age of ca. 7400 cal yr BP. We think it would be appropriate to devise and implement independent means for dating the footprints, thus lowering the uncertainty in the proposed age of the footprints and leading to a better understanding of when humans first arrived in the Americas.

AB  - Sheep pasturing has become an important means for landscape management and conservation in marginal areas of mountain regions by reducing succession with dwarf shrubs and bushes, thus creating space for valuable forage grasses. Furthermore, mountain sheep pasturing for meat production also contributes to local food se-curity. However, little is known about the energetic expenditures of sheep during mountain pasturing, which is important information for optimizing the productivity and economic efficiency, environmental aspects (e.g., biodiversity) as well as animal welfare. Therefore, the aim of the following study was to estimate the mainte-nance energy requirements of ewes over the whole mountain pasturing period (transhumance) considering movement patterns assessed by using satellite-based Global Positioning System (GPS) tracking devices. Energy requirements for walking increased rapidly at the beginning of transhumance (May -June), which could be explained by the longer walked distance and by overcoming variable altitude during that phase. Walking speed was slower compared to previous findings due to the difficult terrain of mountain pastures on which sheep moved. Energy demand for walking was strongly correlated with walking distance and walking speed. Results out of this study contribute in promoting the efficiency and consequently the rentability of alpine sheep pasturing systems. The latter ensures the production of local food and further preserves the ecosystem services linked to this low-input production system.

AB  - Plants are widely recognized as chemical factories, with each species producing dozens to hundreds of unique secondary metabolites. These compounds shape the interactions between plants and their natural enemies. We explore the evolutionary patterns and processes by which plants generate chemical diversity, from evolving novel compounds to unique chemical profiles.We characterized the chemical profile of one-third of the species of tropical rainforest trees in the genus Inga (c. 100, Fabaceae) using ultraperformance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry-based metabolomics and applied phylogenetic comparative methods to understand the mode of chemical evolution.We show: each Inga species contain structurally unrelated compounds and high levels of phytochemical diversity; closely related species have divergent chemical profiles, with individual compounds, compound classes, and chemical profiles showing little-to-no phylogenetic signal; at the evolutionary time scale, a species' chemical profile shows a signature of divergent adaptation. At the ecological time scale, sympatric species were the most divergent, implying it is also advantageous to maintain a unique chemical profile from community members; finally, we integrate these patterns with a model for how chemical diversity evolves.Taken together, these results show that phytochemical diversity and divergence are fundamental to the ecology and evolution of plants.

AB  - Locating a vocalizing animal can be useful in many fields of bioacoustics and behavioral research, and is often done in the wild, covering large areas. In zoos, however, the application of this method becomes particularly difficult, because, on the one hand, the animals are in a relatively small area and, on the other hand, reverberant environments and background noise complicate the analysis. Nevertheless, by localizing and analyzing animal sounds, valuable information on physiological state, sex, subspecies, reproductive state, social status, and animal welfare can be gathered. Therefore, we developed a sound localization software that is able to estimate the position of a vocalizing animal precisely, making it possible to assign the vocalization to the corresponding individual, even under difficult conditions. In this study, the accuracy and reliability of the software is tested under various conditions. Different vocalizations were played back through a loudspeaker and recorded with several microphones to verify the accuracy. In addition, tests were carried out under real conditions using the example of the giant otter enclosure at Dortmund Zoo, Germany. The results show that the software can estimate the correct position of a sound source with a high accuracy (median of the deviation 0.234 m). Consequently, this software could make an important contribution to basic research via position determination and the associated differentiation of individuals, and could be relevant in a long-term application for monitoring animal welfare in zoos.

AB  - Climate change has increased the frequency and severity of frequent drought in the Kenya arid and semiarid lands with resultant fodder and water shortages. In order to adapt to these longer and less predictable droughts, keeping of camels has been adopted as a coping strategy in grappling with the vagaries of climate change. Camels are both grazers and browsers of a broad spectrum of preferred forages whose nutrient composition is not well documented. The objective of this study was to identify and determine the chemical composition of forage species mostly preferred by lactating Somali camels in Laikipia County, Kenya. Lactating Somali camels and their calves were monitored while browsing and grazing in the rangelands during the wet and dry seasons from August to November 2019. The forage species were ranked on the basis of bite count. The most browsed forages identified through observation were sampled, identified by the local and scientific names, and analyzed for proximate composition, detergent fiber fractions, and in vitro dry matter digestibility. The most browsed forage species were Acacia nubica (22.6%), Acacia seyal (47.3%), Cucumis aculeatus (7.2%), Euclea divinorum (11.1%), Hibiscus parrifolia (11.9%) during the wet season and Barleria acanthoides (22.9%), Balanites aegyptiaca (15.5%), Cynodon dactylon (11.7%), Lycium europaeum (32%), and Pollichia campestris (17.8%) during the dry season. Shrubs constituted 60%, trees 30%, and grasses 10% of the most preferred forage species. The preferred browsed and grazed species had a range of 7.1% +/- 0.4% to 25.7% +/- 1.2% crude protein on a dry matter basis, 29.1% +/- 2.7% to 74.0% +/- 7% for neutral detergent fiber concentrations, and 43.4% +/- 0.2% to 81.6% +/- 0.3% for in vitro dry matter digestibility. The study indicates that trees and shrubs with high crude protein and low neutral detergent fiber concentrations were more preferred, indicating that forage nutritive value affected the forage preference by the camels.

AB  - Some jurisdictions in the eastern United States have reduced harvest of white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) because of perceived declines in recruitment and population size over the last decade. Although the restoration of American black bears (Ursus americanus) and the colonization of coyotes (Canis latrans) have increased fawn predation in some areas, limited information exists on how temporally dynamic resources and weather influence fawn survival. Therefore, we evaluated fawn survival probability, cause specific mortality, and if factors such as oak (Quercus spp.) mast abundance, winter severity, precipitation, and landscape composition influenced mortality risk on Marine Corps Base Quantico in northern Virginia, USA, from 2008 to 2019. We tracked 248 fawns outfitted with very high frequency radio-collars and predation was the leading cause of mortality (n = 42; 45%). We estimated survival to 133 days and survival pooling all years (2008-2019) was 0.50 (95% CI = 0.42-0.60). Increased annual red oak (Quercus spp.) mast abundance from the previous fall reduced mortality hazard for fawns. The longevity of our study revealed a link between fawn survival and a specific maternal resource (red oak mast) only available during gestation. Our results highlight the importance of oak mast in eastern deciduous forests and, more broadly, overwinter maternal condition on white-tailed deer recruitment.

AB  - The calcaneus plays a critical role in balance, locomotion, and muscle attachment, making it a key structure for biomechanical adaptations. This study examined interspecies differences between sheep and goats, as well as intraspecies variations among different sheep breeds, in calcaneus morphology. A total of 128 right calcanei were analyzed using 3D geometric morphometric methods to allow detailed assessments of calcaneus shape and size. Among sheep, the Hamdani sheep displayed the largest calcaneus among the breeds, distinguishing them significantly from the others. In contrast, goats had a bilaterally narrower calcaneal body, while sheep featured a more pronounced distal portion that articulates with the talus and a deeper articular surface. Additionally, the sustentaculum tali were more developed in sheep. The bilaterally compressed calcaneal body in goats likely reflects their agility and ability to navigate steep, rocky terrains. In contrast, sheep's broader and more robust calcaneus may support their grazing lifestyle on flatter terrains, emphasizing their stability and weight-bearing capacity. These findings highlight the functional significance of calcaneal morphology in the locomotor strategies and physical capabilities of goats and sheep, providing valuable insights for comparative anatomy and veterinary science.

AB  - Although global change and landscape modifications have degraded natural habitats, some species are able to thrive in anthropized landscapes by exploiting agricultural subsidies. In heterogeneous agroecosystems, spatial variation in landscape composition is predicted to impact demographic performance of wildlife depending on predominant agricultural practices and the distribution of remnant fragments of semi-natural habitat. Body mass is a key driver of among-individual variation in performance which varies at a fine scale, depending on landscape structure. We tested the hypothesis that the availability of rich crops (i.e. sorghum, corn and sunflower) in heterogeneous agricultural landscapes promotes rapid first-year growth of roe deer fawns, potentially driving spatial variation in demographic performance. We used GPS data of 166 juveniles (8-10 months old) inhabiting a heterogeneous agricultural landscape to predict their home range and evaluate its composition in terms of crops that may provide complementary resources. We hypothesized that juveniles with a post-weaning home range that included these crop types would be the heaviest at the onset of winter. Winter body mass of juveniles decreased by 35 +/- 5 g per percentage point increase of woodland in their home range, so that juveniles with almost no woodland in their home range were about 3.5 kg heavier than those living in pure forest. Further, individuals with at least some corn in their home range were, on average, 773 +/- 237 g heavier than those with none. Agricultural food subsidies reshape the habitat-dependent body mass trajectory of large herbivores, likely driving improved reproductive performance in agricultural landscapes.

AB  - Determination of factors affecting sex ratio is important while considering application of sex ratio enrichment approach. Present study aimed to design a SYBR Green qPCR-based method for measurement of primary sex ratio and to evaluate different factors (genetic group, sire, spermiogenic cycle and processing layer) affecting boar sperm sex ratio. The qPCR was based on relative copy number analysis of sex chromosome-specific single copy gene fragments with an autosomal gene as reference and was evaluated using DNA dilution series from pigs with numerically normal karyotype. The sex ratio was estimated from genomic DNA samples isolated from boar semen collected from different genetic groups at different time points and different processing layers. The X chromosome frequencies of semen samples revealed significant effect of genetic group. However, significant variation was observed neither within same genetic group nor between ejaculates of different spermatogenic cycles. Among the processing techniques studied, swim-up technique produced a significant X sperm enrichment in comparison to control whereas, Percoll density gradient failed to show any significant difference among layers. The lower layer in swim-up technique was found to contain higher proportion of X sperms. The designed qPCR is found to be an easy, less time-consuming method and does not require high end laboratory facilities or the specialized expertise. The lower layer of swim-up processing has a scope for X sperm enrichment in boar semen with proper validation.

AB  - Plants of the same species can strongly differ in their specialized metabolite profiles, which can affect insect presence and abundance in the field. However, how specialized chemistry shapes plant attractiveness to herbivorous insects is not fully understood. Here, we used common tansy Tanacetum vulgare, Asteraceae) - a perennial plant that is highly diverse in terpenoid composition and is known to have variable chemotypes - to test whether 1) plants with different chemotype profiles differ in attractiveness to two specialist aphid species, Macrosiphoniella tanacetaria and Uroleucon tanaceti, in pairwise choice assays; 2) the diversity of the terpenoid blend affects plant attractiveness to aphids; 3) how plant chemical traits relate to plant morphological traits and which traits best explain aphid preference. We found that M. tanacetaria preferred two out of five chemotypes, dominated by alpha-thujone/beta-thujone and beta-trans-chrysanthenyl acetate, while avoiding a chemotype dominated by alpha-pinene/sabinene. Uroleucon tanaceti showed no clear preference towards chemotypes, but when given a choice between chemotypes dominated by alpha-thujone/beta-thujone and by alpha-pinene/sabinene, they preferred the former. Importantly, plant attractiveness to aphids was marginally negatively correlated with chemodiversity, i.e. the number of terpenoid compounds, in M. tanacetaria, but not in U. tanaceti. Interestingly, the relative concentration and number of terpenoids were generally higher in larger and bushier plants. Hence, we did not observe a tradeoff between plant growth and defence. We conclude that plant chemical composition affects plant attractiveness to aphids and hence may contribute to variation in natural aphid colonization patterns on plants of the same species.

AB  - We conducted the present study in two freshwater lakes in the Mysore district of Karnataka, India, from December 2023 to May 2024, with the aim of evaluating the diversity, relative abundance, and feeding guilds of avifauna in Giribetta and Hadinaru lakes. The "point count" method was used to evaluate the species composition of birds. A total of 5,790 individuals, representing 106 species from 18 orders and 48 families, were recorded. Four species were in the near-threatened category: Painted Stork (Mycteria leucocephala), Black-headed Ibis (Threskiornis melanocephalus), Oriental Darter (Anhinga melanogaster), and Spot-billed Pelican (Pelecanus philippensis), while the others were of least concern. In terms of species richness, Giribetta Lake had 87 species belonging to 18 orders and 42 families, as compared to Hadinaru Lake, which had 86 species from 16 orders and 40 families. The two areas had similar species composition, with a Sorenson index of 76.3% and a Jaccard index of 61.7%, which indicates that the species diversity is fairly similar across the habitats. Based on the diet and foraging habitat, the recorded bird species were classified into eight major feeding guilds, which revealed a higher abundance of carnivorous and insectivorous birds, followed by omnivorous, granivorous, frugivorous, nectarivorous, herbivorous, and mixed guild types. It is expected that this study will provide a preliminary database for the waterbirds of this area, useful for further research and assessment.

AB  - The Australian Pleistocene fossil record of the Accipitridae (hawks, eagles and Old World vultures) is sparse and poorly known. Only two extinct confirmed accipitrid species have been described for this time period; both have received little investigation since their description. One is "Taphaetus" lacertosus de Vis, 1905, described from a distal humerus and a quadrate from north-eastern South Australia. While this species was verified as an accipitrid in subsequent studies, its more precise taxonomic affinities have remained conjectural. In this study, a new analysis incorporating newly referred material and phylogenetic analyses using a wide range of accipitriforms reveals that the lectotype humerus of "T." lacertosus is an Old World vulture in the subfamily Aegypiinae. The associated quadrate, one of two original syntypes from which de Vis named this species, is of an indeterminate species of ardeid. We erect the novel genus Cryptogyps, to accommodate the species 'lacertosus', as it cannot be placed in Taphaetus de Vis, 1891, because the type species of this genus, Uroaetus brachialis de Vis, 1889, was transferred back to the genus Uroaetus, a synonym of Aquila Brisson, by de Vis in 1905. Further, U. brachialis is now considered a synonym of Aquila audax (Latham, 1801). Moreover, Taphaetus de Vis, 1891 is a senior homonym of Taphaetus de Vis, 1905, type species Taphaetus lacertosus de Vis, 1905, making the 1905 version of the genus unavailable. Newly referred fossils from Wellington Caves (NSW) and the Nullarbor Plains (WA) reveal this taxon had a wide geographical range across Pleistocene Australia. The referred tarsometatarsus lacks hyper-developed trochleae, indicating that Cryptogyps lacertosus (de Vis, 1905) comb. nov., was probably a scavenger like other aegypiines. Identification of Cryptogyps lacertosus as an aegypiine significantly expands the palaeogeographical range of the Old World vultures, hitherto unknown in Australia. The avian guild of large, obligate scavenging birds of prey, is currently absent in the modern Australian biota, but its former presence is not surprising given the megafauna-rich communities of the Pleistocene.

AB  - Telemetry studies allow scientists to track animal movements and study species ecology without direct visual observation. Fitting telemetry devices requires physical or chemical capture and restraint of animals. Ground darting is a commonly used technique to capture cervids but locating animals to dart and finding individuals post induction remains a challenge. Here we present an application of using thermal imaging drones to help locate, ground dart, and monitor target animals to ensure safe immobilization. We immobilized 10 free-ranging Sitka black-tailed deer (Odocoileus hemionus sitkensis), 8 of which were captured with the assistance of the thermal drone. The utilization of drones in wildlife ground darting operations can increase safety and efficiency, and reduce risk to researchers and study subjects.

AB  - Trade in wild game meat (WGM) is increasing in online markets. However, the distribution of WGM in online trade remains unclear, and our limited knowledge has prevented sustainable WGM consumption that reduces the risks to human health and overcomes the challenges in wildlife management and biodiversity conservation. To explore the trends and challenges of online transactions of WGM, we analyzed the sales data from the online consumer-to-consumer market in Japan. Results revealed a high propensity to trade the lean meat. Our results also showed that transactions of edible offal were significantly positive and relatively more common in wild boar and black bear. In the brown bear, the coefficient for the sales numbers of "hand and foot" was significantly positive. Findings indicate that the online consumer-to-consumer market can be a new opportunity to distribute WGM. The development of guidelines and regulatory systems could help to avoid the risks associated with WGM consumption.

AB  - In this study, we investigate whether replacing conventional seabed-contacting otter boards with semi-pelagic self-adjusting otter (SAO) boards, which have the ability to maintain a given height above the seabed, affects the catch efficiency of a demersal fish trawl. Experimental fishing trials, using the alternate haul method, were conducted in the Kattegat and Skagerrak with three otter board configurations using conventional seabed-contacting otter boards; the SAO set to maintain a target height over the seabed of 1 m; and the SAO set to maintain a target height of 5 m. Replacing conventional otter boards with SAO resulted in a loss of catch efficiency for haddock (Melanogrammus aeglefinus), whiting (Merlangius merlangus), and plaice (Hippoglossoides platessoides), while no significant difference was found for cod (Gadus morhua), common dab (Limanda limanda), and lemon sole (Microstomus kitt). When comparing the SAO-1 m and SAO-5 m, it was observed that SAO-5 m resulted in a loss of catch efficiency for haddock and plaice, a minimal reduction for cod, and no significant difference for whiting, common dab, and lemon sole.

AB  - 1. Studies have shown that fruits of plants from the Fabaceae family harbour a diverse community of herbivorous insects and their natural enemies. Despite this observation, we still lack information on the specific interactions within these multi-trophic communities. Herein, we describe the food web of insects associated with fruits and seeds of Leucaena leucocephala (Fabaceae), an invasive plant in Brazil, and their relationship with plant traits including seed biomass.2. We found 17 species of insects distributed across three trophic levels. The main herbivore species sampled was Acanthoscelides macrophthalmus (Coleoptera, Chrysomelidae, Bruchinae), which was responsible for most of the seed predation and associated with the highest parasitoid biodiversity (N = 10 species). Four other herbivorous species were lower in abundance, including a previously unreported Lepidopteran species with two parasitoids and one hyperparasitoid associated with it.3. Seeds with more mass promoted an increase in insect abundance, insect species richness, and the number of links and connectivity. We observed two native parasitoid species, Paracrias pluteus and Stenocorse suldamericanos, shift from herbivores on native plants to herbivores on the invasive L. leucocephala, consistent with a potential host shift. However, more investigation is required to ascertain the effects of recent shifts of native insect communities (on native plants) to non-native ones and their consequences on plant fitness. Our study contributes to the understanding of the dynamics of communities and food webs in unknown systems, specifically in fruits of an invasive plant, and provides information about the influence of different plant traits on these communities.

AB  - Adaptation to Late Pleistocene climate change is an oft-cited potential contributor to Neanderthal disappearance in Eurasia. Accordingly, research on Neanderthal behaviour - including subsistence strategies, mobility, lithic technology, raw material procurement and demography - often focuses on linking changes observable in the archaeological record to specific phases of climate and environmental change. However, these correspondences are often tenuous because palaeoclimatic and archaeological records are rarely available on the same scale. In Iberia, a critical location for understanding the demise of Neanderthals, some research indicates that Neanderthal populations were unable to recover from environmental degradations known as Heinrich Events, while other studies suggest that enclaves of Neanderthal populations survived for several millennia longer in refugial zones. Here, we present a palaeoenvironmental reconstruction study using analysis of delta C-13 and delta O-18 of herbivore tooth enamel recovered from two Mousterian deposits at Lapa do Picareiro, a site located in Portuguese Estremadura. We then use these data, combined with other site-based palaeoenvironmental indicators, to assess whether central Portugal acted as a refugium during periods of unfavourable climate, and to test whether Neanderthals in Portuguese Estremadura reorganised their mobility strategies after severe climate episodes.

AB  - The study of trophic interactions might be key to understanding the distribution of species on Earth. Particularly, the biogeography of heterotrophic species - such as mammals - could be strongly driven by trophic interactions (diet). Here, we map and discuss the division of dietary strategies (herbivory, frugivory, carnivory, etc.) of terrestrial mammals on a global scale. We analyzed the diet of 4854 extant terrestrial mammal species (with known range and diet data, representing 86.67 % of extant mammal species). We compiled species diets (EltonTraits database), species ranges (International Union for Conservation of Nature, IUCN, database) and climate data (WorldClim database) to illustrate how mammal dietary strategies are distributed across the globe. First, we performed a principal coordinate analysis (PCoA) with diet data. Second, we mapped the distribution of the main dietary strategies (PCoA axes) of terrestrial mammals globally. Third, we analyzed how climate relates to dietary strategies. We found that herbivory in mammals is more common in northern and desert areas, which corresponds to areas with lower minimum temperatures and lower precipitation. Mammals feeding on fruits and invertebrates (frugivory and invertivory) are more common in the tropics, which corresponds to areas with higher precipitation and higher minimum temperatures. Mammals feeding on seeds (granivory) are predominant in North America, Europe, Central Asia and Oceania, corresponding to areas with temperate environments. Carnivorous mammals are more common in the Northern Hemisphere and towards the poles, which corresponds to areas with lower minimum temperatures and less extreme dry periods. Terrestrial mammal diets show clear geographical patterns that can be partially explained by climate across the globe.

AB  - Florida is renowned for its non-native reptile communities, with 2 such pervasive non-native species including the apex predator Python bivittatus (Burmese Python) and the herbivorous Iguana iguana (Green Iguana) that showcase the spectrum of their ecological impacts. Both species have recently expanded into the Florida Keys. We used a camera trap to survey a radio-tagged Burmese Python and documented both non-native reptiles cohabitating in the active, natural stick-nest of an endangered rodent, Neotoma floridana smalli (Key Largo Woodrat), in Dagny Johnson Botanical State Park, Key Largo, FL. An additional nest visitor included Peromyscus gossypinus allapaticola (Key Largo Cotton Mouse), another endangered rodent and potential prey for the python. Camera placement allowed us to detect both rodents on the exterior of the stick-nest. The presence of the Key Largo Woodrat and Key Largo Cotton Mouse at the nest warrant continued monitoring of the 2 reptile species and their interactions with the endangered small mammals as their presence becomes more common in the Florida Keys.

AB  - Ecologists have long been interested in the interactions between plants and insects. However, there are few recent reviews and syntheses on plant-insect interactions research. To explore the current state of plant-insect interactions research and promote the research progress of plant-insect interactions, we used bibliometric methodologies to analyze the annual publication volume, research strength, and research hotspots of the literature about plant-insect interactions included in the Web of Science from 2001 to 2021. The results showed that the number of publications on plant-insect interactions research increased steadily from 2001 to 2021, with the initial development stage occurring before 2004 and a steady growth stage from 2005 to 2009, as well as a steady growth trend in the number of publications. After 2010, it entered a phase of rapid development, with the highest number of articles in 2021, with 352 publications. The studies were mostly conducted in developed countries. The USA had the most publications and the greatest influence, with a total of 1,218 publications. Furthermore, China had the second-highest number of publications and the strongest growth in the last 5 years (from 2017 to 2021) in terms of recent publication output. The University of California System stands out as the research institution with the highest number of publications, followed by the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) and the French National Center for Scientific Research (CNRS). The Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences (CAAS) and the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS) were the top two among the top 15 institutions in terms of article publication in the past five years. The author with the most publications was Dicke M, while Wei TY had been more active with 66.67% of the total number of papers published in the last five years. Oecologia was the journal that published the most academic articles in plant-insect interactions research, but PNAS had the highest impact factors. The hotspots primarily concentrated on understanding the impact of insect-plant interactions on genes, the interconnections between insects and plants, and the effects of these interactions on the diversity of ecosystems. The number of Chinese publications increased rapidly during the previous five years, indicating some strength in plant-insect interaction research. However, there is still much opportunity for improvement in terms of both the quality and number of study findings. With China's continued investment in scientific research in recent years, it is projected that plant-insect interaction research will have a significant developmental tendency in the future.

AB  - Earthworm incubation combined with organic fertilization is promoted as an amended measure to improve soil properties in the ecological restoration of various degraded soils. However, the impacts of earthworms on the soil aggregate size under different organic fertilization in salt-affected soils have not yet been fully revealed. This hinders our ability to develop policies by which to alleviate soil salinization. In this study, under mesocosm experiments, we investigate the effects of earthworm (Aporrectodea trapezoides) and organic fertilization on the soil aggregate size after 16 weeks of incubation. The soil treated with clover residues showed lower earthworm survival rates and biomass compared to that treated with sheep manure. However, the soil macropores and large macroaggregate were higher in the soils treated with clover residue when earthworms were present. In addition, earthworm burrowing activities form pathways toward food patches improve the characteristics of soil macropores, and the properties of the residue itself play a decisive role. Moreover, whether earthworms are present or not significantly influences the soil macroporosity, macropore number, and soil electrical conductivity. This demonstrates that earthworms exhibit a key feature of soil physical functioning in salt-affected soil.

AB  - The objective of this study was to determine how application of dolomitic limestone and stocking methods (continuous stocking or deferred stocking) affect the soil compaction, sheep grazing location, height, and nutritional value of pastures when the pasture growth rate is at its maximum. A 4 ha field at Mitra farm-University of & Eacute;vora-was divided into four plots: P1 and P2-without application of dolomitic limestone, continuous stocking (CS), and deferred stocking (DS), respectively-and P3 and P4-with application of dolomitic limestone, DS (2.3 AUE), and CS (1 AUE), respectively. In DS, animals were placed and removed from the plots depending on the height of the pasture (entry >= 10 cm; removal <= 5 cm). Throughout the pasture's vegetative cycle, several measurements of pasture height and cut were carried out. From the beginning of March to the beginning of June, animal behavior was observed (animals' activity grazing and location) by trained observers through binoculars on six dates. The results show the following: (i) the application of dolomitic limestone combined with CS provided higher values of pasture height; (ii) there were no significant differences in pasture quality between treatments; (iii) DS led to 50% more sheep grazing days that CS; (iv) there were no significant differences in soil compaction between CS and DS; and (v) the stocking methods and the application of dolomitic limestone did not seem to change the grazing pattern between treatments. This study constitutes a basis to support more informed decisions by agricultural managers and may also contribute to maintaining balance in the Montado ecosystem, as well as increasing the efficiency of livestock production systems based on rainfed pastures.

AB  - Simple Summary: Yaks are a major economic source for people in the Tibetan Plateau region. Yaks are rich in nutrients, but their low fat content is not conducive to the large-scale promotion of yak meat, so the study of the mechanism of yak lipid deposition is beneficial to the marketing of yak meat. In this paper, the results of transcriptome sequencing analysis of yak liver showed that it could be determined that the expression levels of genes associated with partial lipid deposition were significantly up-regulated during yak fattening. In addition, this study found that the tenderness of yak meat improved during this process. Fattening significantly affects fat deposition in yaks, which may be realized through its effects on lipid metabolic pathways. Therefore, studying the mechanism of lipid deposition in yaks and fattening yaks will improve the quality of yak meat. Yak meat is nutritionally superior to beef cattle but has a low fat content and is slow-growing. The liver plays a crucial role in lipid metabolism, and in order to determine whether different feeding modes affect lipid metabolism in yaks and how it is regulated, we employed RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) technology to analyze the genome-wide differential gene expression in the liver of yaks maintained under different raising systems. A total of 1663 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified (| log2FC | >= 0 and p-value <= 0.05), including 698 down-regulated and 965 up-regulated genes. According to gene ontology (GO) and KEGG enrichment analyses, these DEGs were significantly enriched in 13 GO terms and 26 pathways (p < 0.05). Some DEGs were enriched in fatty acid degradation, PPAR, PI3K-Akt, and ECM receptor pathways, which are associated with lipid metabolism. A total of 16 genes are well known to be related to lipid metabolism (e.g., APOA1, FABP1, EHHADH, FADS2, SLC27A5, ACADM, CPT1B, ACOX2, HMGCS2, PLIN5, ACAA1, IGF1, FGFR4, ALDH9A1, ECHS1, LAMA2). A total of 11 of the above genes were significantly enriched in the PPAR signaling pathway. The reliability of the transcriptomic data was verified using qRT-PCR. Our findings provide new insights into the mechanisms regulating yak meat quality. It shows that fattening improves the expression of genes that regulate lipid deposition in yaks and enhances meat quality. This finding will contribute to a better understanding of the various factors that determine yak meat quality and help develop strategies to improve yield and quality.

AB  - Prosocial behaviours (providing benefits to a recipient with or without cost for the donor) have been found to be highly influenced by sex and by hierarchy. Rodents, in particular, are good model for studying prosocial responses, as they were found to exhibit intentional prosocial behaviours to reward a conspecific, and are very sensitive to reciprocity. In our study, we conducted a Prosocial Choice Test (PCT) in which four capybaras (Hydrochoerus hydrochaeris) living in a social group could choose between three tokens: choosing the prosocial token rewarded simultaneously the subject and a recipient, while choosing the selfish token only rewarded the subject; and choosing the null token provided no reward to anyone. Dominance within each dyad was also studied, both before and during the PCT experiment. Our results showed an influence of hierarchy: subjects were more prosocial towards the recipient when it was a subordinate than when it was a dominant individual. These results could be interpreted as a desire of strengthening a hierarchical rank regarding the subordinate, of punishing aggressive conspecifics (usually the subject's direct dominant), and of weakening dominant individuals in order to modify the pre-existing hierarchy. Additionally, our results highlighted a direct reciprocity phenomenon, a subject being more likely to be prosocial towards a prosocial recipient. All these findings suggest that prosociality could be well developed in other taxa than Primates and that, in long enough PCT experiments, subtle rules could influence individual prosocial strategies.

AB  - Simple Summary Given the fact that sheep serve as an increased meat product consumption in China, as well as a suitable model for fat deposition, their digestive tract microbiota has drawn growing attention. Our study depicted the gut microbiota community composition and diversity of sheep with varied genotypes but shared geography, with different sampling intestinal sites and probiotics supplementation time. The results indicated the great difference of the gut microbiota in samples from different sheep breeds, various intestinal sites, and different probiotics feeding times. Additionally, all results implied the dominance of the host factor in shaping unique microbiota under a certain environment, the greatest similarity of colonic and fecal microbiota, and the oral probiotic effectiveness for a given period of time for sheep. Three sampling strategies with a 16s rRNA high-throughput sequencing and gene expression assay (by RT-PCR) were designed, to better understand the host and probiotics effect on gut microbiota in sheep. Sampling: (1) colon contents and back-fat tissues from small-tailed Han sheep (SHS), big-tailed Hulun Buir sheep (BHBS), and short-tailed Steppe sheep (SHBS) (n = 12, 14, 12); (2) jejunum, cecum and colon contents, and feces from Tan sheep (TS, n = 6); (3) feces from TS at 4 time points (nonfeeding, 30 and 60 feeding days, and stop feeding 30 days) with probiotics supplementation (n = 7). The results indicated SHS had the highest Firmicutes abundance, the thinnest back-fat, and the lowest expression of C/EBP beta, C/EBP delta, ATGL, CFD, and SREBP1. Some bacteria orders and families could be potential biomarkers for sheep breeds with a distinct distribution of bacterial abundance, implying the host genotype is predominant in shaping unique microbiota under a shared environment. The microbiota diversity and Bifidobacterial populations significantly changed after 60 days of feeding but restored to its initial state, with mostly colonies, after 30 days ceased. The microbiota composition was greatly different between the small and large intestines, but somewhat different between the large intestine and feces; feces may be reliable for studying large intestinal microbiota in ruminants.

AB  - Bushmeat consumption and trade plays a relevant role in many tropical countries as a source of protein and income for rural populations. In Madagascar, rural populations depend heavily on natural resources and wildlife as source of income and protein. The bushpig (Potamochoerus larvatus) is the largest mammal available in the island and regularly hunted. However, little is known about the importance and characteristics of this activity and its implication as a potential source of pathogens for both humans and domestic animals. A cross-sectional study was conducted in 2014-2015 in five different regions of rural Madagascar suspected to have significant bushpig populations to (i) quantify and characterize the importance of bushpig hunting, (ii) assess the socioeconomic impact of bushpig trade, (iii) evaluate the potential pathogen transmission between bushpigs, domestic pigs and humans. A total of 77 hunters, 10 butchers and 95 pig farmers were individually interviewed. Hunting seasonality and the perception of local hunters with regards to the dynamics of bushpig populations in the last decade differed between the tropical dry and tropical sub-arid climatic zones. The top reason for hunting bushpigs was crop protection but personal consumption and selling of meat were also common. Hunting efficacy was largely dependent on the technique used. Snares and traps, the most widely used techniques, allowed the majority of hunters to catch from one to 10 bushpigs per year. Limited commercial bushpig trade was observed with only 0.8 bushpig sold in average per year and per hunter, representing a 16 USD income. The average price per kilo sold was USD 0.8 and the average profit received by each butcher/collector after the sale of a carcass was USD 11.9. No perception of disease risks nor precautions were taken to prevent potential pathogen transmission from bushpig to humans or pigs. Most of the hunters (68%) indicated that they had never seen a diseased bushpig. Bushpig hunting in our study areas in Madagascar was basically a small-scale subsistence hunting, very different from commercial bushmeat hunting described in areas of Central Africa or the Amazon Basin. More research is needed to verify the sustainability of bushpig hunting and its potential role in terms of reducing pressure on other endemic wildlife species and transmitting pathogens to humans and pigs.

AB  - As an exotic, generalist leafroller the light brown apple moth (Epiphyas postvittana) has become established in coastal California where populations have been shown to experience strong negative density dependence from an unknown cause. This study was conducted to determine whether plant secondary metabolites could be a potential source of the density dependence. Experimental observations were focused on two of its commonly used host plants (ribwort plantain and Japanese cheesewood) to test for detrimental effects of secondary metabolites on larval performance under laboratory conditions. A plant defense induction assay was used to test for density-dependent responses of the two host plants to prior larval feeding damage, and a leaf disk assay was used to quantify the impact of increased concentrations of selected groups of chemical defenses (iridoid glycosides and polyphenols). Contrary to expectations, the results from these assays provided no evidence that E. postvittana either induced a sufficient plant response to impact larval performance, or that experimentally increased chemical defense concentrations affected larval performance. Consequently, the observed results suggest that the larvae of E. postvittana may have adaptations that inhibit induced responses in their host plants and/or that allow them to tolerate secondary defenses through detoxification and excretion. In conclusion, there is no evidence that induced plant defenses can account for the strong negative density dependence observed in the dynamics of E. postvittana populations in California and further research will be needed to identify the true cause of this density dependence.

AB  - Populations of green turtles (Chelonia mydas), a megaherbivore that consumes seagrasses via cultivation grazing, are recovering worldwide. Information on plant-mediated effects on herbivore foraging behavior is critical to understanding plant-herbivore interactions and sustainability of grazing as ecosystems continue to change. In a Caribbean seagrass ecosystem, we use stationary cameras and benthic surveys to evaluate the effects of seagrass morphology and leaf nitrogen content on green turtle grazing behavior. Thalassia testudinum leaf morphology has significant effects on forage intake (in milligrams of dry mass [DM] per minute) for green turtles, whereas leaf nitrogen content has no effect. Intake increases in grazed areas with shorter leaves and higher leaf biomass concentration (in milligrams of DM per cubic centimeter), indicating more efficient foraging under these conditions. Bite rate (in bites per minute) increases in grazed areas with short leaves, a result of reduced search time. Bite size (in milligrams of DM per bite) increases in grazed areas with short but dense canopies, because a turtle crops more shoots with each bite. Increased foraging efficiency and reduced search time in grazed areas with high biomass concentrations collectively maximize intake. Ingested leaves are shorter than the mean height of all available leaves in grazed areas, indicating herbivore selection for shorter leaves. Our estimate for daily intake is 86.1 g DM day(-1) 33-kg turtle(-1). Our study provides a novel contribution on the effects of plant-level cues on the grazing behavior of a marine megaherbivore, and how cultivation grazing behavior optimizes the green turtle foraging strategy by maximizing foraging efficiency and intake.

AB  - Asian elephants (Elephas maximus) are globally endangered, and their populations persist in several meta-populations within fragmented landscapes across their distribution. Developing landscape-level management plans for elephants requires reliable information on the pattern and determinants of their distribution across relevant spatial and temporal scales. The Brahmagiri-Nilgiri-Eastern Ghats Landscape (Nilgiri landscape) of peninsular India supports the largest breeding population of Asian elephants globally. The Wayanad Plateau, a wet forest tract in the dry forest-dominated Nilgiri landscape, witnessed extensive forest fragmentation recently and evolved as a forest-agriculture matrix. We predicted that habitat use by elephants in the Wayanad Plateau would be high during summer because of the availability of numerous perennial streams and associated swamps that retain water and soil moisture for plant growth over the dry season. We also hypothesized that elephants would use areas with greater forest cover that are removed from human settlements. We used an occupancy-based approach that accounts for detection probability to understand factors influencing habitat use by elephants in summer (low rainfall, high temperature) and post-monsoon (largely rainless winter conditions but with abundant forage and water) in 2019 and 2020. As expected, the intensity of habitat use was higher during the summer than during the post-monsoon season. Elephants used habitats near perennial water sources and with greater forest cover, avoiding areas with high human disturbances. We emphasize the importance of areas that provide key resources for elephants during resource scarcity and the need to prevent habitat degradation for long-term persistence of elephants and mitigation of human-elephant conflict.

AB  - The rapid diversification of notothenioid fishes in Antarctic waters is a prime example of the process of adaptive radiation. Within around 10 million years, Antarctic notothenioids have diversified into over 100 species with a broad range of lifestyles and ecological adaptations. However, the exact number of species within this radiation has long been unclear. Particularly challenging is the taxonomy of the genus Channichthys, for which between one and nine species have been recognized by different authors. The putative species of this genus are known from a limited number of specimens, of which most were sampled decades ago. Here, we investigated the mitochondrial genomes of museum specimens representing the four species Unicorn Icefish (C. rhinoceratus), Red Icefish (C. rugosus), Sailfish Pike (C. velifer), and Charcoal Icefish (C. panticapaei), complemented by morphological analyses. All analyzed specimens were collected in the 1960s and 1970s and fixed in formaldehyde, and their DNA has been heavily degraded. Applying ancient-DNA protocols for DNA extraction and single-stranded library preparation, we were able to obtain sufficient endogenous DNA to reconstruct the mitochondrial genomes of one specimen per species. These mitochondrial genome sequences were nearly identical for the three specimens assigned to Unicorn Icefish, Red Icefish, and Sailfish Pike, while greater divergence was observed for the Charcoal Icefish specimens. We discuss possible explanations of the contrast between these molecular results and the recognizable morphological variation found among the four species, and recommend that at least the Charcoal Icefish be included in the list of valid notothenioid species.

AB  - African savannah elephants (Loxodonta africana) are key ecosystem engineers that migrate over large spatiotemporal scales foraging as they require copious amounts of food and water across habitable landscapes. Therefore a need to understand movement patterns arises in relation to vegetation type and landscape variability, moreso in forage depauparate arid areas such as Gonarezhou National Park (GNP) in Zimbabwe. The objectives of this study were to: (i) assess the performance of vegetation indices in modelling the distribution of African savannah elephants, and (ii) model future landscape variability in Gonarezhou National Park (GNP) in Zimbabwe. Maximum entropy (MaxEnt) algorithm was used to explore the relationship between vegetation indices and distribution of African savannah elephants in the GNP. The Soil Adjusted Vegetation Index (SAVI) performs better relative to other indices in modelling the distribution of African savannah elephants across all habitat types in the GNP. Cellular automata-Artificial Neural Network (CA-ANN) showed a significant future decrease (Kruskal Anova; p < 0.05) in landscape suitable to sustain large populations of African savannah elephants in the GNP by the year 2083. Future remote sensing reveals directional insights into the future consequences of current landscape management for African savannah elephant conservation which is a crucial in the sustainability of climate threatened arid protected areas such as the GNP.

AB  - This report is the first to provide information on the discovery of a female moose with an anomalous antler. The female moose with an anomalous single horn was captured in Yakutia on the Lena-Vilyuyskiy interfluve in the upper reaches of the Namana River (left tributary of the Lena) on 29 September 2024. The age of the female corresponds to a two-year old individual. An anomalous horn about 15 cm long in the female was formed on the right side of the head from the apophyses of the frontal bones. The horn is covered with thin velvety skin with short wool and it looks like the growing horns (antlers) of young moose in the phase of their spring-summer development. However, unlike young antlers with a non-horned soft structure, this anomalous antler was ossified.

AB  - The effect of Mo mining on soil-plant-animal ecosystem heavy metal accumulation and migration has not been well investigated. In this work, soil, native plants, and goat hair samples were collected from mining, urban, and rural areas near a Mo-mining area in Luanchuan, China and analyzed for Mo, Pb, Cd, Cu, Zn, Ni, and Mn concentrations. Molybdenum had the largest pollution indices (soil heavy metal concentration/background value) among all metals. Although mining area soil had greater concentrations of all seven metals as compared to urban and rural areas, significant differences were only found for Cd (mining, 2.54; urban, 1.59; and rural, 1.85 mg kg(-1)), Cu (73.4, 32.1, and 32.6 mg kg(-1)), and Mo (109, 33.6, and 16.6 mg kg(-1)). Setaria viridis had greater Mo concentrations in the mining area than the urban area, most plant samples had Mo concentrations >5 mg kg(-1), and mean plant Cu:Mo ratios were <4 in all three areas, both indicating potential Mo toxicity and Cu deficiency risks to herbivores. Goat hair Mo concentrations in both areas were greater, whereas the Cu:Mo ratios were lower than those found in the literature. Plants had greater bioconcentration factors (0.840-5.30) for soil Mo than other metals, whereas goat hair and grass Mo concentration ratios were <0.03, lower than most reported literature values. Results indicate Mo accumulation in soil, plants, and goat hair in the Mo-mining area; remediation measures may be needed to alleviate animal and potentially resident Mo stress.

AB  - Antimicrobial resistance constitutes a global challenge to public health. The common addition of Zn, Cu and other metals to animal feed and the widespread presence of metal ions in livestock and their receiving environments may be a factor that facilitates the proliferation of antimicrobial resistance via co-selection of antimicrobial resistance genes (ARGs) and metal resistance genes (MRGs). However, the extent of co-selection is not yet fully understood. In this study, we used a metagenomic approach to profile ARGs, MRGs and mobile genetic elements (MGEs) known to constitute potential ARG and MRG vectors of transmission, and we determined the concentration of metal ions to assess the interrelationships between the occurrence of ARGs, MRGs and metal concentrations in samples from pig farms in China. Samples analyzed included fresh pig feces, soils fertilized with treated slurry, and sediments from aquatic environments, where effluent from treated slurry was discharged. Resistance genes to tetracycline and zinc were the most commonly observed ARGs and MRGs for all three types of samples. Significant correlations were observed between the abundance of ARGs and MRGs, and between ARGs/MRGs and MGEs, and between metal and ARGs/MGEs as documented by Pearson's correlation analysis (r > 0.9, P < 0.001). Further network analysis revealed significant co-occurrence between specific ARGs and MRGs, between ARGs/MRGs and MGEs, and between specific metals (Zn, Cr, and Mn) and ARGs and MGEs. Collectively, our findings demonstrate a high level of co occurrence of antimicrobial and metal resistance genes in slurry from pig farms and their surrounding environments. The results suggest that metals added to pig feed might facilitate co-selection of ARGs and MGEs in the pig production environments, thereby resulting in a bigger pool of mobile ARGs.

AB  - For decades, researchers have employed sound to study the biology of wildlife, with the aim to better understand their ecology and behaviour. By utilizing on-animal recorders to capture audio from freely moving animals, scientists can decipher the vocalizations and glean insights into their behaviour and ecosystem dynamics through advanced signal processing. However, the laborious task of sorting through extensive audio recordings has been a major bottleneck. To expedite this process, researchers have turned to machine learning techniques, specifically neural networks, to streamline the analysis of data. Nevertheless, much of the existing research has focused predominantly on stationary recording devices, overlooking the potential benefits of employing on-animal recorders in conjunction with machine learning. To showcase the synergy of on-animal recorders and machine learning, we conducted a study at the Kutuharju research station in Kaamanen, Finland, where the vocalizations of rutting reindeer were recorded during their mating season. By attaching recorders to seven male reindeer during the rutting periods of 2019 and 2020, we trained convolutional neural networks to distinguish reindeer grunts with a 95% accuracy rate. This high level of accuracy allowed us to examine the reindeers' grunting behaviour, revealing patterns indicating that older, heavier males vocalized more compared to their younger, lighter counterparts. The success of this study underscores the potential of on-animal acoustic recorders coupled with machine learning techniques as powerful tools for wildlife research, hinting at their broader applications with further advancement and optimization.

AB  - This study uses Cu and Zn isotopic compositions as proxies of sources and metal transfers in the planktonic food webs from the Mediterranean Sea. Plankton was collected in spring 2019 in the deep chlorophyll maximum (DCM) along a North-South transect including coastal and offshore zones (MERITE-HIPPOCAMPE campaign). 865Cu and 866Zn were determined on four planktonic size fractions from 60 to 2000 mu m. Combined 865Cu and 866Zn with geochemical tracers (Ti, particulate organic phosphorus) showed that geogenic particles were ubiquitous with plankton assemblages. The 815N ecological tracer showed that planktonic food web was enriched in heavy isotopes of Cu and Zn in the higher trophic levels. 865Cu were correlated with picoplankton in the offshore zone, and with zooplankton in the southern coastal zone. Firmicutes bacteria were found correlated with 866Zn in northern and southern coastal zones suggesting decomposition of particulate matter at the DCM.

AB  - Blooms of toxigenic cyanobacteria pose a mounting risk to aquatic ecosystems. Relative to abiotic drivers of cyanobacteria success, biotic processes have received less attention. Mixotrophic nanoflagellates that combine heterotrophic ingestion of particulate prey with photoautotrophy are among the eukaryotes that can resist cyanotoxins. We used laboratory experiments in culture to integrate top-down (herbivory) and bottom-up (nitrogen and phosphorus limitation) controls on the growth and production of microcystin-LR, including biodegradation products, of Microcystis by Ochromonas (mixotroph) and Spumella (heterotroph). A notable reduction in the growth rate of toxic Microcystis was evident in co-culture with either Ochromonas or Spumella under P-limitation. Under P-limitation, the co-culture of toxic Microcystis with Ochromonas also led to a reduction in concentration of microcystin-LR (MC-LR and an increase in biodegradation products. Grazing rates up to 31 and 50 cell-1 day-1 on toxic Microcystis were recorded for Ochromonas and Spumella, respectively. The highest grazing rates by Ochromonas were observed on toxic Microcystis under N-limitation. Hence, it is likely that Ochromonas is an herbivore of toxic Microcystis under N-limitation and a competitor for nutrients under P-limitation. Collectively, these results suggest a role of eukaryotic nanoflagellates in decreasing the biomass and toxicity associated with cyanobacteria blooms that vary with nutrient availability.

AB  - Identification of the effect of anthropogenic threats on ecosystem is crucial. We used molecular tools and remote sensing to evaluate the population status of an isolated Asian elephant population in southwestern China in response to changes in habitat suitability between 1989 and 2019. A total of 22 unique genotypes were identified from 117 dung samples collected between March and June 2018 using microsatellite DNA analysis, including 13 males and 9 females. Based on the size of fecal boli, 1 animal was a juvenile, 9 were subadults, and 12 were adults, indicating that recruitment was limited. The effective population size was small (15.3) but there was no signature of a recent population bottleneck. We observed a low genetic diversity (H-e = 0.46 +/- 0.05) and a high level of inbreeding (F-is of 0.43 +/- 0.11), suggesting low population viability and high risk of extinction. In total, these elephants lost nearly two thirds (62%) of their habitat in 3 decades. The expansion of agriculture and rubber plantations followed by an increase in human settlements after 1989 increased the isolation of this population. We recommend that resettlement of 800 inhabitants of 2 villages and the abandonment of associated farmland and rubber plantations would make an additional 20 km(2) of suitable habitat available. This could allow a population increase of 14 elephants, possibly by translocating individuals from elsewhere in China. Our findings can be applied to the management and conservation of other fragmented populations in China or in other range countries of Asian elephants.

AB  - Facilitation of fear extinction is a desirable action for the drugs to treat fear-related diseases, such as posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). We previously reported that a selective agonist of the delta-opioid receptor (DOP), KNT-127, facilitates contextual fear extinction in mice. However, its site of action in the brain and the underlying molecular mechanism remains unknown. Here, we investigated brain regions and cellular signaling pathways that may mediate the action of KNT-127 on fear extinction. Twenty-four hours after the fear conditioning, mice were reexposed to the conditioning chamber for 6 min as extinction training (reexposure 1). KNT-127 was microinjected into either the basolateral nucleus of the amygdala (BLA), hippocampus (HPC), prelimbic (PL), or infralimbic (IL) subregions of the medial prefrontal cortex, 30 min before reexposure 1. Next day, mice were reexposed to the chamber for 6 min as memory testing (reexposure 2). KNT-127 that infused into the BLA and IL, but not HPC or PL, significantly reduced the freezing response in reexposure 2 compared with those of control. The effect of KNT-127 administered into the BLA and IL was antagonized by pretreatment with a selective DOP antagonist. Further, the effect of KNT-127 was abolished by local administration of MEK/ERK inhibitor into the BLA, and PI3K/Akt inhibitor into the IL, respectively. These results suggested that the effect of KNT-127 was mediated by MEK/ERK signaling in the BLA, PI3K/Akt signaling in the IL, and DOPs in both brain regions. Here, we propose that DOPs play a role in fear extinction via distinct signaling pathways in the BLA and IL.

AB  - BackgroundDespite the popularity of modern medicine, medicinal plants remain a cornerstone of treatment for numerous diseases, particularly among ethnic groups and tribal communities around the globe. Ethnomedicine offers advantages such as ease of use, convenience, and economic benefits. Medicinal plant knowledge within Bulang ethnic community of southwest China is a valuable complement to Chinese ethnomedicine systems. Accumulated medical knowledge is due to the extensive length of occupation by Bulang People, considered the earliest inhabitants of Xishuangbanna; this has resulted in the development of various traditional treatment methods with local characteristics and unique curative effects. Therefore, there is exceeding value in exploring the medical knowledge of Bulang.MethodsA total of 175 local informants participated in the interviews and distribution of questionnaires in 10 Bulang villages in Menghai County, Xishuangbanna Prefecture, Yunnan Province, China. We documented the community of Bulang's use of medicinal herbs, and we used both the informant consensus factor (ICF) and use value (UV) methodologies to analyze the data. Furthermore, we conducted a comparative study to explore the potential of Bulang traditional medicine by comparing it to traditional Dai medicine.ResultsThe study recorded 60 medicinal plant species belonging to 41 families and 59 genera, including 22 species of herb, 22 species of shrub, nine species of trees, and seven species of liana. Araceae, Compositae, Lamiaceae and Leguminosae were found to have the highest number of species. The affordability and cultural heritage of Bulang medicine make it advantageous, Investigated Informants report that increased usage of Western medicine (88%), less availability of herbal medicine (95.43%), and the reduction in medicinal plant resources (80.57%) pose significant threats to Bulang medicine. All Bulang medicinal plants are naturally grown, with only 22 per cent being cultivated. Camellia sinensis (0.94) and Zingiber officinale (0.89) showed the highest UV values, while the function of Phyllanthus emblica L. and Houttuynia cordata Thunb. were also noted. The ICF revealed digestive system related diseases were the most commonly treated, with conditions of the motor system using the highest number of plant species. Finally, a comparison with traditional Dai medicine determined that 22 plants (36.67%) of the 60 surveyed had higher medicinal value in Bulang medicine.ConclusionBulang communities primarily source medicinal plants from the wild. Should environmental damage lead to the extinction of these medicinal plants, it could result in a shift toward modern Western medicine as a preferred medical treatment. Bulang ethnomedicine is a vital supplement to China's traditional medicine, particularly aspects of ethnic medicine relevant to daily life. Future research should emphasize inter-ethnic medical studies to reveal the untapped potential of medicinal plants.

AB  - In Mediterranean rocky shores, the black sea urchin Arbacia lixula is often associated with communities dominated by encrusting corallines, devoid of fleshy algae. While it is commonly known as a diurnal herbivore, this species also migrates at night from hidden to more exposed habitats. Here, we provide the first experimental evidence of an adjustment to a predominant nocturnal behaviour in a population of A. lixula. Sea urchin densities changed from nearly zero during daytime to more than 16 urchinsm(-2) at night in treatment plots where the sea urchins were removed. We suggest that the observed behaviour was triggered by our experimental manipulations and was a response to the presence of dead conspecifics and small predatory fishes attracted by the urchin culling. Further research is needed to assess whether our findings can be generalised to the behaviour of A. lixula in areas where sea urchins are under strong pressure from diurnal predators. In these cases, it is important to perform sea urchin density counts at night to avoid misleading assessments about the herbivore pressure in a littoral area.

AB  - Long-term monitoring is an important component of effective wildlife conservation. However, many methods for estimating density are too costly or difficult to implement over large spatial and temporal extents. Recently developed spatial mark-resight (SMR) models are increasingly being applied as a cost-effective method to estimate density when data include detections of both marked and unmarked individuals. We developed a generalized SMR model that can accommodate long-term camera data and auxiliary telemetry data for improved spatiotemporal inference in monitoring efforts. The model can be applied in two stages, with detection parameters estimated in the first stage using telemetry data and camera detections of instrumented individuals. Density is estimated in the second stage using camera data, with all individuals treated as unmarked. Serial correlation in detection and density parameters is accounted for using time-series models. The two-stage approach reduces computational demands and facilitates the application to large data sets from long-term monitoring initiatives. We applied the model to 3 years (2015-2017) of white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) data collected in three study areas of the Big Cypress Basin, Florida, USA. In total, 59 females marked with ear tags and fitted with GPS-telemetry collars were detected along with unmarked females on 180 remote cameras. Most of the temporal variation in density was driven by seasonal fluctuations, but one study area exhibited a slight population decline during the monitoring period. Modern technologies such as camera traps provide novel possibilities for long-term monitoring, but the resulting massive data sets, which are subject to unique sources of observation error, have posed analytical challenges. The two-stage spatial mark-resight framework provides a solution with lower computational demands than joint SMR models, allowing for easier implementation in practice. In addition, after detection parameters have been estimated, the model may be used to estimate density even if no synchronous auxiliary information on marked individuals is available, which is often the case in long-term monitoring.

AB  - Membrane-covered composting and hyperthermophilic composting technologies have been proven to be effec-tive and have been widely applied as organic waste recycling strategies. However, attempts to combine the two technologies have not been reported. Thus, this study constructed a novel semi-permeable membrane covered hyperthermophilic composting (smHTC) and investigated its potential in CH4 and N2O mitigation. Results showed that smHTC reduced the average emission flux of CH4 and N2O in the thermophilic phase of composting by 79% and 45%, compared to conventional thermophilic composting (cTC). The abiotic mechanism of CH4 and N2O emission mitigation could be attributed to the double barrier of semi-permeable membrane and sub -membrane water layer, which made it difficult for CH4 and N2O to escape, resulting in less CH4 and N2O being released into environment. As for the biotic mechanism, smHTC could suppress the abundance of mcrA gene and methanogens participated in methanogenic process through the high-temperature, which also contribute to the reduction of CH4 emissions. smHTC also could reduce the abundance of denitrification-related functional genes and related microbial taxa, this also facilitated the N2O mitigation. Overall, this work demonstrated the advantages of smHTC in greenhouse gas mitigation and could be a promising recycling strategy for organic waste.

AB  - Purpose Theileriosis and babesiosis, two tick-borne haemoparasitic diseases (TBHDs) of ruminants, are caused by protozoan parasites of the genus Theileria and Babesia, respectively. Among them, some species are considered to be highly pathogenic causing serious economic losses to livestock holders especially in tropic and subtropic regions. Local and/or general control measures are needed to be applied to reduce economic impact of TBHDs. Prevalence studies are essential for the implementation and/or design of effective prevention and control measures based on true epidemiological data. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the presence, prevalence and possible cross infections of Theileria/Babesia species between sheep, goat and cattle herds in Burdur province in Turkey. Methods A total of 964 blood samples were collected from sheep (n = 330), goat (n = 300) and cattle (n = 334) from five different districts of Burdur province. The samples were investigated for ovine and bovine Theileria/Babesia species using reverse line blot (RLB) hybridization assay. Results In small ruminants, T. ovis was the most abundant Theileria species detected in sheep with a rate of 79.69%. Among Babesia species, B. ovis and B. crassa were detected only in blood of goats (0.66%) and sheep (1.12%) as single and mixed infections, respectively. In cattle, T. annulata, B. bovis, Babesia spp. were detected in rates of 0.59%, 3.29%, 3.59%, respectively. Conclusion Obtained results clearly indicated that no cross infections with Theileria/Babesia species occurred in small ruminant and cattle herds that use the same grazing area.

AB  - The Wadden Sea is the world's largest intertidal ecosystem and provides vital food resources for a large number of migratory bird and fish species during seasonal stopovers. Previous work using bulk stable isotope analysis of carbon found that microphytobenthos (MPB) was the dominant resource fueling the food web with particulate organic matter making up the remainder. However, this work was unable to account for the trophic structure of the food web or the considerable increase in delta N-15 values of bulk tissue throughout the benthic food web occurring in the Eastern regions of the Dutch Wadden Sea. Here, we combine compound-specific and bulk analytical stable isotope techniques to further resolve the trophic structure and resource use throughout the benthic food web in the Wadden Sea. Analysis of delta N-15 for trophic and source amino acids allowed for better identification of trophic relationships due to the integration of underlying variation in the nitrogen resources supporting the food web. Baseline-integrated trophic position estimates using glutamic acid (Glu) and phenylalanine (Phe) allow for disentanglement of baseline variations in underlying delta N-15 sources supporting the ecosystem and trophic shifts resulting from changes in ecological relationships. Through this application, we further confirmed the dominant ecosystem support by MPB-derived resources, although to a lesser extent than previously estimated. In addition to phytoplankton-derived particulate, organic matter and MPB supported from nutrients from the overlying water column there appears to be an additional resource supporting the benthic community. From the stable isotope mixing models, a subset of species appears to focus on MPB supported off recycled (porewater) N and/or detrital organic matter mainly driven by increased phenylalanine delta N-15 values. This additional resource within MPB may play a role in subsidizing the exceptional benthic productivity observed within the Wadden Sea ecosystem and reflect division in MPB support along green (herbivory) and brown (recycled/detrital) food web pathways.

AB  - Incense-cedar (Calocedrus decurrens (Torr.) Florin) is a drought-resistant conifer species native to the western United States that is host to few lethal pests and pathogens. Quantifying its survival and growth after planting is important for defining its potential place within future silvicultural prescriptions. Our objectives are to understand the impact of (1) spacing and herbivore protectors on seedling survival, (2) spacing on growing space occupancy after 19 years, and (3) spacing on individual tree and stand characteristics. The use of herbivory protection had a positive influence on seedling survival (96% survival with protection; 92% survival without protection). After 19 years, including drought conditions, 89% of planting spots were occupied by a live tree. Mean live crown ratios occurred across a narrow range, from 89.4 to 97.8, indicating a lack of differentiation at this phase of stand development. Wider spacing treatments resulted in the expected trade-off of larger individual tree sizes but lower stand-level volume. Because of persistent live crowns, thinning and pruning are potential strategies not only to reduce fire risk but also to improve timber quality. Our results also support the contention that incense-cedar is a species well-adapted to the anticipated future climate.

AB  - This study describes the microhabitat use, daily activity pattern, and diet of Liolaemus etheridgei Laurent, 1998 in the El Simbral and Tuctumpaya Polylepis forests in Arequipa, Peru. El Simbral is a fragmented forest, whereas Tuctumpaya is unfragmented. Our results reveal that L. etheridgei shows no positive selection for any of the microhabitats we identified in Polylepis forests; on the contrary, it selects negatively against Polylepis trees and nonthorny bushes. The daily activity patterns indicate a bimodal pattern with peaks at 9:00-10:59 and 13:00-13:59 h. The diet of L. etheridgei consists mainly of plant material, and the most important animal prey category is Lygaeidae: Hemiptera, which is selected for positively. In particular, microhabitat selection varied for nonthorny bushes, which were selected negatively in the Tuctumpaya population but neither positively nor negatively in the El Simbral population. According to the proportions of plant material found, the L. etheridgei from El Simbral were found to be omnivorous, whereas the Tuctumpaya population was herbivorous. However, the percentage of plant material consumed in the El Simbral population was close to the critical value for herbivory-omnivory. We conclude that the three ecological aspects of L. etheridgei studied here are virtually identical in El Simbral and Tuctumpaya; therefore, this species is not affected significantly by the current fragmentation of forest.

AB  - Interspecific competition determines the invasive capability of alien plants. Phytolacca americana, one of the most destructive invasive plants in China, was first discovered and recorded in China in 1935. Since its arrival, the rapid expansion of the species has driven out a native congener, Phytolacca acinosa. In this study, we assessed the competitive interaction of the invasive P. americana the native P. acinosa in a pot experiment at Yunnan University. Our results indicate that P. americana severely inhibits the growth and reproduction of P. acinosa. Furthermore, P. americana demonstrated a superior resistance against both insect predation and bacterial infection. We suggest that this improved tolerance against herbivory and potentional pathogen damage may be a cornerstone to the invasive success of Phytolacca americana.

AB  - This study analyzed 9871 cases of wild boar damage recorded over more than 20 years using a consistent methodology in a 5000-hectare area with minimal changes in crop structure. This allowed for a reliable assessment of seasonal damage dynamics. Wild boar exhibited seasonal feeding preferences: grasses in spring, cereals in summer, legumes in early autumn, and root crops in late autumn. A bimodal pattern of damage was identified, comprising three types. The rare and severe pattern occurred in spring when the wild boar population at its lowest size caused infrequent but highly damaging events, mainly in meadows. The frequent and weak pattern appeared in late summer and autumn when wild boar numbers were two to three times higher, leading to frequent but less severe damage. The indirect pattern was linked to lower field attractiveness in summer and winter. The high symmetry of damage observed suggests that an effective wild boar management strategy should account for not only damage reduction but also sanitary risks, such as ASF.

AB  - Livestock guardian dogs (LGDs) are increasingly used to protect livestock from predators, but their effects on the distribution and behaviour of wild predators are mostly unknown. A key question is whether LGDs exclude predators from grazing land, or if predators continue to use areas with LGDs but modify their behaviour in ways that reduce impacts on livestock. We studied effects of LGDs (Maremma sheepdogs) on distribution and behaviour of red foxes Vulpes vulpes in north-eastern Victoria, Australia. We mapped the activity of LGDs across the study areas using GPS tracking and measured fox activity using remote cameras. We also measured risk-sensitive foraging in foxes to test if they reduced feeding time at sites regularly used by LGDs. Foxes occurred throughout areas occupied by LGDs, but their probability of detection was negatively related to the probability of LGD presence. Foxes extracted fewer food items from experimental food stations in proportion to the intensity of local activity of LGDs. This indicates that, though foxes overlapped with LGDs, they responded to risk of encountering LGDs by allocating less time to foraging. While LGDs do not necessarily exclude wild predators from areas used for livestock production, they can have strong effects on predator behaviour. Reduction in time allocated to foraging in areas regularly used by LGDs could lead to suppression of hunting behaviour and therefore a reduction in attacks on livestock. The flexible response of predators to LGDs should facilitate coexistence of wild predators with livestock farming, by allowing predators to continue to use areas occupied by livestock while still preventing attacks on those livestock. Our results therefore strengthen the case for use of LGDs in the conservation of predators threatened by conflict with farming. Suppression of hunting behaviour should also mean that prey species experience reduced rates of predation on farmland with LGDs. This effect could be valuable for conservation of threatened species of prey.
   The probability of detecting foxes is negatively related to the probability of guardian dog (LGD) presence, and foxes allocate less time to foraging in response to the risk of encountering LGDs. By affecting predator behaviour, LGDs can facilitate the coexistence of predators and livestock.image

AB  - Intensive clear-cutting of natural forests and conversion to monoculture plantations are ongoing worldwide, leading to the degradation of soil quality and microbial functions. Here, we compared soil quality index (SQI) and fungal communities in a natural forest (Forest) and four 5-year-old monoculture plantations, including Camellia oleifera (Oil), Amygdalus persica (Peach), Myrica rubra (Berry) and Cunninghamia lanceolate (Fir) in a subtropical region of China. After conversion, soil pH in the plantations rose up to 0.31, but organic carbon and total nitrogen contents, sucrase, acid protease, glutaminase, acid and alkaline phosphatase activities decreased by 83%, 59%, 40%, 64%, 66%, 94% and 59%, respectively. Correspondingly, the SQI dropped by 65%. Highthroughput sequencing of the ITS1 region demonstrated an increase in alpha-diversity and a striking difference in beta-diversity of fungi following conversion. Changes in the dominant fungal taxa following forest conversion to plantations were interpreted by r- and K-selection of life strategies. Conversion increased the fungal groups with r-strategies, such as Ascomycota and Zygomycota, but decreased the fungal groups with K-strategies, such as Basidiomycota. Genera affiliated to those phyla including Pseudophialophora, Rhytisma increased, but Russula decreased. Redundancy analysis and structural equation modeling indicated that the diversity and composition of fungal communities changed with soil degradation, which was mainly driven by increased pH and total phosphorus content, but decreased C/N ratio and C and N related enzymes activities. Overall, the conversion of forest to monoculture plantations decreased soil quality and the abundance of K-strategists, retarded the decomposition of persistent organic matter, but boosted the prevalence of r-strategists in a more diverse fungal community.

AB  - Boreal ecosystems are experiencing extensive changes because of anthropogenic stressors such as climate change. Information on density of species at multiple sites is vital to understand and manage the impact of these changing conditions on boreal forest communities. Yet, for most boreal forest species, including the vast majority of mammals, obtaining reliable estimates of density is exceedingly difficult. Recently developed methods for the estimation of densities of unmarked animals from camera-trapping data could help to overcome this hurdle, but have not yet been empirically validated in many ecosystems. Here, we assess the ability of camera traps to estimate density of snowshoe hare (Lepus americanus) using three different models: the random encounter model (REM), the random encounter and staying time (REST) model, and the time-to-event (TTE) model. We additionally evaluate the relationship between hare density and two simple indices based on camera detection rate and pellet counts. Across 13 sites in North Central Washington, United States, we compared live-trapping spatially explicit capture-recapture (SECR) estimates of density to the three camera-based density models and the two indices. We found that the camera-based models, in particular the REM and REST models, performed well in estimating densities consistent with the live-trapping data, with an average difference in density from SECR-based estimates of only 0.12 and 0.13 hares/ha, respectively. Both indices also had strong predictive relationships with hare density. Our results show that, owing to their noninvasive nature and relative ease of application, camera-based methods could be used to obtain hare density estimates at much larger spatiotemporal scales than have been applied to date. Given the keystone role of hare in boreal ecosystems, and emerging evidence of hare range retraction, the ability to estimate densities across many sites is a key tool for hare conservation and management. Moreover, our results are highly encouraging for the application of camera-based methods to obtain density estimates on a wide variety of boreal forest species, though additional validation will be necessary.

AB  - The iconic giant clams are known for its multifaceted importance throughout the Indo-Pacific -for functional, ecological, or cultural purposes. In Malaysia, habitat destruction and illegal poaching were main reasons behind the declining populations of giant clams. As previous surveys date back to 1990 s, an update on the status of giant clam populations in Malaysia is overdue. Using the extensive monitoring data from Reef Check Malaysia, we analysed and provided an assessment of population trends of giant clams between 2007 and 2021 in Malaysia. This study showed a decline in giant clam population in the east coast Peninsula and Sabah, while their abundances have always been low in the west coast Peninsula and Sarawak. In the east coast Peninsula, Tridacna maxima and T. crocea were most common (2.7 +/- 7.3 and 1.4 +/- 7.6 clams per 100 m2, respectively), followed by T. squamosa (0.7 +/- 1.4 clams per 100 m2), and Hippopus hippopus (0.3 +/- 2.5 clams per 100 m2). The boring species, T. maxima and T. crocea, typically displayed highly aggregated populations, reaching densities of 41.5 and 70 clams per 100 m2, where a reciprocal abundance shift between both species was observed between northern and southern sites of east coast Peninsula. The demography of T. maxima and T. crocea is either positively skewed or normally distributed, indicating abundant recruits that correspond to their higher densities. In contrast, T. squamosa showed a negative skew, suggesting poor recruitment rates. Findings here underscore the need to tailor conservation strategies for respective giant clam species in Malaysia. Proposed initiatives include establishing conservation zones in key areas like Perhentian, Lang Tengah, Redang, and Tioman Islands, which have significant T. maxima and T. crocea recruit populations. Also, targeted restocking efforts are necessary for T. squamosa and H. hippopus to ensure long-term viability of populations.

AB  - Rapid growth of human populations in sub-Saharan Africa has led to a simultaneous increase in the number of livestock, often leading to conflicts of use with wildlife in protected areas. To minimize these conflicts, and to meet both communities' and conservation goals, it is therefore essential to monitor livestock density and their land use. This is usually done by conducting aerial surveys during which aerial images are taken for later counting. Although this approach appears to reduce counting bias, the manual processing of images is time-consuming. The use of dense convolutional neural networks (CNNs) has emerged as a very promising avenue for processing such datasets. However, typical CNN architectures have detection limits for dense herds and close -by animals. To tackle this problem, this study introduces a new point-based CNN architecture, HerdNet, inspired by crowd counting. It was optimized on challenging oblique aerial images containing herds of camels (Camelus dromedarius), donkeys (Equus asinus), sheep (Ovis aries) and goats (Capra hircus), acquired over heterogeneous arid landscapes of the Ennedi reserve (Chad). This approach was compared to an anchor-based architecture, Faster-RCNN, and a density-based, adapted version of DLA-34 that is typically used in crowd counting. HerdNet achieved a global F1 score of 73.6 % on 24 megapixels images, with a root mean square error of 9.8 animals and at a processing speed of 3.6 s, outperforming the two baselines in terms of localization, counting and speed. It showed better proximity-invariant precision while maintaining equivalent recall to that of Faster-RCNN, thus demonstrating that it is the most suitable approach for detecting and counting large mammals at close range. The only limitation of HerdNet was the slightly weaker identification of species, with an average confusion rate approximately 4 % higher than that of Faster-RCNN. This study provides a new CNN architecture that could be used to develop an automatic livestock counting tool in aerial imagery. The reduced image analysis time could motivate more frequent flights, thus allowing a much finer monitoring of livestock and their land use.

AB  - More sustainable pastoral livestock production systems are required to face the challenge of reconciling agricultural production and environmental impact. Although the need for more holistic approaches, such as systems thinking and design theory, is acknowledged, systemic research applying those theories to create healthier systems remains underexplored. A multiple steps holistic approach involving modelling, geographic information systems, and decision-making analysis was used to design, assess, and contrast alternative scenarios that represent distinct grazing management to the current grazing management of a high-country station in New Zealand used as a case study to enhance grassland health. Three alternative scenarios were created, and five main parameters used to assess grassland health were obtained from the evaluation of the designed scenarios. From all the parameters, soil erosion control and increased production were ranked as the most and least important, respectively, to be considered in the design process. A multi-criteria evaluation defined that the best-compromise scenario to enhance grassland health is the scenario with lower soil erosion, as a result of applying adaptive and flexible management at the paddock level, the lower total emission of greenhouse gases (only sheep herd grazing), and greater profitability (due to production costs reduction, as cattle were removed from the station), compared to the 'status quo'. Our design methodology produced a variety of alternatives that enhanced the health of grasslands in different parameters while still maintaining or increasing profitability. The use of multicriteria evaluation facilitated the decision of the most contextualised and best-compromise scenario for New Zealand high country grasslands.

AB  - High altitude environments challenge small mammals with persistent low ambient temperatures that require high rates of aerobic heat production in face of low O-2 availability. An important component of thermogenic capacity in rodents is non-shivering thermogenesis (NST) mediated by uncoupled mitochondrial respiration in brown adipose tissue (BAT). NST is plastic, and capacity for heat production increases with cold acclimation. However, in lowland native rodents, hypoxia inhibits NST in BAT. We hypothesize that highland deer mice (Peromyscus maniculatus) overcome the hypoxic inhibition of NST through changes in BAT mitochondrial function. We tested this hypothesis using lab born and raised highland and lowland deer mice, and a lowland congeneric (Peromyscus leucopus), acclimated to either warm normoxia (25 degrees C, 760 mmHg) or cold hypoxia (5 degrees C, 430 mmHg). We determined the effects of acclimation and ancestry on whole-animal rates of NST, the mass of interscapular BAT (iBAT), and uncoupling protein (UCP)-1 protein expression. To identify changes in mitochondrial function, we conducted high-resolution respirometry on isolated iBAT mitochondria using substrates and inhibitors targeted to UCP-1. We found that rates of NST increased with cold hypoxia acclimation but only in highland deer mice. There was no effect of cold hypoxia acclimation on iBAT mass in any group, but highland deer mice showed increases in UCP-1 expression and UCP-1-stimulated mitochondrial respiration in response to these stressors. Our results suggest that highland deer mice have evolved to increase the capacity for NST in response to chronic cold hypoxia, driven in part by changes in iBAT mitochondrial function.

AB  - Borrelia species are spirochetes transmitted by ticks that are important in human and animals. In most countries, there is still no molecular epidemiology of borreliosis in ruminants. This study was aimed to evaluate the existence of Borrelia spp. DNA in the blood samples of small ruminants using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method in West Azerbaijan Province, Iran. To detect Borrelia spp. DNA, about 1,018 ruminants (456 goats and 562 sheep) blood samples were examined from different bioclimatic regions in West Azerbaijan province, Iran. The DNA extracting and PCR were conducted. In sheep, the following prevalence rates were respectively obtained for the 16S rRNA, 5S - 23S rRNA and ospA genes: 3.55% (20/562), 2.13% (12/562) and 0.88% (5/562). And so, the prevalence rates of the genes in goats were 0.87% (4/456) for 5S - 23S rRNA gene, 1.75% (8/456) for 16S rRNA gene and 0.65% (3/456) for ospA gene. The prevalence of Borrelia spp. was significantly different in small ruminants based on the farms and localities. The sheep and goats in humid areas (north of West Azerbaijan) were infected statistically more than those in sub -humid areas (south of West Azerbaijan). It is demonstrated that host species like sheep and goats may have a key role in natural Lyme disease cycles and other borreliosis diseases in Iran. (c) 2024 Urmia University. All rights reserved.

AB  - Temperate woodlands are amongst the most threatened ecosystems in Australia because the land on which they occur is highly suited to agriculture. Two hundred years of habitat loss and fragmentation in the Midlands agricultural region in Tasmania have led to widespread declines in native vertebrates and landscapes with populations of predators including feral Cat (Felis catus) and the native-invasive Noisy Miner (Manorina melanocephala). Ecologists at the University of Tasmania co-designed mechanistic animal-centric research on mammals and birds in the Midlands to inform vegetation restoration carried out by Greening Australia that would support the recovery of wildlife species. We used species-appropriate technologies to assess the decisions made by individual animals to find food and shelter and to disperse across this fragmented landscape, and linked these, together with patterns of occupancy, across multiple spatial and temporal scales. We focussed on a native (Spotted-tailed Quoll, Dasyurus maculatus) and an invasive (feral Cat, Felis catus) carnivore, a woodland-specialist herbivore (Eastern Bettong, Bettongia gaimardi) and woodland birds including the native-invasive Noisy Miner. Our results, which show intense predatory and competitive pressure of cats and populations of Noisy Miner on native fauna, highlight how grounding restoration in the context of ecological interactions is essential to success in managing the impacts of invasive species in restored landscapes. Successful restoration will require innovative approaches in plantings and field experimentation with artificial refuges, to reduce habitat suitability for the Noisy Miner and cats and provide refuges for native mammals and birds to live in the landscape where cats also occur. Our results emphasise the significance of structural complexity of restoration plantings for supporting the recolonisation and persistence of native fauna. At large landscape-scale, we demonstrate the importance of retaining small habitat elements, including ancient paddock trees, pivot irrigation corners and small, degraded remnants, in facilitating occupancy and dispersal and, therefore, persistence of wild animals across this agricultural region.

AB  - Whether ex situ populations constructed in the limited nursery resources of botanical gardens can preserve enough genetic diversity of endangered plants in the wild remains uncertain. Here, a case study was conducted with Camellia tunghinensis, which is one of the species with the lowest natural distribution area in the sect. Chrysantha (golden camellia) of the family Theaceae. We investigated the genetic diversity and population structure of 229 samples from wild and ex situ populations using genotyping by sequencing (GBS). Core germplasm was constructed from these samples. The results showed that wild C. tunghinensis exhibited high genetic diversity, with observed heterozygosity of 0.257-0.293 and expected heterozygosity of 0.247-0.262. Compared with wild populations, the genetic diversity of ex situ populations established by transplanting wild seedlings was close to or even higher. However, the genetic diversity of those established by seed or cuttings of a few superior trees was lower. The Admixture analysis revealed that the structure of the ex situ populations derived from seeds and cuttings was relatively simple compared with the ex situ populations derived from transplanted wild seedlings and wild populations. These results suggested that direct transplanting of wild seedlings was more conducive to preserving the genetic diversity of endangered plants in the wild. In addition, wild populations demonstrated a small differentiation (mean F-ST = 0.044) among themselves, possibly due to long-term and frequent gene flow between the wild populations. In contrast, moderate differentiation (mean F-ST > 0.05) was detected among ex situ populations and between ex situ and wild populations. This may be the combined result of the absence of gene flow pathways and strong selection pressure in various ex situ environments. Finally, 77 core germplasms were extracted from 229, likely representing the genetic diversity of C. tunghinensis. This study provides future strategies for the ex situ conservation and management of the golden camellia species and other rare and endangered plants.

AB  - Ecological and evolutionary transitions offer an excellent opportunity to examine the molecular basis of adaptation. Fishes of the order Beloniformes include needlefishes, flyingfishes, halfbeaks, and allies, and comprise over 200 species occupying a wide array of habitats-from the marine epipelagic zone to tropical rainforest rivers. These fishes also exhibit a diversity of diets, including piscivory, herbivory, and zooplanktivory. We investigated how diet and habitat affected the molecular evolution of cone opsins, which play a key role in bright light and colour vision and are tightly linked to ecology and life history. We analyzed a targeted-capture dataset to reconstruct the evolutionary history of beloniforms and assemble cone opsin sequences. We implemented codon-based clade models of evolution to examine how molecular evolution was affected by habitat and diet. We found high levels of positive selection in medium- and long-wavelength beloniform opsins, with piscivores showing increased positive selection in medium-wavelength opsins and zooplanktivores showing increased positive selection in long-wavelength opsins. In contrast, short-wavelength opsins showed purifying selection. While marine/freshwater habitat transitions have an effect on opsin molecular evolution, we found that diet plays a more important role. Our study suggests that evolutionary transitions along ecological axes produce complex adaptive interactions that affect patterns of selection on genes that underlie vision.

AB  - Camellia gigantocarpa is one of the oil-tea trees whose seeds can be used to extract high-quality vegetable oil. To date, there are no data on the mitochondrial genome of the oil-tea tree, in contrast to the tea-tree C. sinensis, which belongs to the same genus. In this paper, we present the first complete mitochondrial genomes of C. gigantocarpa obtained using PacBio Hi-Fi (high-fidelity) and Hi-C sequencing technologies to anchor the 970,410 bp genome assembly into a single sequence. A set of 44 protein-coding genes, 22 non-coding genes, 746 simple sequence repeats (SSRs), and more than 201 kb of repetitive sequences were annotated in the genome assembly. The high percentage of repetitive sequences in the mitochondrial genome of C. gigantocarpa (20.81%) and C. sinensis (22.15%, tea tree) compared to Arabidopsis thaliana (4.96%) significantly increased the mitogenome size in the genus Camellia. The comparison of the mitochondrial genomes between C. gigantocarpa and C. sinensis revealed genes exhibit high variance in gene order and low substitution rate within the genus Camellia. Information on the mitochondrial genome provides a better understanding of the structure and evolution of the genome in Camellia and may contribute to further study of the after-ripening process of oil-tea trees.

AB  - BackgroundThe by-product of insect larval production, frass, can be applied to soil as an organic fertiliser. Its three main organic N fractions are assumed to be ureic, protein and chitin. The significance of the latter is unknown, and it is not known if lignaceous sources have been overlooked.AimsThis study sought to gauge the activities of the (respectively, lignolytic and chitinolytic) enzymes peroxidase and N-acetyl-ss-D-glucosaminidase following frass application to soil. Their activities were monitored under conditions of urease inhibition, with a particular focus on the fungal domain.MethodsMealworm or buffalo worm frass was applied, with or without inhibitors, to a sand/soil substrate at 3% (w/w). After 16 weeks, concentrations of the fungal biomarker ergosterol and enzyme activities were determined.ResultsSoil amendment with frass had no significant effect on peroxidase activity. Fungal biomass was stimulated in particular by application of mealworm frass, which was further improved by urease inhibition. Chitinase activity was positively correlated with fungal biomass, and was increased under urease inhibition when applied with mealworm frass.ConclusionsThere were no appreciable quantities of lignaceous compounds in the frass used in this study. Importantly, the use of urease inhibitors co-applied with frass has demonstrated that when its ureic N breakdown is prevented, chitin becomes a significant organic N source to soil fungi. The superior fungal response to mealworm frass indicates a larger chitin content than in buffalo worm frass.

AB  - Feature extraction and object detection face a challenging problem on remote sensing satellite images. This research paper proposed an effective feature extraction technique named convolutional neural network-based features from accelerated segment test (FAST-CNN) and classifier as support vector machine decision tree. The proposed FAST-CNN is generally producing a feature vector that two scenarios should form. In the first scenario, the dense layer extraction of CNN is performed to extract the features. In the second scenario, the final layer of fully connected is replaced by FAST, and it is used only for detecting the exciting point of an image to create a vector. The combination can effectively reduce complexity in terms of its feature parameter, and detecting objects is much faster to maintain the system at a more accurate rate. The accuracy of the proposed feature extractor and classifier is better than the existing approaches. The proposed feature extraction technique improved its precision value by 22.5%, 23.7%, 14.17%, 10.18%, and recall by 19%, 17.96%, 9.72%, 7.31% against the existing techniques of HOG, LBP, FAST, and CNN.

AB  - 4- tert butylphenol (4-tBP), a toxic environmental pollutant estrogen, received widespread attention due to its widespread presence, environmental persistence, and toxic effect. Common carp ( Cyprinus carpio L.) is the most important freshwater economic animal in China and is also a model animal for the study on molecular mechanisms of poisoning. Head kidney is a target organ attacked by environmental pollutants. Here, we established a common carp 4-tBP poisoning model. The results showed that exposure to 4-tBP resulted in mitochondrial damage, endoplasmic reticulum damage, and apoptotic damage in head kidneys of common carps using microstructure and ultrastructure observations, as well as TUNEL kit methods. Furthermore, we found at transcriptional level from three perspectives that 4-tBP induced apoptosis in common carp head kidney cells: Hippo pathway, mitochondrial pathway, and ER stress. Hippo pathway formed a complex network, in which LATS1 was a core gene. It's noteworthy that Hippo pathway triggered mitochondrial pathway through YAP/NR4A1/Bcl-2 and YAP/BIRC5/Caspase-9 pathways under 4-tBP-induced apoptosis. PERK-eIF2 alpha-ATF4-Caspase-3 pathway was involved in 4-tBP-induced apoptosis via ER stress. Moreover, miR-203a mediated 4-tBP-induced apoptosis through targeting MST1, MAP4K4, and NR4A1. In addition, 4-tBP disrupted balance between oxidants and antioxidants, and caused oxidative stress, and oxidative stress mediated ER stress under 4-tBP-caused apoptosis via via H 2 O 2 -PERK-eIF2 alpha-ATF4-Caspase-3 pathway. miR-203a and oxidative stress participated in 4-tBP-induced apoptosis in common carp head kidney cells. For the first time, we found that Hippo pathway took part in molecular mechanism of fish poisoning, which needs to be investigated in the future. Our research provided foundational knowledge for exploring toxic effects of estrogen on fish and provided new insights into a theoretical basis for safety risk assessment for humans and fish, which deserves further profound exploration in the future. Moreover, the insights we generated help inform new strategies for preventing toxic injury in fish.

AB  - Simple Summary Cephalopods are not only important economic products in fisheries, but also located in the middle pyramid of the marine ecosystem, playing a role of carrying the top and bottom. Cephalopods are the meals of large marine mammals, and their soft tissues are mostly digested in the stomach, and the beaks can be retained as hard tissues of cephalopods, which are structurally stable and resistant to corrosion. Therefore, the biodiversity of cephalopods can be analyzed by studying the beaks. However, there are many difficulties in the identification of beaks, such as the high level of similarity between different species of beaks and the variability arising from the growth process. The local shallow features, namely texture features and morphological features, and the global deep features were used, and the two types of features were fused for identification. This study verifies the complementarity between the two types of features and further contributes to the progress of beak recognition, providing a new approach to analyzing the biodiversity of cephalopods.Abstract Cephalopods are an essential component of marine ecosystems, which are of great significance for the development of marine resources, ecological balance, and human food supply. At the same time, the preservation of cephalopod resources and the promotion of sustainable utilization also require attention. Many studies on the classification of cephalopods focus on the analysis of their beaks. In this study, we propose a feature fusion-based method for the identification of beaks, which uses the convolutional neural network (CNN) model as its basic architecture and a multi-class support vector machine (SVM) for classification. First, two local shallow features are extracted, namely the histogram of the orientation gradient (HOG) and the local binary pattern (LBP), and classified using SVM. Second, multiple CNN models were used for end-to-end learning to identify the beaks, and model performance was compared. Finally, the global deep features of beaks were extracted from the Resnet50 model, fused with the two local shallow features, and classified using SVM. The experimental results demonstrate that the feature fusion model can effectively fuse multiple features to recognize beaks and improve classification accuracy. Among them, the HOG+Resnet50 method has the highest accuracy in recognizing the upper and lower beaks, with 91.88% and 93.63%, respectively. Therefore, this new approach facilitated identification studies of cephalopod beaks.

AB  - Background Fire regimes in South African fynbos shrublands have been quantified in the western (winter rainfall) and central (aseasonal rainfall) parts. They have not been quantified at their eastern extremity (summer rainfall), where fynbos transitions to grassland and is embedded in other fire-resistant vegetation types. We assessed fire regimes at the eastern extremity of the fynbos biome and discussed the ecological and management implications of our findings. Results Using remote sensing, we assessed fires over 21 years in a 350,000-ha study area at the eastern edge of the fynbos biome. Only 9% of the study area burned, almost exclusively in mixed grassland-fynbos vegetation. The largest proportion (44% of the total area burnt) burnt in late winter and early spring, but fires occurred throughout the year. Fires only occurred in 39% of the mixed grassland-fynbos vegetation. Of the mixed grassland-fynbos vegetation that did burn, 44%, 11%, 26%, and 19% experienced one, two, three, and four fires, respectively. Areas with multiple fires had return intervals ranging from 3 to 15 years, with 76% of the area with multiple fires burning every 4 to 6 years. Most large fires were preceded by two relatively dry months, when fuels were drier and more flammable. Conclusions The mixed grassland-fynbos vegetation at the eastern extremity of the fynbos biome is surrounded by fire-resistant vegetation and exhibits a varied fire regime, with different parts experiencing frequent, infrequent, or no fire over 21 years. Fires were largely aseasonal, occurring throughout the year, although data over more years may reveal that a greater proportion of fires will occur in winter, when grasses are cured and rainfall is low, as well as after relatively long (> 2 months) periods of below-average rainfall. As most fires would burn out safely against fire-resistant vegetation, we conclude that lightning-ignited fires should be allowed to spread unhindered to approximate a natural and heterogeneous fire regime, provided that no neighboring properties or infrastructure are threatened. The response of the biota to fires is not well understood for this transition area, and further research is needed.

AB  - To elucidate changes in the defensive traits of tree seedlings under global environmental changes, we evaluated foliar defensive traits of the seedlings of successional trees, such as beech, oak, and magnolia grown in a natural-light phytotron. Potted seedlings were grown under the combination of two CO2 concentrations (360 vs. 720 ppm) and two nitrogen (N) treatments (4 vs. 15 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1)) for two growing seasons using quantitative chemical analyses and anatomical method. We hypothesized that the effects of CO2 and N depend on the successional type, with late successional species providing greater defense of their leaves against herbivores, as this species exhibits determinate growth. Beech, a late successional species, responded the most to both elevated CO2 concentration (eCO(2)) and high N treatment. eCO(2) and low N supply enhanced the defensive traits, such as the high leaf mass per area (LMA), high carbon to N ratio (C/N ratio), and increase in the concentrations of total phenolic and condensed tannin in agreement with the carbon-nutrient balance (CNB) hypothesis. High N supply decreased the C/N ratio due to the high N uptake in beech leaves. Oak, a mid-late successional species, exhibited different responses from beech: eCO(2) enhanced the LMA, C/N ratio, and concentration of total phenolics of oak leaves, but only condensed tannin increased under high N supply. Magnolia did not respond to all treatments. No interactive effects were observed between CO2 and N supply in all species, except for the concentration of total phenolics in oak. Although the amounts of phenolic compounds in beech and oak varied under eCO(2) and high N treatments, the distribution of these compounds did not change. Our results indicate that the changes in the defensive traits of forest tree species under eCO(2) with N loading are related to the successional type.

AB  - Plants have evolved several strategies to cope with the ever-changing environment. One example of this is given by seed germination, which must occur when environmental conditions are suitable for plant life. In the model system Arabidopsis thaliana seed germination is induced by light; however, in nature, seeds of several plant species can germinate regardless of this stimulus. While the molecular mechanisms underlying light-induced seed germination are well understood, those governing germination in the dark are still vague, mostly due to the lack of suitable model systems. Here, we employ Cardamine hirsuta, a close relative of Arabidopsis, as a powerful model system to uncover the molecular mechanisms underlying light-independent germination. By comparing Cardamine and Arabidopsis, we show that maintenance of the pro-germination hormone gibberellin (GA) levels prompt Cardamine seeds to germinate under both dark and light conditions. Using genetic and molecular biology experiments, we show that the Cardamine DOF transcriptional repressor DOF AFFECTING GERMINATION 1 (ChDAG1), homologous to the Arabidopsis transcription factor DAG1, is involved in this process functioning to mitigate GA levels by negatively regulating GA biosynthetic genes ChGA3OX1 and ChGA3OX2, independently of light conditions. We also demonstrate that this mechanism is likely conserved in other Brassicaceae species capable of germinating in dark conditions, such as Lepidium sativum and Camelina sativa. Our data support Cardamine as a new model system suitable for studying light-independent germination studies. Exploiting this system, we have also resolved a long-standing question about the mechanisms controlling light-independent germination in plants, opening new frontiers for future research.

AB  - Background: Xerophilous scrubland is a semi-desert ecosystem characterized by a wide diversity of shrubs, which have secondary compounds with nutraceutical potential that could be used as feed for livestock, specifically by goats, since this species has developed behavioral and physiological adaptations that allow it to take advantage of the plant resources of said scrubland. Objective: To evaluate the nutraceutical potential of Havardia pallens and Vachellia rigidula, native species of the xerophilous scrubland, when incorporated as ingredients in goat diets. Methods: Integral diets for male goats were prepared, formulated with 35% inclusion of Havardia pallens, Vachellia rigidula, and Medicago sativa, the latter used as a plant control species. The content of flavonoids and total phenols was compared using colorimetric methods, and the antioxidant capacity was measured using the FRAP method. RP-HPLC-ESI-MS characterized the bioactive compounds in the different extracts. Statistical analysis was performed by ANOVA. Results: The aqueous extraction of Vachellia rigidula showed the highest concentration of total phenols (x <overline> = 18.22 mg GAE/g(-1)), followed by the ethanolic extract in the same species (x(sic) = 17.045 mg GAE/g(-1)). Similarly, Vachellia rigidula presented the highest antioxidant capacity ( x(sic) = 144,711.53 mu mol TE/g(-1)), while Medicago sativa presented the lowest (x(sic) = 11,701.92 mu mol TE/g). The RP-HPLC-ESI-MS analysis revealed that Vachellia rigidula presented a higher abundance of flavones, catechins, flavonols, methoxyflavones, and tyrosols. However, Harvardia pallens presented higher levels of methoxycinnamic and hydroxycinnamic acids. One-way ANOVA results showed that diets containing 35% Vachellia rigidula and Havardia pallens significantly contrasted (p < 0.05), increased the content of secondary compounds and antioxidant capacity compared to the control species. Furthermore, including Vachellia rigidula led to a significantly higher antioxidant capacity (p < 0.05) than diets with Havardia pallens or Medicago sativa. Conclusions: Incorporating the leguminous shrubs Vachellia rigidula and Havardia pallens into the formulation of comprehensive diets for buck goats improves the content and availability of phenols, flavonoids, and antioxidants. However, in vivo evaluation of these diets is important to determine their physiological and productive effects on the animals.

AB  - The African forest elephant (Loxodonta cyclotis) plays a critical role in upholding the Congo Basin's structure and function, a vital area that supports global carbon sequestration. However, between 1990 and 2021, the species' numbers declined by 86%, mainly because of ivory hunting. Owing to their elusive nature in the region's dense rainforests, their responses to human disturbances, such as gun hunting, are not well understood, though the limited studies that have been completed suggest that forest elephants may respond by altering their abundance, distribution and nocturnal activity. Using passive acoustic monitoring (PAM) in and around Nouabal & eacute;-Ndoki National Park, Republic of Congo, we assess how gun hunting impacts forest elephant occupancy and night-time vocal activity. Findings reveal that elephant occupancy drops from 0.54 to 0.52 following a gunfire event, a change sustained over 8 days. Additionally, increased gunshots led to a significant rise in the proportion of night-time vocal activity. These behavioural changes can affect forest elephant foraging and reproductive success and their interactions with vegetation, impacting forest growth and function. This study highlights the need for effective conservation strategies to protect the species and their habitats and demonstrates PAMs effectiveness in studying cryptic species in our world's dense, highly biodiverse and life-sustaining tropical forests.This article is part of the theme issue 'Acoustic monitoring for tropical ecology and conservation'.

AB  - What causes host use specificity in herbivorous insects? Population genetic models predict specialization when habitat preference can evolve and there is antagonistic pleiotropy at a performance-affecting locus. But empirically for herbivorous insects, host use performance is governed by many genetic loci, and antagonistic pleiotropy seems to be rare. Here, we use individual-based quantitative genetic simulation models to investigate the role of pleiotropy in the evolution of sympatric host use specialization when performance and preference are quantitative traits. We look first at pleiotropies affecting only host use performance. We find that when the host environment changes slowly, the evolution of host use specialization requires levels of antagonistic pleiotropy much higher than what has been observed in nature. On the other hand, with rapid environmental change or pronounced asymmetries in productivity across host species, the evolution of host use specialization readily occurs without pleiotropy. When pleiotropies affect preference as well as performance, even with slow environmental change and host species of equal productivity, we observe fluctuations in host use breadth, with mean specificity increasing with the pervasiveness of antagonistic pleiotropy. Thus, our simulations show that pleiotropy is not necessary for specialization, although it can be sufficient, provided it is extensive or multifarious.

AB  - Excavation campaigns conducted at the Pecel-Kis harsas site (Hungary) between 2014 and 2017 yielded the remains of a mature female woolly rhinoceros (Coelodonta antiquitatis) and six lithic artefacts. Radiocarbon dating confirmed that the rhinoceros died ca. 20.4k cal a bp, at the very end of the Last Glacial Maximum and, considering the position of the artefacts when found, it was probably killed by Epigravettian hunters. Based on dental analyses of the specimen, a vigorous lichen- (and possibly moss-)consuming diet could be inferred for the end of the animal's lifetime. Based on Sr results, we can exclude the possibility of long-range migration. In accordance with the optimum environmental demands of the foraging lichen, the low delta O-18 value of osseous material implies a relatively cold contemporaneous climate with a calculated mean annual air temperature of around 0.7 degrees C. Meanwhile, the extremely low delta N-15 value may have resulted from the proximity of the discontinuous permafrost zone and some intensive soil dislocation. Consequently, poor vegetation and an open, tundra-like habitat can be assumed to have been dominant at the site at that time, which is also supported by palaeoenvironmental modeling experiments.

AB  - Respiratory infections are considered the leading cause of mortality among communicable diseases in indigenous populations, becoming a public health issue. This case study was conducted in Amatur & aacute; municipality (Amazonas, Brazil) indigenous communities. On total 2.728 medical records for respiratory infections from the Alto Rio Solim & otilde;es Special Indigenous Health District (DSEI) were analized. Of these, 52.7% were females, and 76.6% were under 18 years old. Acute nasopharyngitis was the most frequent diagnosis (91.5% of cases). The age group 1 to 4 years showed a higher frequency of some conditions. Females showed a significant likelihood ratio (LR) with unspecified acute tonsillitis, and males with acute laryngopharyngitis. The specific analysis of the village revealed LR for acute bronchitis caused by rhinovirus in Bom Pastor, and acute bronchitis caused by respiratory syncytial virus and Streptococcus in Nova It & aacute;lia. This study highlights the high frequency of upper respiratory infections in the largest indigenous district of the Brazilian Amazon, especially affecting children aged 1 to 4 years. Though often self-limiting, these infections can lead to more severe lower respiratory issues. The findings stress the need for effective preventive measures, better healthcare access, and environmental policies to reduce the health impacts of pollution. The study also calls for more research with better representation of indigenous diversity and emphasizes the importance of strengthening health surveillance systems and social participation in healthcare planning.

AB  - Understanding what motivates animal spatial behavior requires discerning the relationship between animals and the landscape in which they move. Many studies have focused on large scale trends that drive migrations and movement across broad landscapes, but few studies have focused on drivers of local movement within smaller areas based on fine-scale landscape heterogeneity. This is especially true for African elephants (Loxodonta africana), whose movements in relation to landscape variables have frequently been studied across vast areas, but infrequently on a small scale. We report on how the local distribution of an important resource-fruit trees-shapes elephant movement patterns in Kibale National Park, Uganda. We hypothesized that the spatial location of elephant trails, and especially intersections in the network of trails, would be heavily associated with fruit trees, with trail density being higher in areas with greater fruit availability. Elephant trails and nearby fruit trees were mapped within a 64 km(2) area within the interior of the Park. Trail and fruit tree sampling were conducted along 16 evenly spaced one-km control transects and compared to 28.6 km of elephant trails arrayed throughout the park. Fruit tree basal area was higher along trails and at trail intersections. Trail density was also positively correlated with fruit tree density. Fruit trees may thus serve as a determinant of small-scale elephant movement and could be used to predict patterns of elephant spatial behavior across forested habitat, which has potential implications for elephant management in the area.

AB  - Developing the zoos' ability to assess the reproductive status of the individuals they house is essential to improve the husbandry and management of these species. The use of non-invasive techniques such as fecal hormone analysis has been proven to be a simple and effective way to achieve this. Designed by bioMerieux, mini VIDAS (R) instrument is used in human and veterinary medicine to evaluate different endocrinological parameters, including serum or plasma progesterone. This study evaluates VIDAS (R) Progesterone (PRG) assay's efficacy to monitor fecal progestagens using a simple sample extraction protocol adapted to the zoo environment. We compared (1) VIDAS (R) PRG fecal profiles with established assays specifically designed for fecal progestagens analysis at the VetmedUni (Vienna, Austria) for okapis (Okapia johnstoni), greater one-horned rhinoceros (Rhinoceros unicorns), giraffes (Giraffa camelopardalis reticulata) and hippopotamus (Hippopotamus amphibius) (2) VIDAS (R) PRG fecal profiles with VIDAS (R) PRG serum profiles for African elephants (Loxodonta Africana), giant anteater (Myrmecophaga tridactyla) and white rhinoceros (Ceratotherium simum). Spearman mean correlations were: 0.6748 for African elephants (n = 2 animals), 0.7969 for giant anteater (n = 1 animal), 0.7926 for okapis (n = 2 animals), 0.6072 for greater one-horned rhinoceros (n = 4 animals), 0.6062 for giraffes (n = 4 animals) and 0.5740 for hippopotamus (n = 2 animals). Fecal progestagens analysis revealed estrous cycles in several species: 12.5 +/- 0.5 weeks for African elephants (n = 2 cycles), 15.3 +/- 1.1 days for okapis (n = 6 cycles), 44 +/- 2.1 days for greater one-horned rhinoceros (n = 4 cycles) and 15.5 +/- 0.5 days for giraffes (n = 4 cycles). We observed pregnancies in a giant anteater, an okapi and a hippopotamus. We observed a strong positive Spearman correlation (r> 0.60) for individuals exhibiting estrous cycles. These first results indicate that the mini VIDAS (R) can be used for monitoring of the reproductive status of non-domesticated species and can be a useful tool for the reproductive management through fecal progesterone analysis. A simple extraction protocol was suitable for sample preparation of fecal progesterone metabolite analysis. Further studies using a larger number of individuals per species at different reproductive stages could confirm the relevance of mini VIDAS (R) in the zoo community. (C) 2021 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Managing interactions between humans and wild elephants is a complex problem that is increasing as a result of agricultural and urban expansion into and alongside protected areas. Mitigating negative interactions requires the development of new tools to reduce competition and promote coexistence. Many studies have tested various mitigation techniques across elephant ranges in Africa and Asia, with varying levels of success. Recently, strobe lights have been suggested as a potential mitigation strategy in deterring African lions Panthera leo from kraals or bomas, but this technique has to date not been tested to reduce negative human-elephant interactions. Over a 2-year period (November 2016-June 2018), we tested the effectiveness of solar-powered strobe light barriers in deterring African elephants Loxodonta africana, in collaboration with 18 farmers in a community adjacent to the Chobe Forest Reserve and Chobe National Park in northern Botswana. Although elephants were more likely to pass by fields with solar-powered strobe light barriers (which was probably a result of selection bias as we focused on fields that had previously been damaged by elephants), they were less likely to enter these treatment fields than control fields without such barriers. Our findings demonstrate the efficacy of light barriers to reduce negative human-elephant interactions in rural communities.

AB  - Wildlife that share habitats with humans with limited options for spatial avoidance must either tolerate frequent human encounters or concentrate their activity into those periods with the least risk of encountering people. Based on 5259 camera trap images of adult wolves from eight territories, we analyzed the extent to which diel activity patterns in a highly cultivated landscape with extensive public access (Denmark) could be explained from diel variation in darkness, human activity, and prey (deer) activity. A resource selection function that contrasted every camera observation (use) with 24 alternative hourly observations from the same day (availability), revealed that diel activity correlated with all three factors simultaneously with human activity having the strongest effect (negative), followed by darkness (positive) and deer activity (positive). A model incorporating these three effects had lower parsimony and classified use and availability observations just as well as a 'circadian' model that smoothed the use-availability ratio as function of time of the day. Most of the selection for darkness was explained by variation in human activity, supporting the notion that nocturnality (proportion of observations registered at night vs. day at the equinox) is a proxy for temporal human avoidance. Contrary to our expectations, wolves were no more nocturnal in territories with unrestricted public access than in territories where public access was restricted to roads, possibly because wolves in all territories had few possibilities to walk more than few hundred meters without crossing roads. Overall, Danish wolf packs were 6.5 (95% CI: 4.6-9.6) times more active at night than at daylight, which make them amongst the most nocturnally active wolves reported so far. These results confirm the prediction that wolves in habitats with limited options for spatial human avoidance, invest more in temporal avoidance.

AB  - The study of carnivores' diets is an important conservation tool, which can minimize conflicts with different stakeholders and provide proper substantiations for management measures. The main aim of this study was to understand the diet of a small, isolated pack named Mogadouro Sul, present in the Northeast of Tr & aacute;s-os-Montes (Portugal). Scat analysis was the method used to determine what wolves consumed. The specific origin of all collected fecal samples (n = 78) was confirmed by molecular analysis. The results, expressed in frequency of occurrence (FO) showed that domestic animals were the most frequent food category in the wolf's diet (78.3% FO), with a special incidence in goats (40.6% FO), although wild ungulates (roe deer and wild boar) also accounted for 21.7% FO of the diet. The study pack presented a diet diversity (H ') of 0.65 and a food niche breadth (B ') of 0.55. Food availability did not appear to be a limiting factor, and the wolf's presence in the study area could be explained by changes in land use and increased infrastructure. This trophic behavior may threaten the conservation of this pack due to the persecution it may face.

AB  - ContextMaintaining connectivity is crucial for wildlife conservation in human-occupied landscapes. Structural connectivity modeling (SCM) attempts to quantify the degree to which physical features facilitate or impede movement of individuals and has been widely used to identify corridors, but its accuracy is rarely validated against empirical data.ObjectivesWe evaluated SCM's ability to identify suitable habitat and corridors for onagers (Equus hemionus onager) through a comparison with functional connectivity (i.e., actual movement of individuals) using satellite tracking data.MethodsWe used MaxEnt to predict suitable habitat and evaluated the ability of three SCM approaches: circuit theory, factorial least cost path, and landscape corridors approaches to identify corridors. The performance of the three SCM approaches was validated against independently collected GPS telemetry data.ResultsOnagers selected water sources and dense vegetation while avoiding areas grazed intensely by livestock. The three approaches to SCMs identified similar movement corridors, which were interrupted by roads, affecting major high-flow movement corridors. The SCMs overlapped with functional connectivity by about 21%.ConclusionMovement corridors derived from SCMs did not align with the locations or intensity of corridors identified using the functional connectivity model. This finding suggests that SCMs might have a tendency to overestimate landscape resistance in areas with low habitat suitability. Therefore, SCM may not adequately capture individual decisions about habitat selection and movement. To protect corridors linking suitable habitat, data on functional connectivity (i.e., telemetry data) can be coupled with SCM to better understand habitat selection and movements of populations as a consequence of landscape features.

AB  - Air pollution, including particulate matter (PM), impacts public health in urban areas. Vegetation acts as a natural filter, removing environmental pollution by absorbing large quantities of toxic substances on the foliage. Ambient air pollution problems are real in Armenia's cities. This article presents the results of a study based on field sampling in July 2022 undertaken in urban parks and streets in the Armenian cities of Yerevan, Gyumri, and Vanadzor. The three cities have different climates and geographic conditions. The main research goal was a comparative study of the accumulation of PM by urban greenery. The most widespread tree species were selected for the study in each city: in Yerevan, Platanus orientalis and Quercus robur; in Gyumri, Fraxinus excelsior and Tilia caucasica; and in Vanadzor, Aesculus hippocastanum and Acer pseudoplatanus. The ecological status of trees was assessed through visual observation. Tree species with high PM uptake potential were identified and selected for inclusion in urban greening systems (Platanus orientalis, Fraxinus excelsior, and Quercus robur in Yerevan; Tilia caucasica, Sorbus persica, Fraxinus excelsior, and Populus alba in Grumri; Acer pseudoplatanus, Fraxinus excelsior, Aesculus hippocastanum, and Thuja occidentalis in Vanadzor.). High PM accumulation was found on the leaves of tree species in all of the investigated cities, with the largest amount recorded in Yerevan. In these cities, PM levels were higher in street plantations than in parks. All studied tree species have a high potential for PM absorption, demonstrating strong phytofilter properties. Therefore, they can be effectively used in their typical climatic zones and included in street plantings, gardens, and parks. These results can help urban planners and policymakers make informed decisions about urban greening initiatives to improve air quality and overall wellbeing.

AB  - To conserve wide-ranging species in degraded landscapes, it is essential to understand how the behavior of animals changes in relation to the degree and composition of modification. Evidence suggests that large inter-individual variation exists in the propensity for use of degraded areas and may be driven by both behavioral and landscape factors. The use of cultivated lands by wildlife is of particular interest, given the importance of reducing human-wildlife conflicts and understanding how such areas can function as biodiversity buffers. African elephant space use can be highly influenced by human activity and the degree to which individuals crop-raid. We analyzed GPS data from 56 free-ranging elephants in the Serengeti-Mara Ecosystem using resource selection functions (RSFs) to assess how crop use may drive patterns of resource selection and space use within a population. We quantified drivers of similarity in resource selection across individuals using proximity analysis of individual RSF coefficients derived from random forest models. We found wide variation in RSF coefficient values between individuals indicating strongly differentiated resource selection strategies. Proximity assessment indicated the degree of crop use in the dry season, individual repeatability, and time spent in unprotected areas drove similarity in resource selection patterns. Crop selection was also spatially structured in relation to agricultural fragmentation. In areas with low fragmentation, elephants spent less time in crops and selected most strongly for crops further from protected area boundaries, but in areas of high fragmentation, elephants spent twice as much time in crops and selected most strongly for crops closer to the protected area boundary. Our results highlight how individual differences and landscape structure can shape use of agricultural landscapes. We discuss our findings in respect to the conservation challenges of human-elephant conflict and incorporating behavioral variation into human-wildlife coexistence efforts.

AB  - Rhipicephalus are a species-diverse genus of ticks, mainly distributed in the Afrotropics with some species in the Palearctic and Oriental regions. Current taxonomic consensus comprise nine informal species groups/lineages based on immature morphology. This work integrates biogeographic, ecological and molecular lines of evidence to better understand Rhipicephalus evolution. Phylogenetic analysis based on four genes (12S, 16S, 28S-D2 and COI) recovered five distinct clades with nine descendant clades that are generally congruent with current taxonomy, with some exceptions. Historical biogeography is inferred from molecular divergence times, ancestral distribution areas, host-use and climate niches of four phylogenetically significant bioclimatic variables (isothermality, annual, seasonal and diurnal temperature range). Novel hosts enabled host-linked dispersal events into new environments, and ticks exploited new hosts through nested predator-prey connections in food webs. Diversification was further induced by climate niche partitioning along gradients in temperature range during off-host periods. Ancestral climate niche estimates corroborated dispersal events by indicating hypothetical ancestors moved into environments with different annual and seasonal temperature ranges along latitudinal gradients. Host size for immature and adult life stages was important for dispersal and subsequent diversification rates. Clades that utilise large, mobile hosts (ungulates and carnivores) early in development have wider geographic ranges but slower diversification rates, and those utilising small, less mobile hosts (rodents, lagomorphs and afroinsectivores) early in development have smaller ranges but higher diversification rates. These findings suggest diversification is driven by a complex set of factors linked to both host-associations (host size, ranges and mobility) and climate niche partitioning along annual and seasonal temperature range gradients that vary with latitude. Moreover, competitive interactions can reinforce these processes and drive speciation. Offhost periods facilitate adaptive radiation by enabling host switches along nested predator-prey connections in food webs, but at the cost of environmental exposure that partitions niches among dispersing progenitors, disrupting geneflow and driving diversification. As such, the evolution and ecological niches of Rhipicephalus are characterised by trade-offs between on- and off-host periods, and these trade-offs interact with nested predatorprey connections in food webs, host-use at different life stages, as well as gradients in annual and seasonal temperature ranges to drive adaptive radiation and speciation.

AB  - Senegal, like the other Sahelian countries, remains an important livestock area, particularly for ruminants, with almost 36% of its livestock population was goat in 2016. The national herd increased from 2010 to 2016, from 3.32 to 3.54 million head of cattle, 5.6 to 6.68 million sheep and 4.8 to 5.7 million goats, i.e. annual growth rates of 1.1%, 3.2% and 3.13% respectively. Thus, due to diversification of local agricultural resources and the strengthening of goat breeding techniques in the Fatick area, a programme aiming to develop the local goat sector was set up in 2010. The programme focused on improving animal husbandry, providing new added values to goat products and structuring the goat sector. This study's aim is to better understand goat rearing systems in the area, in order to propose, together with the herders, ways of improving these systems, taking into account family and socio-cultural considerations. To better evaluate the diversity in different production systems, a survey of animal rearing practices was carried out. The survey involved 45 farmers in four localities. It revealed that the farmers were all agro-pastoralists practising a mixed farming system. The majority (93%) supplemented their animals with agricultural by-products, agro-forestry and kitchen leftovers. A multiple correspondence analysis identified three groups: cluster 1 (milk producers and processors into traditional curdled milk, selling animals for household needs), cluster 2 (milk processors into yoghurt and cheese) and cluster 3 (goat vendors in pastoral and the agro-pastoral system). The study of the objectives and contexts of goat farming in the Fatick will enable policy-makers to design strategies for the sustainable development of family goat farming in the area.

AB  - The functions of latrines have been well studied in gregarious or pair-living territorial ungulates, however, there are no field-based studies on latrine behaviour of solitary ungulates with monogamous pair territories. We investigated latrine behaviour of the Japanese serow (Capricornis crispus), a solitary and monogamous species. The spatial patterns of latrines did not coincide with the serows' home range boundaries, and individuals of the same sex did not defecate at the same latrine (i.e., there was no countermarking), which suggests that latrines may not function as territorial marking. During the late-mating season, when males and females tend to live separately, the number of latrine visits by females increased and the probability of defecating was significantly higher, suggesting that females are the signallers, informing their oestrus status to males. Moreover, males also frequently visited the latrines, and latrine sniffing and overmarking were observed only during the late-mating season, suggesting that males may receive information about oestrus from the females' faeces. Obtaining information on female oestrus directly is difficult for solitary species in which sexes live separately. Although future studies would be required to confirm this hypothesis, our study suggests that latrines may have evolved as female-to-male communication sites in the Japanese serow.

AB  - Understanding how fecal glucocorticoid (GC) concentration is associated with reproduction in wild animals allows us to associate physiological stress with the costs of reproduction. Glucocorticoids are among the main stress-related hormones, and their secretion is strongly associated with reproductive seasonality. Using non-invasive methods (thereby avoiding causing stress), we used fecal GC metabolites (FGC) to test the hypothesis that the reproductive phase (mating, non-mating, gestation, and lactation) influences stress levels of the seasonally reproductive Pampas Deer (Ozotoceros bezoarticus). Furthermore, we compared FGC between sexes and between males of different antler statuses (velvet, hard, cast). During 1 year, in the Pantanal of Brazil, we collected 621 fresh fecal samples (327 from females, 294 from males) from which we estimated FGC using enzyme immunoassay (EIA). FGC concentrations varied by reproductive phase and antler status. Agonistic and courtship interactions associated with mating (i.e., fights between males, attempts to mount females), suggest that they influence FGC concentrations most strongly in both sexes. Females also had greater FGC concentrations during lactation, suggesting that this phase and parental care are also associated with increased physiological stress. In males, the association of FGC concentrations with antler status may be, in part, associated with photoperiod and testosterone secretion, both of which can trigger reproductive and agonistic behaviors. Finally, reproductive synchrony of the sexes causes similar FGC over time and suggests that environmental factors contribute as well. We show that non-invasive monitoring of glucocorticoid metabolites levels is an effective tool for detecting changes in the physiological stress response in Pampas Deer, suggesting that this tool will be useful for detecting changes in physiological stress caused by human disturbance, such as cattle ranching in Pantanal and similar disturbances elsewhere.
   In the Brazilian Pantanal, Pampas Deer exhibits higher concentrations of fecal glucocorticoids during mating, lactation (females), and the hard antler phase (males). These relationships suggest that the reproductive cycle is associated with physiological stress, such as during agonistic and courtship interactions and parental care by females. Non-invasive monitoring will be useful for detecting changes in physiological stress caused by human disturbance, such as cattle ranching in the Pantanal and similar disturbances elsewhere. image

AB  - The black-legged tick -sometimes referred to as the deer tick-Ixodes scapularis and the lone star tick Ambylomma americanum are sympatric species whose distributions overlap both geographically and ecologically. Each species vectors a number of pathogens including the agents responsible for Lyme disease and ehrlichioses. We performed ethological observations of both species in five behavioral arenas focusing on geotropism and hydrokinesis. Adults of A. americanum showed positive geotropism by (a) walking down a precipice, (b) descending a wire, and (c) refusing to climb up a wall at the first encounter. In contrast, I. scapularis adults and most nymphs of both species showed negative geotropism in the same tests. Adults of both species and nymphs of A. americanum walked into the water while clinging to a cork, and even walked a distance beneath the surface of the water. On a servosphere, adults of A. americanum walked faster than I. scapularis adults, but I. scapularis spent more time walking. We discuss the importance of these attributes from behavioral ecology perspectives including previously reported notions of aggressiveness of tick species. The assessment of behavioral distinctness between these sympatric species will facilitate the design of experiments aimed at evaluations of attractants and repellents, and contribute to biorational control and surveillance strategies.

AB  - Almost all living plants can be simultaneously colonised by arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi in the roots and endophytes in the shoots, while also being attacked by insect herbivores. However, to date, no study has ever examined the multitrophic interactions between these two different fungal groups and insects on any species of forb. Here, we examined the effects of two commercial species mixtures of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) and two foliar endophytes (Colletotrichum acutatum and Cladosporium oxysporum) on the growth of an invasive weed, Impatiens glandulifera, and the aphids that attack it. AMF reduced plant biomass, which was most evident when C. oxysporum was inoculated. Mycorrhizal fungi had few effects on aphids, and these depended on the identity of the endophytes present. Meanwhile, endophytes tended to increase aphid numbers, but this depended on the identity of the AMF inoculum. Throughout, there were differences in the responses of the plant to the two mycorrhizal mixtures, demonstrating clear AMF specificity in this plant. These specific effects were also strongly affected by the endophytes, with a greater number of interactions found between the AMF and endophytes than between the endophytes themselves. In particular, AMF reduced infection levels by the endophytes, while some endophyte inoculations reduced mycorrhizal colonisation. We suggest that both AMF and endophytes could play an important part in future biological control programmes of weeds, but further multitrophic experiments are required to unravel the complexity of interactions between spatially separated parts of the plant microbiome.

AB  - Due to anthropogenic influences, habitat degradation and a continuous loss of biodiversi - ty in freshwater ecosystems are occurring on a large scale, while these ecosystems con - stitute invaluable natural resources. Therefore, it is essential to study and monitor fresh - water ecosystems to guide conservation efforts. Freshwater ecosystems are one of the less -studied fields in Georgia. Studies about the species distribution of many taxa and/ or regions carried out during the last century have not been updated for decades. Here, we report the results of an environmental DNA (eDNA) metabarcoding exercise, based on samples collected from the Rioni River, a tributary to the Black Sea and a crucial aquat - ic ecosystem regionally and globally. The only comprehensive review of the fish of the Rioni River dates back to 1956. We compared the eDNA-based taxonomic composition to the known faunal composition within the Rioni River and found that the eDNA-based taxonomic coverage approached 75% of the expected total fish fauna. A number of new species occurrences were also found, including the first detection of three invasive alien species ( Carassius gibelio , Pseudorasbora parva , Rhinogobius lindbergi ) in the Rionis River Basin and a new country record of the ninespine stickleback (genus Pungitius ) for Geor - gia. In spite of the usefulness of the eDNA metabarcoding approach, the sparsity of the fish DNA barcode reference library for the region emerged as a limitation to this study. However, our findings still represent a great leap forward in updating fish status on the Rioni River and testing the effectiveness of the eDNA sampling for aquatic species.

AB  - Long-term use of feed additives containing antibiotics and chemicals can make some pathogens resistant and even cause mutations that threaten animal and human health. Therefore, the development of green feed additives has become a top priority. Recent studies have shown that steviol glycosides are helpful in improving livestock performance, improving feed utilization, and regulating gastrointestinal microbiota. At present, steviol glycosides have been used as feed additive in pigs, fish and birds, but less in ruminants. Therefore, the primary aim of this study was to delve into the impact of steviol glycosides on the performance, blood biochemical parameters, rumen fermentation processes, and the microflora composition of Hu sheep. The findings revealed that the inclusion of steviol glycosides did not exert any notable influence on the growth rate or serum biochemical indices of Hu sheep, but it could improve rumen fermentation parameters and the structure of the rumen microbial community, had certain effects on the diversity and composition of rumen microorganisms, and helped maintain the balance of rumen microecology. The experiment was conducted to investigate the potential effects of steviol glycosides on growth performance, rumen fermentation processes, and microbial diversity in Hu sheep. A single-factor design was used for the trial. Twenty healthy weaned Hu lambs, possessing comparable body weights averaging 18.31 +/- 1.24 kg, were randomly allocated into two distinct groups: the control group (CON) and the experimental group (STE), with each comprising 10 lambs. The CON was fed the basal diet, and the STE was supplemented with 0.07% steviol glycosides based on the basal diet. During the experimental period, variations in body weight and feed intake were closely monitored and recorded. After feeding for 90 d, blood was collected to determine blood biochemical indices, and rumen fluid samples were gathered for an in-depth analysis of rumen fermentation parameters and microbial diversity. The outcomes revealed no statistically significant differences in growth performance or serum biochemical indices between the two groups (p > 0.05). Rumen pH in STE and CON was within the normal range. The rumen ammonia nitrogen (NH3-N) and acetic acid (AA) content of STE decreased significantly compared with CON (p < 0.05). No significant variations were observed in the levels of other volatile fatty acids (VFAs) between the two groups (p > 0.05). The rumen microbial OTUs count, as well as the Shannon, Simpson, Chao1, and Ace indices, were notably lower in the STE group compared to the CON group (p < 0.05). Additionally, at the phylum level, the relative abundance of Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes, and Proteobacteria collectively accounted for over 97% of the total phylum composition. In comparison to the CON group, the STE group exhibited an increase in the relative abundance of Proteobacteria (p < 0.05), accompanied by a significant reduction in the relative abundance of Patescibacteria and Desulfobacteria (p < 0.05). At the genus level, there was a notable increase in the relative abundance of Prevotella_7 and Succinivibrionaceae_UCG_001 in the STE group, whereas the relative abundance of Rikenellaceae_RC9_gut_group significantly decreased (p < 0.05). According to the correlation analysis between rumen microflora and VFAs, the relative abundance of Succinivibrionaceae_UCG_001 displayed a significant negative correlation with AA (p < 0.
   05), whereas Lactobacillus exhibited a notable positive correlation with isobutyric acid (IBA) (p < 0.05). In summary, steviol glycosides had no significant effect on the production performance and blood biochemical indexes of Hu sheep. Steviol glycosides can improve rumen fermentation parameters and rumen microflora structure of Hu sheep and have a certain effect on rumen microbial diversity and composition.

AB  - Translocations of Rhinocerotidae are commonly performed for conservation purposes but expose the animals to a variety of stressors (e.g. prolonged fasting, confinement, novel environment, etc.). Stress may change the composition of gut microbiota, which can impact animal health and welfare. White rhinoceroses in particular can develop anorexia, diarrhea and enterocolitis after translocation. The aim of this study was to investigate the associations of age, sex and translocation on the rhinoceros' fecal bacterial microbiota composition. fecal samples were collected from rhinoceroses at capture (n = 16) and after a >30-hour road transport (n = 7). DNA was isolated from these samples and submitted for 16S rRNA V3-V4 phylotyping. Alpha diversity indices of the rhinoceros' fecal microbiota composition of different age, sex and before and after transport were compared using non-parametric statistical tests and beta diversity indices using Permutational Multivariate Analysis Of Variance (PERMANOVA). Resulting P-values were alpha-corrected (Padj.). Alpha and beta diversity did not differ between rhinoceroses of different age and sex. However, there was a significant difference in beta diversity between fecal samples collected from adult animals at capture and after transport. The most abundant bacterial phyla in samples collected at capture were Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes (85.76%), represented by Lachnospiraceae, Ruminococcaceae and Prevotellaceae families. The phyla Proteobacteria (Padj. = 0.009) and Actinobacteria (Padj. = 0.012), amongst others, increased in relative abundance from capture to after transport encompassing potentially pathogenic bacterial families such as Enterobacteriaceae (Padj. = 0.018) and Pseudomonadaceae (Padj. = 0.022). Important commensals such as Spirochaetes (Padj. = 0.009), Fibrobacteres (Padj. = 0.018) and Lachnospiraceae (Padj. = 0.021) decreased in relative abundance. These results indicate that the stressors associated with capture and transport cause an imbalanced fecal microbiota composition in white rhinoceroses that may lead to potentially infectious intestinal disorders. This imbalance may result from recrudescence of normally innocuous pathogens, increased shedding of pathogens or increased vulnerability to new pathogens.

AB  - Host plant specialization across herbivorous insects varies dramatically, but while the molecular mechanisms of host plant adaptations are increasingly known, we often lack a comprehensive understanding of the selective forces that favor specialization. The milkweed bugs (Heteroptera: Lygaeinae) are ancestrally associated with plants of the Apocynaceae from which they commonly sequester cardiac glycosides for defense, facilitated by resistant Na+/K+-ATPases and adaptations for transport, storage, and discharge of toxins. Here, we show that three Lygaeinae species independently colonized four novel nonapocynaceous hosts that convergently produce cardiac glycosides. A fourth species shifted to a new source of toxins by tolerating and sequestering alkaloids from meadow saffron (Colchicum autumnale, Colchicaceae). Across three milkweed bug species tested, feeding on seeds containing toxins did not improve growth or speed of development and even impaired growth and development in two species, but sequestration mediated protection of milkweed bugs against two natural predators: lacewing larvae and passerine birds. We conclude that physiological preadaptations and convergent phytochemistry facilitated novel specialized host associations. Since toxic seeds did not improve growth but either impaired growth or, at most, had neutral effects, selection by predators on sequestration of defenses, rather than the exploitation of additional profitable dietary resources, can lead to obligatory specialized host associations in otherwise generalist insects.

AB  - BackgroundThe impacts of climate change on crop and livestock sectors are well-documented. Climate change and its related events (e.g., high temperatures, extreme events, disease outbreaks) affect livestock production in various ways (e.g., nutrition, housing, health, welfare), and tend to compromise the physical productivity and the economic performances. Understanding animal responses to climate change may help planning strategies to cope with the adverse climatic conditions and also to reduce polluting emissions. Through an interdisciplinary approach, we develop a conceptual framework to assess and develop new organisational models for Mediterranean small-scale farming systems so as to mitigate the impacts of climate change, to improve farm management and farming technologies, and to achieve an effective adaptation to the climate changes. The conceptual framework consists of four phases: (i) community engagement, (ii) strategies development, (iii) data collection and analysis, (iv) business model generation and sustainability assessment. We assess strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats of the eco-solutions by mean of a SWOT (Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, Threats) analysis technique.ResultsThe proposed eco-solutions are expected to increase the sustainability of agriculture and food production systems by introducing new and efficient uses of natural resources. The proposed models are expected to have an impact not only on the environment (in terms of mitigation), but also on the economic and social performances, as they are expected to foster the responses of small-scale farms to the increasingly frequent effects of climate change (adaptation solutions). Among the positive impacts, we emphasise the importance of more stable revenues, a tendency that would help farmers to raise their revenues. Last but not least, we found that the proposed models are likely to increase the social resilience of the farming systems to the challenges imposed by the climate change.ConclusionsThe eco-solutions can support stakeholders involved in Mediterranean small-scale farming systems by suggesting novel land, crop, and livestock management approaches to optimise revenue flows, business models and climate change mitigation strategies thanks to the adoption of a systemic approach, that is not only focused on specific components of the system but instead based on the linkages between environmental, social, and economic aspects.

AB  - Hunted wildlife can often be used to answer questions about wild individuals. Sex ratios of hunted individuals can be important for understanding changes in population demographics and viability. Here we determined the sex ratio of the illegally hunted helmeted hornbill Rhinoplax vigil, a critically endangered species from Southeast Asia, to examine their vulnerability to hunters. Using casques seized in Hong Kong SAR between 2012 and 2016, we identified the sex of seized individuals using morphological and molecular methods as well as discriminant analysis. As R. vigil females can spend up to 6 months of the year sealed into tree cavity nests, they are reliant on males for food. The unique breeding ecology of this elusive species means that males are more likely to be observed than females throughout the year. These behavioural differences mean that there are several potential outcomes which may be observed in the sex ratio of the seized casques, depending on hunting strategies. Our results suggest that sex identification is possible via visual inspection of the gular skin colour and beak-tip markings, but when these are not available, genetic methods or morphological measurements can be used. Our findings also indicated a primarily male-biased sex ratio across the seizures; however, females, as well as juveniles, were also present in seizures. Although removing one sex from the wild can cause shifts in demographic dynamics over time, illegal and unsustainable hunting of any measure of a critically endangered species will ultimately heighten its risk of extinction. These methods and results are useful to conservationists and researchers interested in further study of hornbill populations and their viability and are ultimately important for the conservation and management of this critically endangered species.

AB  - The yak (Bos grunniens) is a species adapted to the hypoxic environment in the plateau area. The heart is a hypoxia-sensitive organ involved in this adaptation. Herein, we used single-cell RNA-seq technology and clustering to determine the presence of 11 cell populations in the yak heart. We analyzed gene expression differences and expression patterns in each cell subpopulation at different altitudes. The cells related to altitude changes are mainly smooth muscle cells and vascular endothelial cells. Of the four transcription factors (TFs, MEF2B, FOXP4, ARID5A, and HES4) found in smooth muscle cells, only MEF2B was specifically expressed in vascular smooth muscle cells. Three key TFs (HNF1B, DMRTA1, and ARNTL2) were also found in the cardiomyocyte module. Compared with data extracted from low-altitude yak, we observed that the high altitude yak has enhanced contraction and relaxation of vascular smooth muscle cells and an increased metabolic level of cardiomyocytes. These may be strategies for the yak to adapt to high-altitude hypoxia environments.

AB  - This paper explores how property rights arrangements affect the equity, efficiency and sustainability of high-altitude rangeland management in Bhutan from the perspectives of rangeland users. Property rights affect how natural resources are allocated to individuals, communities and institutions and how they are managed. In Bhutan, only grazing rights are granted to rangeland users, as ownership of rangeland lies with the State. Three case study areas were selected across Bhutan with different levels of rangeland degradation, governance arrangements and property rights regimes. Semi-nomadic yak herders, sedentary livestock farmers and government officials participated in 40 semi-structured interviews and nine focus group discussions between 2013 and 2014. Findings revealed that historical inequities exist with private leases and some communal leases, but government-supported leases with management rights are considered more equitable. All property rights systems can become unproductive and inefficient with increasing populations, but communal areas are at greater risk of sub-optimal resource use and conflicts. Respondents were concerned about the lack of management rights, uncertainty over future lease arrangements and climate change impacts. This research revealed that (i) assignment of incomplete property rights is detrimental to efficient and sustainable natural resource management; (ii) banning of traditional practices such as burning, clearing and cutting of shrubs and bushes could undermine conservation by triggering natural resource degradation; (iii) granting of management rights in the bundle of rights is vital to encourage provisioning and maintenance activities; and (iv) in the absence of official contracts, deeds or titles which provide tenure security and political legitimacy, equitable distribution, clear boundary demarcation with written norms and rules are not sufficient to foster long-term investment in provisioning and maintenance activities. We discuss the implications of the findings for delayed implementation of the Land Act 2007 aimed at a more equitable redistribution of use rights and improved high-altitude rangeland management in Bhutan.

AB  - Cingulata (Mammalia, Xenarthra) is one of the most conspicuous clades in the Cenozoic fossil record of South America, largely due to the high abundance of disarticulated osteoderms in most fossiliferous sites of the continent. Nevertheless, the fragmentary nature of this material hinders the identification of extinct taxa, particularly in groups that do not exhibit great shape diversity in the ornamentation of the osteoderms, as occurs in armadillos of the clade Dasypodini (long-nosed armadillos). Methodologies that quantify shape variability could offer an alternative strategy for identifying these fragmentary fossil remains. In the present study, we apply geometric morphometric analysis to assess shape variation of Dasypodini osteoderms. First, we evaluate previous referrals of two isolated late Miocene osteoderms to Dasypus, one identified as Dasypus sp. from the Guanaco Formation (Jujuy province, Argentina) and the other identified as D. neogaeus from the Ituzaingo Formation (Entre Rios province, Argentina). Second, we evaluate the identification of a disarticulated osteoderm from the middle Miocene of Brazil to Anadasypus sp. nov.?. Our results distinguish two main generic clusters, Plesiodasypus + Anadasypus and Dasypus + Propraopus, supporting previous referral of disarticulated osteoderms from Jujuy and Entre Rios to the genus Dasypus. This confirms the extension of the biochron of Dasypus by at least 3 million years, from the early Pliocene to the late Miocene. The present contribution offers a new application for geometric morphometrics to evaluate taxonomic assignments of fossil Dasypodini osteoderms.

AB  - Purpose: Neuronal ceroid lipofuscinoses (NCL; Batten disease) are a group of rare inherited neurodegenerative disorders caused by mutations in one of 13 ceroid lipofuscinosis neuronal (CLN) genes. The diseases share a common set of symptoms, including motor and cognitive dysfunction, progressive loss of vision, and seizure activity. A naturally occurring model of CLN5 NCL exists in New Zealand Borderdale sheep, which exhibit similar clinical disease and post-mortem pathology to the human disease. Recent trials of concurrent intracerebroventricular and intravitreal gene therapy in sheep with CLN5 disease confirmed the therapeutic efficacy of this approach. Given the documented natural history of brain volume changes, detected by MRI, in sheep with CLN5 disease, the current study sought to utilize MRI as both a longitudinal readout and cross-sectional measure of therapeutic efficacy in treated sheep. Method: Sheep treated at a pre-symptomatic timepoint underwent five T1-weighted structural MRI scans between 5 and 18 months of age. Sheep treated at early and advanced symptomatic disease stages underwent a single MRI at 18 months of age. All scans from treated sheep were compared to historical healthy control and affected untreated sheep at each age. Finding: Pre-symptomatic treated sheep showed growth in intracranial volume at a comparable rate to healthy control sheep over the course of the study. Whilst grey matter volume decreased and cerebrospinal fluid volume increased in treated sheep, this was to a much smaller degree than in untreated affected sheep. The majority of the cortical regions assessed showed stable volumes over the course of the study, with the notable exception of the cerebellum. Both early and advanced symptomatic treated sheep showed intracranial volumes comparable to untreated affected sheep at 18 months of age. However, when individual tissue types were assessed, grey and white matter were significantly larger, and cerebrospinal fluid was significantly smaller in early symptomatic sheep compared to untreated affected sheep, while the same volumes in advanced symptomatic treated sheep were comparable to untreated affected sheep. Cortical regions assessed showed an age-at-treatment and dose effect. Finding: Pre-symptomatic treated sheep showed growth in intracranial volume at a comparable rate to healthy control sheep over the course of the study. Whilst grey matter volume decreased and cerebrospinal fluid volume increased in treated sheep, this was to a much smaller degree than in untreated affected sheep. The majority of the cortical regions assessed showed stable volumes over the course of the study, with the notable exception of the cerebellum.

Cortical regions assessed showed an age-at-treatment and dose effect. Conclusion: This study has demonstrated that MRI, a clinically relevant outcome measure, can be successfully utilized to assess therapeutic efficacy in a large animal model of CLN5 NCL, both in a longitudinal study and a cross-sectional study when robust natural history data is available for comparison.

AB  - Efficient learning about disease dynamics in free-ranging wildlife systems can benefit from active surveillance that is standardized across different ecological contexts. For example, active surveillance that targets specific individuals and populations with standardized sampling across ecological contexts (landscape-scale targeted surveillance) is important for developing a mechanistic understanding of disease emergence, which is the foundation for improving risk assessment of zoonotic or wildlife-livestock disease outbreaks and predicting hotspots of disease emergence. However, landscape-scale targeted surveillance systems are rare and challenging to implement. Increasing experience and infrastructure for landscape-scale targeted surveillance will improve readiness for rapid deployment of this type of surveillance in response to new disease emergence events. Here, we describe our experience developing and rapidly deploying a landscape-scale targeted surveillance system for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in two free-ranging deer species across their ranges in the United States. Our surveillance system was designed to collect data across individual, population, and landscape scales for future analyses aimed at understanding mechanisms and risk factors of SARS-CoV-2 transmission, evolution, and persistence. Our approach leveraged partnerships between state and federal public service sectors and academic researchers in a landscape-scale targeted surveillance research network. Methods describe our approach to developing the surveillance network and sampling design. Results report challenges with implementing our intended sampling design, specifically how the design was adapted as different challenges arose and summarize the sampling design that has been implemented thus far. In the discussion, we describe strategies that were important for the successful deployment of landscape-scale targeted surveillance, development and operation of the research network, construction of similar networks in the future, and analytical approaches for the data based on the sampling design.

AB  - The chemical compositions of tea (Camellia sinensis) are affected by numerous factors, such as cultivar, climate, leaf position, and cultivation pattern. However, under the same conditions, the chemical compositions are mainly determined by varieties. Therefore, we investigated the genetic diversity of chemical compositions of tea tree resources in China to screen excellent germplasm resources. Three chemical compositions index (including chlorophyll index, flavonoid index, and anthocyanin index) and the nitrogen balance index of tea leaves were measured in 102 tea germplasms planted in Chinese Tea Plants Improved Variety Germplasm Resources Nursery (CTPIVGRN) by Dualex on April 15 2019. Results showed that the chlorophyll, flavonoid, and anthocyanin contents and the nitrogen balance index significantly differed between the 102 tea germplasms. The genetic diversity index values were 2.005, 2.246, 1.599, and 1.838, and the average genetic diversity was 1.922. The 102 tea germplasms can be divided into four categories by cluster analysis under the genetic distance threshold of 11. These results suggest that the genetic diversity of tea germplasm resources in China is rich. This study's results can serve as a basis for the diversified development and utilization of tea plant.

AB  - Herbivory is a major threat to virtually all plants, so adaptations to avoid herbivory will generally be selected. One potential adaptation is the ability to 'listen in' on the volatile cues emitted by plants that are experiencing herbivory and to then respond by ramping up defences. The nature of these volatile cues is poorly understood. Sagebrush (Artemisia tridentata) plants that were exposed to cues of experimentally damaged neighbours experienced less herbivory; this induction was most effective if emitter and receiver plants had similar volatile emission profiles, termed chemotypes. Previously, we observed that sagebrush populations that were in locations with high herbivory exhibited little diversity of volatiles compared to populations with low herbivory. Several hypotheses could produce this correlation. High risk of herbivory could have selected for individuals that converged on a common 'alarm cue' that all individuals would respond to. In this case, individuals of locally rare chemotypes that were less able to eavesdrop would experience more damage than common chemotypes when herbivores were abundant. Alternatively, low chemotypic diversity could allow higher levels of damage to plants. In this case, rare chemotypes would experience less damage than common chemotypes. We examined the chemotypes of sagebrush individuals from multiple sites and found that rare chemotypes experienced more damage than common chemotypes when herbivores were abundant. This pattern was seen among sites and among years with different densities of herbivores. This result is consistent with the hypothesis that herbivory selects for individuals that are effective communicators and shapes the communication system.

AB  - BackgroundMineral-rich licks are known to provide mineral supplements to wildlife species, including mammals. Artificial salt licks have been provided as habitat enrichment in protected areas and secondary forests in Peninsular Malaysia since 2012. However, few studies have investigated artificial salt licks, particularly their mineral composition and roles in different habitats. We used 40 camera traps to assess mammal species diversity and assemblages at 20 salt licks (nine natural and 11 artificial licks) in three forest reserves in Peninsular Malaysia. Nine mineral elements from water and soil samples from natural and artificial licks in primary and secondary forests were analysed.ResultsTwenty-nine mammal species were identified across salt licks, with 16 species being salt lick users, including eight herbivorous, five frugivorous and three carnivorous mammals, most of which moved in groups and solitarily. The mammal species assemblages across both salt lick and habitat types demonstrated a predominantly nested pattern, with herbivorous and frugivorous mammals being the primary users. The artificial salt licks in both habitats showcased the same feeding guilds including species that are resilient to habitat changes. The visitation frequency at both types of licks and habitats suggests that each salt lick user had its own preferences for minerals from salt lick water and soil.ConclusionsThis study suggests that artificial licks may be as effective as natural licks in providing minerals to many mammal species both in primary and secondary forests. Thus, they could be used to enrich degraded habitats. Enriching degraded habitats is essential for supporting the ecosystem, especially in carbon reduction, biodiversity conservation and connectivity between degraded forests and intact forests.

AB  - BackgroundThe evening primrose family (Onagraceae) includes 664 species (803 taxa) with a center of diversity in the Americas, especially western North America. Ongoing research in Onagraceae includes exploring striking variation in floral morphology, scent composition, and breeding system, as well as the role of these traits in driving diversity among plants and their interacting pollinators and herbivores. However, these efforts are limited by the lack of a comprehensive, well-resolved phylogeny. Previous phylogenetic studies based on a few loci strongly support the monophyly of the family and the sister relationship of the two largest tribes but fail to resolve several key relationships.ResultsWe used a target enrichment approach to reconstruct the phylogeny of Onagraceae using 303 highly conserved, low-copy nuclear loci. We present a phylogeny for Onagraceae with 169 individuals representing 152 taxa sampled across the family, including extensive sampling within the largest tribe, Onagreae. Deep splits within the family are strongly supported, whereas relationships among closely related genera and species are characterized by extensive conflict among individual gene trees.ConclusionsThis phylogenetic resource will augment current research projects focused throughout the family in genomics, ecology, coevolutionary dynamics, biogeography, and the evolution of characters driving diversification in the family.

AB  - Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are abundant in body fluid and are critical in cell interaction. Seminal plasma contains numerous EVs which affecting sperm function via transferring regulatory cargoes to the sperm. However, the mechanism of seminal plasma extracellular vesicles (SP-EVs) is still not clear. The present study aimed to isolate the boar SP-EVs and explore its potential function, then identify the key protein involved in SP-EVs and sperms interaction, and elucidate mechanism of SP-EVs protein on sperms. Here, we successfully isolated and concentrated boar SP-EVs, the SP-EVs showed a typical vesicle structure under transmission electron microscopy, most of their diameters range between 50 and 200 nm and express EVs biomarkers CD9 and CD63. We proved that SP-EVs could inhibit sperm acrosome reaction and in vitro fertility. Through a data-independent acquisition analysis of protein profiles of noncapacitated sperms, normal capacitated sperms and SP-EVs treated capacitated sperms, we identified that EZRIN was one of the active proteins that participated in SP-EVs and sperms interaction. Furthermore, we tested that the inhibition of EZRIN could promote boar sperm fertility, which is in consistence with the function of SP-EVs. The results may facilitate future research of SP-EVs on sperm function and male infertility.

AB  - Published faunal assemblage analyses of medieval and early modern contexts from Portuguese archaeological sites remain infrequent. Nevertheless, the attention given to these materials has grown in the last decades, allowing us to identify consumption trends throughout the Iberian Peninsula. This paper presents the results of a faunal assemblage analysis from Vila Franca de Xira (Portugal), ascribed to the fifteenth-sixteenth centuries. In this context, the predominance of domestic mammals can be observed, mainly sheep/goat, cattle and pig. Birds, fish and molluscs, beyond other mammals like leporids and, possibly, cervids, would have complemented this population's diet. Although most identified species belong to domestic animals, the presence of wild species was detected, attesting to the practice of hunting and fishing. These results can be compared to other Portuguese faunal assemblages from the same period.

AB  - In animal assisted reproductive technology, the production of high-quality oocytes is crucial. The yak, having lived in the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau for an extended period, has reproductive cells that are regulated by hypoxia-inducible factor 1 alpha (HIF-1 alpha). This study aimed to investigate the impact of HIF-1 alpha on yak oocyte maturation and early embryonic development in vitro through the regulation of autophagy. The in vitro maturation process of yak oocytes involved the addition of the HIF-1 alpha inducer DFOM and the inhibitor LW6 to examine their effects on yak oocyte maturation, early embryonic development, cell autophagy, cytochrome P450s (CYP450s) enzyme expression, and cumulus diffusion factors. The findings revealed that DFOM significantly upregulated the expression of HIF-1 alpha, resulting in increased the cumulus diffusion area, elevated first polar body expulsion rate of oocytes, enhanced mitochondrial and actin levels, decreased ROS production, and reduced early apoptosis levels of oocytes. Moreover, DFOM promoted the expression of autophagy-related proteins, CYP450s enzymes, and cumulus diffusion factors, thereby enhancing oocyte maturation and early embryonic development. Conversely, LW6 exhibited opposite effects. The inhibition of autophagy levels with 3-MA during DFOM treatment yielded similar outcomes. Furthermore, reducing autophagy led to increased apoptosis levels at all stages of early embryonic development, as well as a significant decrease in total cell number and ICM/TE ratio of blastocysts. Studies have shown that during the in vitro maturation of yak oocytes, HIF-1 alpha can affect the cumulus expansion area of oocytes by regulating autophagy, the first polar body excretion rate, mitochondrial level, actin level, ROS and early apoptosis level, the CYP450s enzyme, and the expression of cumulus expansion factors, thereby improving the in vitro maturation and early embryonic development of yak oocytes. These findings offer valuable insights into the reproductive regulation mechanism of yaks in hypoxic environments and suggest potential strategies for the advancement of yak assisted reproductive technology.

AB  - Pangenomes can facilitate a deeper understanding of genome complexity. Using de novo phased long-read assemblies of eight representative goat breeds, we constructed a graph-based pangenome of goats (Capra hircus) and discovered 113-Mb autosomal novel sequences. Combining this multi-assembly pangenome with low-coverage PacBio HiFi sequences, we constructed a long-read structural variations (SVs) database containing 59,325 SV deletions, 84,910 SV insertions, and 24,954 other complex SV alleles. This resource allowed reliable graph-based genotyping from short reads of 79 wild and 1,148 worldwide domestic goats. Selection signal analysis of SV captured a novel immune-related domestication locus containing the galectin-9 gene and extra copies of the ruminant-specific galectin-9-like genes (LGALS9L), which have high tissue specificity. A segmental duplication in domestic goats generates three additional LGALS9L copies. Ancient goat genome sequences show a gradual increase in frequency of this duplication from the Neolithic to the present. Two other newly detected SVs also have higher selection signals than adjacent SNPs, a truncated-LINE1 deletion in EDAR2 associated with cashmere production and a VNTR-related insertion in PAPSS2 linked to high-altitude adaptation. In summary, the multi-assembly goat pangenome and long-read SV database facilitates detecting complex variations that are important in evolution and selection.

AB  - Key message Bark stripping wounds by red deer (Cervus elavus L.) were assessed on 9026 Norway spruce trees. Wound variables (length, width, area, relative width, height above ground, and angle) were analysed using generalized additive models with spatial soap film smoothers. Wounds located at the uphill side of trees were larger in summer than winter, and wound size depended on the diameter at breast height (DBH) and was spatially clustered. Context In Austria, red deer (Cervus elaphus L.) is the main species causing bark stripping wounds. In winter, they often gnaw at the bark because of food scarcity; in summer, large pieces of bark are detached to help digestion, water, and nutrient uptake or as social behaviour. Aims The aim of this study was to analyse wound size (length, width, area, relative width (i.e., width divided by stem circumference)) and wound position (height above ground, angle (i.e., deviation between wound azimuth from slope line)) for winter and summer bark stripping wounds by red deer depending on stand attributes and to describe the spatial patterns of wound size within stands. Methods A total of 3832 wounds on 9026 trees in nine experimental stands of Norway spruce (Picea abies (L.) Karst.) located at 47 degrees 19' N and 14 degrees 46' E at an elevation of 1009-1622 m were analysed. A linear regression model was fit for wound length over wound width for each season. For all wound variables (wound length, width, area, relative width, position, height above ground, and angle) generalized additive models (GAM) with soap film smoothers, which predict spatial patterns, were fitted. Results Of all wounds, 79.5 % were inflicted in winter and 20.5 % in summer. Wound length (31.9 cm +/- 31.2 SD), width (11.7 cm +/- 6.0 SD), area (446.5 cm(2)+/- 558.1 SD), and relative wound width (0.177 cm +/- 0.098 SD) were modelled depending on summer or winter bark peeling, DBH, and tree coordinates. For wound height above ground (119.4 cm +/- 26.8 SD) and angle (- 1.9 +/- 97.3 SD), no meaningful GAM could be calculated. Seasonal differences between wound length and area were more pronounced than for wound width; differences in height above ground were minimal, but significant. Analyses further showed that wounds were mainly located at the uphill side of the trees. Conclusion The spatial clustering of wound sizes might reduce the efficiency of thinning to remove heavily damaged trees in bark-peeled stands and might increase the number of sample points required to assess deer impact in forest inventories. Also, the uphill location of damages is an important information in inventories.

AB  - Treatment of the planting and breeding waste is becoming a big issue due to their significant quantities. Com-posting could be an effective alternative for planting and breeding waste management which could be used as fertilizer. The purpose of this research was to evaluate the effect of planting and breeding waste on baby cabbage growth and soil properties, to establish a suitable agricultural cycle model for semi-arid area in central Gansu Province. The planting and breeding wastes [sheep manure (SM), tail vegetable (TV), cow manure (CM), mushroom residue (MR) and corn straw (CS)] were used as the raw materials in this study, which were designed 8 compost formulas for composting fermentation. With no fertilization (CK1) and local commercial organic fertilizer (CK2) as the control, the comprehensive evaluation of planting and breeding waste composts on the yield of baby cabbage, fertilizer utilization rate, soil physical and chemical properties and microbial diversity were studied to select the best compost formula suitable for the growth of baby cabbage. And the material flow and energy flow analysis of the circulation model established by the formula were carried out. The results showed that the biological yield and economic yield of baby cabbage, absorption and recycling utilization of total phosphorus (TP) and total potassium (TK) reached the maximum under the formula of SM: TV: MR: CS = 6:2:1:1. Compared with CK2, the formula of SM: TV: MR: CS = 6:2:1:1 significantly increased the richness of soil bacteria and beneficial bacteria Proteobacteria, and decreased the relative abundance of harmful bacteria Olpidiomycota. Principal component analysis showed the comprehensive score of SM: TV: MR: CS = 6:2:1:1 was the best organic compost formula suitable for producing high-quality and high-yield baby cabbage and improving soil environ-ment. Therefore, this formula can be used as a reference organic fertilizer formula for field cultivation of baby cabbage.

AB  - With limited information known about the zoo-housed Sichuan takin (Budorcas taxicolor tibetana), there is a need to gain more knowledge about their basic physiology to be able to better assess their well-being. Our goal was to develop noninvasive methods to evaluate stress physiology in the Sichuan takins housed under human care. The objectives were: (1) validate the use of fecal glucocorticoid metabolite (FGM) analysis to monitor adrenocortical activity and (2) determine the relationship between FGM concentrations and changes in various factors including environmental conditions, reproductive hormones, and social factors. Three (one male and two females) adult Sichuan takins were included in the study from Lincoln Park Zoo. A cortisol enzyme immunoassay was used to analyze FGM from samples that were collected 2-4 times per week. FGM was biochemically validated in the laboratory and biologically validated using pregnancy and parturition. Results showed that 1 day after birth one female had a more than a six-fold increase in FGM. A positive relationship (p < .05) was observed between FGM and temperature for two of the three takins. Finally, FGM values tended to increase during times when aggression (p = .09) and reproductive (p = .08) behaviors were observed. In conclusion, environmental, reproductive, and behavioral factors could affect adrenocortical activity in zoo-housed Sichuan takins; therefore, these methods can be used to assist in the management and conservation of this threatened species both in zoos and potentially in the wild.

AB  - The Wild goat (Capra aegagrus) has had less attention and study than many other mammals, especially in Iraq. We collected comprehensive data about this species in Iraq, a total of 36 records, in order to build species distribution models using Maximum Entropy and seven environmental variables. The results confirm that suitable habitat is limited to the northeastern part of Iraq, especially the Zagros mountains of Kurdistan region/Iraq. Elevation most influenced the predicted distribution. Habitat suitability under different future climate scenarios (RCP2.6 and RCP8.5 for 2050 and 2070) is stable but expands compared with the current period. Areas of marginally and highly suitable decrease, while suitable habitat increases compared to the present. Habitat suitability inside existing Protected Areas was significantly higher than outside. Applying IUCN Red List criteria at the national scale, the species was classified as Endangered. The main short-term threat is, against which urgent action is needed to avoid future declines. We conclude that climate change is not likely to be a long-term threat to the Wild goat in Iraq, but urgent action to stop poaching is needed to sustain many Iraqi mammals, especially the Wild goat. Our applied approach can help understand and conserve other critical species in Iraq.

AB  - Simple Summary With the development of living standards, consumers are paying more and more attention to meat quality and flavor. When consumers choose meat, they directly pay attention to meat quality and flavor, so the meat quality and flavor directly decide meat price and sales volume. Better meat quality and flavor are the crucial factors that increase the additional value of meat. Because of its special nutritional value and taste, yak meat is popular with consumers. The intramuscular lipids can greatly affect the meat quality and flavor, but there is no report on the effect of lipids in yak muscle on the meat quality and flavor. In this study, we studied the characterization of lipids in yak muscle under different feeding systems and further explored the key lipids affecting yak meat quality and flavor. This study can provide new insight into the improvement of yak meat quality and flavor. The effect of lipids on yak meat quality and volatile flavor compounds in yak meat under graze feeding (GF) and stall feeding (SF) was explored using untargeted lipidomics based on liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) in this study. First, the volatile flavor compounds in longissimus dorsi (LD) of SF and GF yaks were detected by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). In total 49 and 39 volatile flavor substances were detected in the LD of GF and SF yaks, respectively. The contents of pelargonic aldehyde, 3-hydroxy-2-butanone and 1-octen-3-ol in the LD of both GF and SF yaks were the highest among all detected volatile flavor compounds, and the leading volatile flavor substances in yak LD were aldehydes, alcohols and ketones. In total, 596 lipids were simultaneously identified in the LD of SF and GF yaks, and the leading lipids in the LD of both GF and SF yaks were sphingolipids (SPs), glycerolipids (GLs) and glycerophospholipids (GPs). Seventy-five significantly different lipids (SDLs) between GF and SF yaks were identified in the LD. The high content of TG(16:1/18:1/18:1), TG(16:0/17:1/18:1) and TG(16:0/16:1/18:1), PE(18:0/22:4) and PC(18:2/18:0) can improve the a* (redness) and tenderness of yak muscle. The changes in volatile flavor compounds in yak muscle were mainly caused by TG(18:1/18:1/18:2), TG(18:0/18:1/18:1), TG(16:0/17:1/18:1), TG(16:0/16:1/18:1), PC(18:2/18:0), TG(16:1/18:1/18:1), PI(18:0/20:4), TG(16:1/16:1-/18:1) and TG(17:0/18:1/18:1). The above results provide a theoretical basis for improving yak meat quality from the perspective of intramuscular lipids.

AB  - Scientific researches have clearly indicated that ocean acidification and warming poses serious threats to coral reef ecosystems. In coral reef ecosystems, herbivorous gastropods have an important function in maintaining the stability of the ecosystem due to controlling the abundance and growth of macroalgal, which compete for nutrients and space with coral. However, limited knowledge is available on the physiological responses of the specific keystone species to the increased ocean acidity and thermal stress. In this study, we evaluated the effects of ocean acidification (OA) and warming (OW) on an herbivorous gastropod Trochus niloticus commonly found on intertidal and shallow subtidal coral reefs in the South China Sea, on the aspect of immune responses (total hemocyte counts, reactive oxygen species level and apoptosis rate), oxidative stress (lipid peroxidation level, antioxidant enzyme activities), neurotoxicity (acetylcholinesterase activity), and energy metabolism (respiration rate and cellular energy allocation), after a 28-day exposure experiment to acidic (pH 7.6) and/or thermal (30 degrees C) seawater. Our results demonstrated that both OA and OW could lead to physiological disturbances of the herbivorous top-shells, including impaired immune functions and oxidative balance, neurotoxicity, and disorder of energy metabolism. Furthermore, results of integrated biomarker response (IBR) confirmed that the overall fitness of T. niloticus were deleteriously impacted by OA and OW, and were more stressed under the co-exposure condition. These results indicated that increased acidity and temperature in the future ocean might impair the viability of T. niloticus in the long-run, which will indulge the proliferation of macroalgae and lead to degradation of the coral reef ecosystem.

AB  - Modern coexistence theory (MCT) holds the potential to study the ability of species to avoid extinction (i.e. to persist) across community types but is rarely applied beyond pairs of competing species. Here, we show that this limitation can be overcome by mapping species according to their niche () and fitness differences (). This application provides three main benefits to study processes of multispecies persistence across trophic levels. First, mapping introduces a novel categorization of species and communities according to the high-level processes at play: frequency dependence (negative or positive), the occurrence of positive species interactions (facilitation and mutualism) and whether persistence is possible without the presence of other species because of trophic interactions, such as herbivory or predation. Therefore, this mapping can be seen as a toolbox to describe how species persistence depends on species interactions. Second, mapping facilitates studying how species persistence responds to environmental changes that shift intrinsic growth rates and the strength and sign of species interactions. Third, mapping has the potential to foster synthesis across community types because it can accommodate co-occurrence of positive, negative and neutral interactions between species. We, therefore, argue that mapping can promote collaboration across sub-fields, as it provides a common concept to link disparate ecological communities.

AB  - Competitive interactions between species can have marked effects on the diets and foraging behaviours of the interactants. Dominant competitors can constrain the foraging decisions of subordinate competitors, reducing the individual fitness of subordinates and potentially driving their populations to low levels. Following a sustained population decline of the bush rat, Rattus fuscipes, in the presence of the competitively dominant common brushtail possum, Trichosurus vulpecula, at Booderee National Park in south-eastern Australia, we investigated whether possums affected the foraging decisions of bush rats. Using a manipulative feeding experiment, we predicted that bush rats would (1) increase visits to baited sites where possums had restricted access to the bait and (2) restrict visits to baited sites where possums had free access. We used camera traps to investigate visit patterns and time spent foraging at 40 baited sites with two treatments, one that allowed full access by both species (full access) and the other that attempted to prevent possum access (restricted access). We also measured additional covariate factors that may influence visits. Bush rats visited both treatments less when there were more possum visits. We also found that bush rats spent less time eating bait at sites regularly visited by possums, regardless of possums' access level. Our results indicate that negative interactions, such as competition, can restrict the ability of subordinate species to successfully forage, contributing to species declines. (c) 2025 The Authors.

AB  - The rich floristic and faunistic diversity of T & uuml;rkiye hosts numerous endemic species, particularly in the southeastern region. Climate change could exert negative impacts on the distribution of endemic species and cause their extinction. Hydrothassa anatolica S,ahin & & Ouml;zdikmen, 2019 (Chrysomelidae: Chrysomelinae) is an endemic species distributed in the Hakkari province of T & uuml;rkiye. This study assessed the impacts of climate change on the habitat suitability of H. anatolica using maximum entropy (MaxEnt) model. The occurrence records of the species were collected through surveys in Y & uuml;ksekova district of Hakkari province during 2022 and 2023 and used in the modeling exercise. Habitat suitability of H. anatolica was predicted for 2021-2040, 2041-2060, 2061-2080 and 2081-2100 under two shared socioeconomic pathways (SSPs), i.e., SSP1-2.6 (low greenhouse gas emissions scenario) and SSP5-8.5 (very high greenhouse gas emissions scenario). A total 12 occurrence records and 9 bioclimatic variables were used to predict the habitat suitability under current and future climatic conditions. The results indicated that bio 6 (minimum temperature of the coldest month) bio18 (precipitation of warmest quarter) will mediate the distribution of H . anatolica under current and future climatic conditions. The areas with wet summers and cold winters were predicted highly suitable for H . anatolica. . The model predicted that the species will expand its distribution range in the future under both climate change scenarios.

AB  - Until recently, most ecological network analyses investigating the effects of species' declines and extinctions have focused on a single type of interaction (e.g. feeding). In nature, however, diverse interactions co-occur, each of them forming a layer of a 'multilayer' network. Data including information on multiple interaction types has recently started to emerge, giving us the opportunity to have a first glance at possible commonalities in the structure of these networks. We studied the structural features of 44 tripartite ecological networks from the literature, each composed of two layers of interactions (e.g. herbivory and pollination), and investigated their robustness to species losses. Considering two interactions simultaneously, we found that the robustness of the whole community is a combination of the robustness of the two ecological networks composing it. The way in which the layers of interactions are connected to each other affects the interdependence of their robustness. In many networks, this interdependence is low, suggesting that restoration efforts would not automatically propagate through the whole community. Our results highlight the importance of considering multiple interactions simultaneously to better gauge the robustness of ecological communities to species loss and to more reliably identify key species that are important for the persistence of ecological communities.
   In the face of the current biodiversity crisis, predicting how species loss will affect ecological communities is becoming increasingly relevant. Previous studies including only one type of ecological interactions (e.g. feeding or pollination) revealed the relevance of the structure of ecological networks for the persistence of ecological communities. However, there is mounting evidence that considering multiple interactions simultaneously can alter the results based on a single interaction. Here, we study the robustness of ecological networks with two interaction types to the loss of plant species, and we show that it is a combination of the robustness of the two bipartite ecological networks composing the ecological community. By analyzing networks from multiple communities, we are able to identify commonalities across interaction types, as well as singularities specific to a given interaction type, caused by underlying biological constraints. Our results highlight that a multi-interaction approach is crucial to better gauge the overall robustness of ecological communities, and to correctly determine the relative importance of different plants species at the whole community level, which can be key for biodiversity conservation.

AB  - Identifying the interactions of functional, biotic, and abiotic factors that define plant-insect communities has long been a goal of community ecologists. Metabolomics approaches facilitate a broader understanding of how phytochemistry mediates the functional interactions among ecological factors. Ceanothus velutinus communities are a relatively unstudied system for investigating chemically mediated interactions. Ceanothus are nitrogen-fixing, fire-adapted plants that establish early post-fire, and produce antimicrobial cyclic peptides, linear peptides, and flavonoids. This study takes a metabolomic approach to understanding how the diversity and variation of C. velutinus phytochemistry influences associated herbivore and parasitoid communities at multiple spatiotemporal scales. Herbivores and foliar samples were collected over three collection times at two sites on the east slope of the Sierra Nevada Mountain range. Foliar tissue was subjected to LC-MS metabolomic analysis, and several novel statistical analyses were applied to summarize, quantify, and annotate variation in the C. velutinus metabolome. We found that phytochemistry played an important role in plant-insect community structure across an elevational gradient. Flavonoids were found to mediate biotic and abiotic influences on herbivores and associated parasitoids, while foliar oligopeptides played a significant positive role in herbivore abundance, even more than abundance of host plants and leaf abundance. The importance of nutritional and defense chemistry in mediating ecological interactions in C. velutinus plant-herbivore communities was established, justifying larger scale studies of this plant system that incorporate other mediators of phytochemistry such as genetic and metageomic contributions.

AB  - In the human-dominated epoch of the Anthropocene, nations worldwide are trying to adopt a variety of strategies for biodiversity conservation, including flagship-based approaches. The Asian elephant (Elephas maximus) plays a pivotal role as a flagship species in India's biodiversity conservation efforts, particularly within its tropical forest ecosystems. As the country harboring the largest Asian elephant population among the 13 range countries, India's conservation strategies offer valuable insights for other range countries. This study elucidates India's elephant conservation paradigm by outlining a historical account of elephant conservation in the country and examining the current administrative and legal frameworks. These are instrumental in implementing strategies aimed at maintaining sustainable elephant populations. Our study also analyzes trends in elephant populations and negative human-elephant interactions, drawing upon data from a centralized government database. Our findings indicate that the elephant population in India is reasonably stable, estimated at between 25,000 and 30,000 individuals. This figure constitutes nearly two-thirds of the global Asian elephant population. India's elephant population occupies similar to 163,000 km(2) of diverse habitats, comprising 5% of the country's land area, with their distribution spread across the northern, northeastern, east-central, and southern regions. This distribution has shown fluxes, particularly in the east-central region, where large-scale elephant dispersals have been observed. Between 2009 and 2020, human-elephant conflicts in India have resulted in an average annual loss of 450 (+/- 63.7) human lives. During the same period, the central and state governments paid an average of US$ 4.79 million (+/- 1.97) annually as ex gratia for property losses. Recognizing the critical nature of these conflicts, India has implemented various measures to manage this pressing conservation challenge. Overall, sustaining the world's largest extant population of wild elephants in the midst of India's human-dominated landscapes is enabled by a robust institutional policy and legal framework dedicated to conservation. This commitment is further reinforced by strong political will and a deep-rooted cultural affinity towards elephants and nature, which fosters a higher degree of tolerance and support for conservation efforts.

AB  - Insect herbivores, such as aphids, are common on plants, yet how they interact with plant microbiomes remains largely unknown. For instance, for the widespread bacterial epiphyte and potential aphid pathogen Pseudomonas syringae, aphids could impact bacterial populations by serving as secondary hosts or by altering the epiphytic habitat through feeding and/or waste secretion. Here, we examined whether the pea aphid, Acyrthosiphon pisum, could influence epiphytic populations of P. syringae. First, we quantified epiphytic growth ability without aphids and virulence to aphids across 21 diverse P. syringae strains. For eight strains that varied in these traits we then assessed the influence of aphid presence on epiphytic bacterial growth. In some cases P. syringae benefited significantly from the presence of aphids, with up to 3.8 times more cell doublings. This benefit was not correlated with strain traits but rather with initial population densities; smaller bacterial populations received relatively more benefit from aphids, and larger populations received less benefit. Honeydew, the sugary waste product of aphids, in the absence of aphids was sufficient to increase P. syringae density on leaves. We conclude that aphid honeydew can sometimes increase P. syringae epiphytic growth but that the bacteria may not benefit from using aphids as hosts.

AB  - Common names allow species diversity to be acknowledged by experts and non-specialists alike; they are descriptors with both scientific and cultural implications. However, a lack of clarity when using a common name could risk altering perceptions of threatened species. This is the case for the Critically Endangered wild camel Camelus ferus, which, despite extensive evidence of its species status, is frequently referred to in English as wild Bactrian camel. However, the wild camel (Mongolian: khavtgai; Chinese: ye luo tuo) is not a wild version of the domestic Bactrian camel Camelus bactrianus but a separate species near extinction, with an estimated population of c. 950. Failure to clearly separate Bactrian and wild camels in name risks masking the plight of the few remaining wild camels with the visible abundance of the domesticated species. Here we advocate the use of the accurate English common name wild camel for C. ferus ideally alongside its Indigenous names to correctly represent its cultural and conservation importance.

AB  - Lodging is a major limiting factor for the yield, quality and harvesting efficiency of selected crops worldwide. This study presents an efficient, robust and non-destructive assessment of lodging severity for four different grasses for seed production, using images collected by an unoccupied aerial vehicle (UAV) in two field plot experiments across five growing seasons. Canopy texture and height related features were extracted from individual plot images and evaluated for estimating lodging severity. Histograms of oriented gradients (HOG) were used as texture features, and three canopy height distributions features (CHV1, CHV2 and CHV3) were proposed. Each canopy height distribution feature divides the plots into subplots and estimates the average height of each subplot. CHV1 concatenates average height of the subplots into its feature, while CHV2 concatenates the difference in average height between all subplots, and CHV3 concatenates the difference in average height between adjacent subplots. The plots were classified using support vector machines into three categories according to the lodging severity. The results showed that the HOG and height distribution features can be used for grading lodging severity in UAV images with high accuracy (71.9% and 79.1%, respectively). However, the HOG features showed a negative relationship to the ground sample distance (GSD), while the CHV1 had a constant accuracy across the GSDs. Combination of the two features did not significantly improve the classification accuracy. The present results have potential to generate lodging severity maps for application in precision farming and thereby to increase grass seed yield and harvest efficiency at farm scale. It should be noted that results and methods from the current study might not be transferred to other crops due to crop specific lodging characteristics and effect of yields.

AB  - Simple Summary Livestock biodiversity is being lost at an alarming rate. It is mainly due to genetic selection for desirable traits and the standardization of productions, but this has determined a dramatic reduction in intra- and inter-breed genetic variability. Autochthonous breeds represent a pivotal genetic resource thanks to their environment-specific adaptive features, especially related to rusticity, frugality, fertility, and longevity. In this context, it is of fundamental importance to deepen the knowledge about these breeds' physiology and to take care of their health in the optic of conservation strategies. This study established hematological reference values in female goats of a cosmopolitan (i.e., Camosciata delle Alpi) and an Italian autochthonous (i.e., Verzaschese) breed reared in the same conditions. The influence of breed, age, and season on the hematological parameters was also investigated. The results have shown that variation due to breed, age, and season in blood parameters could be attributed both to physiological changes, such as the ones given by ageing and melatonin effect, and to adaptive genetic processes, for example, towards gastrointestinal parasitism. These findings can be helpful to provide evidence of the importance of recovering endangered/rare local breeds, which are a fundamental heritage for agricultural biodiversity, and local culture. Local livestock breeds are pivotal to ensure sustainable agriculture and represent a real genetic resource in the context of genetic variability reduction. This study aimed at broadening the knowledge about hematological values in female Verzaschese and Camosciata delle Alpi goats (an Italian local and a cosmopolitan goat breed, respectively) and investigating factors affecting them (i.e., breed, age, season). Blood samples were collected monthly from 34 Verzaschese and 37 Camosciata delle Alpi female goats kept under the same semi-extensive farming system for a whole year. The main hematological parameters were evaluated, and descriptive as well as inferential statistical analyses were performed. Reference intervals for complete blood cell count were established and several inter-breed differences were found. In particular, most of the red blood cell parameters were higher in Verzaschese than Camosciata delle Alpi (p < 0.05) suggesting a greater gastrointestinal parasites' resilience of the local breed. The age effect (p < 0.05) was consistent with the literature while the season effect (p < 0.05) could be explained by the melatonin immunostimulant action and gastrointestinal parasitism influence. Overall, differences in blood values could be attributed to physiological changes and adaptive strategies developed through centuries highlighting the remarkable rusticity and adaptation to the environment and farming system of the local breed.

AB  - The study on the potential use of potassium octadecanoate (C17H35COOK) in the protection of silver fir, Scots pine and sessile oak against browsing and bark stripping by cervids on ten 0.1 ha study plots in the Jele & sacute;nia and the Radomsko Forest Districts during the autumn and winter season 2021 and 2022 was carried out. Naturally regenerated trees Abies alba, Pinus sylvestris, and Quercus petraea were treated with potassium soap and Cervacol Extra PA repellent. For each tree species four study plots were established where 200 trees (100 treated by repellent and 100 untreated) selected randomly were tested. Moreover, at one plot, as a pilot study where early thinning was performed prior, an additional 60 Scots pines were left as browsing trees to evaluate the protective effect of potassium stearate. Damage inspections on research plots were carried out twice per month by checking the extent and degree of damages. Potassium octadecanoate protected best on the older Scots pine plantation, since it had a significant impact on the trees protection in relation to pines free from repellent. In the case of natural regenerated fir trees, a significantly higher percentage of damaged trees protected with Cervacol Extra PA was found compared to silver fir trees protected with the use of potassium octadecanoate. At the sessile oak plots protected with both tested repellents, no significant differences were found in the extent and degree of damage to trees. It was shown that potassium octadecanoate persists on pro- tected plants maintaining an intense odour and durability during storage over the winter period. Considering the satisfactory results and the original research profile (besides ecological character of the substance), it is recommended to continue field experiments with the use of potassium octadecanoate in protecting forest plantations and natural regenerated stands against damage caused by cervids. Further research could consider enrichment of the substance composition with a quartz sand as well as increase the number of experimental plots and their distribution in various regions of the country.

AB  - Coral reefs continue to experience extreme environmental pressure from climate change stressors, but many coral reefs are also exposed to eutrophication. It has been proposed that changes in the stoichiometry of ambient nutrients increase the mortality of corals, whereas eutrophication may facilitate phase shifts to macroalgae-dominated coral reefs when herbivory is low or absent. But are corals ever nutrient limited, and can eutrophication destabilize the coral symbiosis making it more sensitive to environmental stress because of climate change? The effects of eutrophication are confounded not just by the effects of climate change but by the presence of chemical pollutants in industrial, urban, and agricultural wastes. Because of these confounding effects, the increases in nutrients or changes in their stoichiometry in coastal environments, although they are important at the organismal and community level, cannot currently be disentangled from each other or from the more significant effects of climate change stressors on coral reefs.

AB  - Nutrition-dependent growth of sexual traits is a major contributor to phenotypic diversity, and a large body of research documents insulin signalling as a major regulator of nutritional plasticity. However, findings across studies raise the possibility that the role of individual components within the insulin signalling pathway diverges in function among traits and taxa. Here, we use RNAi-mediated transcript depletion in the gazelle dung beetle to investigate the functions of forkhead box O (Foxo) and two paralogs of the insulin receptor (InR1 and InR2) in shaping nutritional plasticity in polyphenic male head horns, exaggerated fore legs, and weakly nutrition-responsive genitalia. Our functional genetic manipulations led to three main findings: FoxoRNAi reduced the length of exaggerated head horns in large males, while neither InR1 nor InR2 knock-downs resulted in measurable horn phenotypes. These results are similar to those documented previously for another dung beetle (Onthophagus taurus), but in stark contrast to findings in rhinoceros beetles. Secondly, knockdown of Foxo, InR1, and InR2 led to an increase in the intercept or slope of the scaling relationship of genitalia size. These findings are in contrast even to results documented previously for O. taurus. Lastly, while FoxoRNAi reduces male forelegs in D. gazella and O. taurus, the effects of InR1 and InR2 knockdowns diverged across dung beetle species. Our results add to the growing body of literature indicating that despite insulin signalling's conserved role as a regulator of nutritional plasticity, the functions of its components may diversify among traits and species, potentially fuelling the evolution of scaling relationships.

AB  - Artificial light at night (ALAN) is a growing threat to coastal habitats, and is likely to exacerbate the impacts of other stressors. Kelp forests are dominant habitats on temperate reefs but are declining due to ocean warming and overgrazing. We tested the independent and interactive effects of ALAN (dark versus ALAN) and warming (ambient versus warm) on grazing rates and gonad index of the sea urchin Centrostephanus rodgersii. Within these treatments, urchins were fed either 'fresh' kelp or 'treated' kelp. Treated kelp (Ecklonia radiata) was exposed to the same light and temperature combinations as urchins. We assessed photosynthetic yield, carbon and nitrogen content and C : N ratio of treated kelp to help identify potential drivers behind any effects on urchins. Grazing increased with warming and ALAN for urchins fed fresh kelp, and increased with warming for urchins fed treated kelp. Gonad index was higher in ALAN/ambient and dark/warm treatments compared to dark/ambient treatments for urchins fed fresh kelp. Kelp carbon content was higher in ALAN/ambient treatments than ALAN/warm treatments at one time point. This indicates ocean warming and ALAN may increase urchin grazing pressure on rocky reefs, an important finding for management strategies.

AB  - Satellite data play an irreplaceable role in global observation data systems. Effective comprehensive application of satellite products will inevitably improve numerical weather prediction. FengYun-4 (FY-4) series satellites can provide not only radiance data but also retrieval data with high temporal and spatial resolutions. To evaluate the potential benefits of the combination application of FY-4 Advanced Geostationary Radiance Imager (AGRI) products on Typhoon Saola analysis and forecast, two group of experiments are set up with the Weather Research and Forecasting model (WRF). Compared with the benchmark experiment, whose sea surface temperature (SST) is from the National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) reanalysis data, the SST replacement experiments with FY-4 A/B SST products significantly improve the track and precipitation forecast, especially with the FY-4B SST product. Based on the above results, AGRI clear-sky and all-sky assimilations with FY-4B SST are implemented with a self-constructed AGRI assimilation module. The results show that the AGRI all-sky assimilation experiment can obtain better analyses and forecasts. Furthermore, it is proven that the combination application of AGRI radiance and SST products is beneficial for typhoon prediction.

AB  - Sociability indicates the variances of affinity and solitary among animals and it is strongly correlated with cortisol levels. This study was conducted in 2020, from September 16th to October 15 (th) , at the Zhuanglang Musk Deer Farm in Gansu Province of China. We recorded behaviours of 41 captive Alpine musk deer ( Moschus chrysogaster ) (in 12 enclosures) using the integrated methods of focal sampling and all occurrence recording for sociability analysis, while non-invasive sampling methods and radioimmunoassay were used to collect and measure faecal cortisol level. The relationship between the sociability of captive Alpine musk deer and faecal cortisol hormone was analysed. The results showed that the sociability of captive Alpine musk deer was 14.754% (+/- 3.026%) (n=41). Individuals in highdensity enclosures (19.090% +/- 4.497%, n=26) were significantly more sociable as compared to those in low -density enclosures (7.979% +/- 2.640%, n=15; P =0.011). The cortisol level of Alpine musk deer was 109.215 (+/- 5.349) ng/g (n=41). The cortisol level of female individuals (120.419 +/- 11.103 ng/g, n=14) was significantly higher than that of male individuals (103.406 +/- 5.575 ng/g, n=27; P =0.008). The male musk deer in high sociability (44.114% +/- 9.364%, n=8) had lower faecal cortisol levels (102.415 +/- 14.885 ng/g, n=8) than those in low sociability (5.518% +/- 1.369%, n=19) (103.823 +/- 5.243 ng/g, n=19), however these differences were not significant ( P =0.911). The female musk deer in high sociability (20.556% +/- 2.174%, n=3) had significantly lower ( P =0.035) faecal cortisol levels (77.018 +/- 17.036 ng/g, n=3) than those in low sociability (7.773% +/- 1.595%, n=11) (132.256 +/- 11.079 ng/g, n=11), which could be related to maternal care and weaning period. It is suggested that the enclosing density should be increased to improve captive Alpine musk deer's (especially female musk deer) sociability in the domestication of musk deer.

AB  - In regions frequently affected by typhoons, offshore wind turbines are exposed to extreme weather conditions that significantly impact their dynamic performance. This study explores the effects of super typhoon Saola on the drivetrain dynamics of a floating offshore wind turbine mounted on an OC4-DeepCwind semisubmersible platform. Using actual typhoon data, we developed a stepwise coupled simulation model to analyze turbinetyphoon interactions, specifically examining how the turbine shaft, gearbox, and generator respond to the extreme conditions. While previous research has extensively covered aspects such as structural dynamics, aerodynamic loading, and control strategies, there remains a notable gap in understanding the internal dynamics of drivetrains during typhoon conditions. By addressing this gap, our study provides critical insights for designing typhoon-resistant offshore wind turbines, enhancing their safety and operational reliability.

AB  - Musk is a precious wildlife resource, secreted by adult male musk deer and having role in rutting and reproduction. As predicted by senescence hypothesis, this sexual trait should change with age. By investigating a captive forest musk deer (Moschus berezovskii Flerov, 1928) population located in the western plateau of China from 2006 to 2018, we assessed the relationship between animal age, body weight and musk secretion. Aging pattern was found both in body weight and musk secretion. Body weight of males decreased from 10 years old, while musk secretion declined from 4 years of age. The relationship between body weight and musk secretion varied at different age classes. Musk secretion represented positive correlation with body weight for individuals aged 1-4 years, while it was not obvious for older males. Our results provide an understanding of endangered musk deer from the perspective of age-related phenotypic and endocrine change, which can serve as a basis for successful musk deer farming, sustainable musk production and improving ex situ conservation.

AB  - Background and Aims Chinese pistachio (Pistacia chinensis), an important horticultural plant species, holds great ornamental value with beautiful leaves and fruits. Seedling propagation of this tree species is restricted by its erratic seed germination; however, the germination mechanism is ambiguous. The aim of this study was to determine the germination mechanism from a novel perspective based on the multi-omics data.Methods The multi-omics technique combined with hormone content measurement was applied to seed germination of Chinese pistachio.Key Results Due to its great accumulation during seed germination, catechin stood out from the identified metabolites in a broadly targeted metabolomic analysis. Exogenous catechin at 10 mg L-1 significantly improved the germination of Chinese pistachio seeds. An interesting result of hormone analysis was that the improving effect of catechin could be attributed to an increase in gibberellic acid 3 (GA3) content rather than a decrease in abscisic acid (ABA) content before germination. Treatments with paclobutrazol (PAC, a GA biosynthesis inhibitor) and PAC + catechin also showed that the promoting effect of catechin on seed germination depends on GA biosynthesis. Transcriptome analysis and qRT-PCR further revealed that catechin induced the expression of PcGA20ox5 to activate GA biosynthesis. Several transcription factors were induced by catechin and GA treatments, such as TCP, bZIP and C3H, which may play an important regulatory role in GA biosynthesis in a catechin-mediated way.Conclusions Catechin promotes seed germination via GA biosynthesis in Chinese pistachios. This study proposes a novel mechanism by which catechin promotes seed germination via the GA pathway, which provides new insight into a comprehensive understanding of seed dormancy and germination.

AB  - Myiasis caused by Calliphorid and Oestrid flies constitute a major threat to the development of livestock industry in Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. Increased veterinary concerns recently paid to the frequent reports on enteric pathogens caused by the larvae of these flies. Although the importance of sheep and goats in Saudi Arabia, the geographic distribution limits of Calliphorid and Oestrid infestation in caprine livestock has never been highlighted. ArcGIS software was used to assess the spatial distribution of myiasis causing flies in Jazan Province, Saudi Arabia. Implemented Evolutionary algorithms in maximum entropy (MaxEnt) was used to predict the distribution map for myiasis causing flies. Bioclimatic and topographic data layers from Worldclim was analyzed to estimate the percent contribution of variables predicting suitable habitats of flies causing myiasis. Field validation was occurred to evaluate the habitat suitability produced by the model. The predictive ecological niche model was found high with an AUC value of 0.95 and 0.93 for train and test occurrence records, respectively, with a standard deviation equal 0.032. About eighteen variables were found to left-to-right markcontribute in spatial predictive occurrence of myiasis causing flies. Precipitation variables enhanced the model predictive power with (57.7%) in Jackknife test. Besides, elevation, NDVI and tree cover shared reduced effect in predicting myiasis causing flies distribution.

AB  - Aim: Latitudinal variation in biotic interactions is recognized as a driver underlying variation in plant invasion success and therefore an important issue in conservation biogeography. However, previous studies have mainly focused on interactions between living plants and herbivores, whereas litter traits and detritivory have been hardly studied along latitude or compared between native and invasive plants. Our aim was to compare latitudinal variation in leaf litter chemistry and palatability to detritivores between invasive and native plants, and investigate which chemical traits determine detritivory and whether they are climate-driven.
   Location: China.
   Taxa: Spartina alterniflora, Phragmites australis, Porcellio laevis, Chiromantes dehaani.
   Methods: We combined field surveys with laboratory experiments to compare latitudinal variation in litter chemistry between the widespread invasive Spartina alterniflora and its native competitor Phragmites australis across their co-occurring range (20.9-40.7 degrees N, similar to 2200 km). For both species, we examined litter palatability to two common detritivores (Porcellio laevis and Chiromantes dehaani) along the same latitude. We also analysed relationships among climate, litter traits and detritivory.
   Results: In five of nine litter traits, we found latitudinal clines, with little difference between the two plant species in how they responded across the gradient. Litter palatability decreased with increasing latitude, but was generally higher in Spartina than Phragmites. Two key litter traits (C:P ratio and flavonoid content) were significantly associated with temperature of origin and with detritivory.
   Main Conclusions: There were geographic clines in litter traits and palatability, with strong links between climate, litter chemistry and detritivory, in both Spartina and Phragmites. Spartina litter, however, was more rapidly decomposed by detritivores, which could create positive feedbacks, and contributes to the successful Spartina invasion along China's coast. Future ecological restoration projects should therefore dispose Spartina plant tissue or litter off-site, to reduce the competitiveness of Spartina and support the conservation of native Phragmites.

AB  - Biodegradable plastic bags (BPBs) to collect food waste and microplastics (MPs) produced from their biodegradation have received considerable scientific attention recently. Therefore, the current study was carried out to assess the co -composting efficiency of biodegradable plastic bags (polylactic acid (PLA) + polybutylene terephthalate (PBAT) + ST20 and PLA + PBAT+MD25) and food waste. The variations in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, micro-bial community and compost fertility were likewise assessed. Compared with the control, PLA + PBAT+ST20 and PLA + PBAT+MD25 both accelerated organic matter degradation and increased temperature. Moreover, PLA + PBAT+ST20 aggravated CH4 and CO2 emissions by 12.10 % and 11.01 %, respectively. PLA + PBAT+MD25 decreased CH4 and CO2 emissions by 5.50 % and 9.12 %, respectively. Meanwhile, compared with PLA + PBAT+ST20, the combined effect of plasticizer and inorganic additive in PLA + PBAT+MD25, reduced the NO3--N contents, seed germination index (GI) and compost maturity. Furthermore, adding BPBs changed the richness and diversity of the bacterial community (Firmicutes, Proteobacteria and Bacteroidetes). Likewise, redundancy anal-ysis (RDA) showed that the co-compost system of BPBs and food waste accelerated significantly bacterial community succession from Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes at the initial stage to Proteobacteria and Actinobacteria at the mature stage, increased co-compost temperature to over 64 degrees C and extended thermophilic composting phase, and promoted the degradation of MPs. Additionally, according to structural equation model quantification results, the inorganic ad-ditive of PLA + PBAT+MD25 had more serious toxicity to microorganisms and had significantly adverse effects on GI through CO2-C (lambda = -0.415, p < 0.05) and NO3--N (lambda = -0.558, p < 0.001), thus reduced compost fertility and quality. The results also indicated that the BPBs with ST20 as an additive could be more suitable for industrial composting than the BPBs with MD25 as an additive. This study provided a vital basis for understanding the potential environmental and human health risks of the MPs' generated by the degradation of BPBs in compost.

AB  - Simple Summary The consumption of goat milk is constantly increasing. However, there are not many studies on the nutritional profile of retail goat milk. This study examined the effects of production systems (conventional and organic) and seasons (spring, summer, autumn and winter) on the fatty acid composition and nutritional indices related to the healthy fat consumption of fluid goat milk sold in the supermarkets. The production system did not significantly affect milk fatty-acid composition nor its nutritional value, whereas seasonal effects were observed. Overall, retail goat milk had a desirable nutritional value, irrespective of production system and season. An increased consumer interest in goat milk has been registered in recent years due to its health-related benefits. This study aimed to investigate the effects of production systems and seasons on fatty-acid composition and nutritional indices for the healthy fat consumption of retail goat milk. The study lasted one year, and milk samples (n = 160) from 14 brands (10 conventional and 4 organic) were collected on a monthly basis. Organic milk had a marginally lower fat and protein content compared with conventionally produced milk according to the declared chemical composition. The production system did not significantly affect milk fatty-acid composition and its nutritional value, indicating that there were no major differences in the feeding strategies between conventionally and organically raised ewes. Seasonal effects were observed in the fatty-acid profile and the nutritional indices. Lower content of saturated fatty acids (SFAs), hypocholesterolemic/hypercholesterolemic ratio (h/H) and linoleic acid/alpha-linolenic acid (LA/ALA) ratio values were observed in summer. Retail goat milk had a desirable nutritional value, irrespective of production system and season, due to the following characteristics: low atherogenic index (AI) and LA/ALA ratio values, and high h/H ratio, desirable fatty acid (DFA) values and health-promoting index values. In conclusion, neither production nor season significantly impacted the fatty-acid composition and the fat-consumption nutritional indices of retail goat milk produced in Greece.

AB  - Archaeologists relate increasing forager reliance on small animals and broad-spectrum resource use to environmental and demographic changes in temperate regions during Marine Isotope Stage (MIS) 2, 29-14.7 thou-sand years ago (ka), and MIS 1, after 14.7 ka. However, little research has examined the factors that influenced small game hunting in the arid and semi-arid tropics of eastern Africa during this period. To address this research gap, we report on a large MIS 2/1 (N = 81,986) faunal assemblage from Guli Waabayo rock shelter in southern Somalia. Dates from the site show repeated Later Stone Age (LSA) forager occupation throughout the mostly arid MIS 2 and wetter African Humid Period (AHP; 14.7-5 ka). Evidence of a major lithic transition between MIS 2 and the AHP suggests changing LSA mobility patterns and economic systems corresponded with regional precipitation fluctuations. However, unusually high frequencies of small taxa (e.g., dik-dik, rock hyrax, monitor lizard) and fewer large and medium species (e.g., kudu and warthog) throughout the Guli Waabayo sequence crosscut both climatic and technological changes. These findings contrast with studies in other world regions that emphasize small game hunting in response to environmental reorganization, changing forager land use strategies, and large game overhunting.

AB  - The livestock industry has developed rapidly in recent decades, but the improper treatment of livestock manure, especially slurry, causes environmental pollution. Treatment technologies are considered to be effective in alleviating nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) losses from livestock slurry. Here, we used published research data to conduct a meta-analysis of the recovery efficiencies of N and P of five mainstream treatment technologies, including ammonia stripping, air scrubbing, membrane filtration, microalgae cultivation and struvite crystallization. Additionally, the agronomic effects of the recovered products of these treatment technologies were evaluated. The results showed that all technologies exhibited clear recovery effects on N and P. The N recovery efficiencies ranged from 57% to 86%, and those of P ranged from 64% to 87%. Struvite crystallization was the most efficient treatment technology for both N and P recovery; moreover, the ammonia stripping and microalgae cultivation technologies were less efficient. The pH levels and temperatures are the main factors that influence ammonia stripping, struvite crystallization and microalgae cultivation, while membrane filtration and air scrubbing are mainly affected by the membrane types and properties. When the equal amount of N or P input to fields, the recovered products (ammonium sulfate and struvite crystals) may achieve a similar crop yield, relative to commercial N or P fertilizers. Our findings can provide deep suggestions and parameters for designing proper treatment technologies to reduce nutrient discharge from livestock slurry in regions with high livestock density and also for identifying the research gaps that should be paid more attention in the future.

AB  - The prevalence and correlation of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) in pig farm wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) and surrounding environment were investigated using metagenomics and real time quantitative PCR (q-PCR). The hosts of ARGs were also studied in this study. The abundance of ARGs decreased significantly in the anoxic/oxic (A/O) process and disinfection tank of WWTPs. New ARGs emerged in wastewater that passed though the anaerobic reactor. The abundances of ARGs in the soils and water near pig farm were 10-and 35-fold higher than those in the control, respectively. The abundance of ARGs in wells near pig farm were an order of magnitude higher than that in the control. Similarly, a high abundance of ARGs was detected in swine manure. After composting, most of the ARGs were eliminated, but sul1 increased 10.5-fold. A high-throughput analysis revealed that the pig farm altered the microbial community structure in the surrounding environment, with 52% and 37% of the operational taxonomic units (OTUs) endemic to the soil and water samples near pig farm in comparison with these data in the control, respectively. The phyla Proteobacteria, Choroflexi, and Actinobacteriota dominated the water and soil samples. In addition, three pathogenic genera were found in the surrounding soil and water samples. A metagenomic analysis identified 14 types of ARGs (>1%), with the highest proportion of multidrug ARGs at 47%. A total of 28 subtypes of ARGs were detected (>1%), with macB the most prevalent. The correlation analysis revealed that several key phyla, including Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria and Acidobacteria, were the main potential hosts and posed a positive correlation with the ARGs. Efflux pumps (60-66%) were the primary resistance mechanism, and each resistance mechanism was distributed in similar proportions in the microbial community.

AB  - Populations of the green turtle (Chelonia mydas), a mega-herbivore that consumes seagrasses, are recovering worldwide. Understanding green turtle adaptations to herbivory and responses to changes in seagrass availability will be critical to interpreting plant-herbivore interactions as green turtle populations continue to rebound. Ingesta particle size and diet composition of two green turtle foraging aggregations (Bermuda, 32.3 degrees N, 64.8 degrees W; U.S. Virgin Islands [USVI], 17.8 degrees N, 64.6 degrees W) in the Northwest Atlantic (NWA) were evaluated to assess the prevalence of herbivory across foraging sites and life stages, determine if there is an optimum ingesta particle size, and evaluate green turtle responses to changes in seagrass availability. Both aggregations were herbivorous (> 90% seagrass/algae) across size classes (straight carapace length, SCL). Ingesta particle size (mean +/- SD) did not differ between Bermuda (2.6 +/- 1.4 cm) and the USVI (2.3 +/- 1.2 cm). Of seagrass leaves ingested, 20-30% were 1.7 cm in length, indicating a potential optimum for maximizing digestion rates. Turtle size (SCL) had a significant effect on particle size in Bermuda (p = 0.01, R-2 = 0.16) (35.1 +/- 9.9 cm SCL) but not in the USVI aggregation, which was comprised of larger turtles (49.0 +/- 6.1 cm SCL). In Bermuda, there was no apparent response to the declines in seagrass availability. Ingesta particle size and volume of seagrass leaves did not decline from 2015 to 2019, nor was there an increase in volume of seagrass roots and rhizomes. These results indicate herbivory is prevalent across size classes at two NWA foraging sites and ingesta particle size has important implications for optimizing the green turtle grazing strategy and facilitating ontogenetic diet shifts to herbivory in juveniles. Ingesta particle size is a valuable tool for assessing green turtle responses to seagrass declines that should be interpreted within the context of population demographics.

AB  - Invasive freshwater species are reported to have tolerance of salinity stress that allows them colonizing new sites in estuaries. Pomacea canaliculata, a gastropod that disperses from its native freshwater habitats to penetrate estuarine environments in invaded regions has raised considerable concern. Previous studies indicated P. canaliculata can survive a short period of exposure at certain environmental salinity. However, salinity tolerance of snails remains unknown in context of a possible long-term acclimation that may further facilitate dispersal into estuaries. Here, in a laboratory experiment, juvenile snails were first exposed to four different levels of pre-acclimation salinity (0, 2, 4 or 6 psu) for 30 days randomly. Snails in each level of pre-acclimation salinity were then transferred to five salinity treatments (8, 10, 12, 14 and 16 psu) separately, with three replicates for each salinity stressor. Pomacea canaliculata pre-acclimated in low salinity environments could survive at least 5 days when exposed to salinities less than 12 psu, with the maximum body weight gains rate (WG, 30.369 +/- 1.418%) and specific growth rate (SGR, 1.326 +/- 0.032% d(-1)). Half of the snails pre-acclimated at 6 psu survived over 25-31 days when exposed to a stressor of 8 psu. The upper limit of pre-acclimation (6 psu) was optimal for post-adaptation of P. canaliculata to stressful saline environments (from 8 to 16 psu). We determined the salinity stress tolerances of the invasive P. canaliculata and examined the effects of salinity pre-acclimation on its survival and growth. The results on enhanced salinity tolerance of P. canaliculata through gradual acclimation is of particular importance to brackish environments (e.g. alkaline lakes, mangrove habitats) of tropical and subtropical coasts. Given the high adaptability of P. canaliculata and its potential threats, early detection and management strategies should urgently be implemented in these regions.

AB  - Pregnancy status is a key parameter used to assess reproductive performance of a species as it represents a starting point for measuring vital rates. Vital rates allow managers to determine trends in populations such as neonate survival and recruitment; two important factors in ungulate population growth rates. Techniques to determine pregnancy have generally involved capture and restraint of the animal to obtain blood samples for determining serum hormone levels. Non-invasive pregnancy assessment, via feces, eliminates any hazards between handler and animal, as well as removes handling-induced physiological biases. Using noninvasive fecal sampling, we conducted hormone validations, investigated pregnancy rates, and determined hormone degradation rates across five subpopulations of pronghorn (Antilocapra americana) in Idaho. Samples were collected during April-May of 2018 and 2019 from adult pronghorn of known sex and age class. Metabolites of testosterone, cortisol, 17 beta-estradiol, and progesterone were measured in fecal samples, and concentrations of estradiol and progesterone were examined for pregnancy determination. Average fecal progesterone metabolite (FPM) levels of pregnant females were more than double compared to levels of nonpregnant females. Fecal estrogen metabolite (FEM) levels did not differ during concurrent sampling. The largest difference in FPM levels between pregnant and nonpregnant females began on 28 April. Pregnancy determination sampling showed average FPM levels for all five subpopulations were significantly different than the nonpregnant female validation group. Nonetheless, pregnancy rates for some subpopulations lacked conclusive estimates due to early fecal sampling. Fecal glucocorticoid metabolites (FGM) levels significantly differed between pregnant females and male pronghorn, but did not differ from nonpregnant females. Degradation rates of FPM and FGM differed across days, with values for FPM from Day 1 being significantly different from all subsequent days, and after Day 9 for FGM, demonstrating the requirement of fresh samples to accurately measure hormone concentrations. We concluded that a noninvasive method to diagnosis pregnancy is possible in pronghorn via progesterone metabolites if fresh samples are collected during late gestation.

AB  - Improved techniques are needed to estimate the dietary species composition of grazing animals. The fecal DNA metabarcoding technique has been proposed as a noninvasive method to determine dietary species composition. However, studies suggest that it is more effective to qualitatively estimate species composition of wild and domestic animals than for accurately quantifying diet composition. The technique, using the trnL barcode, was evaluated with 10 individually penned goats, which were fed hand-harvested plant materials that were collected fresh each morning before known amounts of each type of plant materials were fed and completely consumed by the goats. Goats were fed at 3% of their body weight on a DM basis. Broadleaf plant materials fed were Russian olive (Elaeagnus angustifolia), silver buffaloberry (Shepherdia argentea), western snowberry (Symphoricarpos occidentalis), and wormwood sage (Artemisia absinthium) plus a mixture of predominantly smooth bromegrass (Bromus inermis), which also included small amounts of other grasses such as Kentucky bluegrass (Poa pratensis) and forbs such as leafy spurge (Euphorbia esula). Estimates of the dietary composition of the goats were different ( P <= 0.04) from those of their known dietary composition, except for wormwood sage when expressed on a crude protein basis ( P = 0.98), regardless of whether known composition was expressed on a dry matter or crude protein basis. Therefore, we conclude that the fecal DNA metabarcoding technique for estimating the dietary composition of goat diets is useful qualitatively but needs further development to be a better quantitative technique.

AB  - Evolution of trophic diversity is a hallmark of adaptive radiation. Yet, transitions between carnivory and herbivory are rare in young adaptive radiations. Haplochromine cichlid fish of the African Great Lakes are exceptional in this regard. Lake Victoria was colonized by an insectivorous generalist and in less than 20 000 years, several clades of specialized herbivores evolved. Carnivorous versus herbivorous lifestyles in cichlids require many different adaptations in functional morphology, physiology and behaviour. Ecological transitions in either direction thus require many traits to change in a concerted fashion, which could be facilitated if genomic regions underlying these traits were physically linked or pleiotropic. However, linkage/pleiotropy could also constrain evolvability. To investigate components of the genetic architecture of a suite of traits that distinguish invertivores from algae scrapers, we performed quantitative trait locus (QTL) mapping using a second-generation hybrid cross. While we found indications of linkage/pleiotropy within trait complexes, QTLs for distinct traits were distributed across several unlinked genomic regions. Thus, a mixture of independently segregating variation and some pleiotropy may underpin the rapid trophic transitions. We argue that the emergence and maintenance of associations between the different genomic regions underpinning co-adapted traits that evolved and persist against some gene flow required reproductive isolation.

AB  - Environmental DNA (eDNA) sampling of water is a powerful method for comprehensive and noninvasive monitoring of aquatic animal species. However, there have been few reports of its application to cetacean species. On June 29, 2021, a whale (nicknamed Xiaobu) appeared in Dapeng Bay off Guangdong Province, China. We used eDNA technology to obtain information related to this whale (e.g., species identification and food re-sources) and to trace its possible origin. Fragments of four whale mitochondrial sequences (12S rDNA, 16S rDNA, cytochrome c oxidase subunit 1, and control region) were obtained from amplicons of eDNA collected in Dapeng Bay; sequence barcoding showed that this was an Eden's whale (Balaenoptera edeni edeni Anderson 1879). Analysis of potential prey species (PPS) suggested that this whale might enter Dapeng Bay while tracking prey, mainly sardines (Sardinella lemuru, Sardinella gibbosa and Sardinella jussieui) and anchovies (Thryssa dussumieri, Thryssa vitrirostris and Thryssa kammalensis). Retrieval of eDNA metabarcoding data from samples collected in waters adjacent to Dapeng Bay (i.e. Lingding Bay and Daya Bay) revealed that Eden's whale had appeared outside Lingding Bay up to 2 months prior to the appearance of this whale in Dapeng Bay (early April 2021). Overall, this study showed that eDNA is a highly effective noninvasive survey method for the accurate identi-fication of target cetacean species and prey composition; it can be used to monitor megafauna that are under strict legal protection or to monitor megafauna with unknown conditions.

AB  - The effects of predation risk on prey populations have been studied extensively; yet, how risk is manifested in a trophically linked guild-scavengers-has been overlooked. Risk could be particularly consequential for obligate scavengers that are vulnerable while foraging and rely on carrion provisioned by, and shared with, apex predators. We investigated whether Andean condors (Vultur gryphus) respond to predation risk in a landscape where the main source of carrion are camelids killed by pumas (Puma concolor). We hypothesized that condors would exhibit different behavioral responses to predation risk while they search, encounter, and exploit carrion. We explored condor habitat selection while flying by tracking nine birds with satellite transmitters and monitored via camera traps 41 natural carcasses and 25 experimental carrion stations. We found that condors searched for carrion in areas with a high probability of occurrence of puma kills. However, condors avoided exploiting carrion in areas featuring tall vegetation and steep slopes-selected by pumas to stalk prey-suggesting that condors manage risk primarily through the identification of safe foraging sites prior to landing. Our finding that condors avoided foraging near stalking cover for pumas highlights the importance of risk effects beyond predator-prey interactions, particularly for obligate scavengers.

AB  - Characteristics of preferred or alternative host plants can impact the population dynamics of polyphagous insects. Chrysodeixis includens has become an important pest in economically important crops such as sunflower, cotton, soybean, and beans. In the present study, we evaluated the effects of basil cultivars Ocimum basilicum (alternative host) on C. includens. For this, larvae were fed daily with bean leaves (preferred host-control) and five basil cultivars (Maria Bonita, Mr. Burns, Italian Large Leaf, Vermelho Rubi, and Cinnamon). Subsequently, development, survival, pupae body mass, reproductive parameters, and life table parameters of insects were evaluated. The populations of C. includens fed with leaves of the Italian Large Leaf cultivar showed similar performance to the preferential host (beans). The other host plants prolonged the duration of the larval stage and negatively affected the reproductive and demographic parameters of C. includens. Mr. Burns negatively affected the development and reduced the reproductive potential of the insect. The cultivars Maria Bonita, Vermelho Rubi, and Cinnamon had a negative effect on the development and reproductive potential of this insect. The results indicate that basil cultivars have a negative effect on the development, longevity, and reproduction of C. includens. The use of basil host plants may be a safe alternative to be used concomitantly with other strategies for the management of C. includens.

AB  - The first-ever case of animal tuberculosis (TB) caused by Mycobacterium bovis is described in a striped dolphin (Stenella coeruleoalba) found stranded on the coasts of Sicily, Southern Italy, in 2012. The carcass showed a typical TB granulomatous lesion in the intestine; microbiological culture on solid medium (Stonebrink) allowed to isolate colonies with the characteristic aspect of Mycobacterium tuberculosis Complex (MTC) members. M. bovis was identified by molecular and microbiological tests. Genotyping of the dolphin strain by spoligotyping and Multilocus Variable Number of Tandem Repeat Analysis (MLVA) showed that it was similar to isolates found in cattle herds in Sicily over the period 2008-2012, suggesting an epidemiological correlation with the dolphin case. In particular, we can hypothesise possible contamination by cattle faeces of marine environments due to seasonal rain streams and to the practice to graze animals (cattle, sheep and goats) in seaside areas.

AB  - The aim of the present study was to evaluate the effect of grazing the low deciduous forest (LDF) vegetation on the diversity of the rumen microbiome in growing lambs and its relationship with volatile fatty acid (VFA) profiles. After a 35-day indoor acclimatization (stabilization period), the lambs were assigned to two groups: housed (CG, n = 4) and grazing (EG, n = 4). The grazing lambs had a 14-day habituation period in the LDF (4 h/day) and a further 30 grazing days when fodder intake was observed. Ruminal samples were collected at the end of the stabilization, on day 14 post-stabilization (14DPS), and on day 44 post-stabilization (44DPS). The ruminal butyrate concentration showed a progressive decrease of approximately 23% over the time (p = 0.0130). The qualitative composition (p = 0.001) and relative proportions of bacteria (p = 0.004) in EG-44DPS exhibited a greater diversity, with 107 total genera and 19 unique, significant abundances in 13 genera with a higher presence of Bacteroidales_RF16_group, Lachnospiraceae_ND3007_group, and WCHB1-41. Moreover, significant functional profiles are associated with key metabolic pathways in bacteria and are interconnected by the need to generate energy and biosynthetic precursors and to manage available nitrogen and carbon. Finally, eight bacterial genera were identified as biomarkers correlated with the increase in VFA in EG-44DPS.

AB  - Drought events are expected to limit crop productivity in the context of current climate change. Drought is also likely to affect multitrophic interactions such as those involving plants, phytophagous insects and their natural enemies. We designed a two-phase experiment to test the effect of water availability and fertilizer treatment on the interaction between maize, the fall armyworm and its nucleopolyhedrovirus pathogen. Plants grown in soil with high irrigation and mineral fertilization had the highest shoot and root dry weight. Furthermore, plant nitrogen levels were higher in plants with fertilization and a low irrigation scheme compared to other treatments. Low irrigation of maize plants reduced virus-induced mortality of armyworm larvae. Insects did not feed on plants with high irrigation and without fertilization. We conclude that water stress and plant nutrition can affect virus performance and thereby affect the efficiency of biological control and pest management, especially as water and nutrient limitation will likely increase under climate change.

AB  - Maternal diet affects reproductive output in female freshwater turtles (Emydura macquarii). At wetlands where filamentous green algae are scarce and turtles are functionally carnivorous, females produce smaller clutches. Reduced clutch size associated with food availability may have implications for declining freshwater turtle species.
   Food availability determines the amount of energy animals can acquire and allocate to reproduction and other necessary functions. Female animals that are food limited thus experience reduced energy available for reproduction. When this occurs, females may reduce frequency of reproductive events or the number or size of offspring per reproductive bout. We assessed how maternal diet affects reproductive output in adult female Murray River short-necked turtles, Emydura macquarii, from four wetlands in Victoria. We previously found that turtle diets differ in the composition of plants and animals between our study wetlands. In this study, we tested whether differences in turtle diet composition (i.e. plants and animals) at these wetlands were associated with differences in clutch mass, individual egg mass, bulk egg composition and hatching success. We found total clutch mass increased with maternal body size at each site. At sites where filamentous green algae were scarce and E. macquarii were carnivorous, females produced smaller clutches relative to body size compared to females from sites where algae were abundant, and turtles were more herbivorous. Individual egg mass, bulk egg composition and hatching success did not differ across wetlands. Isotopic analysis revealed significant positive relationships between the carbon and nitrogen isotopes (delta 13C, delta 15N) of the eggs and those of the mothers, indicating that mothers allocated ratios of carbon and nitrogen isotopes to their eggs similar to those present in their tissues. Our study suggests that at sites where females are more carnivorous due to a relative absence of algae, females produce smaller clutches, but other aspects of their reproduction are not significantly impacted. The reduction in clutch size associated with differences in the availability of dietary plants and animals may have long-term consequences for E. macquarii and other freshwater turtle species that are experiencing population declines.

AB  - Achieving sustainable resource use is a priority to meet future challenges. The Gulf of C & aacute;diz, located in the Atlantic waters of southern Europe, is home to a significant fishing fleet due to the richness and diversity of its ecosystems. Managing this area is complex due to the diversity of variables, including social, ecological, and oceanographic factors. Therefore, multidisciplinary approaches are proposed for implementing conservation strategies. One strategy for defining area-based management measures is through the use of flagship species, such as seahorses. These emblematic animals can assist in defining such measures. However, there is currently scarce information on the occurrence of seahorses in the Gulf of C & aacute;diz. In this study, we present the first occurrence data of two species of the genus Hippocampus (H. hippocampus and H. guttulatus) in this area. The Gulf of C & aacute;diz is not only described as the southernmost region of their distribution in continental Europe, but it is also a significant landmark for the genus Hippocampus, as one adult was captured at a depth of up to 101 m. Five management areas based on differentiated benthic habitats are proposed. We believe that our study has the potential to significantly improve conservation of seahorses and induce a positive impact on the ecosystem.

AB  - Large river systems are one of the most important water resources for human societies. However, the ecological integrity of large rivers has been altered greatly by human activities. To monitor and manage these ecosystems, multimetric indices (MMI) are considered as efficient tools. This study aimed to develop and validate a fish-based multimetric index for the Karun River basin, Iran (Karun fish-based multi-metric index [KFMMI]). Eighteen rivers and 54 sites in the basin were sampled in July-August 2019, and physico-chemical and habitat characteristics were used to identify reference sites based on principal components analysis (PCA). Of the 54 sites, 14, 26, and 14 sites were classified as least, moderate, and most disturbed sites, respectively. Fifty-four candidate metrics were evaluated for range, responsiveness, and redundancy with other metrics. This resulted in the identification of eight metrics (relative abundance of native and endemic taxa, relative richness of migratory taxa, relative richness of Leuciscidae taxa, relative richness of herbivorous taxa, relative abundance of cyprinid taxa, relative richness of vegetative inhabitant taxa, relative abundance of slow water flow, and relative richness of edge inhabitant taxa) that informed on species richness and composition, migratory status, functional feeding groups, and habitat preferences. The KFMMI showed excellent performance in separating least, moderate, and most disturbed sites in our study area. Regarding water quality, the KFMMI was classified 16, 5, and 29 sites as good, moderate, and bad, respectively. The discrimination efficiency of KFMMI was 81.6%, which makes it an effective management tool for directing restoration actions at most disturbed sites and intensifying protection of least disturbed sites.

AB  - Transportation stress adversely affects animal health, productivity, and meat quality. Bioactive plant compounds may alleviate transit stress in livestock. This study evaluated the effects of fresh hemp leaf supplementation on blood metabolites, performance, carcass traits, and meat quality in transported goats. Twenty male goats (15 +/- 2.76 kgBW) were investigated, some were given a hemp supplement (n = 10) and the remaining goats were used as a control group (n = 10). The hemp group received 10 g/30 kg body weight of fresh leaves prior to transportation. Blood samples were analyzed before and after the 200 km journey. The goats were slaughtered after transit and the quality of the meat examined. In the controlled group, transportation increased neutrophils and electrolytes, but decreased lymphocytes and hemoglobin. In contrast in the hemp-supplemented group, the hemp maintained this animal blood parameters. Body weight and carcass yield, however, did not differ between the two groups. Hemp reduced meat redness at 1 h postmortem but had minimal effects on its pH, color, water holding capacity, tenderness, and texture after 24 h. However, hemp supplementation did alter the odor profiles between the two groups detected by electronic nose sensors. In conclusion, fresh hemp leaf supplementation maintained blood metabolites and had minor advantageous effects on meat quality in response to transportation stress in goats. Further investigation using hemp supplements shows potential to alleviate transit stress, although higher doses may be required in order to further enhance its benefits.

AB  - While both bacteria and fungi are important for the degradation and humification of organic matter during composting, it is unclear to what extent their roles are associated with abiotic compost properties. This study evaluated changes in abiotic compost properties and the succession of bacterial and fungal communities during pig manure composting for 90 days. The compost rapidly reached thermophilic phase (>58 celcius), which lasted for 15 days. Both bacterial and fungal community compositions changed drastically during composting and while bacterial diversity increased, the fungal diversity decreased during the thermophilic phase of composting. Two taxa dominated both bacterial (Bacillales and Clostridiales) and fungal (Eurotiales and Glomerellales) communities and these showed alternating abundance fluctuations following different phases of composting. The abundance fluctuations of most dominant bacterial and fungal taxa could be further associated with decreases in the concentrations of fulvic acid, cellulose, hemicellulose and overall biodegradation potential in the compost. Moreover, bacterial predicted metabolic gene abundances dominated the first three phases of composting, while predicted fungal saprotrophic functional genes increased consistently, reaching highest abundances towards the end of composting. Finally, redundancy analysis (RDA) showed that changes in abiotic compost properties correlated with the bacterial community diversity and carbohydrate metabolism and fungal wood saprotrophic function. Together these results suggests that bacterial and fungal community succession was associated with temporal changes in abiotic compost properties, potentially explaining alternating taxa abundance patterns during pig manure composting.

AB  - The feeding ecology of scarinine parrotfishes on tropical coral reefs has received considerable attention in the past few decades; nonetheless, relatively few studies have been conducted in high-latitude reefs. Among the Indo-Pacific Scarus species, Scarus ovifrons is unique, being largely restricted to the warm temperate waters of Japan. Nonetheless, there is very little information available on the feeding ecology of this species. In this study, the authors used acoustic telemetry to detect the diel vertical movement patterns of S. ovifrons, video survey to detect its feeding depths and substrata and focal follow survey and genetic analysis to identify algae composition on the feeding scars at Kashiwajima Island, southwestern Japan (32 degrees 46 ' N, 132 degrees 38 ' E). Acoustic telemetry revealed that S. ovifrons spent most of its time in shallow water (<10 m) during the day and slept in deeper water (10-15 m) at night. Video and focal follow surveys revealed that most fishes of various sizes regularly took bites on epilithic algae and detrital materials on rocky substrata at depths of <10 m, but large fishes (>40 cm total length) sometimes took bites directly on live corals (Acropora solitaryensis) at the 5 m depth zone where live tabular corals dominated the benthos. Molecular phylogenetic analyses revealed that epilithic algae collected from feeding scars were mainly composed of Rhodophyta, and coralline algae were less often targeted. Overall, this study revealed that S. ovifrons feeds mostly at depths <10 m, and the feeding algae substrata of the species are similar to those of tropical coral reef parrotfishes.

AB  - Understanding ontogenetic differences in plant defenses and herbivory damage is crucial for obtaining a better understanding of plant life-history strategies, community assembly, and dynamics. Although many studies have compared plant defenses or herbivory damage between ontogenetic stages (e.g. sapling vs. adult), how the effects of plant characteristics on leaf herbivory damage change during plant ontogeny has rarely been examined across species or in a species-rich natural community. To elucidate the effects of plant characteristics, we compared the relationships of leaf herbivory by insects with stem density, plant size, and leaf traits between saplings and adults for almost all co-occurring woody species (56 species, ranging from rare to abundant) in a Japanese temperate forest. In most species, adults were larger, fewer in number, and had leaf traits that were potentially less favorable to herbivores (e.g. stronger, or with more phenolics). In contrast, we observed species-specific directions of changes in herbivory damage between adults and saplings with plant phylogeny or density having no clear effect. The relationships between some plant traits and herbivory damage were ontogeny dependent, indicating a shift from chemical to physical defense as plants mature, although most of the species characteristics studied were highly correlated between stages. Such ontogeny-dependent relationships between plant traits and herbivory damage could cause variation in the ontogenetic changes in herbivory damage among species depending on the value of plant traits. Moreover, the direction and magnitude of the effects of ontogenetic differences in species traits on the ontogenetic differences in herbivory damage varied depending on the traits. Together, these factors could have caused the observed ontogenetic changes in herbivory damage among species. Synthesis. Our study demonstrated how relationships between plant characteristics and herbivory damage can change ontogenetically across many coexisting woody species in a forest community, suggesting that plant traits may perform different functions related to herbivory at different ontogenetic stages. This has rarely been considered in previous dualistic comparisons of individual traits and herbivory damage between ontogenetic stages, and it is vital for understanding plant life-history strategies across stages in relationships with herbivores in natural communities.

AB  - The studies of the long-term effects of insect infestations on plant anti-herbivore defences tend to focus on feeding-induced damage. Infestations by an entire insect generation, including egg depositions as well as the feeding insects, are often neglected. Whilst there is increasing evidence that the presence of insect eggs can intensify plants' anti-herbivore defences against hatching larvae in the short term, little is known about how insect infestations, including insect egg depositions, affect plant defences in the long term. We addressed this knowledge gap by investigating long-term effects of insect infestation on elm's (Ulmus minor Mill. cv. 'Dahlem') defences against subsequent infestation. In greenhouse experiments, elms were exposed to elm leaf beetle (ELB, Xanthogaleruca luteola) infestation (adults, eggs and larvae). Thereafter, the trees cast their leaves under simulated winter conditions and were re-infested with ELB after the regrowth of their leaves under simulated summer conditions. Elm leaf beetles performed moderately worse on previously infested elms with respect to several developmental parameters. The concentrations of the phenylpropanoids kaempferol and quercetin, which are involved in egg-mediated, short-term effects on elm defences, were slightly higher in the ELB-challenged leaves of previously infested trees than in the challenged leaves of naive trees. The expression of several genes involved in the phenylpropanoid pathway, jasmonic acid signalling, and DNA and histone modifications appeared to be affected by ELB infestation; however, prior infestation did not alter the expression intensities of these genes. The concentrations of several phytohormones were similarly affected in the currently challenged leaves of previously infested trees and naive trees. Our study shows that prior infestation of elms by a specialised insect leads to moderately improved defences against subsequent infestation in the following growing season. Prior infestation adds a long-term effect to the short-term enhancer effect that plants show in response to egg depositions when defending against hatching larvae.

AB  - This article comments on: 'Alliance Between Conifer Trees and Endophytic Fungi Against Insect Defoliators'. The article reveals that fungal endophytes play a crucial role in conifer defence against herbivores by producing toxic metabolites and volatile organic compounds (VOCs) that alter budworm behaviour and physiology, potentially reducing growth and fitness. Their study across 30 white spruce families shows that endophyte community composition, influenced by host genotype and environment, correlates with defensive metabolite profiles. Inoculation experiments further demonstrate that endophytes not only exert direct anti-herbivore effects but also enhance host production of monoterpenes and sesquiterpenes. These findings support the 'Plant Partnership (PP) Hypothesis', suggesting a coevolutionary relationship among endophytes, plant defences, and herbivores. This study highlights endophytes as both biochemical defenders and modulators of host metabolism.

AB  - Simple Summary: Ticks are ectoparasites of animals and humans that can transmit pathogens usually referred to as Tick-borne pathogens (TBPs). This study analyzed 683 ticks collected from different wild animals (roe deer, wild boar, fallow deer, and chamois) hunted in Liguria between 2019 and 2022. Tick species were identified by morphological analysis; ticks from the same animal were grouped into homogeneous pools by species and life stage and submitted to molecular analysis for the detection of specific TBPs. Four different tick species were found: the most common was Ixodes ricinus, followed by Dermacentor marginatus, Rhipicephalus sanguineus s.s., and Haemaphysalis punctata. Almost 28% of the 222 tick pools analyzed were positive for at least one TBP. Most pools were positive for Rickettsia spp., and several species were found, all potential agents of human disease: Rickettsia slovaca, R. monacensis, R. helvetica, R. massiliae, and R. raoultii. Varying prevalences were found depending on the tick and host species. Other less frequent TBPs were Anaplasma phagocytophilum (three pools) and B. burgdorferi s.l. (one pool). All samples were negative for Coxiella burnetii and tick-borne encephalitis virus. Significant associations were found between I. ricinus and roe deer, D. marginatus and wild boar, and between R. monacensis and I. ricinus. The widespread presence of TBPs, particularly of several zoonotic Rickettsia species, requires the monitoring of domestic and wild animals and providing specific information to citizens for preventive actions. Tick-borne diseases (TBDs) are a considerable public health problem worldwide. The occurrence of Anaplasma spp., Borrelia burgdorferi s.l., Coxiella burnetii, Rickettsia spp., and tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEv) was investigated via PCR and sequencing in 683 ticks collected from 105 roe deer, 61 wild boars, 49 fallow deer, and 2 chamois, in the Liguria region, northwest Italy, between 2019 and 2022. The ticks were morphologically identified. Four different tick species were found: Ixodes ricinus (66.8% of the collected ticks), Dermacentor marginatus (15.8%), Rhipicephalus sanguineus s.s. (15.7%), and Haemaphysalis punctata (0.9%). Six ticks (0.9%) were only identified as Rhipicephalus spp. Of the 222 pools analyzed, 27.9% were positive. Most pools (n = 58, 26.1% of pools analyzed) were positive for Rickettsia spp., and several species were found: Rickettsia slovaca was the dominant species (15.3%), followed by R. monacensis (8.1%), while R. helvetica (1.8%), R. massiliae (0.5%), and R. raoultii (0.5%) were found only sporadically. Anaplasma phagocytophilum was identified in three pools and B. burgdorferi s.l. in one pool. All samples were negative for C. burnetii and TBEv. Significant associations were found between I. ricinus and roe deer, D. marginatus and wild boar, and between R. monacensis and I. ricinus. The prevalence of Rickettsia spp. differed significantly between tick and host species. This updated picture of tick species and TBPs in wild ungulates in Liguria, where the population of these animals is increasing, shows a widespread presence of potentially zoonotic Rickettsia spp. Continuous monitoring and public information on preventive measures are needed.

AB  - Bovine tuberculosis (bTB) is an infectious disease which thrives at the wildlife-livestock interface. Exmoor has the largest herd of wild red deer (Cervus elaphus) in England, and also a large number of dairy and beef farms. The population, health and well-being of the herd are managed by a combination of hunting with hounds and by stalking. This study used a serological assay to determine the incidence of bTB in the population of 106 wild red deer of Exmoor, the relationship between regional deer densities and the presence of bTB in deer, and domestic cattle. The overall number of bTB positive deer was 28.3% (30/106). Stalked deer had a slightly higher incidence of bTB (19 out of 55, 34.55%) than hunted deer (11 out of 51, 21.57%). There was no clear pattern of distribution except for one region which showed an incidence of 42.22% compared with 16.4% in the remainder of the moor. There was little difference in the incidence of bTB between male and female animals. The age of animals in the study ranged from < 1 year to over 10 years. There was no clear difference in the incidence across the age range (< 1 year- > 10 years) with the exception of a particularly high incidence in those animals aged 1 year or less. There was a significant correlation between the presence of deer with bTB and the number of farms reporting bTB positive cattle, but not between the regional population of red deer and bTB in deer or cattle.

AB  - Risk could vary temporally with predator activity levels or as animals age. While risk could vary spatially as a function of habitat complexity, where open habitats are risky because prey are more visible to predators. Prey, such as caribou (Rangifer tarandus (Linnaeus, 1758)), attenuate predator risk by altering behaviour through space and time. We tested the "risky times" and "risky places" hypotheses to investigate how sociality can mitigate putative risk during risky times and in risky places. We predicted that caribou are social in risky times (e.g., night and calving) because their predators are primarily nocturnal and newborn calves are vulnerable. We also predicted that sociality is higher in open habitats at nighttime relative to closed habitats at nighttime to mitigate risk during a riskier time and place. We used location data collected from global positioning system collared caribou in Newfoundland to generate social networks to estimate sociality. In winter, caribou were more social at night than during the day. During the night, caribou were more social in open habitat than in forested habitat, indicating a potential trade-off between selecting open foraging habitat and the risk of predation. We illustrate that sociality mitigates risky times and risky places.

AB  - Maintaining soil quality is a major problem for traditional farmers in the tropics. Many rely on organic amendments to enhance the productivity of their fields. However, indigenous knowledge about soil organic matter (SOM) and its management has received relatively little attention from researchers. This paper describes the use of organic materials to maintain soil quality by Thai-Lao farmers in a rice-growing village in Northeast Thailand. In-depth semi-structured interviews were conducted with twelve farmers to: 1) identify the indicators of soil fertility they employed; 2) inventory the organic materials they used; 3) determine changes in the use of amendments over time; and 4) understand their concept of SOM. They used many physical and biological indicators of soil quality. They used nine different organic materials: rice straw and stubble, cattle, buffalo and pig manure, rice husks, sunn hemp plants as green manure, charcoal, commercial compost, homemade compost, and tree leaf litter. Recently, use of livestock manure, rice husks, charcoal, and leaf litter has declined because of supply shortages. They do not appear to have a general concept of organic matter nor is there a commonly used word for "organic" in their language. Most of the farmers would use larger quantities of organic amendments but are constrained by their scarcity and high cost. Ways to increase local supplies of organic materials must be found if the government's efforts to encourage the adoption of organic agriculture are to be successful.

AB  - Salmonella is a zoonotic foodborne bacterial pathogen that can seriously harm health. Persistence of Salmonella and antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) in different types of soil under flooding and natural conditions are rare explored. This study investigated the dynamic changes of the Salmonella, ARGs and bacterial communities in three types of soils applied with pig manure in lab scale. Abundance of the Salmonella Typhimurium in soils reduced to the detection limit varied from 40 to 180 days, most of the Salmonella did not survive in soil for more than 90 days. Flooding and soil texture (content of sand) promote the decline rate of Salmonella. No Salmonella was found have acquired resistance gene from the soil or manure after 90 days. 64 ARGs and 11 MGEs were quantified, abundance of these genes and risky ARGs both gradually decline along with the extension of time. Most of the extrinsic ARGs cannot colonize in soil, cellular protection and antibiotic deactivation were their main resistance mechanism. Multidrug resistance and efflux pump were the dominant class and mechanism of soil intrinsic ARGs. Flooding can affect the ARGs profiles by reducing the types of extrinsic ARGs invaded into soil and inhibit the proliferation of intrinsic genes. Soil sand content, soil moisture and nutrition concentrations had significant direct effect on the abundance or profile of ARGs. Soil bacterial community structures also changed along with the extension of time and affected by flooding. Network analyses between ARGs and bacteria taxa revealed that Actinobacteria and Myxococcia were the main hosts of intrinsic ARGs, some taxa may play a role in inhibiting extrinsic ARGs colonization in the soils. These findings unveil that saturate soil with water may play a positive role in reducing potential risk of Salmonella and ARGs in the farmland environment.

AB  - Synopsis Snakes are a phylogenetically diverse (> 3500 species) clade of gape-limited predators that consume diverse prey and have considerable ontogenetic and interspecific variation in size, but empirical data on maximal gape are very limited. To test how overall size predicts gape, we quantified the scaling relationships between maximal gape, overall size, and several cranial dimensions for a wide range of sizes (mass 8-64,100 g) for two large, invasive snake species: Burmese pythons (Python molorus bivittatus) and brown treesnakes (Boiga irregularis). Although skull size scaled with negative allometry relative to overall size, isometry and positive allometry commonly occurred for other measurements. For similar snout-vent lengths (SVL), the maximal gape areas of Burmese pythons were approximately 4-6 times greater than those of brown treesnakes, mainly as a result of having a significantly larger relative contribution to gape by the intermandibular soft tissues (43% vs. 17%). In both snake species and for all types of prey, the scaling relationships predicted that relative prey mass (RPM) at maximal gape decreased precipitously with increased overall snake size. For a given SVL or mass, the predicted maximal values of RPM of the Burmese pythons exceeded those of brown treesnakes for all prey types, and predicted values of RPM were usually least for chickens, greatest for limbed reptiles and intermediate for mammals. The pythons we studied are noteworthy for having large overall size and gape that is large even after correcting for overall size, both of which could facilitate some large individuals (SVL = 5 m) exploiting very large vertebrate prey (e.g., deer > 50 kg). Although brown treesnakes had longer quadrate bones, Burmese pythons had larger absolute and larger relative gape as a combined result of larger overall size, larger relative head size, and most importantly, greater stretch of the soft tissues.

Their adhesive tube feet are essential for survival, effecting secure attachment and locomotion in high wave energy habitats, yet little is known about how hyposalinity impacts their function. We exposed green sea urchins (Strongylocentrotus droebachiensis) to salinities ranging from ambient (32%o) to severe (14%o) and assessed tube feet coordination (righting response, locomotion) and adhesion [disc tenacity (force per unit area)]. Righting response, locomotion and disc tenacity decreased in response to hyposalinity. Severe reductions in coordinated tube foot activities occurred at higher salinities than those that affected adhesion. The results of this study suggest moderate hyposalinities (24-28%o) have little effect on S. droebachiensis dislodgement risk and survival post-dislodgment, while severe hyposalinity (below 24%o) likely reduces movement and prevents recovery from dislodgment.

AB  - Protected and conserved areas (PCAs) target at biodiversity conservation and human well-being, but often reflect low levels of effectiveness. Understanding PCAs social-ecological systems in which people and nature interact in so-called social-ecological interactions is key to understanding the roots of (in)effectiveness, and to leverage change toward resilient and sustainable systems. Despite this potential, social-ecological interactions in PCAs are commonly neglected in effectiveness evaluations. To address this gap, we elaborated a thorough understanding of the social-ecological interactions in PCAs through the following steps: In a first step, we extracted from scientific literature which social-ecological interactions influence the effectiveness of PCAs in general and derived influencing factors which shape those interactions. Based on these insights, we developed an analytical framework, which, in a second step, we applied to a case study in North Luangwa, Zambia. We elucidated three dimensions of social-ecological interactions occurring in the study area: care (e.g., conservation programs), conflict (e.g., disease transmission), and use (e.g., hunting). We visualized relationships between these interactions and associated key variables in a causal loop diagram. Finally, we drew on the case study in Zambia's Luangwa Valley to propose system-specific metrics for key variables central to the social-ecological structure of the study area to make effectiveness measurable. Our approach allows for linking site-specific social-ecological interactions to PCA effectiveness. More generally, our findings call for the consideration of the relationships between people and nature when assessing conservation effectiveness.

AB  - Objectives: The Holocene arrival of humans on Madagascar precipitated major changes to the island's biodiversity. The now-extinct, endemic "subfossil" megafauna of Madagascar were likely hunted by early human inhabitants. Perhaps in part due to preferential hunting of larger prey, no surviving endemic species on Madagascar is >10 kg. Moreover, some subfossil bones of extant lemurs are considerably larger than those of the modern members of their species, but subfossil versus modern locale differences for the comparisons conducted to date lead to uncertainty about whether these size differences reflect in situ change or pre-existing ecogeographic variation. Here, we revisited this question with samples from nearby locales.
   Materials and Methods: We used high-resolution 3D scan data to conduct comparative morphological analyses of subfossil and modern skeletal remains of one of the larger extant lemurs, Verreaux's sifakas (Propithecus verreauxi) from subfossil and modern sites only similar to 10 km apart: Taolambiby (bones dated to 725-560-1075-955 cal. years before present) and Beza Mahafaly Special Reserve, respectively.
   Results: The mean aggregate score for all subfossil elements (n = 12; 0.089 +/- 0.117) is significantly greater than that for the modern individuals (n = 31; 0.009 +/- 0.045; t-test; p = 0.039). We found that the average subfossil sifaka bone is similar to 9% larger than that of modern sifakas (permutation test p = 0.037).
   Discussion: We cannot yet conclude whether this size difference reflects evolutionary change or an archaeological aggregation/taphonomic process. However, if this is a case of phyletic dwarfism in response to human size-selective harvesting pressures then the estimated rate of change is greater than those previously calculated for other archaeological cases of this phenomenon.

AB  - During the conversion of pig manure by black soldier fly larvae (BSFL), the accumulation and speciation changes of heavy metals (HMs) have adverse effects on the environment. In this study, corn straw, rice straw, bamboo chips (BC), wood chips, and rice husk char were added to a bioconversion system to study the accumulation, migration, speciation changes, and microbial correlations of HMs. The results indicated that the addition of BC was most beneficial for the accumulation of HMs (47-72 %) in the BSFL body. In the BC group, the accumulation effect of the BSFL body on zinc (Zn) and arsenic (As) was the most evident (72 and 71 %, respectively). The results of linear fitting (R-2 > 0.90) and redundancy analysis (RDA; 90 %) indicated that the bacterium Bacillaceae (Bacillus) was beneficial for increasing the larval weight (LW) of BSFL, and a higher LW accumulated HMs. The addition of BC helped reduce the total amount (6-51 %) of available states (weak acid extraction and reducible states) in the BSFL residue. The RDA results indicated that bacteria (55-92 %) affected the transformation of HM speciation. For example, Zn and cadmium were mainly affected by Firmicutes, whereas copper and chromium were affected by Bacteroidetes. Proteobacteria and Pseudomonas formosensis affected the conversion of lead and As. This study provides important insights into the adsorption of HMs from pig manure by BSFL.

AB  - ContextWhen human-made barriers impact wildlife by limiting habitat connectivity, simulation can reveal movements lost to fragmentation, strategies to restore corridor function, and potential benefits of corridor restoration.ObjectivesGuided by previous genetic research, we examined desert bighorn sheep movement near two highways that restrict gene flow and modelled their movement and habitat selection behavior. The ultimate goal was to simulate movement without highway barriers as a means to site crossing structures that mitigate fragmentation and to reveal their benefits for habitat reachability.MethodsWe fit integrated step selection functions (iSSFs) to GPS data from 9 bighorn populations near highways in California. After comparing iSSF simulations to validation data, we simulated 8200 bighorn-years of movement-200 year-long tracks each for 41 individuals-on a landscape with and without highways. We derived utilization distributions (UD) from simulations to identify probable high-use locations along the highways, compare these locations to previously predicted genetic corridors and roadkill events, and estimate changes in habitat reachability and elevation without these barriers.ResultsSimulation UDs correlated well with observed bighorn movements. Barrier-free simulations indicated preferred corridors across highway-blocked valleys, often at the same locations predicted by landscape genetics models (4 of 6 genetic-based corridors matched simulation-based corridors), and where bighorn roadkill events occurred (3 of 3 roadkill events occurred at simulation-predicted corridors). Relative to barrier-present simulations, barrier removal increased accessible habitat for 8 of 9 populations, with increases ranging from 7 to 138% per population. Barrier-free conditions allowed movement to higher elevations in two populations.ConclusionAnimal movement simulation can effectively assess fragmentation impacts and reveal mitigation options when other data sources are scarce. Our simulations confirm previously predicted corridors, provide detailed locations for targeted mitigation, and suggest certain corridors pose greater habitat-related benefits.

AB  - Plant cuticles protect the interior tissues from ambient hazards, including desiccation, UV light, physical wear, herbivores and pathogens. Consequently, cuticle properties are shaped by evolutionary selection. We compiled a global dataset of leaf cuticle thickness (CT) and accompanying leaf traits for 1212 species, mostly angiosperms, from 293 sites representing all vegetated continents. We developed and tested 11 hypotheses concerning ecological drivers of interspecific variation in CT. CT showed clear patterning according to latitude, biome, taxonomic family, site climate and other leaf traits. Species with thick leaves and/or high leaf mass per area tended to have thicker cuticles, as did evergreen relative to deciduous woody species, and species from sites that during the growing season were warmer, had fewer frost days and lower wind speeds, and occurred at lower latitudes. CT-environment relationships were notably stronger among nonwoody than woody species. Heavy investment in cuticle may be disadvantaged at sites with high winds and frequent frosts for 'economic' or biomechanical reasons, or because of reduced herbivore pressure. Alternatively, cuticles may become more heavily abraded under such conditions. Robust quantification of CT-trait-environment relationships provides new insights into the multiple roles of cuticles, with additional potential use in paleo-ecological reconstruction.

AB  - The continuous expansion of global road networks, driven by increasing human populations, poses an emerging threat to animal populations through vehicle collisions. This study identifies the causal factors and hotspots of animal roadkill along a 72 km stretch of the Nairobi-Mombasa Highway (from Kyumvi to Sultan-Hamud) and recommends appropriate mitigation measures to enhance wildlife conservation. Data on roadkill incidents were collected from 2013 to 2018 through road patrols conducted by field scouts. Environmental variables, including water points, corners, vegetation, culverts, migratory routes, settlements, slopes, land use, and fences, were gathered using Geographic Information System (GIS) techniques. A presence-absence binary logistic regression model within a GIS environment was employed to identify significant environmental drivers of roadkill and to map hotspots. A total of 408 roadkill incidents (0.944 roadkill km-1 y-1) were recorded, comprising 51 species from six animal groups. Wild herbivores (13 species) and carnivores (14 species) constituted the majority of the documented wildlife, with a density of 0.204 and 0.157 fatalities per kilometre of road per year, respectively. Roadkill incidents for all species combined were significantly higher in areas near migratory routes, settlements, culverts, and corners, while they were lower in grassland, dwarf shrub grassland, open shrub areas, and near fences. However, the roadkill of different animal groups was influenced by distinct sets of factors. Most roadkill hotspots were located between Konza Center and Salama Town, with birds having the shortest stretch and herbivores and carnivores having the longest stretches. Roadkill can be mitigated by establishing road signs, fences, speed bumps, overpasses, and underpasses, and maintaining a cleared vegetation zone along the road. These findings can assist wildlife managers and infrastructure engineers in incorporating wildlife welfare and the concerns and attitudes of local communities when planning and developing linear infrastructure projects.

AB  - Simple Summary Enhancement strategies for native goat breeds are essential for sustainable production. In the present study, milk and cheese derived from the Teramana goat, a native bread of the Abruzzo region, were analysed and compared with those of the intensive Saanen breed. The outcomes showed that the milk and cheese of the Teramana were richer in some fatty acids, mainly linoleic acid. A low concentration of compounds such as ketones and esters, and a higher concentration of carboxylic acids found in Teramana cheeses improve the cheese's oxidative stability during ripening. The variations in volatile profile, lipolytic action and technological characteristics were confirmed by sensory analyses. Our findings open new prospects for the valorisation and preservation of the Teramana goat. The preservation and enhancement of native breeds is a central issue to initiate new breeding policies, which are sustainable and adapted to climate changes. The aim of this study was the characterisation of the qualitative traits of milk and cheese obtained from Teramana goats compared with Saanen goats reared in the same breeding facilities or environment. The research involved 41 Teramana goats and 40 Saanen goats. The milk of each group was collected and used to produce cheese, which was analysed fresh and after 30 and 60 days of ripening. Cheese samples were subjected to evaluations of the physical parameters, including colour and the TPA test, in addition to chemical evaluations that were focused on the determination of total lipids, fatty acids composition, volatile profile and proteolysis. The results showed the Teramana goat to be rich in fat, characterised by a significant increase in conjugates of linoleic acid (CLA), which are attributed to important health benefits. The analysis of volatile compounds showed more oxidative stability of Teramana goats' cheeses during the ripening. The results from sensory analyses indicated an improved hardness and yellowness, which could be accompanied by an improvement in customer acceptance. In conclusion, our study shows interesting results regarding the milk and cheese from the Teramana goat, as well as a positive evaluation by consumers, findings that encourage the importance of promoting native breeds.

AB  - Tetracyclines (TCs) are one of the most widely used antibiotics in livestock and poultry industry. Sichuan province and Chongqing city are the provinces and cities with the most concentrated purple soil distribution in China, as well as the largest livestock and poultry breeding scale. Purple soils with low organic carbon content and poor structure, and manure fertilizers were heavily applied to improve soil quality. However, the research on antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) dis-persal in purple soils is limited. Overall, 234 ARGs subtypes belonging to 15 types were detected in all soils. Long-term application of livestock manures significantly changed the characteristics of ARGs, mobile genetic elements (MGEs), path -ogen species and bacterial communities in the soil, and increased by 103.2 %, 13.1 %, 188.6 % and 43.7 % in chicken manure treatments compared with the control, respectively. Partial equation PLS-PM analysis further reveals that the main driving factor of ARGs is bacterial abundance, while bacterial diversity has a negative effect on ARGs abundance. Through ANOVA and network analysis, it was found that 30 ARGs were significantly affected by manure, its relative abun-dance is 0.8-1.4 times that of the control treatment. The qPCR results also proved that the relative abundance of ARGs including sul2, etc. increased with the increase of manure application and these resistance genes in chicken manure treat-ments were higher than in pig manure treatments. These resistance genes pose a high risk to public health, and chicken manure application posed a higher risk than pig manure. The TC content in the 40-60 cm soil layer was higher in medium-and high-volume pig manure, which was at risk of being transported to groundwater. Our research results deepen the understanding of ARGs transmission in purple soil under agricultural activities and emphasize the species and distribution of antibiotic resistance genes may differ across soil and manure types.

AB  - Aerobic composting was carried out in a greenhouse using home-made compost bins, and the changes in humus(HS) composition of composted manure with different proportions of wood vinegar(WV) added to pig manure and rice straw as raw materials were studied. Since the temperature, water content and pH were very different from those of the summer compost, they were used as basic evaluation indices of compost maturity. Rice straw(RS) and Swine manure (SM) were used as test materials, and the water-soluble carbon (CWSS), extractable humic carbon (CHE), humic carbon (CHA), humic carbon (CFA) and humic carbon (CHU) of the materials were investigated, and the humus decomposition coefficients were dynamically analyzed. The findings demonstrated that 1.25% and 1.75% wood vinegar affect humification. Meanwhile, the results of Ratio of absorbance of water-soluble organic substances at 465 and 665 under UV spectrophotometer (E4/E6) indicated that the aromatic ring of 1.75% WV solution was more stable after condensation, and the decomposition of hominin as a HS stabilizing component was more complete at the concentration of 1.75%. Consequently, this study revealed that WV at a concentration of 1.75% was more efficient in stimulating pile decomposition in cold conditions.

AB  - Goodfellow's tree kangaroos (Dendrolagus goodfellowi) are an endangered, arboreal macropod native to the lower, mid-montane rainforests of Papua New Guinea. Despite a number of holders keeping D. goodfellowi in zoos across the world, there is a lack of recent published work on this species. Here, we present daytime activity budgets, document height use and provide husbandry information for two Goodfellow's tree kangaroos (Dendrolagus goodfellowi buergersi) housed at Chester Zoo, UK. Throughout the observation period, both individuals spent the majority of their time resting within the environment but also spent time engaging in vigilance, travel and feeding behaviour. Additionally, despite the age and sex differences of the study individuals, both animals used the highest height level in the indoor habitat most frequently. We aim to share our information and encourage knowledge transfer with other holders, to both increase understanding and promote evidence-based management of this species.

AB  - Parasitoid wasps are the most successful group of insect parasitoids, comprising more than half the known diversity of Hymenoptera and probably most of the unknown diversity. This lifestyle has enabled them to be used as pest control agents conferring substantial economic benefits to global agriculture. Major lineages of parasitoid wasps include Ichneumonoidea, Ceraphronoidea, Proctotrupomorpha, and a number of aculeate families. The parasitoid lifestyle arose only once among basal Hymenoptera, in the common ancestor of the Orussidae and Apocrita some 200+ Ma ago. The ancestral parasitoid wasp was probably an idiobiont on wood-living beetle larvae. From this comparatively simple biology, Hymenoptera radiated into an incredible diversity of hosts and parasitoid lifestyles, including hyperparasitoidism, kleptoparasitoidism, egg parasitoidism, and polyembryony, in several instances co-opting viruses to subdue their hosts. Many lineages evolved beyond the parasitoid niche, becoming secondarily herbivorous or predatory nest provisioners and eventually giving rise to most instances of insect societies.

AB  - This study provides information about the diet across geographic areas and throughout ontogeny and sex of two coastal and commercial batoid species in Peru (Chilean eagle ray Myliobatis chilensis and Pacific guitarfish Pseudobatos planiceps). Data was collected in the central coast (13 degrees 30 ' S to 14 degrees 30 ' S; Pisco district, Lima) and in the northern coast (13 degrees 12 ' S to 13 degrees 49 ' S; San Jose district, Lambayeque) off Peru during the second semester of the years 2015 and 2016 (i.e., winter and spring) in an El Nino event. A total of 357 stomach contents were analyzed in northern and central Peru with different oceanographic and ecological conditions. In the central coast, M. chilensis showed a high trophic position (tertiary consumer) due to its high consumption of Peruvian anchoveta (Engraulis ringens), while P. planiceps had a lower trophic position (secondary consumer) and a less specialized diet of benthic invertebrates (i.e., crustaceans and mollusks) and pelagic fish (e.g., E. ringens). In the northern coast, both species preyed mainly upon benthic invertebrates and to a lesser degree on fish; therefore, their trophic position was lower. Dietary variation was influenced by species, geographic location, and ontogeny. The diet variability between geographic locations shows insights of these batoids' trophic plasticity and opportunistic feeding behavior in response to differences in the local prey availability, an effect that may be amplified during the El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO). The spatial variation in this species diet may indicate that they play different ecological roles in distinct environments. This study contributes to the scarce literature about batoids' ecology in the southeast Pacific Ocean and presents novel information on habitat-specific diet composition.

AB  - Domestication-related changes in the chemical traits of crop plants affect parasitoid foraging success, development, and survival. For example, herbivore-induced changes in the production of volatiles by domesticated plants can enhance or reduce parasitoid attraction. While the trade-off between nutrient content and chemical defense in cultivated plants can increase the suitability of hosts for parasitoids, their increased health and size can positively affect their immune response against parasitoids. Overall, plant domestication is expected to significantly affect their relationship with parasitoids due to altered plant morphology, physical characteristics, chemical defenses, and new plant associations. This review highlights the need for research on the effects of plant domestication on host-parasitoid interactions in the interest of better controlling insect pests.

AB  - Simple Summary The present study aimed to isolate Corynebacterium pseudotuberculosis from caseous lymphadenitis (CLA) in smallholder sheep and goats. Thereafter, antimicrobial resistance determinants, virulence characteristics, and phylogenetic analysis of the isolates were investigated. Our results revealed that 24.54% (54/220) of examined animals showed CLA-compatible lesions from which C. pseudotuberculosis was isolated. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing revealed that all isolates were resistant to bacitracin and florfenicol. Additionally, 92.6% of the isolates displayed resistance to penicillin and erythromycin, while none of the isolates were resistant to norfloxacin. Interestingly, 16.7% of C. pseudotuberculosis isolates recovered from sheep showed vancomycin resistance. Molecular characterization revealed that PLD, PIP, and FagA virulence genes were detected in all examined C. pseudotuberculosis isolates. The bla (& beta;-lactam) resistance gene was present in all isolates. Additionally, 83% of sheep isolates carried the aminoglycoside (aph(3 & DPRIME;)-lb), chloramphenicol (cat1), and bacitracin (bcrA) resistance genes. Notably, the glycopeptide (vanA) resistance gene was detected in 8% of the sheep isolates as a first report. Enterobacterial Repetitive Intergenic Consensus Polymerase Chain Reaction (ERIC-PCR) genotyping of 10 multi-drug resistant C. pseudotuberculosis isolates showed a high similarity index of 83.6% between isolates from sheep and goats. Nucleotide sequence analysis of partial 16S rRNA sequences of these isolates showed 98.83% similarities with biovar Ovis of globally available reference sequences on the Genbank database. In conclusion, this study emphasized the high isolation rate of C. pseudotuberculosis and its molecular characterization in smallholder sheep and goats in four districts in Egypt. Caseous lymphadenitis (CLA) is a bacterial infection caused by Corynebacterium pseudotuberculosis (C. pseudotuberculosis) that affects sheep and goats, leading to abscess formation in their lymph nodes. The present study aimed to isolate and identify C. pseudotuberculosis from CLA in smallholder sheep and goats, and determine the resistance patterns, virulence, and resistance genes of the isolates. Additionally, genotypic and phylogenetic analysis of the isolates was conducted using ERIC-PCR and DNA sequencing techniques. A cross-sectional study examined 220 animals (130 sheep and 90 goats) from 39 smallholder flocks for clinical signs of CLA. Fifty-four (24.54%) animals showed CLA-compatible lesions, confirmed by C. pseudotuberculosis isolation and PCR identification. Sheep had a lower infection rate of CLA (18.46%) compared with goats (33.3%). Antimicrobial susceptibility testing of 54 C. pseudotuberculosis isolates to 24 antimicrobial drugs revealed that they were 100% resistant to bacitracin and florfenicol, while none of the isolates were resistant to norfloxacin. A high resistance rate was observed for penicillin and erythromycin (92.6% each). Interestingly, 16.7% of C. pseudotuberculosis isolates recovered from sheep showed vancomycin resistance. Molecular characterization of C. pseudotuberculosis isolates revealed that PLD, PIP, and FagA virulence genes were present in all examined isolates. However, the FagB, FagC, and FagD genes were detected in 24 (100%), 20 (83%), and 18 (75%) of the sheep isolates, and 26 (87%), 26 (87%), and 18 (60%) of the goat isolates, respectively. The & beta;-lactam resistance gene was present in all isolates.
   Furthermore, 83% of the sheep isolates carried the aminoglycoside (aph(3 & DPRIME;)-lb), chloramphenicol (cat1), and bacitracin (bcrA) resistance genes. Among the isolates recovered from goats, 73% were found to contain macrolides (ermX), sulfonamide (sul1), and bacitracin (bcrA) resistance genes. It is worrisome that the glycopeptide (vanA) resistance gene was detected in 8% of the sheep isolates as a first report. ERIC-PCR genotyping of 10 multi-drug-resistant C. pseudotuberculosis isolates showed a high similarity index of 83.6% between isolates from sheep and goats. Nucleotide sequence analysis of partial 16S rRNA sequences of C. pseudotuberculosis revealed 98.83% similarity with biovar Ovis of globally available reference sequences on the Genbank database. Overall, our findings might indicate that C. pseudotuberculosis infection in smallholders in Egypt might be underestimated despite the significant financial impact on animal husbandry and potential health hazards it poses. Moreover, this study highlights the importance of implementing a sustainable control strategy and increasing knowledge and awareness among smallholder breeders to mitigate the economic impact of CLA.

AB  - Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) is widely used in aquaculture to prevent and control fish mortality often associated with fungal, bacterial, and parasitic infections. Its main advantage by its reduced environmental impact. However, H2O2 affects redox regulation of cell survival and proliferation, controls inflammatory and immune responses, and is related to oxidative stress. Here we evaluated the behavioral response, opercular beats, and weight loss as stress indicators in captive-bred Hippocampus reidi seahorses exposed to four different concentrations of H2O2 (4.4 mM, 10.9 mM, 12.0 mM, and 13.0 mM). The lowest concentration (4.4 mM) was considered safe up to 60 min of exposure, with little impact on weight loss, behavior changes, and opercular beats. Conversely, H2O2 concentrations & GE;10.9 mM led to a high frequency of stress-associated behaviors (irregular swimming, pipe, and curled tail), severe alterations in locomotion and opercular beats, and were lethal at 12 mM and 13 mM. The lowest dose tested increased the locomotion time of seahorses by 55% and decreased benthic behavior by 47% compared to seahorses not exposed to H2O2. The opercular beats were increased in the presence of H2O2 following a dose-response curve. H2O2 exposure induced a significant decrease in the mean body weight of the seahorses in a dose-dependent manner. We conclude that H2O2 can be used as a potential treatment by immersion (i.e. bath) for H. reidi in a concentration of 4.4 mM for 60 min.

AB  - This study was aimed to clarify the effects of stumping on root and leaf traits as well as the tradeoffs and synergies of decaying Hippophae rhamnoides in feldspathic sandstone areas, and to select the optimal stump height that contributed to the recovery and growth of H. rhamnoides. variations and coordination between leaf traits and fine root traits of H. rhamnoides were studied at different stump heights (0, 10, 15, 20 cm, and no stumping) in feldspathic sandstone areas. All functional traits of the leaves and roots, except the leaf C content (LC) and the fine root C content (FRC), were significantly different among different stump heights. The total variation coefficient was the largest in the specific leaf area (SLA), which is therefore the most sensitive trait. Compared to non-stumping, SLA, leaf N content (LN), specific root length (SRL) and fine root N content (FRN) all improved significantly at stump height of 15 cm, but leaf tissue density (LTD), leaf dry matter content (LDMC), leaf carbon to nitrogen ratio (LC : LN), fine root tissue density (FRTD), fine root dry matter content (FRDMC) and fine root carbon to nitrogen ratio (FRC : FRN) all decreased significantly. The leaf traits of H. rhamnoides at different stump heights follow the leaf economic spectrum, and the fine roots show a similar trait syndrome to the leaves. SLA and LN are positively correlated with SRL and FRN and negatively with FRTD and FRC : FRN. LDMC and LC : LN are positively correlated with FRTD and FRC : FRN, and negatively correlated SRL and RN. The stumped H. rhamnoides changes to the 'rapid investment-return type' resource trade-offs strategy, and the growth rate is maximized at the stump height of 15 cm. Our findings are critical to the prevention and control of vegetation recovery and soil erosion in feldspathic sandstone areas.

AB  - Context. Vehicle collisions with wildlife can injure or kill animals, threaten human safety, and threaten the viability of rare species. This has led to a focus in road-ecology research on identifying the key predictors of 'road-kill' risk, with the goal of guiding management to mitigate its impact. However, because of the complex and context-dependent nature of the causes of risk exposure, modelling road-kill data in ways that yield consistent recommendations has proven challenging. Aim. Here we used a multi-model machine-learning approach to identify the spatiotemporal predictors, such as traffic volume, road shape, surrounding vegetation and distance to human settlements, associated with road-kill risk. Methods. We collected data on the location, identity and wildlife body size of each road mortality across four seasons along eight roads in southern Tasmania, a 'road-kill hotspot' of management concern. We focused on three large-bodied and frequently affected crepuscular Australian marsupial herbivore species, the rufous-bellied pademelon (Thylogale billardierii), Bennett's wallaby (Macropus rufogriseus) and the bare-nosed wombat (Vombatus ursinus). We fit the point-location data using 'lasso-regularisation' of a logistic generalised linear model (LL-GLM) and out-of-bag optimisation of a decision-tree-based 'random forests' (RF) algorithm for optimised predictions. Results. The RF model, with high-level feature interactions, yielded superior out-of-sample prediction results to the linear additive model, with a RF classification accuracy of 84.8% for the 871 road-kill observations and a true skill statistic of 0.708, compared with 61.2% and 0.205 for the LL-GLM. The lasso rejected road visibility and human density, ranking roadside vegetation type and presence of barrier fencing as the most influential predictors of road-kill locality. Conclusions. Forested areas with no roadside barrier fence along curved sections of road posed the highest risk to animals. Seasonally, the frequency of wildlife-vehicle collisions increased notably for females during oestrus, when they were more dispersive and so had a higher encounter rate with roads. Implications. These findings illustrate the value of using a combination of attributive and predictive modelling using machine learning to rank and interpret a complexity of possible predictors of road-kill risk, as well as offering a guide to practical management interventions that can mitigate road-related hazards.

AB  - The value enhancement of Guadeloupe's private forests (48% of the total) is a major challenge for the territory in terms of agroecological transition combined with diverse ecosystem services (ES). In many Latin American regions, agroforestry systems (AFS) include a significant proportion of livestock, but very few are described in Guadeloupe. In this study, AFS including livestock activities were classified through semi-open interviews (n = 50) based on two dimensions: the agricultural region and the farmer's main production strategy. Results showed that, on average, AFS are family farming systems (more than 30%) and the percentage of farmers with multiple activities is high (77%). Mixed tree-crop-livestock systems are very frequent, with 1/3rd of the sub-units devoted to animal husbandry. Farmers preferably raise small ruminants, backyard animals, and large herbivores (20 to 25% of answers each), and to a lesser extent raise pigs and keep bees (12% each). Mixed animal units exist (50%) with between two and six species. More than 80% of farmers use their farm resources (pastures, natural fodder trees or crop by-products) to feed their animals. Even though self-consumption remains widespread (50% of responses), 80% of the farmers want to give a more economic orientation to their activities. The other responses (16%) concerned socio-cultural functions. Several ES are described and are discussed here at different levels (farm, territory, society). In conclusion, in the forested area of Guadeloupe, there is a potential for the development of efficient livestock farming using an agroecological approach. Complete mixed systems (tree-crop-livestock) should be promoted for the provision of multiple ES.

AB  - Ecotourism is increasing worldwide for financial, educational and social purposes. Organized viewing of wildlife, especially at feeding sites where wildlife is "ready-to-view", increases the opportunities for tourists to observe animals in the wild. However, feeding sites might retain only a subsample of wild populations. We thus hypothesized that such human intervention could induce population subdivisions and alter random mating by artificially creating small groups. The endangered Yunnan snub-nosed monkey (Rhinopi-thecus bieti) is an emblematic example reflecting the contradictions between conservation and ecotourism. In Gehuaqing/Xiangguqing (Yunnan, China), some individuals are maintained at feeding sites, while the rest of the monkey subpopulation wanders in a large surrounding area. Using faecal sampling and molecular analyses, we showed that this subpopulation is genetically structured into two moderately differentiated subgroups. The fed subgroup exhibited lower genetic diversity and higher relatedness than the rest of the subpopulation. Simulation model results indicated that a single translocation probably would not restore genetic diversity in fed individuals. Thus, feeding sites implementation and associated management practices might rapidly induce founder effects. We discuss the possibilities of conciliating ecotourism and the conservation of endangered animal species from this viewpoint.

AB  - High mortality poses a serious threat to sustainable conservation of the African elephant (Loxodonta africana). Using detected carcass data collected by the Kenya Wildlife Service (KWS) during 1992-2017, we analyze temporal and spatial variation in elephant mortality in Kenya. We investigate the major mortality causes and means used to kill elephants, carcass category, tusk recovery status, variation in mortality with elephant age and sex classes, differences between inside and outside protected areas (PAs), the Proportion of Illegally Killed Elephants (PIKE) and the overall mortality rate (MR - the number of dead/number of live elephants in a given year). In total 9,182 elephant deaths were recorded during the 26 years. Elephant mortality increased over time and was attributed primarily to natural (33.1%) and human-related causes, particularly ivory poaching (31.5%) and human-elephant conflicts (19.9%). Elephant mortality varied across Kenya's 47 counties in correspondence with variation in elephant population size and was the highest in the leading elephant range counties of Taita Taveta, Laikipia, Samburu and Meru. Mortality was higher for males and adults and outside the protected areas. Most elephant carcasses had tusks (75.1%) but a few did not (12.5%). Yearly PIKE values peaked in 2012, the year with the highest poaching levels in Kenya during 1992-2017. MR increased throughout 1992-2017. Temporal variation in elephant mortality probability was significantly influenced by human and livestock population densities, average annual maximum temperature and total annual rainfall and the strength of these influences varied across the seven leading elephant range counties of Kenya. Natural processes are increasingly contributing to elephant mortality likely due to climate change and the associated food and water stress, exacerbated by contracting range. Enhancing anti-poaching and strategies for mitigating climate change impacts and human-elephant conflict and reducing range contraction while sustaining habitat connectivity can help reduce mortality and promote elephant conservation. Strengthening enforcement of international wildlife laws can further reduce illegal trade in tusks and killing of elephants.

AB  - The research of 26 -year -old mixed plantations of Siberian spruce and Siberian stone pine cultivated by biogroups of about 300 pcs/ha (2-5 stone pine seedlings alternating 4-9 spruce seedlings in a row) has shown that the damage rate by moose to them is much lower than to pure stone pine plantations or the mixed ones of Siberian stone pines and Scots pines we have studied before. The share of biogroups containing damaged stone pine trees is 18 %. A third of this number is plantations with damage to all the trees. This is most pronounced in biogroups of 4 to 5 stone pines as well as in case of frequent alternation of biogroups in a row. 76 % living stone pines have been preserved (89.3 % of them without damage to the stem). About two thirds of them (about 500 pcs/ha) grow in the crown of spruce trees adjacent to stone pine biogroups. Prolonged exposure to growing in a spruce tree crown negatively affects the growth of a stone pine's central shoot and crown. We are the first in the Middle Urals to propose a scheme for cultivating sustained productive mixed plantations of Siberian stone pines and Siberian spruce trees (or Norway spruce trees). Stone pines are planted in biogroups of 2-3 seedlings, beginning the planting strictly on one side of the site. The first biogroup in odd -numbered rows (1, 2, 3, 5, etc.) is planted after 3 spruce seedlings from the beginning of the row, the second and subsequent biogroups in these rows - after 9 spruce seedlings. The first biogroup in even -numbered rows (2, 4, 6, 8, etc.) is planted after 9 spruce seedlings from the beginning of the row, maintaining this sequence until the end of the row. Every row in mixed plantations is concluded with planting no less than 3 spruce seedlings. During silvicultural treatment procedures natural regeneration is completely removed: softwoods - by mechanical means, and hard woods - by ringing or injection of environmentally friendly water -based chemicals. These measures reduce or eliminate the appearance of coppice and, accordingly, food reserve for wild animals. Spruce trees adjacent to stone pine biogroups are cut down while lightening and thinning, which creates the possibility for the growth of stone pines. The proposed method for cultivating plantations of Siberian stone pines and Siberian spruce trees has been patented. It can be introduced into silvicultural practice in the taiga zone where stone pines are grown.

AB  - Jellyfish venom can cause the mass mortality fish and induces apoptosis of many types of cells; therefore, we speculated that the venom might be able to induces apoptosis in fish. To further understand the mechanism, we cultured Larimichthys crocea with Rhopilema esculentum and performed transcriptome analysis of liver, heart, and kidney of the fish. According to KEGG analysis, we selected certain apoptosis-related pathways, such as the P53 signaling pathway and apoptosis, and analyzed the apoptosis-relatedrelated DEGs in these pathways in the three tissues using quantitative real-time reverse transcription PCR. PIG3, CTSL, CytC, AP1 and Gadd45a were all upregulated in three tissues; whereas Mdm4 was downregulated in heart tissues. Then, we treated HEK 293 T cells with jellyfish venom and knocked down the expression of PIG3 and CTSL using small interfering RNAs (siRNAs). In cells treated with jellyfish venom, cell viability increased significantly after RNAi; P53 and CASP9 were upregulated, but the expression of CASP9 was much higher in the Control-RNAi group (without siRNA). PIG3 and BAX were downregulated in the PIG3-RNA+ (with PIG3 siRNA); CTSL and CYTC were upregulated, but BCL2 was downregulated in the Control-RNAi group. The protein levels of PIG3, CTSL, and CASP9 detected by western blotting showed similar trends to their mRNA expression levels. Thus, the results indicated that jellyfish venom could activate PIGs through the P53-PIG3 pathway to damage lysosomes, which released CTSL to affect mitochondria, leading to the apoptosis in fish. The data increases our understanding of the mechanism of apoptosis induced by jellyfish venom.

AB  - Herbivorous waterfowl populations have increasingly adapted to forage on agricultural land and triggered a parallel rise in damage to agricultural crops. Winter wheat (Triticum aestivum) is the most commonly reported crop damaged in northern Europe, and farmers increasingly demand management actions to mitigate economic impacts. Here, we apply two parallel approaches (exclosure experiments in undisturbed fields and yield assessments in fields subject to scaring) to quantify the impact of waterfowl grazing on winter wheat yield, crop height and nutrient content. We demonstrate that waterfowl grazing led to a substantial reduction in crop height during winter and early spring, but also that compensatory growth led to no significant effect on crop height at the time of harvest. In terms of grain yield, the effect of waterfowl grazing varied from non-significant to a 6% loss, and on fields subject to scaring, the negative effect of grazing was only significant when grazing continued into spring (the case for 7.6% of the area sampled). In addition, the exclosure experiments indicated that plots grazed both winter and spring had a protein content 9% lower than ungrazed plots. While these figures express an economic loss to the affected farmers, our findings also indicate that substantial economic impacts from grazing waterfowl on winter wheat was rare in our study area. This may also be the case elsewhere in the temperate region, when most waterfowl abandon crop foraging in due time to allow for compensatory growth in late spring, and as long as the early developmental stages survive the early impacts from grazing. A substantial scaring effort had only a limited effect on grain yield loss when fields were grazed during spring, but seemed to prevent damage on fields that were grazed only during winter. Future decision-making in relation to the waterfowl-agriculture conflict may benefit from studies looking in-depth at the costs and benefits associated with scaring efforts.

AB  - To more effectively protect biodiversity and promote sustainable development, transfrontier conservation areas (TFCAs) aim to enhance wildlife flows across national borders. This is true of the world's largest terrestrial TFCA, the Kavango-Zambezi (KAZA), home to half of Africa's savannah elephants that move across five countries in a mixed-use landscape. We used GPS tracking data from >100 collared elephants to evaluate how fences between Namibia and Botswana impact transboundary connectivity in KAZA. For female elephants these fences formed an impenetrable boundary, with no exchange between animals collared in Botswana and those collared in Namibia. Male elephants did cross border fences, although they remained a partial boundary, with 7 of 21 males accounting for most crossings. Our results suggest a review of fence alignment and de-commissioning of some fencing separating Namibia and Botswana, combined with increased support for fence-free interventions that reduce wildlife-livestock interactions, should be considered to meet the objectives of KAZA.

AB  - Despite the important role that biocrust communities play in maintaining ecosystem structure and functioning in deglaciated barren soil, few studies have been conducted on the dynamics of biotic communities and the impact of physicochemical characteristics in shaping the different successional stages. In this study an integrated approach encompassing physicochemical parameters and molecular taxonomy was used for identifying the indicator taxa and the presence of intra- and inter -kingdom interactions in five different crust/biocrust successional stages: i) physical crust, ii) cyanobacteria-dominated biocrust, iii) cyanobacteria/ moss -dominated biocrust, iv) moss -dominated biocrust and v) bryophyte carpet. The phylum Gemmatimonadota was the bacterial indicator taxon in the early stage, promoting both inter- and intra-kingdom interactions, while Cyanobacteria and Nematoda phyla played a pivotal role in formation and dynamics of cyanobacteria-dominated biocrusts. A multitrophic community, characterized by a shift from oligotrophic to copiotrophic bacteria and the presence of saproxylic arthropod and herbivore insects was found in the cyanobacteria/moss-dominated biocrust, while a more complex biota, characterized by an increased fungal abundance (classes Sordariomycetes, Leotiomycetes, and Dothideomycetes, phylum Ascomycota), associated with highly trophic consumer invertebrates (phyla Arthropoda, Rotifera, Tardigrada), was observed in moss -dominated biocrusts. The class Bdelloidea and the family Hypsibiidae (phyla Rotifera and Tardigrada, respectively) were metazoan indicator taxon in bryophyte carpet, suggesting their potential role in shaping structure and function of this late successional stage. Nitrogen and phosphorus were the main physicochemical limiting factors driving the shift among different crust/biocrust successional stages. Identification and characterization of indicator taxa, biological intraand inter -kingdom interactions and abiotic factors driving the shift among different crust/biocrust successional stages provide a detailed picture on crust/biocrust dynamics, revealing a strong interconnection among micro- and macrobiota systems. These findings enhance our understanding of biocrust ecosystems in High Arctic, providing valuable insights for their conservation and management in response to environmental shifts due to climate change.

AB  - Simple Summary It remains unclear whether the prolonged preservation of cells, such as sperm, in liquid nitrogen (LN2) leads to their deterioration over time. In this study, we investigated whether the conservation of Iberian pig semen for ten years results in a decline in quality and whether the evaporation of LN2 from the tanks between refills could be a contributing factor. Furthermore, the only way to improve already-frozen samples is to implement specific thawing protocols. Thus, our findings suggest that only samples consistently submerged in LN2 benefit the most from the application of thawing protocols, such as rapid thawing at 70 degrees C for 8 s. While partial conservation in LN2 and LN2 vapors does not result in a loss of quality over time, it does cause damage that thawing protocols cannot mitigate. This finding suggests that, independently of the lack of the effect of the level of storage in the tank, careful handling and optimization of thawing protocols are essential for the quality preservation of the cryopreserved sperm samples.Abstract The conservation of genetic resources in pig breeds, notably the Iberian pig, is crucial for genetic improvement and sustainable production. Prolonged storage in liquid nitrogen (LN2) is recognized for preserving genetic diversity, but potential adverse effects on seminal quality remain debated. This study aims to assess the impact of ten years of storage at different LN2 levels and to optimize thawing protocols for Iberian pig sperm. Sperm samples from 53 boars were cryopreserved and stored at varying LN2 levels and, a decade later, the samples were thawed at 37 degrees C for 20 s or at 70 degrees C for 8 s. Sperm motility, membrane integrity, acrosome status, and DNA fragmentation were evaluated in year 0 and year 10. Overall, no significant differences were observed in post-thaw sperm quality between storage levels in year 0 or year 10. But thawing at 70 degrees C 8 s showed significant improvements, particularly in samples that were always stored in LN2, in all analyzed parameters except fragmentation, which was not affected by cryostorage. This study suggests that the long-term preservation of Iberian pig sperm does not affect quality over time, regardless of whether the samples were fully submerged in LN2. Furthermore, it is determined that thawing at 70 degrees C for 8 s maximizes post-thaw sperm quality, especially in those samples stored constantly submerged in LN2.

AB  - BackgroundHippopotamus (Hippopotamus amphibious) is a semi-aquatic mammal that is considered the third largest living land mammal still alive on earth. The main objective of this study was to determine the distribution range and human-hippopotamus conflicts in the Lake Tana Biosphere Reserve, Ethiopia. Data were collected from June 2022 to January 2023. Total count methods were used to estimate the hippopotamus population, and Arc GIS was used to determine the distribution range and habitat suitability of hippopotamus. Structured questionnaire and focus group discussions were used to collect data on human-hippopotamus conflict. Data were analysed using One-way ANOVA, independent t-test, and chi-sqaure test.ResultsThe mean population estimation of hippopotamus in in the study area showed 252.67 +/- 15.9 with a density of 0.072 individuals per km2. The suitable slope analysis of hippopotamus along the the Lake Tana Biosphere Reserve's shoreline revealed that 4.7% of the shoreline was most suitable, 48.4% moderately suitable, and 46.9% not suitable. Variations in the hippopotamus' habitat suitability within the study area have been associated with a number of factors including availability of water, food, elevation, and vegetation cover. Crop raiding and overgrazing were the primary causes for conflict.ConclusionIn order to conserve hippopotamus in the in the Lake Tana Biosphere Reserve, appropriate conservation measures including habitat protection and restoration, and community engagement and education need to be developed. Moreover, further research on the ecological aspects of the Lake's ecosystem is required to ensure the conservation of hippopotamus.

AB  - In heavy metal-contaminated farmland, microorganisms or organic fertilizers can be used to minimize heavy metal uptake by crops to ensure food safety. However, the mechanisms by which urease-producing and metal-immobilizing bacteria combined with manure inhibit Cd uptake in wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) remain unclear. Herein, the effects of Enterobacter bugandensis TJ6, sheep manure (SM), and TJ6 combined with SM on Cd uptake by wheat and the mechanisms involved were investigated under field conditions. The results showed that strain TJ6 increased the urease activity and the proportion of strains with a high Cd adsorption capacity in SM, thereby enhancing the Cd adsorption capacity of SM in solution. Strain TJ6 combined with SM improved the rhizosphere soil urease activity, NH4+/NO3- ratio, and pH, thus reducing the Cd content (75.9%) in wheat grain. In addition, TJ6+SM reduced the bacterial community diversity but shifted the structure of the bacterial community in rhizosphere soil. Interestingly, the relative abundances of urease-producing bacteria and metal-immobilizing bacteria (Enterobacter, Bacillus, Exiguobacterium, Rhizobium, and Serratia) in rhizosphere soil were enriched, which enhanced wheat resistance to Cd toxicity. These results showed that urease-producing and metal-immobilizing bacteria combined with sheep manure can inhibit the uptake of Cd by wheat.

AB  - The Guizhou golden monkey (Rhinopithecus brelichi) is a critically endangered wildlife species, and understanding its diet composition may be useful for assessing its feeding strategies. DNA metabarcoding was used to determine the dietary diversity of R. brelichi. DNA was extracted from 31 faecal samples and amplified chloroplast rbcL and mitochondrial COI DNA was sequenced using the Illumina NovaSeq platform. A comparative analysis of the sequences revealed that the five most abundant plant genera were Magnolia, Morinda, Viburnum, Tetradium and Eurya. In winter, R. brelichi mostly consumed shrubs, herbs and shrubs/trees according to the habit of plant genera with higher abundances comparatively. The five most abundant families in animal diet were Psychodidae, Trichinellidae, Staphylinidae, Scarabaeidae and Trichoceridae. This study is the first to show the composition of the winter animal diets of R. brelichi based on DNA metabarcoding. These results provide an important basis for understanding the diet of wild R. brelichi, which inhabits only the Fanjingshan National Nature Reserve, China.

AB  - The impacts of heat exposure on mitochondrial physiology are poorly understood in most mammals. We examined the thermal effects on muscle mitochondrial function in deer mice (Peromyscus maniculatus), a species in which running endurance is impaired when heat exposure increases body temperature beyond 40 degrees C. Mitochondrial physiology was examined at 37, 40, and 42 degrees C using both permeabilized fibres and isolated mitochondria from the gastrocnemius muscle. Hot temperatures increased leak respiration, reduced the coupling efficiency of oxidative phosphorylation, and increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) emission. These results suggest that heat exposure reduces mitochondrial efficiency, which could contribute to impairments in running performance, and may also induce oxidative stress. Thermal effects on mitochondrial function may thus represent a potential vulnerability during heat exposure in mammals.

AB  - Simple Summary Boar taint (BT) is an off-odor and off-flavor affecting pork caused by the accumulation in the tissues of uncastrated male pigs of three main compounds: androstenone, skatole, and indole. The reduction in BT compound accumulation by genetic selection is a viable strategy to stop surgical castration of male piglets. Understanding the genetic relationships between BT compound concentration and carcass and meat quality is necessary to assess the potential effects of selecting against BT on other traits of interest. In pigs, selection is operated in purebred lines, but slaughter pigs are mostly crossbred. Therefore, before selecting against BT, it is crucial to evaluate the potential effects of such selection on commercial traits measured in crossbreds. The moderate heritability values estimated for BT compound concentrations confirmed that breeding strategies against BT can be successful. Results indicated that there is a correlation between BT compound concentrations measured in purebred pigs and carcass and ham quality traits of crossbreds. In particular, selection against BT might lead to a favorable increase in carcass backfat depth. However, such selection is also expected to negatively impact dry-cured ham quality through decreased ham fat thickness and increased proportion of unsaturated fatty acids in ham subcutaneous fat. Selecting pigs with reduced ability to accumulate boar taint (BT) compounds in their tissues is an alternative to male surgical castration. As the majority of slaughter pigs are crossbred, before selecting against BT in purebreds, it is essential to consider possible impacts on commercial traits in crossbreds. This study estimated the genetic correlations between BT compound levels measured in 1115 purebred pigs and carcass and ham quality traits collected in 26,577 crossbred Italian heavy pigs. Genetic correlations were estimated in bivariate Bayesian analyses including one BT trait and one production or ham quality trait at a time. Heritability of androstenone, skatole, and indole was 0.41, 0.49, and 0.37, respectively. A moderate negative correlation between skatole and carcass yield (-0.40), and between all BT compounds and backfat (from -0.26 to -0.55) was observed. Conversely, positive correlations (from 0.11 to 0.54) were found between skatole and ham fat thickness traits. Correlations between BT compounds and iodine number ranged from -0.07 (for androstenone) to -0.64 (for skatole), whereas those with PUFA ranged from -0.13 (for indole) to -0.33 (for skatole). Hence, reducing BT could decrease ham fat thickness and increase unsaturated fatty acids, with potential negative impacts on product quality.

AB  - The study of the effect of the mechanism of urea addition to sewage sludge and sawdust-composting substrates on methane production is still limited. In the present study, the systematic investigation of the effect of urea addition (0.18, 0.9 and 1.8 kg) on methane production is discussed through the dynamics of physical properties, enzymes, and the microbial community during composting. The results showed that high urea addition (1.8 kg) suppressed methane production, with a lower rate and a shorter duration of warming in the thermophilic phase, but significantly enhanced cellulase activity, urease, and peroxidase, and promoted the degradation of organic carbon, as well as the loss of nitrogen. A high addition of urea stimulated the growth and reproduction of Sinibacillus, Pseudogracilibacillus, Sporosarcina, and Oceanobacillus. The random forest model indicated that the top six independent determinants of CH4 emissions were Methanobacterium, temperature, organic matter (OM), Methanospirillum, and NH4+-N. Furthermore, structural equation modeling displayed that NH4+-N, O2, and pH were the main physicochemical properties affecting CH4 emissions. Methanobacterium, Methanosarcina, and Methanosphaera were the main archaea, and Bacillaceae were the main bacteria affecting CH4 emissions. This study provides new insights and a theoretical basis for optimizing urea addition strategies during composting.

AB  - Increased standing macroalgal biomass in upwelling zones is generally assumed to be the result of higher nutrient flux due to upwelled waters. However, other factors can strongly impact macroalgal communities. For example, herbivory and temperature, via their effects on primary producers and the metabolic demands of consumers, can also influence macroalgal biomass and productivity, respectively. We assessed the effects of nutrient availability, temperature, and herbivory on macroalgal biomass on a subtidal nearshore rocky reef in the Galapagos Islands. We manipulated nutrient availability and herbivory in field experiments performed in two seasons: the first during a cool, upwelling season, and the second during a warm, non-upwelling season. Excluding macro-herbivores had a clear effect on standing macroalgal biomass, independent of season or nutrient availability. However, we found different interactive effects of nutrients and macro-herbivores between the two seasons. During the cool season, macroalgal biomass was significantly higher in herbivore exclusions than in open areas under ambient nutrient conditions. However, when nutrients were added, macroalgal biomass was not significantly different across all herbivore treatments, which suggests reduced top-down control of herbivores (hence a greater standing algal biomass) in open areas. In the warm season, macroalgal biomass was significantly higher in herbivore exclusions compared to open treatments, both with and without nutrient addition. Furthermore, biomass reached 2X in herbivore exclusions with nutrient additions, which hints nutrient limitation only during warm, low-upwelling conditions. Overall, our results support the hypothesis that macro-herbivores reduce macroalgal biomass in this system and suggest that nutrient availability, but not temperature, modulate herbivory.

KW  - PHYSETER-MACROCEPHALUS
AB  - As part of ongoing efforts to protect marine megafauna, especially cetaceans, in the NW Mediterranean Sea, a 'Particularly Sensitive Sea Area' (PSSA) was established in July 2023 by the governments of France, Italy, Spain and Monaco through the Marine Environment Protection Committee (MEPC) of the International Maritime Organisation (IMO). This is a legal instrument by which maritime traffic can be subject to advisories or controls to protect the natural environment. While the new PSSA is a significant step forward in terms of marine wildlife protection in the region, the current area only partially includes the waters that play a key ecological role for the conservation of Mediterranean sperm whales (Physeter macrocephalus) around the Balearics Archipelago. This isolated population is currently classified as endangered by the IUCN. Survey data from 2019 to 2022 show how the current area does not include portions of habitat in which calves are more likely to be encountered and risks displacing any maritime traffic that chooses to avoid the voluntary PSSA restrictions into habitat that is sensitive for calf survival. We argue therefore that this PSSA should be augmented to incorporate waters that are an important habitat for this endangered population.

AB  - Tri-trophic interactions between plants, herbivores, and parasitoids are a valuable model for studying how they influence the distribution of genetic diversity and phenotypic variability of the species involved. This study examines the taxonomic, morphological, and genetic diversity of parasitoid wasps involved in the Yucca-Tegeticula interaction on the Baja California Peninsula. We surveyed 35 locations across the peninsula and collected 119 parasitoid wasps. Of these, 114 were adults, while the remaining 5 were in the pupal stage. Our study identified 2 genera of wasps: Bassus sp. (Ichneumonidae; n = 8) and Digonogastra sp. (Brachonidae; n = 111). Moreover, we found moderate levels of genetic diversity within the Digonogastra population across the peninsula. Additionally, this population constitutes a single panmictic group with indications of historical demographic expansion. Phenotypically, we identified sexual dimorphism and variation associated with its different hosts and environmental heterogeneity Digonogastra's geographical range.

AB  - Granivorous rodents have been traditionally regarded as antagonistic seed predators. Agoutis (Dasyprocta spp.), however, have also been recognized as mutualistic dispersers of plants because of their role as scatter-hoarders of seeds, especially for large-seeded species. A closer look shows that such definitions are too simplistic for these Neotropical animals because agoutis can influence plant communities not only through seed dispersal of large seeds but also through predation of small seeds and seedlings, evidencing their dual role. Herein, we summarize the literature on plant-agouti interactions, decompose agouti seed dispersal into its quantitative and qualitative components, and discuss how environmental factors and plant traits determine whether these interactions result in mutualisms or antagonisms. We also look at the role of agoutis in a community context, assessing their effectiveness as substitutes for extinct megafaunal frugivores and comparing their ecological functions to those of other extant dispersers of large seeds. We also discuss how our conclusions can be extended to the single other genus in the Dasyproctidae family (Myoprocta). Finally, we examine agoutis' contribution to carbon stocks and summarize current conservation threats and efforts. We recorded 164 interactions between agoutis and plants, which were widespread across the plant phylogeny, confirming that agoutis are generalist frugivores. Seed mass was a main factor determining seed hoarding probability of plant species and agoutis were found to disperse larger seeds than other large-bodied frugivores. Agoutis positively contributed to carbon storage by preying upon seeds of plants with lower carbon biomass and by dispersing species with higher biomass. This synthesis of plant-agouti interactions shows that ecological services provided by agoutis to plant populations and communities go beyond seed dispersal and predation, and we identify still unanswered questions. We hope to emphasise the importance of agoutis in Neotropical forests.

AB  - Prey-depletion is a significant threat facing carnivores globally, resulting in reduced population numbers, diet alterations, and increased livestock consumption, which increases human-carnivore conflict. We compared the diets of lions (Panthera leo) and leopards (P. pardus) in the prey-abundant Kruger National Park (KNP, South Africa), with that in the prey-depleted/livestock-abundant Limpopo National Park (LNP, Mozambique), using scat analyses. Lions and leopards had broader dietary niche breadths and consumed a greater proportion of smaller (previously suboptimal) prey in LNP relative to KNP. Downshifting in lion and leopard prey size consumption and the continued reliance on previously suboptimal prey may adversely affect carnivore fitness. Diet overlap between lions and leopards was low in both KNP and LNP, suggesting that even when prey is depleted, lions and leopards can partition food resources. Whilst consuming livestock in LNP, lions and leopards strongly avoided cattle (Bos taurus), even though they are the most abundant ungulate in LNP. This suggests that lions and leopards modulate their foraging behavior, so reducing human-carnivore conflict. Efforts to promote carnivore recovery and reduce human-carnivore conflict should focus on prey population restoration, particularly large prey.

AB  - Trophy hunting is a contentious practice often associated by the public with charismatic African megafauna, especially lions (Panthera leo). Public pressure could potentially end trophy hunting in the near future, which many stakeholders argue could lead to negative impacts, including on species conservation and on the livelihoods of communities that depend upon it as a source of income. We investigated the potential for replacing revenue currently generated by trophy hunting in South Africa with levies a "lion protection fee" on international travellers to that country. Our approach recognised tourism as a source of funds for conservation action, and the influence of lions as a charismatic, flagship species. We surveyed 907 respondents who had previously visited South Africa, or would consider visiting in the future. We used van Westendorp and Gabor-Granger direct pricing methodologies to assess whether the willingness of potential visitors to pay for wildlife protection could be sufficient to compensate for any loss were trophy hunting to be banned. Our findings indicated substantial support for the proposition of being charged a "lion protection fee": 84.2% of respondents stated that it was a "great" or a "good" idea. A minority (7.5%) had a negative view but only two of these respondents (0.2%) indicated a pro trophy hunting attitude. Willingness-to-pay was sufficient that, under predicted 2023 numbers of tourists, daily fees could be set at a price acceptable to both overseas ($6-7 USD) and southern African tourists ($3-4 USD), and generate funds at least equalling, but potentially exceeding, those currently generated by trophy hunting ($176.1 million US per annum). We conclude that, in principal, revenue from trophy hunting in South Africa could be fully replaced by a subsidy to stakeholders as a payment for conservation action, funded by a modest levy on international tourist visitors.

AB  - This study compares the physicochemical properties, lignocellulose degradation, microbial community composition, and carbohydrate-active enzymes (CAZymes) in ectopic fermentation systems (EFS) of pig manure mixed with either conventional padding (C) or straw waste (A). The degradation rates of cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin were found to be significantly higher in A (27.72%, 22.72%, and 18.80%, respectively) than in C (21.05%, 16.17%, and 11.69%, respectively) owing to the activities of lignocellulolytic enzymes. Metagenomics revealed that straw addition had a stronger effect on the bacterial community succession than fungi. The abundances of Sphingobacterium, Pseudomonas, and CAZymes were higher in A than in C, as well as the auxiliary activity enzymes, which are crucial for lignocellulose degradation. Redundancy analysis indicates a positive correlation between lignocellulose degradation and Sphingobacterium, Pseudomonas, Bacillus, and Actinobacteria contents. A structural equation model was applied to further verify that the increased microbial functional diversity was the primary driver of lignocellulosic degradation, which could be effectively regulated by the enhanced temperature with straw addition. Replacing traditional padding with straw can thus accelerate lignocellulosic degradation, promote microbial functional diversity, and improve the EFS efficiency.

AB  - During the late Initial Period (c. 1100-800 BC), the Conchucos region of highland Peru witnessed the formation of the ceremonial and "proto-urban" center of Chavin de Huantar (c. 1000-500/400 BC). An important question regarding Chavin de Huantar centers on the nature of its subsistence economy during the time when it was first founded. In this paper, we present new results from zooarchaeological, starch granule, and stable isotope (delta C-13 and delta N-15) analyses to reconstruct diet from Canchas Uckro, a settlement located in Chavin de Huantar's heartland region. Founded c. 1100 BC and abandoned just after 800 BC, Canchas Uckro provides insight into socioeconomic processes during the early phases of Chavin de Huantar. Extant faunal remains suggest deer comprised an important component of the diet, while camelids constitute a minor proportion of the assemblage. Starch granules recovered from the pottery indicate that domesticated cultigens (maize, potato, and manioc) were obtained from different highland production zones. delta C-13 and delta N-15 analysis of a sample of human skeletal remains, coupled with Stable Isotope Analysis in R (SIAR) mixing models, demonstrate that C-3 plants constitute most of the diet, while maize was not intensively consumed. delta C-13 and delta N-15 further indicate that deer made up 25-50% of the diet. The results of this study add to a gro wing corpus of data on subsistence practices in the north-central and northern highlands of Peru prior to the widespread adoption of domesticated camelids.

AB  - Vector-borne diseases represent various sicknesses that are increasingly significant in human and veterinary health. Among the zoonotic agents transmitted by ticks, infections caused by the intracellular pathogens from the Anaplasmataceae family and piroplasmids (Babesia/Theileria spp.) are particularly notable due to the substantial economic losses they cause in the livestock sector. A study was carried out to assess the prevalence of these pathogens in ticks from ruminants in the province of Valencia (Eastern Iberian Peninsula). Between 2019 and 2022, 1674 ticks were collected from 163 domestic and wild ruminants. The tick species were identified using molecular and morphological features and included Rhipicephalus spp. (Rhipicephalus bursa and Rhipicephalus sanguineus) (88.7%), Haemaphysalis sulcata (5.9%), Ixodes ricinus (3.6%) and Dermacentor marginatum (1.2%). The Spanish ibex (Capra pyrenaica) was found to be at greater risk of infestation by Haemaphysalis compared to other ruminants. Polimerase Chain Reaction (PCR) analysis was performed on 108 individual ticks from different hosts, with 16.7% testing positive for members of the Anaplasmataceae family and 39.8% for Theileria spp. Sequencing of 10 positive samples from each pathogen group revealed the presence of Anaplasma ovis, Anaplasma platys, Ehrlichia spp., Theileria ovis and Theileria capreoli. No Anaplasma phagocytophilum or Babesia spp. were detected. Further research is essential for improved management of ticks and the diseases they transmit in the study area.

Entre los agentes zoon & oacute;ticos transmitidos por garrapatas, las infecciones causadas por los pat & oacute;genos intracelulares de la familia Anaplasmataceae y los piropl & aacute;smidos (Babesia/Theileria spp.) son especialmente destacables debido a las considerables p & eacute;rdidas econ & oacute;micas que ocasionan en el sector ganadero. Se llev & oacute; a cabo un estudio para evaluar la prevalencia de estos pat & oacute;genos en garrapatas de rumiantes en la provincia de Valencia (este de la Peninsula Ib & eacute;rica). Entre 2019 y 2022, se recolectaron 1674 garrapatas de 163 rumiantes dom & eacute;sticos y silvestres. Las especies de garrapatas fueron identificadas mediante caracter & iacute;sticas moleculares y morfol & oacute;gicas, incluyendo Rhipicephalus spp. (Rhipicephalus bursa y Rhipicephalus sanguineus s.l.) (88.7%), Haemaphysalis sulcata (5.9%), Ixodes ricinus (3.6%) y Dermacentor marginatum (1.2%). Se encontr & oacute; que la cabra montesa (Capra pyrenaica) presentaba un mayor riesgo de infestaci & oacute;n por Haemaphysalis en comparaci & oacute;n con otros rumiantes. Se realiz & oacute; un an & aacute;lisis mediante PCR en 108 garrapatas individuales de diferentes hospedadores, detect & aacute;ndose un 16.7% de positividad para miembros de la familia Anaplasmataceae y un 39.8% para Theileria spp. La secuenciaci & oacute;n de diez muestras positivas de cada grupo de pat & oacute;genos revel & oacute; la presencia de Anaplasma ovis, Anaplasma platys, Ehrlichia spp., Theileria ovis y Theileria capreoli. No se detectaron Anaplasma phagocytophilum ni Babesia spp. Es fundamental realizar m & aacute;s investigaciones para mejorar la gesti & oacute;n de las garrapatas y las enfermedades que transmiten en el & aacute;rea de estudio.

AB  - Lameness is an important health, welfare and economic problem in sheep flocks and early treatment is key to controlling lameness. Biologging technology provides high-resolution, continuous data that offers a novel op-portunity to detect lameness either directly or by identifying behavioural changes; either option would facilitate more rapid treatment of lame sheep than visual observation. Here, the role of biologging data to identify lame sheep through behavioural changes within and between sheep is investigated. Accelerometers and proximity sensors were fitted to a flock of 50 Poll Dorset ewes rearing 32 single and 36 twin lambs, in Devon, UK in October 2019. Accelerometers were used to identify standing time and classify behaviour into four states for ewes (inactive, ruminating, grazing, walking) and three for lambs (inactive, sucking, moving). Principal components analysis reduced these behaviours to two components, 'feeding' and 'inactive' for ewes, and 'inactive' and 'feeding' for lambs. A visual locomotion score of each sheep was used each day to assess lameness. Complete records from sensors and locomotion observations were obtained for 513 days of ewe-activity and 720 days of lamb-activity (40 ewes, 26 single-raised and 28 twin-raised lambs). Linear mixed effects models were used to assess the effect of lameness adjusted for covariates age, litter size, social behaviour, environment and climate on standing time and the principal components. Lame ewes stood less, spent less time grazing and were more inactive than non-lame ewes. Lame lambs also stood less and were more inactive than non-lame lambs. Lambs with severely lame dams were also more inactive than those with non-lame dams. In conclusion, it is possible to identify behavioural differences between lame and non-lame ewes and lambs which could help enable automated early warning of lameness and consequently early treatment of lameness, and improved sheep welfare.

AB  - Using three data sources, we measured claw lengths of the extremely large major claws of 70 species of fiddler crabs, spread over four major biogeographic regions and all 11 genera, as a function of carapace length. Despite a diversity of biogeography, body size, type of sexual signaling and mating behavior, and details of claw morphology, all species groupings follow the same linear relationship. No subgroupings could be determined, by region, among diverse genera, by ancestral-derived status, or by data source. Major claw size is known to be implicated in female selection of mates, which might be expected to diversify claw lengths among species and genera, as might differences in combat might be expected to diversify claw length, as it does in other claw traits. The constancy suggests a possible functional constraint on major claw length across the fiddler crabs, which is to be determined. Efficient folding of the claw as the male rapidly retreats into a burrow, or a protection of the carapace from frontal attack by predators or combatants in an initial aggressive encounter might select for this pervasive relationship. Tests are suggested. The sexually selected major claw is more variable than the naturally selected minor claw, but this difference in variability could be attributed partially to regeneration of the major cheliped and even variation in shape. A surprising similar trend of closing force index for the major claw exists for a large number of species spread throughout the genera and major regions occupied by fiddler crabs, but a considerable variation exists in a variety of functional traits. Thus, the constancy of length relationship stands out distinctly from a considerable background variation in form. As a sexually selected trait, the claw length constancy begs for an explanation.

FX  - We are grateful to the curatorial staff of the U.S. Natural History Museum, who allowed us to measure crabs in the "Alcoholic Room" in 1992. We are grateful to Chris Boyko, staff assistant, and Niles Eldredge, curator of the American Museum of Natural History, who facilitated our visits in 1994. We are most grateful to the seminal volume on fiddler crabs written by the great Jocelyn Crane (Crane, 1975), which provided photographic sources for measurements of other species and an endless fountain of ideas and observations. We also thank Pat Backwell, Zack Darnell, and Brendan Kelaher for provision of specimens, and Elliot Norse, Dick Zimmer, and Zack Darnell for photographs. Discussions with Mike Rosenberg were very helpful. We are grateful for critical comments of John Christy and L David Smith of a much older version of the manuscript, which eventually helped us to focus our conclusions on constancy. The suggestion of folding the claws as the male retreats was originally described to JSL by Christy, for which we are grateful, as we are grateful for his further review of this submission. We also are grateful for the helpful comments of a second anonymous reviewer. This study was partially supported by U.S. National Science Foundation grant 1754761.

Consequently, we used snorkel survey data from 1985 to 2019 to relate a suite of environmental factors to Mountain Whitefish occupancy and abundance and to estimate population growth rates in central Idaho. Mountain Whitefish population growth rates in the majority of subbasins in central Idaho appear to be stable or increasing over the past several decades, but more so in the Salmon River basin than in the Clearwater River basin. Mountain Whitefish occupancy and abundance were higher in stream reaches that were lower in elevation and gradient and larger in size, with an occupancy rate of 0.50 in stream reaches that were >= 9 m average wetted width. Road density was positively associated with the occupancy and abundance of Mountain Whitefish, contrasting previous studies that generally report negative associations between road density and salmonid population metrics. While this relationship may simply be correlative in nature, in the relatively sterile lotic environment of central Idaho, such anthropogenic disturbance may inadvertently result in nutrient enrichment, potentially benefitting the forage base of Mountain Whitefish. We also observed that conductivity positively influenced Mountain Whitefish abundance, likely stemming from its direct effect on stream productivity. Although the status of Mountain Whitefish in central Idaho appears generally stable, the paucity of studies reporting on the status of this species highlights the need for additional research devoted to a better understanding of trends in Mountain Whitefish abundance across their range.

AB  - Illegal hunting and wildlife trafficking is a growing and prominent threat to species worldwide. An isolated population of Southwestern Speckled Rattlesnakes (Crotalus pyrrhus) occurs in the Tinajas Altas Mountains of Yuma County, Arizona, USA. Individuals in this population are sought after in the pet trade because of their unique white-cream coloration. The ecology of this population is not well understood. We used telemetry to study habitat use, home range size, and movement patterns of 19 C. pyrrhus in this population from October 2017 to May 2019. We calculated home ranges with both Minimum Convex Polygons and Kernel Density Estimates. We most often found snakes on slopes (65%) using boulders as their primary cover (57%). We commonly observed snakes using Elephant Tree (Bursera microphylla) and Catclaw Acacia (Senegalia greggii) as vegetation cover, with low visibility for most observations. We observed annual variation in use of habitat type and daily variation in both cover type and visibility. Minimum Convex Polygon estimates ranged from 0.91-13.74 ha. We found no significant difference in movements, activity areas, or core areas between males and females or between a near-average and an unusually wet winter season. This study provides novel habitat and spatial ecological information for guiding the management and conservation practices of this distinct population of C. pyrrhus.

AB  - The present study investigated the effects of flaxseed oil or flaxseed grain on the intestinal microbiota and blood fatty acid profiles of Albas cashmere goats. Sixty kid goats were allocated to three treatments and fed for 90 days with a control treatment, comprising a basal diet (CON, total-mixed ration with flaxseed meal), or experimental treatments, comprising a basal diet with added flaxseed oil (LNO) and a basal diet with added heated flaxseed grain (HLS). On day 90, two goats were randomly selected from each pen (eight goats per treatment) for euthanizing; then, five of the eight goats were randomly selected, and we collected their intestinal (duodenum, jejunum, ileum, cecum, and colon) digesta for analysis of the bacteria community. The results indicated that Firmicutes are the most predominant phylum in different segments of the intestinal digesta. Compared with the CON group, the relative abundance of duodenal Firmicutes, jejunal Saccharibacteria, and Verrucomicrobia significantly decreased in the LNO and HLS groups (p < 0.05), but there was no significant difference between the LNO and HLS groups. Compared with the CON and HLS groups, the RA of duodenal and jejunal Proteobacteria remarkably increased in the LNO group (p < 0.05), and there was no significant difference between the CON and HLS groups. Compared with the CON and LNO groups, the RA of Actinobacteria remarkably increased in the small intestine of the HLS group (p < 0.05), but there was no significant difference between the CON and LNO groups in the duodenum and ileum. The results of linear discriminant analysis (LDA) effect size (LEfSe) analysis showed that the HLS group was characterized by a higher RA of the [Eubacterium]_coprostanoligenes_group in the small intestine and the LNO group was represented by a higher RA of the Lachnospiraceae_NK3A20_group in the cecum and colon, while the CON group was represented by a higher RA of Solobacterium, Pseudoramibacter, and Acetitomaculum in the small intestine and a higher RA of norank_o__Bradymonadales, the Prevotellaceae_Ga6A1_group, and Ruminiclostridium_1 in the cecum and colon. In conclusion, the addition of flaxseed oil and grain rich in c18:3n3 to the diet could reduce the microbial diversity of the small intestinal segments and the microbial diversity and richness of the cecum and colon in Albas cashmere goats. And flaxseed grain is more efficient than flaxseed oil in protecting intestinal health and promoting the absorption of c18:3n3.

AB  - We used radiocollars and GPS collars to determine the movements and habitat selection of golden jackals (Canis aureus) in a seasonally dry deciduous forest with no human settlements in eastern Cambodia. We also collected and analyzed 147 scats from jackals to determine their seasonal diet and prey selection. The mean (+/- SE) annual size of home-range ranges (47.1 +/- 2.5 km(2); n = 4), which were mutually exclusive between mated pairs, was considerably larger than that previously reported for this species, resulting in an extremely low density (0.01 jackal/km(2)). The unusually large home ranges and low density probably were due to the harsh dry season when most understory vegetation is burned and nearly all waterholes dry up, thereby causing a large seasonal decline in the availability of small vertebrate prey. Resident groups consisted of an alpha pair, but no betas, and were situated only in areas not occupied by leopards (Panthera pardus) and dholes (Cuon alpinus). Jackals avoided dense forests and streams, and had a strong selection for dirt roads, possibly to avoid larger predators. Overall the jackal diet was diverse, with at least 16 prey items identified, and there was no significant difference in diet composition between the cool-dry and hot-dry seasons. Scat analysis showed that the main food items consumed by jackals were processional termites (Hospitalitermes spp.; 26% biomass consumed), followed by wild pig (Sus scrofa; 20%), muntjac (Muntiacus vaginalis; 20%), and civets (17%). Compared to available biomass, jackals were not random in their consumption of ungulates because muntjac were selectively consumed over larger ungulate species. Dietary overlap with dholes and leopards was relatively low, and consumption patterns indicated jackals were preying on ungulates rather than scavenging from kills of larger carnivores. Our results showed that the jackal is an extremely adaptable and opportunistic species that exhibits unique behaviors to survive in an extreme environment near the edge of its distribution.

AB  - Predation of sheep is a production problem that deserves the studies of how this prey species detects and react to predators. In this context, this study determined the behavioural and physiological responses of ewes exposed to the odour of predators? faeces as fox (Lycalopex gymnocercus) and wild boar (Sus scrofa). Four experimental treatments were applied to 48 Corriedale sheep (12 ewes each): fox faeces (FFO), wild boar faeces (WBFO), unknown sheep wool (SWOC) and no odour (NOC). All ewes were evaluated in a behavioural test for 5 min and then rectal temperature was measured, and a series of blood samples were obtained to determine cortisol concentration, glycaemia, total protein, albumin and globulin. The frequency of kicking the ground, turning their head, going back and stillness behaviours increased significantly in FFO in comparison with NOC (p = 0.01; p < 0.0001; p = 0.005 and p = 0.002, respectively) and kicking the ground and turning the head compared with SWOC (p = 0.03 and p < 0.001 respectively). The FFO group spent significantly more time turning the head and going back than NOC (p < 0.001 and p = 0.01 respectively) and SWOC (p = 0.002 and p = 0.05). For ewes evaluated with WBFO, kicking the ground, turning their head, going back and remaining still occurred significantly more times than with NOC (p = 0.008; p = 0.005; p = 0.01 and p = 0.003), and kicking the ground, turning their head and remaining still occurred significantly more times than with SWOC (p = 0.02; p = 0.02 and p = 0.05). Furthermore, WBFO group spent significantly less time still (p = 0.01) and more time turning their head and going back (p = 0.001 and p = 0.02, respectively) than NOC, that spent significantly more time turning their head than SWOC (p = 0.006). Rectal temperature and haematological variables were not affected by treatments. The increase in the frequency of agonistic behaviours and duration of locomotion behaviours in ewes treated with predators? faeces, allow us to conclude that ewes respond to fox and wild boar?s faeces exposure with a similar aversive behavioural repertoire. Also, ewes displayed some physiological responses although these responses cannot be attributed to the odour of predators.

AB  - Bark beetles and root weevils can impact forests through tree death on landscape scales. Recently, subterranean termites have been linked to these beetles via the presence of bluestain fungi (Ascomycota: Ophiostomataceae), which are vectored to trees by beetles. However, only a small subset of bluestain species have been examined. Here, we tested whether termite-bluestain association patterns in the field reflect termite feeding preference in laboratory choice trials. We documented the presence of four bluestain fungi (Leptographium procerum (W.B. Kendr.), L. terebrantis (Barras & Perry), Grosmannia huntii (Rob.-Jeffr.), and G. alacris (TA. Duong, Z.W. de Beer & M.J. Wingf.) in the roots of 2,350 loblolly pine trees in the southeastern United States and whether termites were present or absent on these roots and paired this with laboratory choice feeding trials.Termites were found 2.5-fold on tree roots with at least one bluestain fungus present than tree roots without bluestain fungi. Although termites in this study and others were associated with L. procerum, L. terebrantis, and marginally G. huntii, termites only showed preferential feeding on wood inoculated with G. huntii in laboratory trials. This suggests that increased termite presence on wood with bluestain fungi may be driven by factors other than increased wood palatability. Termites could thus disproportionately affect wood turnover rates for specific pools (e.g., bark beetle and root weevil attacked trees) and in some cases (e.g., G. huntii) accelerate wood decomposition.This study supports the growing evidence that the association between subterranean termites and bluestain fungi is spatially and taxonomically widespread.

AB  - We examined the colonization potential of the chrysanthemum lace bug, Corythucha marmorata, on populations of its host plant, tall goldenrod, Solidago altissima L. In a common garden experiment, we found variation in plant resistance within and among eight USA and four Japanese populations of S. altissima to herbivory by the Duluth, MN, USA population of C. marmorata. Duluth lace bugs significantly differed in their preference for and performance among plant populations and genotypes within populations. Colonization of plant populations was facilitated because Duluth lace bug survival was high on at least one plant genotype in each population. The high genotypic variation in resistance within the Duluth goldenrod population is consistent with the hypothesis that has led to the evolution of the lace bug's ability to deal with a wide range of plant resistance that would improve colonization potential. Because lace bugs are adapted to feeding on senescing tissues with high levels of soluble nitrogen, we hypothesized that preference and performance would be positively related to leaf senescence and plant nitrogen concentrations. We partially supported the prediction that plant leaf nitrogen influenced lace bug preference and performance, as some plant populations with lower total leaf nitrogen had lower lace bug performance. Thus, leaf senescence affected lace bug performance, but there was a complex interaction between plant genotype and the amount of leaf senescence. Our results suggest that tall goldenrod resistance to lace bugs results from adaptation to large- and fine-scale environmental heterogeneity.

AB  - Farming livestock-cattle, sheep, goats, pigs, and chickens-contributes to the air pollution of the atmosphere. Agricultural air pollution comes mainly in the form of ammonia, which enters the air as a gas from heavily fertilized fields and livestock waste. A reduction in air pollutants from the livestock sector can be achieved by reducing production and consumption, lowering the emission intensity of production, or combining the two. This work proposes an approach for assessing the air pollutant emissions derived from intensive cattle farming. For doing this, the animal feed, the animal behavior, and characteristics and the stable environment data are monitored and collected by a cloud platform. Specifically, Internet of Things (IoT) devices are installed in the farm and key air pollutant parameters from the stable environment (such as CO, NH3, PM1, PM2.5, PM10) are monitored. In this scope, a study about monitoring air pollutants is conducted, showing the most relevant platforms used in this domain. Additionally, the paper presents a comparison between the estimated and monitored air pollutants (AP), showing the fluctuation of the measured parameters. The key takeaway of the study is that ammonia concentration has a higher level during the night, being influenced by the ventilation system of the farm.

AB  - Simple Summary As invasive insect species can disrupt agriculture, ecosystem functions, and human health, monitoring the spread of newly invasive insects is a high priority. The purple carrot-seed moth Depressaria depressana, a European species first reported in North America in 2008, specializes on reproductive structures of taxa throughout the family Apiaceae and thus presents a potential threat to native North American umbellifers. We assessed interpopulational genetic diversity of D. depressana across its eastern North American invasion front and compared those values to available data for European populations. We also compared this diversity with genetic diversity estimates for populations of Depressaria radiella (parsnip webworm), a European species introduced to North America more than 160 years ago that is essentially restricted to two apiaceous genera throughout its native and invasive ranges. Documenting the historical spread of D. radiella with museum and literature records, we found D. depressana displays greater genetic diversity than D. radiella and is colonizing North America more rapidly; greater genetic diversity may facilitate faster colonization via establishment on a wider range of hostplants. The contrast in colonization by these two species may inform management practices for invasive insects utilizing a broad versus narrow array of hosts within a single plant family. Depressaria depressana, the purple carrot seed moth, is a Eurasian species first reported in North America in 2008 and currently undergoing range expansion. This invasion follows that of its Eurasion congener Depressaria radiella (parsnip webworm), first documented in North America 160 years ago. Unlike D. depressana, which utilizes hostplants across multiple tribes of Apiaceae, Depressaria radiella is a "superspecialist" effectively restricted in its native and non-indigenous ranges to two closely related apiaceous genera. We investigated the genetic structure of D. depressana populations across latitudinal and longitudinal gradients in the eastern United States by constructing COI haplotype networks and then comparing these with haplotype networks constructed from available COI sequence data from contemporary European D. depressana populations and from European and North American D. radiella populations. Haplotype data revealed higher genetic diversity in D. depressana, indicating high dispersal capacity, multiple introductions, and/or a genetically diverse founding population. Museum and literature records of D. radiella date back to 1862 and indicate that range expansion to the West Coast required more than 50 years. Higher levels of genetic diversity observed in D. depressana compared to its congener may indicate a greater propensity for dispersal, colonization and establishment in its non-indigenous range.

AB  - Merriam's kangaroo rat (Dipodomys merriami) is a member of a unique family of primarily desert-adapted North American rodents (Heteromyidae). Of the 20 species in the genus, D. merriami is one of the most wide-ranging and ecologically flexible, inhabiting desert scrub, grassland, sagebrush steppe, and juniper-pi & ntilde;on woodland in the southwestern deserts of the United States and Mexico. We present a de novo reference genome for D. merriami generated from PacBio HiFi long-read and Omni-C chromatin proximity sequencing as a part of the California Conservation Genomics Project. The primary pseudo-haplotype assembly comprises 3,110 scaffolds, with a contig N50 of 8.6 Mb, scaffold N50 of 49.1 Mb, and a total length of 3.57 Gb. Further, a BUSCO completeness score of 97.8% suggests that the assembly is highly complete. This reference genome will serve as a resource for future studies of Dipodomys conservation genomics, desert adaptation, and phylogeography.

AB  - life history events, such as migration and spawning in fish, are often timed to match seasonal fluc-tuations in environmental conditions. Understanding phenological patterns and their drivers is needed to conserve vulnerable fish populations, particu-larly as climate change is disrupting seasonal transitions. In this study, we examined the phenology of spring spawning migrations of river herring, the alewife (Alosa pseudoharengus) and the blueback herring (A. aestiva-lis), in 4 rivers of Chesapeake Bay over 7 years (2013-2019). We used imaging sonar and weekly biological samples to estimate species-specific hourly fish counts in the Choptank River, Deer Creek (a tributary of Susquehanna River), Marshyhope Creek (a tributary of Nanticoke River), and the Patapsco River. Our results indicate that pat-terns of water temperature in spring drive spawning migrations at seasonal, daily, and hourly scales. The relation-ship between fish counts and other environmental factors, such as stream -flow, lunar phase, turbidity, wind stress, and tides, were annually inconsistent, and their influences on migrations may be river specific. For both species, dis-tinct diel patterns in movement were observed. Migrations were diurnal in the Choptank River and Marshyhope Creek but nocturnal in Deer Creek and the Patapsco River. Observed interannual and inter -river variation in phenology and the influence of non -temperature factors on migrations highlight the need for long -term, multi -river monitoring of river herring in Chesapeake Bay.

AB  - In fisheries science, it is important to understand the population dynamics of commercial species and also their movements from the nursery to the population, especially for juvenile individuals, to avoid overfishing. To determine their migration patterns among nurseries, we collected juvenile Greenland halibut Reinhardtius hippoglossoides from 2 nurseries inside our study area, the Estuary and Gulf of St. Lawrence, in the summer of 2016. We measured the concentrations of chemical elements in their otoliths along a margin-core transect and used the margin elemental fingerprints of Mg, Mn, Sr, and Ba to infer migratory behaviour between 2 sample sites, the Estuary and North Anticosti nurseries. Using a random-forest analysis, we achieved an overall reclassification success of margin elemental fingerprints to their capture site of 77%. Most fish sampled from both sample sites originated from the estuary (82.5%), suggesting an important asymmetry in the source-sink dynamics between these nurseries. Juvenile Greenland halibut migrate towards the North Anticosti nursery at a smaller-than-expected size (approximately 26 cm) corresponding to 2.5-3 yr old fish. Despite sexual dimorphism in growth, sex does not affect migratory behaviour or timing of migration before sexual maturation. Our study highlights the recruitment dynamics of Greenland halibut and confirms the estuary as the main nursery in the St. Lawrence system.

AB  - Globally, amphibians face severe threats, such as climate change and associated extreme events. Our goal was to quantify global amphibian exposure to 3 classes of extreme events: heat waves, cold spells, and droughts. We used the MERRA-2 extreme climate events data and the standardized precipitation-evapotranspiration index database to investigate where these events have increased over the last 40 years. We used the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) database of global amphibian distributions (7202 species) to calculate the level of exposure to extreme events for each species, classifying species as exposed if their distribution had >= 50% overlap with areas experiencing substantial increases of extreme events. To assess whether exposure is associated with amphibian declines, we used logistic regression to analyze the relationship between extreme event exposure and status changes on the IUCN Red List. Heat waves and droughts increased notably in Amazonia, Madagascar, and Europe. Among the 3 classes of events, exposure was highest to heat waves (40% of species exposed), followed by droughts (16% exposed). Exposure to different event classes was uneven with respect to geography and taxonomy. Some areas (e.g., Amazonia, Madagascar) and families (e.g., Mantellidae, Rhinodermatidae) had nearly 100% of constituent species classified as exposed to at least one event class. Exposure to heat waves (odds ratio 1.8) and droughts (odds ratio 1.7) was associated with status deteriorations since 2004. Our findings provide insight into amphibian biodiversity hotspots and taxonomic groups that may be particularly susceptible to extreme climate events, suggesting that these events play a causative role in ongoing declines. Understanding the aspects of species biology that influence susceptibility to extreme events, as well as interactions with other factors (e.g., disease), will be important for understanding the role of climate change in driving amphibian declines.

AB  - Dung-inhabiting fungi play a key role in ecosystems by acting on decomposing dung and cycling non-absorbed nutrients during the digestion process. Due to the scarcity of studies focused on ecological aspects of dung fungi, little is known about how the type of diet and type of animal's digestive system determine the substrate type, modulate and structure dung-inhabiting fungi communities. Herein, we evaluate how biological factors intrinsic to animals (diet and gut type) influence the structure of fungal communities growing on dung of different animal species in the Brazilian Cerrado. We found that the type of digestive system has a low influence on the structure of dung-inhabiting fungi communities, but there is higher fungal diversity in herbivore dung than omnivore dung. The fungi from omnivorous dung are most specific and restricted to this substrate. Horse dung was the most suitable substrate to develop dung-inhabiting fungi. We highlight the importance of dung and animals' conditions as modulators of fungal communities, as well as the need of new sampling methodologies to better characterize the ecological aspects of fungal communities from dung in the wild.

AB  - Identifiable food remains were analyzed from 46 stomachs of striped dolphins (Stenella coeruleoalba) stranded in southern Spain between 2007 and 2014. Results suggest that the species feeds mainly on mesopelagic and neritic fish, but also on oceanic squids. Fish species of the family Myctophidae were the main prey in terms of numerical importance and reconstructed prey weight (62% N and 29% W), followed by squids of the family Ommastrephidae (20% W) and bogue (Boops boops) (15% W). The most important prey taxa according to the General Importance Index (GII) were C. maderensis, Ommastrephidae gen. spp., Notoscopelus spp., and M. punctatum. Higher number of mesopelagic myctophids were found in dolphins from the Mediterranean (73% vs. 29% N), while more demersal gobiids and European hake (Merluccius merluccius) were found in those from the Atlantic (44% vs. 1% and 8% vs. <1% N), where a more varied diet was also observed. Differences were also seen in the seasonal importance of some prey, as well as between years, sexes, and maturity states. The diet composition suggests that most of feeding occurred in oceanic regions, during twilight and night hours, while the observed dietary variation may reflect differences in topography, and changes in the prey availability.

AB  - In long-lived polygynous species, male reproductive success is often monopolized by a few mature dominant individuals. Young males are generally too small to be dominant and may employ alternative tactics; however, little is known about the determinants of reproductive success for young males. Understanding the causes and consequences of variability in early reproductive success may be crucial to assess the strength of sexual selection and possible long-term trade-offs among life-history traits. Selective pressures driven by fluctuating environmental conditions may depend on age class. We evaluated the determinants of reproduction in male bighorn sheep (Ovis canadensis) aged 2-4 years using 30 years of individual-level data. These young males cannot defend estrous ewes and use alternative mating tactics. We also investigated how the age of first detected reproduction was correlated to lifetime reproductive success and longevity. We found that reproductive success of males aged 3 years was positively correlated to body mass, to the proportion of males aged 2-4 years in the competitor pool, and to the number of females available per adult male. These results suggest that reproductive success depends on both competitive ability and population age-sex structure. None of these variables, however, had significant effects on the reproductive success of males aged 2 or 4 years. Known reproduction before the age of five increased lifetime reproductive success but decreased longevity, suggesting a long-term survival cost of early reproduction. Our analyses reveal that both individual-level phenotypic and population-level demographic variables influence reproductive success by young males and provide a rare assessment of fitness trade-offs in wild polygynous males.

AB  - Wildlife management actions are increasingly contingent on acceptance by the broader public. Consequently, understanding factors that influence acceptability of different management options is important. In Australia, kangaroos (native large herbivores, Macropus spp., Osphranter spp.) are managed using lethal control for a range of context-specific reasons. We surveyed 1293 members of the Australian public to test whether acceptability of lethal control of kangaroos depends on the reason for the control, values towards wildlife (assessed using the Wildlife Values Orientation questionnaire), and knowledge about kangaroos. We also tested whether acceptability could be shifted by providing relevant information. Lethal control of kangaroos for biocentric reasons (i. e., agricultural protection, biodiversity conservation, animal welfare) was more acceptable than lethal control of kangaroos for anthropocentric reasons (i.e., human consumption, human safety). Acceptability was greater among survey respondents high on the domination orientation (i.e., valuing wildlife for human benefits), and lower among those high on the mutualism orientation (i.e., valuing wildlife for its own intrinsic value). Acceptability was also positively associated with knowledge of kangaroo ecology and management. Provision of information did not impact acceptability of lethal control for any reason except for human use, which, while not significant, showed promise that acceptability of lethal control for this reason could be influential to the public. Additionally, while the acceptability of lethal control varied widely among the Australian population, there was little evidence of polarisation, suggesting that large sectors of the public may be amenable to different perspectives.

AB  - The transmission of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) to humans through the consumption of plants grown in manure-amended soils is a critical concern. However, the effect of manure application on the profiles of tetracycline resistance genes (TRGs) within the soil-rice continuum remains unclear. In this study, tetracycline (TC) content, bacterial communities, abundance of 8 TRGs, and class 1 integron (intI1) were characterized using highperformance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS/MS), Illumina sequencing, and quantitative PCR (qPCR) in rhizosphere soils, roots, and grains of rice exposed to pig manure (PM), rapeseed cake (RC), and chemical fertilizer (CF), respectively. Our findings indicate that the type of sample was the primary determinant of TRGs abundance variation within the soil-rice continuum, with a consistent decline from rhizosphere soils to roots to grains. Furthermore, fertilization type significantly influenced TRGs abundance, with the highest levels observed in PM treatment. TetZ and tetX were predominant, constituting over 90% of total TRGs abundance across all samples. In addition, the mechanism of TRGs profile formation varies with sample types. Bacterial communities-TC content-intI1 interactions determined the change in TRGs abundance in rhizosphere soils, and bacterial communities constituted the most important factor affecting TRGs abundance within the roots. However, bacterial communities and/or intI1 poorly explained the change in TRGs abundance within the grains. Our study attempts to explore the underlying mechanism for the profiles of TRGs in soil-rice continuums exposed to manure, as well as provides a theoretical basis for controlling the spread of endogenous antibiotic resistance within rice grown in soil receiving pig manure.

AB  - Simple Summary Sustainable wildlife management is achieved when planning is based on a thorough knowledge of the species to be harvested. The objective of this research was to generate such knowledge in two rural communities in Mexico through a collaborative process that integrates formal and traditional knowledge about bighorn sheep management. A program of community workshops was implemented in which the communities discussed their interest in bighorn sheep, trained villagers in their management, described their habitat, and planned their monitoring. During the workshops, the communities identified their primary interest in the species as economic, identified the main factors threatening its conservation, created a detailed map of its habitat, and designed the strategy they would use to monitor its population. The workshop program proposed in this paper aims to train rural communities, generate relevant information for the management of wild species, and lay the foundation for a long-term conservation project.Abstract The description of natural history, and information on the factors threatening conservation, the distribution area, and the status of species population are necessary for proper wildlife management. The objective of this research was to generate such information in two rural communities and to engage residents in bighorn sheep management through a program of three workshops. The first one covered training regarding natural history and management of the species. The second one consisted in the description of the habitat of the species through a dynamic of participatory mapping. The third, include a design of a one strategy to monitor the bighorn sheep population. The workshops were attended by 37 people from the two rural communities. The results suggest the economic element was the main interest of the inhabitants regarding the bighorn sheep. Eleven risk factors were identified to the bighorn sheep in the study sites, a participatory map with relevant information for the management of the species on each community was developed, and a monitoring strategy of the bighorn sheep population was prepared. The workshop program proposed in this research is a tool that can be applied in rural communities to lay the groundwork for a long-term management project of wildlife species.

AB  - The energy cost of adaptive immune activation in endotherms is typically quantified from changes in resting metabolic rate following exposure to a novel antigen. An implicit assumption of this technique is that all variation in energy costs following antigenic challenge is due solely to adaptive immunity, while ignoring potential changes in the energy demands of ongoing bodily functions. We critically assess this assumption by measuring both basal metabolic rate (BMR) and exercise-induced maximal metabolic rate (MMR) in house sparrows before and after the primary and two subsequent vaccinations with either saline (sham) or two novel antigens (keyhole limpet haemocyanin and sheep red blood cells; KLH and SRBC, respectively). We also examined the effect of inducing male breeding levels of testosterone (T) on immune responses and their metabolic costs in both males and females. Although there was a moderate decrease in KLH antibody formation in T-treated birds, there was no effect of T on BMR, MMR or immunity to SRBC. There was no effect of vaccination on BMR but, surprisingly, all vaccinated birds maintained MMR better than sham-treated birds as the experiment progressed. Our findings caution against emphasizing energy costs or nutrient diversion as being responsible for reported fitness reductions following activation of adaptive immunity.

AB  - Caterpillars build various shelters that protect them from natural enemies, but whether specific shelters provide different protection is unknown. To disentangle a caterpillar species' shelter from the rest of its phenotype, we performed a field experiment in which two caterpillar species (Urbanus dorantes and U. proteus) were removed from their original shelters, placed into shelters made by conspecifics or heterospecifics, and monitored for predation and parasitism. Predation was intense, with 0-48% of caterpillars surviving depending on treatment. Shelter builder identity significantly affected predation independent of occupant identity, with caterpillars placed in U. proteus shelters experiencing higher predation than those in U. dorantes shelters. The effect of shelter builder identity was related to shelter type: shriveled leaf shelters built by U. dorantes had a lower risk of predation than cut-and-fold shelters built by either species. Cut-and-fold shelters built by the two species did not have significantly different shapes. Caterpillar stage also significantly affected predation (mid-instars were more successful than early instars), but caterpillar species identity did not. Surprisingly, parasitism was rare, but both shriveled leaf shelters and cut-and-fold shelters resulted in similar overall caterpillar mortality. The differences in predation and overall mortality between shelter types suggest a trade-off between protection from predators and parasitoids. This experiment demonstrates that shelter type determines the fate of the caterpillar inside, independent of the identity of the caterpillar that built the shelter. This is the first experimental evidence that predation may select for shelter type and associated shelter-building behavior in Lepidoptera.

AB  - African forest hogs (genus Hylochoerus) are extant Afro-tropical suids that inhabit a variety of forest environments and thick bushlands and are predominantly herbivores. Hylochoerus likely evolved from a Pleistocene Kolpochoerus majus-like ancestor, but its recent evolutionary history is virtually unknown. Here, we describe a partial right lower third molar from the Late Pleistocene Wasiriya Beds of Rusinga Island (similar to 50-36 ka). The crowns are mesiodistally compressed in a bunolophodont fashion and arranged in columnar pillars that resemble those of extant Hylochoerus. We provide accurate data derived from computed tomography on the hypsodonty index (HI) of extant Hylochoerus and show that the Rusinga third molar crown was as tall as those of its modern counterpart (HI = 1.8-2.0). Stable carbon isotope analyses suggest that the diet of the Rusinga specimen (delta C-13 = -17.0 parts per thousand) was also like that of extant forest hogs (delta C-13 average = -17.6 parts per thousand). This extremely negative value contrasts strikingly with those of other fossil large herbivores at Rusinga (delta C-13 average = -0.7 parts per thousand.). Among the potential explanations for this anomaly, the most likely is that the Late Pleistocene paleoenvironments were more heterogeneous than previously considered and may have included closed-canopy woodland in the highlands of Rusinga.

AB  - Simple Summary Cytochrome P450 2E1 (CYP2E1) is a key enzyme involved in the hepatic metabolism of the major boar taint compound, skatole. Here, we identified single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the promoter region of the CYP2E1 gene that were associated with CYP2E1 mRNA expression, but not with CYP2E1 protein expression. This demonstrates the role of promoter SNPs in the expression of CYP2E1 mRNA and suggests that factors that regulate the translation of CYP2E1 mRNA may also be important in affecting skatole metabolism.Abstract Boar taint, an unfavorable odor in the meat of intact male pigs, is caused primarily by the accumulation of two compounds: androstenone and skatole. This multifactorial trait is regulated by numerous dietary, management and genetic factors. At the mechanistic level, there are many genes known to be involved in boar taint metabolism. Cytochrome P450 2E1 (CYP2E1) impacts boar taint through the phase I metabolism of skatole. The aim of this study was to identify single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within the CYP2E1 gene promoter and explore their relationship with the expression of CYP2E1 mRNA and protein. Sequencing of the promoter region using pools of genomic DNA identified seven promoter region SNPs at -159, -586, -1693, -1806, -2322, -2369 and -2514 bp upstream of the ATG start site. Genomic DNA was obtained from 65 boars from the three major swine breeds: Duroc, Landrace and Yorkshire, and individual animals were genotyped for the identified SNPs. RNA was isolated from liver tissue and quantitative PCR was performed to measure CYP2E1 gene expression, while levels of CYP2E1 protein in liver were measured by Western blotting. Significant within-breed variation in CYP2E1 protein and mRNA expression was observed, indicating significant differences in gene expression among individuals. However, levels of CYP2E1 mRNA and protein were not significantly correlated. Two SNPs within the promoter were significantly associated with CYP2E1 mRNA expression, but not with protein expression. This study provides evidence of additional mutations affecting the gene expression of CYP2E1 and suggests that factors that affect the differences in translation of CYP2E1 mRNA may also be important in affecting skatole metabolism.

AB  - For centuries humans have been interested in using biologically active compounds of animal origin to supplement their diets and to prevent and treat diseases. Nowadays, many extracts are produced to ensure the availability of dietary supplements to consumers worldwide. However, with the population constantly growing, there is a need to develop more effective extraction methods that can enable producers to supply the global market with high-quality products. In this paper, we study the structures and the chemical compositions of antler extracts prepared with antlers of the Altai wapiti and the Tundra Reindeer and compare conventional percolation with a circular (recurring) percolation method that involves multiple, repeated usage of the solvent. We also examine the concentration of the solvent. We argue that circular percolation provides dietary supplement producers with more opportunities, as with this method, the obtained extract is richer in biologically active compounds. The findings of the study can be of interest to dietary supplement producers.

AB  - Simple Summary For minimizing "Human Wildlife Conflicts" (HWCs), it is important to understand the interactions of wildlife with human activities-especially in non-protected areas. The wild boar (Sus scrofa) is one of the most widely spread and highly adaptable ungulate species-referred to as a pest species. The increase in wild boar numbers and ranges is linked to the increasing economic and ecological impacts. In Pakistan, wild boar numbers are rapidly multiplying because, generally, it is hunted neither for meat nor for trophies by locals because of strict religious prohibitions. However, in some rural areas, wild boars are killed by the farmers-mostly using firearms-yet, the rate of these kills does not match this animal's overall reproductive rate. Moreover, a decline in the numbers of apex predators is also adding to the ever-increasing wild boar population. Being a pest species with huge numbers, the wild boar is one of the chief reasons for HWCs in Pakistan. In addition to the economic losses (crop damage and orchard damage) caused by wild boars, a hostile attitude in local communities has developed towards wildlife, in general. In the current study, we investigated the economic effects of the wild boar on pastoral communities' livelihoods and on locals' attitudes towards wild boars in northwestern Pakistan. The results revealed that the major crops raided by wild boars were maize, wheat, and vegetables. Most respondents considered the wild boar to be a very common species and wished for its complete elimination from the area. We believe that properly monitoring and controlling the wild boar population, coupled with compensation schemes, can be very promising for minimizing this kind of HWCs. Conservation goals can only be best achieved when there is firm support and cooperation from locals, especially in emerging economies where poor communities often bear most of the cost of human-wildlife conflicts (HWCs). In this study, we explored the economic losses caused by wild boars in two districts, i.e., the Peshawar district and the Nowshera district, in north-western Pakistan. Between May and June 2022, 589 respondents from 53 villages were interviewed. The results revealed that the wild boar was chiefly involved in crop raiding, causing an annual economic loss of USD 12,030 (USD 20.42/household). The highly raided crops included maize (40.24%), followed by wheat (24.95%), vegetables (22.65%), and sugarcane (6.29%). Wild boars were also held accountable for orchard damages. Most people consider the wild boar a common species in the area and want it completely eliminated. We believe that the increasing wild boar population is alarming and should be noticed. The government should collaborate with the local communities to use innovative methods to deter wild boars. Compensation schemes for crop damages should be launched. Moreover, the regular investigation of the wild boar population size and their carrying capacities should be enlisted as integral parts of wildlife management in the area.

AB  - Parrotfishes are prominent members of the herbivore/detritivore feeding guild on coral reefs. Their feeding activity is important for the removal of algae and detritus, the clearing of new settlement sites for coral and other larvae, and the bioerosion and redistribution of sand across the reef. Estimates of parrotfish feeding activity are normally obtained by divers that may influence or overlook fish behaviors, and are of short duration, limited to shallow habitats, and have limited temporal resolution to associate feeding activity with ecological processes. Excavator and scraper parrotfishes have a robust beak-like jaw morphology that produces a unique sound as the teeth scrape the surface of hard coral rock. We tested the hypothesis that ambient parrotfish bite sounds can be used to estimate their temporal patterns of feeding and associations with environmental variates in the area of an acoustic recorder. Acoustic recorders were deployed on 2 Hawaiian reefs to collect ambient fish sounds for a period of 3 yr. Parrotfish bite sounds showed distinct and repetitive variations in daily, seasonal, and annual feeding patterns, and were statistically correlated with factors of day length and tide range. This study demonstrates the utility of using parrotfish bite sounds to estimate patterns of feeding at coral reef sites. We suggest that regular sampling by multiple acoustic monitors may be a cost-efficient and valuable tool for monitoring the health, degradation, and recovery of large coral reef areas.

AB  - A comprehensive understanding of the functions of Aquaporins (AQPs) is indispensable for elucidating physiological adjustments to varied habitats and addressing water balance complexities amid environmental fluctuations. This experiment endeavors to investigate the relationship between cutaneous AQPs and morphological traits in two sheep breeds with differing haircoat textures, the Naimi and Najdi, under simulated heat stress conditions. Ten male lambs from each breed were housed individually in controlled environments and subjected to cyclic heat stress mimicking summer conditions for six weeks. Sweating rates (SR) were measured biweekly, and skin and coat samples were collected for analysis in the final week. Additionally, the mRNA expression levels of Aquaporin 1 (AQP1), Aquaporin 3 (AQP3), and Aquaporin 5 (AQP5) in skin tissue were assessed. Results showed a (P < 0.05) increase in skin AQPs gene expression following thermal exposure in both breeds, accompanied by elevated SR. However, the Naimi breed exhibited (P < 0.05) higher AQP1 expression levels, correlating with differences in their skin depth, coat thickness, and fleece density compared to the Najdi breed, which showed (P < 0.05) heightened AQP5 expression, consistent with their thicker hair diameter. Both breeds displayed similar upregulation of AQP3, suggesting its equivalent role in facilitating perspiration during heat stress. In conclusion, this experiment represents one of the initial inquiries into the presence of AQPs genes within the dermal layers of sheep. The involvement of both skin AQPs and sweating response might emphasizes the intricate interplay between their physical attributes and genetic predispositions in coping with heat stress, indicating a multifaceted process of thermoregulation in sheep. The obtained findings underscore the role of AQPs in helping sheep breeds with distinct coat textures adapt to environmental challenges and maintain water balance, and thus might support targeted breeding strategies for enhanced heat tolerance in arid environments.

AB  - BackgroundLIM homeobox transcription factor 4 (LHX4) is a promising candidate gene for mammalian reproductive traits. LHX4 polymorphism has previously been associated with phenotypic traits in goats and cattle. However, there have been no LHX4 gene polymorphisms identified in Awassi sheep. Therefore, this study investigated the effects of the LHX4 polymorphism on reproductive hormones, growth hormones, and prolactin in Awassi ewes.Methods and resultsA total of 232 ewes between the ages of 3 and 4 years were selected for this study (123 single-progeny ewes and 109 twin-producing ewes). Serum was collected to measure reproductive hormones, growth hormone, and prolactin using ELISA kits made by ELK Biotechnology. Genomic DNA was extracted from sheep blood, genotyped, and sequenced to confirm variations in LHX4 (exon 1, 207 bp). Genotyping revealed three genotypes in 207 bp: AA, AG, and GG. Sequence analysis detected a novel mutation in exon 1: 160 A > G. Statistically, the 160 A > G SNP was significantly associated with the phenotypic traits. Ewes carrying AA genotypes had higher estrogen, progesterone, follicle-stimulating hormones/luteinizing hormones, and growth hormone, and lower prolactin levels (65.63 +/- 3.84) (pg/mL), (6.67 +/- 0.38) (ng/mL), (22.34 +/- 1.27) (ng/mL)/(23.89 +/- 2.13) (ng/mL), (1.30 +/- 0.05) (ng/mL), and (13.16 +/- 0.75) (pg/mL), respectively, compared to AG and GG genotypes in the fourth month of twin-pregnant ewes compared to single-pregnant ewes.ConclusionThis study suggests that the 160 A > G SNP negatively affects the Awassi sheep's hormone levels. It provides valuable insight into the sheep LHX4 gene, which could be an effective marker in marker-assisted selection.

AB  - Considering the taxonomic uncertainties of Neotropical deer species, as well as the threat status of many of them, new studies and strategies for their maintenance are urgently needed. Obtaining live cells is of great importance for the conservation of wild species in order to allow cytogenetic and molecular studies to be carried out and for the construction of genomic resource banks. In order to increase the genetic diversity stored in these banks, the possibility of collecting skin fragments from dead animals (e.g., run over, hunted, deaths related to disease or natural causes) becomes a valuable source and a last alternative for obtaining material from these individuals. However, the interval between the death of the animal and the collection of tissue can directly interfere with the quality of the sample obtained and it is therefore essential to identify the maximum time during which viable cells are still found. Thus, this study sought to establish a protocol for the collection, storage, cryopreservation, and cultivation of skin obtained postmortem from individuals of the species Subulo gouazoubira (gray brocket deer) and Mazama rufa (red brocket deer). The collection of tissue fragments at different postmortem intervals (0 h, 1 h, 2 h, 3 h, 4 h, 5 h, 6 h, 7 h, 8 h, 9 h, 10 h, and 11 h) was evaluated. The tissues were analyzed for fibroblast cell viability immediately after collection. Their ability to undergo cryopreservation was evaluated based on techniques that can be directly applied to samples obtained in the field and their subsequent thawing and success of cell cultures was performed in the laboratory. Regarding the genetic integrity of the cells, the number of metaphases was observed by the mitotic index. The cell viability presented by the samples always remained above 60%. It was possible to establish cell cultures even with the tissues obtained 11 h after the death of the individuals; however, they required twice as many days to reach bottle confluence compared to the cultures performed with the tissues obtained 0 h after the death of the individuals. The results suggest that the best rates of cell viability, time to reach confluence, and number of metaphases per cell (mitotic index) are found in skin fragments collected up to 5 h after the death of individuals when their carcasses are kept at room temperature.

AB  - Tree kangaroos (Dendrolagus spp.) are poorly studied owing to their elusive arboreal nature, which makes detection difficult using traditional methods such as spotlighting and hand-held thermal cameras. This note documents the first successful detection of Bennett's tree kangaroos (D. bennettianus) using thermal drones in tropical rainforest at Cape Tribulation, Australia. In less than an hour, six individuals were observed across 17 ha. The method proved minimally invasive and highly effective in rainforest environments despite dense vegetation and high temperatures, demonstrating both the unexpected abundance of this species and the utility of thermal drones for monitoring tropical arboreal fauna.

AB  - Blastocystis sp. is a familiar parasite in the gastrointestinal tract causing infection in humans and animals. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the Blastocystis sp. prevalence in three sorts of livestock; cattle, goats, and sheep in Pahang, Malaysia, which are reared under two management systems; intensive and semi-intensive farm management system. About 92, 96, and 65 cattle, goat, and sheep fecal samples respectively were collected from different farms around Kuantan, Bera, and Pekan. The fecal samples were cultured in Jones' medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated horse serum and incubated at 37 degrees C for 2 weeks, then observed under light microscopy daily. The total prevalence of Blastocystis sp. was 29.34% in cattle (27/92), 29.16% in goats (28/96), and 43.07% in sheep (28/65). Supported the results of this study, Blastocystis sp. prevalence was higher in sheep and livestock reared by a semi-intensive farm management system (44.38%). However, further study could be done for Blastocystis sp. subtypes identification to determine its genetic diversity. Notwithstanding, this study has provided additional knowledge on the prevalence of each livestock reared in farms around Pahang that serve as important information in understanding host-parasite relationships, besides determining the best farm management system to be applied by farmers.

AB  - Multiple anthropogenic stressors are causing a global decline in foundation species, including macrophytes, often resulting in the expansion of functionally different, more stressor-tolerant macrophytes. Previously subdominant species may experience further positive demographic feedback if they are exposed to weaker plant-herbivore interactions, possibly via decreased palatability or being structurally different from the species they are replacing. However, the consequences of the spread of opportunistic macrophytes for the local distribution and life history of herbivores are unknown. The green alga, Caulerpa filiformis, previously a subdominant macrophyte on low intertidal-shallow subtidal rock shores, is becoming locally more abundant and has spread into warmer waters across the coast of New South Wales, Australia. In this study, we measured (a) the distribution and abundance of a key consumer, the sea urchin Heliocidaris erythrogramma, across a seascape at sites where C. filiformis has become dominant, (b) performed behavioral field experiments to test the role of habitat selection in determining the local distribution of H. erythrogramma, and (c) consumer experiments to test differential palatability between previously dominant higher quality species like Ecklonia radiata and Sargassum sp. and C. filiformis and the physiological consequences of consuming it. At all sites, urchin densities were positively correlated with distance away from C. filiformis beds, and they actively moved away from beds. Feeding experiments showed that, while urchins consumed C. filiformis, sometimes in equal amounts to higher quality algae, there were strong sublethal consequences associated with C. filiformis consumption, mainly on reproductive potential (gonad size). Specifically, the gonad size of urchins that fed on C. filiformis was equivalent to that in starved urchins. There was also a tendency for urchin mortality to be greater when fed C. filiformis. Overall, strong negative effects on herbivore life-history traits and potentially their survivorship may establish further positive feedback on C. filiformis abundance that contributes to its spread and may mediate shifts from top-down to bottom-up control at locations where C. filiformis has become dominant.

AB  - Cropping systems incorporating soil health management practices such as longer rotations, cover crops and green manures, and organic amendments have been shown to improve soil and crop health. However, long-term trials are needed to fully assess the impacts and effects of these systems over time. Crop varieties may also respond differently to cropping practices or systems. In field trials originally established in 2004, three different 3-year potato cropping systems focused on management goals of soil conservation (SC), soil improvement (SI), and disease suppression (DS) were evaluated and compared to a standard 2-year rotation (SQ) and a nonrotation control (PP). Results compiled over a 4-year period (2019-2022) using two different potato varieties showed that the SI system (with a history of compost amendments) improved soil properties, including organic matter and nutrient contents, aggregate stability, and microbial activity relative to other systems. The SI system also had higher total and marketable tuber yields (by 22-28%) relative to the standard SQ system. The DS system, which included a disease-suppressive green manure rotation crop, also improved yield (by 12%) and reduced soilborne diseases (black scurf and common scab). Variety Caribou Russet, a newer variety with improved characteristics, produced higher marketable yields and larger tuber size, as well as lower severity of common scab than the standard Russet Burbank variety. These results demonstrate that improved cropping systems can substantially enhance productivity relative to standard cropping systems, as well as provide greater sustainability through long-term improvements in soil health.

AB  - This article focuses on the development possibilities of the venison market in the Czech Republic. The main factors affecting the primary game market were investigated, both production limitations on the side of the hunters and on the side of the game production purchase prices. These factors were analysed in the context of the consumer prices of general meat production and the purchase prices of common meat (beef, pork). Furthermore, the size of the total game market was estimated, taking into account the export and import of this commodity. The potential venison market size for the Czech Republic was also established in the study. The gap between the development of the market consumer prices and purchase prices of the venison was analysed. The conducted research further revealed that the respondents do not perceive a relationship between the production of venison and the protection of forest ecosystems. With few exceptions, they do not realise that by buying and consuming venison, they can contribute to the support of forestry. Furthermore, the perception of the role of the forest environment in relation to game meat by the public does not correspond to the need to regulate the game density to limit damage to forest stands. The results of this research are recommendations which mainly consist in expanding the offer of the primary production to products significantly closer to the consumer market (moving from a producer market to a consumer market), and the implementation of acti-vation campaigns (tastings, presentations of opinion makers). At the same time, our work revealed the need for further development, and by increasing the value for the customer who, with the appropriate marketing strategy, can perceive this product as a premium organic food through which they contribute to sustainable forest management.

AB  - Utami P, Kunda RM, Anaktototy Y. 2024. First metagenome report of Haemaphysalis bispinosa ticks of Moa buffalo from Southwest Maluku District, Indonesia. Nusantara Bioscience 16: 130-138. Ticks are vectors of pathogenic organisms such as bacteria, protozoa, and viruses, which are potentially fatal to humans and livestock. Haemaphysalis bispinosa Neumann, 1897 is a tick species with three mammalian hosts in Asia and Australia, including Indonesia, with the highest infestation in cattle ( Bos taurus Linnaeus, 1758) and sheep ( Ovis aries Linnaeus, 1758). H. bispinosa is known to transmit many pathogens, but studies on the profile and structure of the microbiota are still very limited. This study aims to investigate the abundance and diversity of microbiota in H. bispinosa to evaluate the bacterial community's structure and to identify and examine potential zoonotic agents from Moa buffalo ( Bubalus bubalis (Linnaeus, 1758). Amplification in this study used primers from the region (V1 -V9) of the 16S rRNA gene. Metagenomic analysis shows that the microbiota community structure is dominated by non-zoonotic bacteria (96.83%), and zoonotic bacteria are found in the percentage (3.17%). Zoonotic agents were dominated by members of the genus Rickettsia (71.82%), Ehrlichia (19.19%), Romboutsia (3.16%), Anaplasma (2.43%), Coxiella (2.24%), Staphylococcus (0, 48%) and Streptococcus (0.43%). Overall, 16 species were found in H. bispinosa , i.e., 11 species belonging to the genus Rickettsia , 2 species from the genus Ehrlichia (i.e., E. canis and E. minasensis ), and 1 species each belonging to the genera Anaplasma , Coxiella , and Romboutsia . It was concluded that the abundance of the microbial community in H. bispinosa based on metagenome analysis using the 16S rRNA gene from Moa buffalo in the Southwest Maluku District was classified as having a diverse abundance of species.

AB  - For pelagic fish, length and weight measurements are common in aquaculture facilities to determine growth rates and rearing stocking densities. Body surface area is required to estimate stocking densities in the case of demersal fish species such as California halibut (Paralichthys californicus). Using image analysis processing technology allowed for the first time to determine body surface area (BSA) and total surface area (TSA) for reared California halibut in a range from 0.77 to 270 g. Flatfish biometric data were obtained using image analysis software with minimal handling and without causing any harm to the animals. Relationships between total length and wet weight versus total surface area (TSA) and body surface area (BSA) are reported for California halibut under farm-like conditions.

AB  - Understanding the genetic mechanism of how animals adapt to extreme conditions is fundamental to determine the relationship between molecular evolution and changing environments. Goat is one of the first domesticated species and has evolved rapidly to adapt to diverse environments, including harsh high-altitude conditions with low temperature and poor oxygen supply but strong ultraviolet radiation. Here, we analyzed 331 genomes of domestic goats and wild caprid species living at varying altitudes (high > 3000 m above sea level and low < 1200 m), along with a reference-guided chromosome-scale assembly (contig-N50: 90.4 Mb) of a female Tibetan goat genome based on PacBio HiFi long reads, to dissect the genetic determinants underlying their adaptation to harsh conditions on the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau (QTP). Population genomic analyses combined with genome-wide association studies (GWAS) revealed a genomic region harboring the 3 '-phosphoadenosine 5 '-phosphosulfate synthase 2 (PAPSS2) gene showing strong association with high-altitude adaptability (P-GWAS = 3.62 x 10(-25)) in Tibetan goats. Transcriptomic data from 13 tissues revealed that PAPSS2 was implicated in hypoxia-related pathways in Tibetan goats. We further verified potential functional role of PAPSS2 in response to hypoxia in PAPSS2-deficient cells. Introgression analyses suggested that the PAPSS2 haplotype conferring the high-altitude adaptability in Tibetan goats originated from a recent hybridization between goats and a wild caprid species, the markhor (Capra falconeri). In conclusion, our results uncover a hitherto unknown contribution of PAPSS2 to high-altitude adaptability in Tibetan goats on QTP, following interspecific introgression and natural selection.

AB  - This study compares the decision-making processes and workflows of complex and simple wildlife forensic cases at the Wyoming Game and Fish Wildlife Forensic Laboratory. To highlight the varied processes involved in analyzing cases at the laboratory, a complex case, consisting of eighteen different animals and a simpler case consisting of only two animals will be discussed. Both cases highlight several decision making points throughout to determine the number of samples to collect, if the samples contain biological material, the extraction methods to be used, and how to proceed with downstream analyses. These decision points are notably more numerous in the complex case. Both cases cover the process of subsampling, extraction methods, test methods, and results. At the time of the complex case, sanger sequencing, used for species identification of the deer species did not allow for the differentiation between the closely related white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) and mule deer (Odocoileus hemionus) and a protein analysis was used to differentiate them. A new procedure, population assignment in conjunction with sequencing, validated after the complex case and prior to the simple case made the differentiation easier and more efficient. This change in species identification emphasizes the need for continual validation of new procedures. Results of wildlife forensic cases are not only dependent on the analyses performed, but also on the decisions made by the analyst throughout the process.

AB  - Climate change poses enormous challenges for agriculture in developing countries, impacting farmers' livelihoods. Farmers are extremely affected by their need to adapt to changing climatic variations. Climate resilient technologies are an effective means to protect farming systems from climate variability. National Innovations on Climate Resilient Agriculture (NICRA) is a flagship initiative of the Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR), New Delhi which has demonstrated, and promoted the application of climate-resilient technologies in the most vulnerable 151 districts across 28 states and 1 union territory in India. This study has been conducted to investigate the extent to which CRA technologies are being adopted by the farmers in the NICRA project executed in villages of Suryapet and Khammam districts in Telangana state, India. It further studied the factors affecting the extent of adoption of CRA technologies and whether these technologies help achieve the United Nations (UN) Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). A structured interview was carried out to obtain data from 200 respondents. Data was analyzed using normalization of the adoption index and step-wise multiple regression analysis. Results discovered medium to high levels of adoption of CRA technologies by the farmers with interventions like deep ploughing, in situ moisture conservation technologies, improved paddy varieties, crop diversification, crop rotation, deworming in sheep and goats, improved backyard poultry breeds and Custom Hiring Centres were highly adopted by the farmers. Factors like innovative proneness, availability of water resources, economic motivation, farming system, land holding, and risk-taking ability have significantly contributed to the adoption of CRA technologies. Results revealed that NICRA interventions facilitated the achievement of various SDGs, viz., SDG-1 (no poverty), SDG-2 (zero hunger), SDG-3 (good health and well-being), SDG-8 (decent work and economic growth), SDG-12 (responsible consumption and production), SDG-13 (climate action), and SDG-15 (life on land). The study recommends increasing awareness among farmers and enhancing their capacity through various programmes by extension personnel to further improve the adoption of CRA technologies and achieve SDGs.

AB  - The submerged plant species Carolina fanwort (Cabomba caroliniana) has become a dominant invasive aquatic plant in the Lake Taihu Basin (LTB) in China. Introduced species may escape their original specialist enemies and encounter fewer enemies in their new environment. They were assumed to have suffered less herbivory than native species as they are relatively unpalatable (the enemy release hypothesis [ERH]). The objective of this study was to compare the responses of C. caroliniana with those of co-occurring native species to herbivory from native herbivores. We conducted a mesocosm experiment to record the responses of C. caroliniana and two commonly co-occurring native submerged plant counterparts, water thyme (Hydrilla verticillata) and Eurasian watermilfoil (Myriophyllum spicatum), to herbivory by two native generalist gastropod snails, Radix swinhoei and Sinotaia quadrata. Plant morphological traits (total biomass, shoot/root [S/R] biomass ratio and relative growth rate [RGR]) and physiological traits (leaf total nonstructural carbohydrate [TNC], lignin, and cellulose) were recorded. The snail S. quadrata rarely influenced the plant traits of the three submerged plants. With the increasing numbers of R. swinhoei treatments, most of the plant traits of H. verticillata and M. spicatum changed, while those of C. caroliniana showed a relatively stable fluctuation. This result indicates that C. caroliniana is more resistant to herbivory by the snail R. swinhoei, which is consistent with the ERH hypothesis. This finding indicates that herbivorous snail species contributes to the invasion of C. caroliniana, which potentially alters the species composition of submerged plants in the plant community.

AB  - The over-supplementation of animal feeds with phosphorus (P) within livestock-production systems leads to high rates of P excretion and thus to high P loads and losses, which negatively impact the natural environment. The addition of phytase to pig and poultry diets can contribute to reducing P excretion; however, cascading effects of phytase on plant-soil systems remain poorly understood. Here, we addressed how three different diets containing various levels of exogenous phytase, i.e., (1) no-phytase, (2) phytase (250 FTU), and (3) superdose phytase (500 FTU) for pigs (Sus scrofa domesticus) and broilers (Gallus gallus domesticus) might affect P dynamics in two different plant-soil systems including comfrey (Symphytum x uplandicum) and ryegrass (Lolium perenne). We found that differences in phytase supplementation significantly influenced total P content (%) of broiler litter and also pig slurry (although not significantly) as a result of dietary P content. P Use Efficiency (PUE) of comfrey and ryegrass plants was significantly higher under the intermediate 'phytase' dose (i.e., commercial dose of 250 FTU) when compared to 'no-phytase' and 'superdose phytase' associated with pig slurry additions. Soil P availability (i.e., water soluble P, WSP) in both comfrey and ryegrass mesocosms significantly decreased under the intermediate 'phytase' treatment following pig slurry additions. Dietary P content effects on P losses from soils (i.e., P leaching) were variable and driven by the type of organic amendment. Our study shows how commercial phytase levels together with higher dietary P contents in pig diets contributed to increase PUE and decrease WSP thus making the plant-soil system more P conservative (i.e., lower risks of P losses). Our evidence is that dietary effects on plant-soil P dynamics are driven by the availability of P forms (for plant uptake) in animal excretes and the type of organic amendment (pig vs. broiler) rather than plant species identity (comfrey vs. ryegrass).

AB  - Integrating the single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) significantly affecting target traits from imputed whole-genome sequencing (iWGS) data into the genomic prediction (GP) model is an economic, efficient, and feasible strategy to improve prediction accuracy. The objective was to dissect the genetic architecture of intramuscular fat content (IFC) by genome wide association studies (GWAS) and to investigate the accuracy of GP based on pedigree-based BLUP (PBLUP) model, genomic best linear unbiased prediction (GBLUP) models and Bayesian mixture (BayesMix) models under different strategies. A total of 482 Suhuai pigs were genotyped using an 80 K SNP chip. Furthermore, 30 key samples were selected for resequencing and were used as a reference panel to impute the 80 K chip data to the WGS dataset. The 80 K data and iWGS data were used to perform GWAS and test GP accuracies under different scenarios. GWAS results revealed that there were four major regions affecting IFC. Two important functional candidate genes were found in the two most significant regions, including protein kinase C epsilon (PRKCE) and myosin light chain 2 (MYL2). The results of the predictions showed that the PBLUP model had the lowest reliability (0.096 +/- 0.032). The reliability (0.229 +/- 0.035) was improved by replacing pedigree information with 80 K chip data. Compared with using 80 K SNPs alone, pruning iWGS SNPs with the R-squared cutoff of linkage disequilibrium (0.55) led to a slight improvement (0.006), adding significant iWGS SNPs led to an improvement of reliability by 0.050 when using a one-component GBLUP, a further increase of 0.033 when using a two-component GBLUP model. For BayesMix models, compared with using 80 K SNPs alone, adding additional significant iWGS SNPs into one- or two-component BayesMix models led to improvements of reliabilities for IFC by 0.040 and 0.089, respectively. Our results may facilitate further identification of causal genes for IFC and may be beneficial for the improvement of IFC in pig breeding programs.

AB  - The domestication and artificial selection of wild boars have led to dramatic morphological and behavioral changes, especially in East Chinese (ECN) pigs. Here, we provide insights into the population structure and current genetic diversity of representative ECN pig breeds. We identify a 500-kb region containing six tooth development-relevant genes with almost completely different haplotypes between ECN pigs and Chinese wild boars or European domestic pigs. Notably, the c.195A>G missense mutation in exon 2 of AMBN may cause alterations in its protein structure associated with tusk degradation in ECN pigs. In addition, ESR1 may play an important role in the reproductive performance of ECN pigs. A major haplotype of the large lop ear-related MSRB3 gene and eight alleles in the deafness-related GRM7 gene may affect ear morphology and hearing in ECN pigs. Interestingly, we find that the two-end black (TEB) coat color in Jinhua pigs is most likely caused by EDNRB with genetic mechanisms different from other Chinese TEB pigs. This study identifies key loci that may be artificially selected in Chinese native pigs related to the tusk, coat color, and ear morphology, thus providing new insights into the genetic mechanisms of domesticated pigs.Copyright (c) 2022, The Authors.

AB  - For the first time changes in the 137Cs activity in game throughout Poland, including its most contaminated part known as the Opole Anomaly, were analyzed. Due to its long physical half-life, 137Cs continuously demonstrates high activity both in soil and biota. The species of game mammals, along with forest fruit and mushrooms, tend to accumulate this radionuclide, becoming one of the main sources of secondary contamination in people. In this study the 137Cs activity in roe deer, wild boar and red deer muscle tissue samples, within the years of 1986-2019, were studied. The effective and environmental half-lives were determined for each of the mentioned species for four regions including NE Poland and the Opole Anomaly placed in SW Poland. In all examined species at least two different phases of changes in the 137Cs activity were distinguished, therefore the values of effective halflives for the researched period since the Chernobyl accident do not correspond with the values from within last ten years. It was proven for the first time that within the anomalous area, featuring the highest values of gamma surface activity in Poland, the 137Cs activity increases with time in the muscle tissues of all three species. No intraspecies, nor interspecies differences of 137Cs activity among the studied species were found. In the light of the collected data, monitoring game considering the 137Cs activity appears to be valid, as, due to not completely clear trophic dependencies, this radionuclide currently increased its migration to the game species despite passing its physical half-life period.

AB  - Simple Summary The damage by Hippotiscus dorsalis (Hemiptera: Pentatomidae) has resulted in the substantial mortality of moso bamboo in South China. In this study, we survey the damage of H. dorsalis from 2005 to 2013 in Huzhou, Zhejiang Province, and evaluate the current and future potential distribution in China. The results revealed (1) the April mean temperature and April maximum temperature were the main factors affecting the damage of H. dorsalis, and (2) the significant expansion of high suitable areas in Anhui and Jiangxi Provinces under future climate circumstances. Hippotiscus dorsalis is the main pest of Phyllostachys edulis in South China. The relationship between climate change and outbreak of H. dorsalis, and the current and future distribution of H. dorsalis are unknown. This study aimed to confirm the effect of climate on population density and the attacked bamboo rate of H. dorsalis, using field survey data from 2005 to 2013 in Huzhou, Zhejiang Province, and to reveal the potential distribution of H. dorsalis under current and future climate conditions using the MaxEnt model. The damage investigation and distribution forecast revealed the following: (1) The mean monthly temperature and maximum temperatures were main factors affecting the population density and the attacked bamboo rate in April in the Anji county of Zhejiang Province; they are all significantly and positively correlated. (2) High suitable area will significantly expand in Anhui and Jiangxi Provinces under the future climate circumstances, and the total suitable area will present a decrease because of the precipitation restriction. The significant expansion of high suitable area in the Anhui and Jiangxi Provinces under future climate circumstances means that the affected provinces will face even greater challenges. These findings provide a theoretical basis for the early forecasting and monitoring of pest outbreaks.

AB  - Chrysanthemum, an agricultural economic crop with ornamental, medicinal, and edible values, faces the problem of continuous cropping obstacles in its cultivation. As a potential soil conditioner used to address continuous cropping obstacles (CCOs), the applicability of biochar in chrysanthemum cultivation has become a research hotspot. This study explored the effects of three different types of biochar (rice straw biochar = RB, pig manure biochar = PB, and sludge biochar = SB) on soil for chrysanthemum that had been continuously cultivated for eight years through pot experiments. The results indicate that the addition of biochar significantly reduced soil water loss. Compared with CK, the water retention rates of the SB and PB treatments increased by 25.4% and 18.4%, respectively. In the PB treatment, the contents of available phosphorus (AP) and available potassium (AK) increased by 85% and 164%, respectively. The available nitrogen (AN) content showed the highest increase under the SB treatment. All three types of biochar could improve the pH value of chrysanthemum soil with CCOs (increased by 0.4-5.4%). The results of microbial community diversity showed that, compared with CK, PB and RB slightly reduced the diversity of bacterial communities in chrysanthemum soil with CCOs (by 1.50% and 0.41%, respectively). However, the SB treatment increased the diversity of bacterial communities in chrysanthemum soil with CCOs (by 0.41%). At the same time, SB and PB significantly inhibited the diversity of fungal communities (reduced by 15.15% and 6.67%, respectively), while RB promoted the diversity of fungal communities (increased by 5.45%). Furthermore, the analysis results of bacterial phyla and genera indicated that PB and SB had enhancing effects on the beneficial bacterial phylum Actinobacteriota (8.66% and 4.64%) and the beneficial bacterial genus Nocardioides (23.29% and 9.69%). Additionally, the PB treatment enhanced the beneficial bacterial phylum Firmicutes (7.03%). The analysis results of fungal genera and phyla indicated that PB contributed to an increase in the beneficial fungal phylum Ascomycota (1.51%). RB significantly enhanced the beneficial fungal genus Chaetomium (56.34%). Additionally, all three types of biochar effectively reduced the abundance of the harmful fungal phylum Basidiomycota (30.37-73.03%). In the PB and SB treatments, the harmful fungal phylum Mucoromycota was significantly decreased (by 36.22% and 62.60%, respectively). Finally, all three types of biochar reduced the abundance of harmful fungal genera Acremonium (1.15-35.19%) and Phoma (97.1-98.7%). In this study, we investigated the effect of three kinds of biochar (RB, PB, and SB) on the soil of chrysanthemum continuous cropping through potting experiments and found that they could significantly reduce water loss, enhance water retention, increase the soil nutrient content, improve the pH value, regulate microbial communities, increase beneficial microorganisms, and reduce harmful microorganisms. These results provide a scientific basis for addressing barriers to continuous cropping (CC) while supporting the sustainability of agriculture and the development of agroecology.

AB  - Thousands of captive white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) facilities exist across North America for the purpose of producing trophy-quality deer (i.e., exceptionally large-antlered). Many of these deer get marketed to private landowners with the expectation that introduced deer will enhance genetics in the population, resulting in larger-antlered male deer. Previous research suggests that white-tailed deer experience highly variable survival and reproductive success post-translocation, however, little is known about the fate of translocated white-tailed deer sourced from captive-breeding operations. We translocated 24 adult female deer over a 3-year period into a private, 300-ha high-fence enclosure in east-central Alabama. We monitored survival, reproductive success, and fawn recruitment of the translocated deer using VHF radio collars and vaginal implant transmitters (VITs). We found that survival rates were greater than studies where deer were translocated from the wild, but fawn survival and recruitment was poor. We believe our findings provide a baseline of expectations for captive deer translocations. Our following research objectives focus on improving camera survey output for white-tailed deer by reducing sex-age misclassifications. Previous research suggests that misclassifications may be an important source of error in wildlife camera surveys. We developed and tested the effects of species-specific training material designed to reduce sex-age misclassification associated with white-tailed deer images. We found exposure to training material produced the greatest significant improvement on classification accuracy of deer images compared to any other respondent-based factors we investigated. We also found that other experiential factors were positively associated with classification accuracy of deer images. Our findings suggest that use of species-specific training material can reduce misclassifications, leading to more reliable data.

AB  - A comparative analysis of physicochemical and biological properties of Kastanozems and Solonetzes, the two most common soil types in the Caspian region of the post-Soviet territory was carried out. The carbonate, salt, Corg, mineral N (NH4+ and NO3-) contents, microbial biomass (measured by ds-DNA and phospholipids), and activity of 17 hydrolases involved in the C, N, P, and S cycles were measured along the grazing attenuation gradient near a typical sheep farm with year-round grazing. Heavy grazing increases the number of Solonetz areas, they occupy up to 70% of the soil cover. Further away from the farm the areas decrease, and Kastanozems dominate there instead. Both in Kastanozems and Solonetzes, heavy grazing leads to soil salinisation, accumulation of carbonates and nitrates, decrease in ammonia and Corg content, microbial biomass, and enzymatic activity. At moderate grazing, a significant increase in microbial biomass and enzymatic activity throughout the soil profile, particularly in the 0-10 cm layer was found; at light grazing, it was observed mainly in deeper soil layers, not in the upper 0-10 cm. The microbial biomass and enzymatic activity of soils did not directly follow grazing load and was maximal at moderate grazing, where negative effect of reducing phytomass is compensated by large inputs of animal excreta, stimulating development of soil microbial community. Compared to Kastanozems, Solonetzes were more resistant to pasture load, and under heavy grazing, their properties changed to a lesser extent.

AB  - The Kashmir musk deer (Moschus cupreus, hereafter KMD) is one of the top conservation priority species which is facing population decline due to poaching, habitat loss, and climate change. Therefore, the long-term survival and viability of KMD populations in their natural habitat require conservation and management of suitable habitats. Hence, the present study attempted to assess the suitable habitat of KMD in three protected areas (PAs) of the Western Himalayan region of Uttarakhand using the Maxent modelling algorithm. Our results suggest that Kedarnath wildlife sanctuary (KWLS) possesses the maximum highly suitable habitats (22.55%) of KMD, followed by Govind Pashu Vihar National Park & Sanctuary (GPVNP & S; 8.33%) and Gangotri National Park (GNP; 5%). Among the environmental variables, altitude was the major contributing factor governing the distribution of KMD in KWLS. In contrast, human footprint in GPVNP & S and precipitation in GNP were the major contributing factors governing the distribution of KMD in these respective PAs. The response curve indicated that habitats with less disturbance falling in the altitudinal zone of 2000-4000 m were the most suitable habitat range for the distribution of KMD in all three PAs. However, in the case of GNP suitable habitat of KMD increases with an increase in the value of variables bio_13 (precipitation of wettest month). Further, based on our results, we believe that the predictors of suitable habitat change are site specific and cannot be generalized in the entire distribution range of the species. Therefore, the present study will be helpful in making proper habitat management actions at fine scale for the conservation of KMD.

We analysed which climatic and environmental factors affected the dietary composition of golden jackals and compared these drivers in the species' historic and recently colonized distribution ranges. Location Eurasia. Taxon Golden jackal (Canis aureus). Methods Using 40 published datasets, we modelled jackal diet composition using 13 food categories based on the relative frequency of occurrence of food items and trophic niche breadth (BA) against climatic and environmental factors from throughout the jackals' recently colonized (22 studies) and historic range (18 studies) using general additive models. Results The proportion of small mammals in golden jackal diet decreased with annual mean temperature, whereas the consumption of wild ungulates increased with environmental productivity. Increasing temperature and environmental productivity positively influenced niche breadth, while increasing precipitation negatively affected it. The recently colonized distribution range of golden jackals in Europe had a lower mean temperature but higher environmental productivity compared to the species' historic range in Eurasia. In the recently colonized range, jackals consumed small mammals and/or wild ungulates (mostly from scavenging) more frequently, and fewer plants and/or domestic animals (again, mostly from scavenging). Main Conclusions The golden jackal is an opportunistic, omnivorous carnivore with high dietary flexibility and biogeographical variation. Climatic and environmental factors shape the species' diet composition, which, in a changing environment, greatly enhances the opportunities for golden jackals to colonize new areas successfully. Golden jackals will likely continue to expand their range in the foreseeable future. The species' trophic niche is expected to broaden with predictions of overall increasing temperatures and reduced precipitation.

AB  - <ol><li>Conflict between humans and elephants is one of the more complex examples of human-wildlife conflict, a key challenge for wildlife conservation.

Questionnaires and interviews were conducted before and after seeing the film screened on a mobile cinema in Southern Kenya.

Community members aged between 16-80 also gained knowledge (mean effect size = 0.21) and saw the benefits of elephants (mean effect size = 0.15) but felt the costs of living with elephants more profoundly after viewing TEQ (mean effect size = -0.11). After 90 days a follow-up survey also showed a significant increase in community "affection" towards elephants (mean effect size = 0.11), however the costs, benefits and knowledge gained had been reduced to a statistically insignificant level compared to baseline.</li><li>Our results suggest that natural history films can serve as a valuable tool in inspiring young minds.

AB  - The paper presents the results of telemetry observations of movements of individuals of the European elk Alces alces (Linnaeus, 1758) received in the period from 2021 to 2023. Two males were released into the wild after accidentally entering anthropogenic sites in St. Petersburg. Additionally, one female was released into the wild after a prolonged (about two years) existence in captivity. The individuals were equipped with collars containing GPS/GSM transmitters. The calculated values of the individuals' movements for one hour, as well as the values of the diurnal path and diurnal displacement, are presented. In 75% of the cases, the observed individuals did not move more than 200 m per hour. The highest median values of the diurnal path and diurnal displacement for the adult male were observed in June (4369 m/1649 m), and the lowest in February (677 m/195 m). For other individuals, due to the short term of monitoring, values were calculated for the entire observation period and were 2015 m and 619 m for the adult female, respectively, and 4297 m and 1431 m for the yearling male. Movements of the adult male indicate seasonal sedentariness and consistent habitat use in summer. We identified 5 spatially distinct habitat periods associated with the seasonal behaviour of the individuals: the readaptation area after release into the natural environment, summer habitat areas, autumn-winter traveling area, winter habitat area and spring migration. Further, we estimated individual home ranges using different methods: the minimum convex polygon, kernel density estimation, local convex hull and concave polygon alpha shape. Minimum convex polygon home range sizes (100% locations) were: for the adult male - 66692 ha in 22 months; for the adult female elk - 33178 ha in one month; for the yearling male - 6978 ha in 3.5 weeks. A brief literature review summarises previously published similar measurements made in Russia, Scandinavia, Canada and the USA. A comparison of the calculated values with the literature shows territorial and sex-age differences in the aspect of elk movement in space, as well as methodological differences in the assessment of habitat characteristics.

AB  - Invasive mammalian predators have had a devastating effect on native species globally. The European red fox (Vulpes vulpes) is one such species where it has been introduced in Australia. A novel but unexplored tactic to reduce the impact of mammalian predators is the use of unrewarded prey odors to undermine the effectiveness of olfactory hunting behavior. To test the viability of unrewarded prey odors in an applied setting we investigated how foxes responded to the odors of three different prey species. We used the odors of two locally extinct native Australian marsupials; the eastern quoll (a smaller carnivore) and eastern bettong (a fungivore), and the European rabbit, an introduced herbivore. Conducting our research over a period of 3 weeks in a pastoral environment in South-eastern Australia, we used video observations of foxes' behaviors, as they encountered the different odors. We found a reduction in the number of fox visits to bettong odors in the third week. In contrast, we observed a sustained number of visits to rabbit odors. Foxes also spent more time investigating rabbit odors and displayed longer durations of vigilance behavior at quoll odors. Our results support the hypothesis that the exposure of wild foxes to unrewarded odors of novel prey species can reduce their interest in these odors, which might translate to a reduction in predation pressure. Our results also suggest, however, that olfactory pre-exposure may not be as effective at reducing fox interest in a competitor species' odor.

AB  - Largemouth bass Micropterus salmoides, a popular warm water sport fish, is routinely stocked in reservoirs throughout the USA to augment wild populations. Evaluating if these supplementations are successful requires distinguishing hatchery-sourced fish from their wild counterparts. From 2011 to 2019, over 467 000 largemouth bass fingerlings were stocked from multiple hatchery sources into a large southwestern reservoir (Elephant Butte Reservoir, New Mexico, USA) to supplement the sport fish population. To identify hatchery-sourced largemouth bass, we measured strontium isotope ratios (Sr-87/Sr-86) and determined ages using otoliths and dorsal spines. Otolith analysis of 169 fish classified 92.9% (n = 159) to the reservoir with few fish of hatchery origin (2 from Arkansas, 1.2%, and 1 from Montana, 0.6%). While stocking over 467 000 fingerlings across 8 years appears to reflect negligible stocking success, it is likely that low and variable stocking densities (average 3.0, range 0.29-7.77 fish center dot ha(-1)) contributed to the low stocking success in Elephant Butte Reservoir. Dorsal fin spines did not yield accurate age reconstructions and their Sr-87/Sr-86 values were affected by matrix interferences preventing source assignments.

AB  - The destinies of epiphytic orchids (about 70% of all orchids) are linked to their host trees. However, there is little information on if differences in host trees characteristics can affect the long-term persistence of orchid populations, and how this might vary under different climatic conditions. We compared the population dynamics of two epiphytic orchid species, Alamania punicea and Oncidium brachyandrum growing on two host trees with contrasting leaf phenologies: the deciduous Quercus martinezii and the semideciduous Q. rugosa, over 3 years with varying levels of rainfall, in a montane tropical oak forest in Oaxaca, Mexico. Using data from > 500 individuals growing on 63 host trees, we applied linear mixed effects models, Integral Projection Models, and Life Table Response Experiments to identify the effects of host tree on orchid vital rates and population growth rates. For both orchid species, survival and growth did not differ between host species during wettest year. However, during the driest year both vital rates were higher on the semi-deciduous host Q. rugosa than on the deciduous Q. martinezii. Host species did not affect fecundity for A. punicea, but for O. brachyandrum fecundity was higher on the deciduous host. For A. punicea, lambda values were similar between hosts during the wettest and intermediate years, but significantly lower (Delta lambda = 0.28) on the deciduous than on the semi-deciduous host during the driest year. This was due primarily to lower survival on the deciduous host. For O. brachyandrum, lambda was slightly higher (Delta lambda = 0.03) on the deciduous than the semideciduous host during the wettest year, due to higher growth and reproduction. However, during the intermediate and driest years, lambda values were significantly higher on the semi-deciduous than on the deciduous host (Delta lambda = 0.13 and 0.15, respectively). This was due to higher survival and growth. A. punicea populations appear more vulnerable to dry conditions than O. brachyandrum, likely due to its smaller pseudobulbs, and hence lower water-storing capacity. Our results show that host tree species can both influence the vital rates and the long-term dynamics of orchid populations, and these effects vary across orchids species and over time. Our results highlight the importance of maintaining a diversity of host trees to ensure long-term population persistence.

AB  - Chronic wasting disease (CWD) is a fatal neurodegenerative disease infecting cervids. It is highly contagious and caused by misfolded prions that propagate via templated conformational conversion of the cervid's normal prion protein. Prevalence of CWD in free-ranging deer in North America is mostly low, but in some regions local prevalence has reached 80%. CWD prions can be transmitted via direct contact with infected individuals or indirectly through the environment. Infected individuals shed prions through feces, urine, saliva or carcasses, and prions have long environmental persistence. Long-distance dispersal of infected deer poses a significant risk for CWD spread. We propose an integrodifference equation (IDE) model to capture CWD dynamics and the consequences of long-distance dispersal behavior in white-tailed deer (WTD, Odocoileus virginianus). A diffusion-settling model characterizes long-distance dispersal kernels, accommodating hypothetical dispersal behaviors through time-dependent settling rate functions. Three new closed-form dispersal kernels are approximated using Laplace's method and parameterized with GPS location data collected from WTD in Wisconsin, USA. Settling rates reflecting ongoing sensitivity to stimuli which prompt deer to disperse from their natal home range give the most supported long-distance dispersal kernel. Impact of long-distance dispersal on CWD spread is quantified using the IDE model. At high population densities, long-distance dispersal can magnify CWD spread by a factor of four. At lower population densities single infected individuals cannot initiate an outbreak, but CWD may still spread due to the accumulation of environmental hazard from prions behind the wave of invasion, possibly presenting substantial management challenges.

AB  - Heavy metal contamination raised significant concerns throughout the world. The current research aimed to evaluate the impact of organic manure (cow dung and buffalo dung) on vermiremediation and phytoremediation and to remediate heavy metals, i.e., cadmium, lead, and chromium, from artificial contaminated soil via both remediation techniques. The impact of livestock manure was evaluated for the first time which could be effective in in situ as well as ex situ studies. Eisenia fetida, Pheretima lignicola, and Spinacia oleracea were used for the remediation process. Results revealed that E. fetida tolerated lead at 280 mg, cadmium at 150 mg, and chromium at 860 mg compared to P. lignicola. The growth and reproduction of E. fetida were efficient in the cow dung manure compared to buffalo dung. Similarly, seed germination and growth of Spinacia oleracea were better in cow dung media compared to buffalo dung. Bioaccumulation factor showed that E. fetida showed a higher accumulation of heavy metals in their tissues when vermi + phytoremediation was jointly applied (9.50 mg/l of Pb, 24.166 of Cd, and 6.695 of Cr). Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy indicated that heavy metals had no drastic effects on E. fetida and S. oleracea. Similarly, comet assay revealed that heavy metals had no genotoxic effect on the E. fetida and S. oleracea. It was concluded that both E. fetida and S. oleracea are appropriate for heavy metals remediation in cow dung manure.

AB  - Background: Deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the ventral capsule/ventral striatum (VC/VS) represents a promising therapy for treatment-refractory patients with substance-use disorders. We previously found that low- frequency (LF) DBS aimed to the VC/VS during extinction training strengthens the extinction memory for morphine seeking under a partial extinction protocol. Objectives/Hypothesis: In this study, animals were tested in a full extinction protocol to determine whether LF-DBS applied during extinction facilitates extinction while preventing drug reinstatement, and study the molecular mechanisms underlying the effects of LF-DBS, Methods/Results: We used a full extinction CPP paradigm combined with LF-DBS to assess behavior. Western blots for the pro-extinction molecule, brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) were then performed in corticomesolimbic regions of the brain. Lastly, to determine whether changes in BDNF expression elicited by LF-DBS were specific to the VS/NAc afferents from the hippocampus, amygdala, and medial prefrontal cortex, we performed BDNF-like immunohistochemistry, combined with the retrograde tracer cholera toxin B (CtB). Results: We showed a significant reduction in the number of days required to fully extinguish morphine CPP in animals exposed to LF-DBS during extinction training accompanied by a significant increase in BDNF expression in the hippocampus. However, LF-DBS applied during extinction did not prevent drug reinstatement. Lastly, no changes in BDNF/CtB double-labeled cells were found in VS/NAc projecting cells after one-day exposure to LFDBS. Conclusion(s): These data suggest that LF-DBS can facilitate extinction of morphine CPP by decreasing drug seeking through potential synaptic plasticity changes in the hippocampus to strengthen extinction memories.

AB  - Interspecific interactions are highly relevant in the potential transmission of shared pathogens in multi-host systems. In recent decades, several technologies have been developed to study pathogen transmission, such as proximity loggers, GPS tracking devices and/or camera traps. Despite the diversity of methods aimed at detecting contacts, the analysis of transmission risk is often reduced to contact rates and the probability of transmission given the contact. However, the latter process is continuous over time and unique for each contact, and is influenced by the characteristics of the contact and the pathogen's relationship with both the host and the environment. Our objective was to assess whether a more comprehensive approach, using a movement-based model which assigns a unique transmission risk to each contact by decomposing transmission into contact formation, contact duration and host characteristics, could reveal disease transmission dynamics that are not detected with more traditional approaches. The model was built from GPS-collar data from two management systems in Spain where animal tuberculosis (TB) circulates: a national park with extensively reared endemic cattle, and an area with extensive free-range pigs and cattle farms. In addition, we evaluated the effect of the GPS device fix rate on the performance of the model. Different transmission dynamics were identified between both management systems. Considering the specific conditions under which each contact occurs (i.e. whether the contact is direct or indirect, its duration, the hosts characteristics, the environmental conditions, etc.) resulted in the identification of different transmission dynamics compared to using only contact rates. We found that fix intervals greater than 30 min in the GPS tracking data resulted in missed interactions, and intervals greater than 2 h may be insufficient for epidemiological purposes. Our study shows that neglecting the conditions under which each contact occurs may result in a misidentification of the real role of each species in disease transmission. This study describes a clear and repeatable framework to study pathogen transmission from GPS data and provides further insights to understand how TB is maintained in multi-host systems in Mediterranean environments.
   This study highlights that the traditional approach based on quantifying contacts for disease transmission research can lead to misidentify the species' roles. The implementation of a more comprehensive approach is shown, which considers the contact characteristics and the relationship of the pathogen with the individual and the environment.image

AB  - Ungulates (antelopes, deer and relatives) have some of the most diverse social systems among mammals. To understand the evolution of ungulate social organization, Jarman (1974) proposed an ecological scenario of how distribution of resources, habitat and feeding style may have influenced social organization. Although Jarman's scenario makes intuitive sense and remains a textbook example of social evolution, it has not been scrutinized using modern phylogenetic comparative methods. Here we use 230 ungulate species from ten families to test Jarman's hypotheses using phylogenetic analyses. Consistent with Jarman's proposition, both habitat and feeding style predict group size, since grazing ungulates typically live in open habitats and form large herds. Group size, in turn, has a knock-on effect on mating systems and sexual size dimorphism, since ungulates that live in large herds exhibit polygamy and extensive sexual size dimorphism. Phylogenetic confirmatory path analyses suggest that evolutionary changes in habitat type, feeding style and body size directly (or indirectly) induce shifts in social organization. Taken together, these phylogenetic comparative analyses confirm Jarman's conjectures, although they also uncover novel relationships between ecology and social organization. Further studies are needed to explore the relevance of Jarman (1974) scenario for mammals beyond ungulates.

AB  - Water hyacinth [Pontederiaceae: Pontederia(= Eichhornia) crassipes Mart.] is an invasive alien aquatic weed distributed worldwide on freshwater bodies. More than one hundred species of arthropods have been found to feed on water hyacinth. Still, only a few are used as traditional biological control agents. The weed invaded freshwater bodies, but officially no biological control agents were implemented to manage it in Ethiopia. This study determined the occurrence of the water hyacinth-associated herbivore arthropods and their impact on the weed in the country. Randomly selected 0.5 m2 quadrats containing damaged water hyacinth plants were collected seasonally from Lake Koka, Lake Ziway, and Wonji Sugar Cane Farm drain. The weed growth parameters, herbivore species, and density were determined. Neochetina bruchi and Neochetina eichhorniae, Spodoptera littoralis, Aphis gossypii, and Tetranychus urticae were the identified herbivores. Statistical analysis was carried out using SAS version 9.4. Higher number of N. bruchi (8.6/quadrat), and N. eichhorniae (1.2/quadrat) were found in the wet season on Lake Koka. Higher densities of S. littoralis (6.9/quadrat), A. gossypii (21.8/plant), and T. urticae (5.8/plant) were in the dry season at Wonji drain. In the growth parameters of the water hyacinth, higher weed number (249.4/quadrat), weight (29.0 kg/quadrat), and infestation percentage (17.8/quadrat) were found in the wet season at the Wonji drain. The density of the Neochetina spp. recorded per water hyacinth plant was inadequate to manage it without augmentation. Moreover, there should be further investigation to determine the effects of indigenous herbivores on the water hyacinth.

AB  - Fenitrothion (FNT) is a common organophosphorus pesticide that is widely used in both agricultural and domestic pest control. FNT has been frequently detected in various environmental media, including the human body, and is a notable contaminant. Epidemiological investigations have recently shown the implications of exposure to FNT in the incidence of various metabolic diseases, such as diabetes mellitus in humans, indicating that FNT may be a potential endocrine disruptor. However, the effects of FNT exposure on glucose homeostasis and their underlying mechanisms in model organisms remain largely unknown, which may limit our understanding of the health risks of FNT. In this study, FNT (4 5, 90, 180, and 4 50 mu M) exposure model of rat hepatocytes (Buffalo Rat Liver, BRL cells) was established to investigate the effects and potential mechanisms of its toxicity on glucose metabolism. Several key processes of glucose metabolism were detected in this study. The results showed significantly increased glucose levels in the culture medium and decreased glycogen content in the FNT-exposed BRL cells. The results of quantitative real-time PCR and enzymology showed the abnormal expression of genes and activity/content of glucose metabolic enzymes involved in glucose metabolism, which might promote gluconeogenesis and inhibit glucose uptake, glycolysis, and glycogenesis. Furthermore, gluconeogenesis and glycolytic were carried out in the mitochondrial membrane. The abnormal of mitochondrial membrane potential may be a potential mechanism underlying FNT-induced glucose metabolism disorder. In addition, the mRNA and protein expression implicated that FNT may disrupt glucose metabolism by inhibiting the AMPK alpha and IRS1/PI3K/AKT signaling pathways. In conclusion, results provide in vitro evidence that FNT can cause glucose metabolism disorder, which emphasizes the potential health risks of exposure to FNT in inducing diabetes mellitus.

AB  - Indel (insertion-deletion) events observed in the genome represent irreversible mutational processes, making indel regions crucial characteristics for discussing phylogenetic relationships. The tribe Hippoglossoidini is a recently proposed taxonomic group based on the molecular phylogenetic analyses of both mitochondrial (mt) and nuclear DNA sequences. However, no synapomorphic characteristics have been identified within this tribe, either morphologically or molecularly. In the present study, we sequenced the ND5 region of mtDNA in the righteye flounder species and conducted interspecific comparisons. We found a 12 bp indel immediately upstream of the stop codon in the ND5 region. A comparative analysis of this region with outgroup species from the Paralichthyidae revealed that the indel was a unique insertion shared by the common ancestor of the Hippoglossoidini species, providing irreversible evidence to support the monophyly of this taxonomic group (synapomorphic characters).

AB  - Unsustainable wildlife trade is a major driver of biodiversity loss and an important public health threat. Yet, effective wildlife trade regulation is currently at odds with food security and economic incentives provided by this global, multibillion-dollar industry. Given such limitations, public health and conservation resources can be aligned to target species for which trade both increases risk of extinction and threatens public health. Here, we developed a simple conservation and health trade risk (CHT) index (range: 2-50) using a case study of traded mammals based on species' extinction and zoonotic risks, weighed by the extent of their trade. We applied this index to 1161 International Union for the Conservation of Nature-listed terrestrial mammals involved in the wildlife trade to identify 284 high-priority species that scored high in the CHT index (CHT >= 18). Species ranking high for conservation, public health, and trade risks include those belonging to the orders Primates, Cetartiodactyla (even-toed ungulates), Rodentia (rodents), Chiroptera (bats), and Carnivora (carnivores). Of the high-priority species, 33% (n = 95) are country-endemics and may be good candidates for trade regulations and enforcement at national scales. Our study provides a preliminary step in prioritizing species, taxonomic groups, and countries for focused wildlife trade regulation to meet both conservation and public health goals.

AB  - Forecasting hog prices is challenging and of great importance for hog producers and administrators due to its role in supporting decision-making. Considering that the price of hogs dynamically changes as a result of potential cyclical growth, seasonal variation and irregular fluctuation, this study proposes a novel hybrid model for forecasting the price of hogs in the next breeding cycle by combining the seasonal-trend decomposition procedure based on loess (STL), support vector regression (SVR) and autoregressive moving average (ARMA). Specifically, the subseries of rising, descending and transitional phases are first obtained based on the identification of hog-price cycles and the corresponding three typical phases. The subseries of the current phase and historical identical-type phases are subsequently combined and designed to estimate the price of hogs in predicted periods so as to capture its trend over time. Then, the hog price series extended by the estimated prices is decomposed by the STL into the cyclical-trend, seasonal and remaining components, which are truncated by the extended length and subsequently predicted by the SVR, seasonal-naive and ARMA models, respectively, and the resulting forecasts are finally aggregated. Our main contributions are to propose a novel method of extending hog price series to reduce the caudal decomposition deviation caused by the end effect, and provide a tailored prediction method for each hog-price component. The weekly price series of pork and hogs from Jan. 2006 to Dec. 2018 in China are used to evaluate the forecasting performances of the proposed model and the selected counterparts. The empirical results indicate that the proposed hybrid model is a promising alternative for the hog price forecasting.

AB  - The application of additives to regulate the microbial functional composition during composting has attracted much research attention. However, little is known about the succession and role of the fungal community in the laboratory-scale composting of vegetable waste supplemented with pig manure and microbial agents. The purpose of this study was to identify effective additives for improving vegetable waste composting performance and product quality, and to analyze the microbial community succession during composting. The results showed that the combined addition of pig manure and microbial agents (T2 treatment) accelerated the pile temperature increase, enhanced total organic carbon degradation (23.36%), and promoted the maturation of the compost. Furthermore, the T2 treatment increased the activities of most enzymes, reshaped the microbial community, and reduced the relative abundance of potential animal (1.60%) and plant (0.095%) pathogens. The relative abundance of Firmicutes (71.23%) increased with the combined addition of pig manure and microbial agents in the thermophilic stage. In the middle and late stages, Saccharomonospora, Aspergillus, and Thermomyces, which were related to C/N and total phosphorus, were enriched in the T2 treatment. Network analysis demonstrated that the complexity and stability of the fungal network were more evidently increased in the T2 treatment, and Saccharomonospora, Aspergillus, and Microascus were identified as keystone taxa. The keystone taxa associated with extracellular enzymes contributed significantly to compost maturation. These results provide a reference for the application of additives to improve compost safety in pilot-scale composting.

AB  - Hypoxia is among the most prevailing stressors in aquaculture and exerts negative impacts on fish health and metabolism; hence, the search for dietary strategies that mitigate such impacts has been of prime importance. In the present work, chronic daily periodic hypoxic stress on Oreochromis niloticus was induced, together with the protective role of camel whey protein hydrolysate added at 75 g/kg in the diet. The present study has focused on kidney function, serum ions, cortisol, glucose, and markers of oxidative stress. Expression of hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF-alpha) and inflammation-related genes in the kidney and key genes involved in metabolic and ionregulatory functions in the gills were assessed. Fish was divided into four groups: a control group maintained in normoxic conditions with a basal diet; a hypoxic group subjected to daily 6-h hypoxic periods at DO similar to 1.7 mg/ L with the basal diet; a CW group fed camel whey protein hydrolysate under normoxic conditions; and a combined HPX + CW, which received CW-replaced diet (75 mg/kg diet) during HPX conditions. The hypoxic conditions were achieved by stopping aeration and covering the aquaria with a plastic film daily for 6 h, while the temperature and ammonia levels in the water were regularly checked during the experimental period of four successive weeks. The results revealed renal tissue damage with increased levels of oxidative biomarkers. On the molecular level, down-regulation of SDH; and the up-regulation expression of hypoxia and inflammation-related genes (HIF-alpha, Interleukin-1 beta (IL-1 beta), Collagen, type I, alpha 1(COL1A1), and Transforming factor beta-1 (TGF beta 1)) in the kidney. Also, histopathological alterations were observed including, nephropathic alterations and hyperplasia of gill epithelium, with enhancement in the immunoreactivity to TNF-alpha and Caspase-3. In turn, CW supplementation significantly improved all these parameters and hence can be used as an anti-stress dietary supplement to enhance resilience against hypoxic challenges.

AB  - The tropical estuaries are characterized with high biological production and also impacted by anthropogenic activities. Describing these estuaries in terms of ecological data and trophic dynamics to reveal the ecological impacts is gaining attention recently. In this study, the ecological structure is analyzed for a heavily impacted small macrotidal tropical estuary, Ulhas river estuary (URE), situated near Mumbai megacity in the western coast of India, to delineate the impact of anthropogenic stressors on the ecosystem functioning. The URE is being exploited for sand and fisheries resources, and also faces risks from anthropogenic activities. The ecological data of URE were compiled for 2017-18 together with the most relevant literature estimates to construct an ecosystem model. A trophic organization in 20 functional groups was identified for URE using Ecopath modeling approach. The functional groups identified in the food web ranged from detritus and primary producers (trophic level (TL) = 1) to large pelagics (TL = 4.14). Detritivory: herbivory ratio (1.35) indicated that the detritus chain is dominant over the primary producer's chain. The total system throughput (TST) was estimated as 16 736.2 t km(-2)year(-1). The indices such as net system production (NSP = 1 398.781 t km(-2) year(-1)), total primary production/total biomass (TPP/TB = 25.17), biomass/total system throughput (TB/TST = 0.01), recycling index (Finn's Cycling Index = 13.94%), system omnivory index (0.3), relative ascendency (25.6%), and system overhead (74.4%) classified URE as an immature system. The eco-exergy index (30748.54 gm detritus equivalent m(-2)) showed that the ecosystem is a moderately stable and relatively less organized network. The estuarine fish community index (EFCI) yielded a value of 38 indicating the poor health status of the fish community in URE. The study delivers a comprehensive understanding of the ecosystem setting in URE and characterizes the prevailing condition. The ecological indicators analyzed here point towards a medium to a high level of impact in URE due to anthropogenic activities.

AB  - Habitat destruction is one of the biggest threats to wildlife populations. Climate change may exacerbate the impacts of habitat destruction and alter the distribution of species. We projected the impact of climate change on the distribution of mouflon ( Ovis gmelini ) in central Iran in 2055 and 2085, evaluated the efficiency of protected areas for protecting this species, and identified potential climatic refugia for this species. We analyzed presence data of mouflon according to climate and topographic factors and generated an ensemble model of habitat suitability based on nine species distribution models. In the modeling process, the most important uncorrelated variables were chosen. Using circuit theory, potential connectivity between habitat patches was estimated. To assess the impact of climate change on the study area in 2055 and 2085, two shared socioeconomic pathways (SSPs), SSP 2.6 and SSP 8.5, were used based on the global circulation models. Based on the climatic suitability model, approximately 34.11% of protected areas were recognized as suitable habitats for mouflon. In the forecasted climate conditions, approximately 3.30% of suitable habitats would become unsuitable and approximately 9.36% of the current protected areas will lose their efficiency in supporting this species. In addition, climate change may reduce habitat connectivity for mouflon in the future. We conclude that the development of the network of protected areas and attention to habitat connectivity are necessary for the future migration and survival of this species; therefore, conservation planning should consider the future potential of protected/unprotected areas in supporting mouflon populations.

AB  - A fundamental goal in ecology is to understand the role of consumers in top-down (TD) and bottom-up (BU) processes that affect the functioning of ecosystems. Consumers ingest organic matter and excrete inorganic nutrients, and individual roles are influenced by body size and functional identity. Our study quantifies how alterations to herbivore assemblages affect both TD and BU processes on coral reefs in the South Pacific. We collected empirical data on consumption and nutrient excretion rates from 300 individual herbivorous fishes belonging to five functional groups. Individual-level traits were then scaled to a 13-year time series of fish populations from reefs that have either shifted to algal dominance or remained in the coral state. Large excavating parrotfishes and other herbivores on reefs in the coral state contributed 43% more herbivory and excreted nutrients at a higher ratio of N:P than herbivores on algal-dominated reefs; both processes may benefit coral health. Algal-dominated reefs experienced 56% higher rates of detritivory by large detritivorous fishes that remove detritus from algal surfaces, a process that may facilitate algal dominance. By scaling individual-level traits to population time series, our study provides a framework to quantify how changes to consumer assemblages impact both TD and BU processes across ecosystems undergoing change. Identifying the unique roles of consumers in processes that maintain and reinforce ecosystem states is the key to predicting the importance of shifts in diverse consumer assemblages.

AB  - AimsTransformation of species and functional composition on subtropical reefs are ongoing due to poleward range shifts of some tropical species, with largely unknown consequences to ecosystem functioning. Trait-based approaches are powerful tools to quantify such changes. Here, we evaluated changes in the trait composition of coral-associated fish assemblages along a tropical-to-temperate environmental gradient of ca. 1400 km in southern Japan with abundance-weighted trait expression to assess how trait composition changes with increasing latitude.LocationRyukyu Islands and southern Pacific coast of Japan.TaxonReef fish.MethodsWe tested for shifts in trait space and functional redundancy, based on five morphological, life history and behavioural traits: maximum length, pelagic larval duration, trophic level, substrate preference and reproductive mode. Our trait database was coded with two approaches, first, by attributing a single value to each trait per species, and second, by fuzzy coding that allows more than one value per trait and hence considers some intraspecific trait variation.ResultsWe found a reduction in specialist habitat traits (coral substrate preference, nesters and herbivores) and an increase in generalist traits (predators) with increasing latitude, along with a contraction in trait space from tropical-to-temperate reefs. Functional redundancy declined with increasing latitude. These trends were closely linked with latitudinal gradients in temperature, along with changes in other environmental factors such as turbidity and photosynthetically active radiation.Main ConclusionFunctional turnover and contractions are thus likely due to the marginal conditions for coral-associated fishes at higher latitudes, favouring generalist species, whereas increased resources at lower latitudes favour high redundancy and niche partitioning. Accounting for intraspecific trait variation indicated the same trends but highlighted increased functional vulnerability across all sites. We show that trait complexity in coral-associated fish communities decreases from tropical-to-temperate reefs, highlighting the reduced functional scope that comes with marginal environmental conditions.

AB  - Intensive pig farming systems are often characterised by barren and monotonous environments, which can impair pig welfare. While enriching the environment enhances pig welfare, less is known about the implications of changes in housing conditions regularly happening on commercial farms. This study investigated the effect of a previously enriched-varying (E) or barren-monotonous (B) environment on pigs' behavioural expressions when exposed to a switch of environments from E to B or from B to E as assessed by Qualitative Behaviour Assessment (QBA). QBA is based on the assumption that human observers can integrate subtle details in animals' body language to reflect their affective experience by using descriptors like 'lively' or 'apathetic'. Eight groups of pigs underwent a switch of housing conditions from E to B or from B to E (E*B, B*E), while another eight groups moved to different pens, but with the same conditions (E*E, B*B). Pigs' behaviour was video recorded 24 h before (PRE) and 24 h after the switch (POST). Using Free Choice Profiling, 14 observers blinded to the PREswitch housing conditions were asked to score pigs' behavioural expressions on 64 video clips. Two main dimensions (D1, D2) were identified, which accounted for 65.4 % of the variation. Terms describing dimension 1 (D1) ranged from 'active/engaged/explorative' to 'tired/bored', while dimension 2 (D2) was characterised as ranging from 'bored/restless/aggressive' to 'relaxed/content/calm'. Against expectation, there was no statistical support for an interaction between PRE-switch and POST-switch condition on pigs' behavioural expression POST-switch (D1: F1,11 = 0.03, p = 0.86; D2: F1,11 = 0.57, p = 0.47). We cannot disentangle if the PRE-switch conditions did not affect pigs' behavioural expression POST-switch or if observers did not pick up potential changes, e.g. because the contrasting POST-switch conditions may have masked subtle effects from the PREswitch conditions. However, even though not statistically supported, the direction of effects was according to hypotheses with E*B groups being more uniformly assessed as reflecting a negative affective state (tired/bored) compared to B*B, while B*E groups were more consistently judged as reflecting a positive affective state (active/ engaged/explorative) compared to E*E. To test if this direction of effect is robust, we propose to show video clips of pigs in the same condition POST-switch (either E or B, not both) with different experiences in PRE-switch conditions in future studies. Moreover, future research should provide insight into what changes in housing conditions mean for pigs' affective states in the longer term.

AB  - The oxygen isotope ratio of carbonate in Tridacna shell (delta O-18(shell)) is assumed to be precipitated in isotopic equilibrium with surrounding seawater and thus reflects a combination of the Sea surface temperature (SST) and the delta O-18 of seawater (delta O-18(SW)). Accordingly, Tridacna delta O-18(shell) has been widely used for high-resolution paleoclimate reconstructions. However, the influences of interspecific differences, spatial heterogeneity, as well as the "growth effect" on the delta O-18(shell)-SST relationship, have not been fully tested. Here, we present a monthly resolved delta O-18(shell) record of a Tridacna squamosa specimen from Yagong Island, South China sea (SCS). Our results suggested that the monthly resolved delta O-18(shell) from northern SCS was dominated by the seasonal SST variations, which was highly correlated with measured SST after excluding the influence of delta O-18(SW). Then, the SST = f(delta O-18(shell)-delta O-18(SW)) equations of all published monthly delta O-18(shell) records of modern Tridacna from the Indo-Pacific were collected. The resulting investigation revealed that similar SST = f(delta O-18(shell)-delta O-18(SW)) equations for each shell, indicating the minor influences of spatial heterogeneity and interspecific differences. The average equation for Tridacna (Tridacna gigas, Tridacna derasa, Tridacna squamosa, Tridacna maxima and Hippopus hippopus) was SST = - 3.56 +/- 1.26 (delta O-18(shell)-delta O-18(sw)) + 22.44 +/- 2.77 (- 0.28 +/- 0.08 parts per thousand degrees C-1, VPDB) (2 sigma), which was close to the equations set up for other mollusks (without Tridacna) and inorganic aragonite. Finally, although the growth rates varied greatly among Tridacna specimens and within different growth stages of each specimen, we did not find a significant influence of the growth rates on SST = f(delta O-18-(shell) - delta O-18(SW)) equations, indicating that the "growth effect" might have at best a slight impact on the delta O-18(shell) of Tridacna.

AB  - Effective agricultural management hinges upon timely decision-making. Here, we evaluated whether drone and satellite imagery could improve real-time and remote monitoring of pasture management. Using unmanned aerial systems (UAS), we quantified grassland biomass through changes in sward height pre- and post-grazing by sheep. As optical spectral data from Sentinel-2 satellite imagery is often hindered by cloud contamination, we assessed whether machine learning could help improve the accuracy of pasture biomass prognostics. The calibration of UAS biomass using field measurements from sward height change through 3D photogrammetry resulted in an improved regression (R2 = 0.75, RMSE = 1240 kg DM/ha, and MAE = 980 kg DM/ha) compared with using the same field measurements with random forest-machine learning and Sentinel-2 imagery (R2 = 0.56, RMSE = 2140 kg DM/ha, and MAE = 1585 kg DM/ha). The standard error of the mean (SEM) for the field biomass, derived from UAS-measured sward height changes, was 1240 kg DM/ha. When UAS data were integrated with the Sentinel-2-random forest model, SEM reduced from 1642 kg DM/ha to 1473 kg DM/ha, demonstrating that integration of UAS data improved model accuracy. We show that modelled biomass from 3D photogrammetry has significantly higher accuracy than that predicted from Sentinel-2 imagery with random forest modelling (S2-RF). Our study demonstrates that timely, accurate quantification of pasture biomass is conducive to improved decision-making agility, and that coupling of UAS with satellite imagery may improve the accuracy and timeliness of agricultural biomass prognostics.

AB  - Balancing selection is frequently invoked as a mechanism that maintains variation within and across populations. However, there are few examples of balancing selection operating on loci underpinning complex traits, which frequently display high levels of variation. We investigated mechanisms that may maintain variation in a focal polymorphism-leaf chemical profiles of a perennial wildflower (Boechera stricta, Brassicaceae)-explicitly interrogating multiple ecological and genetic processes including spatial variation in selection, antagonistic pleiotropy and frequency-dependent selection. A suite of common garden and greenhouse experiments showed that the alleles underlying variation in chemical profile have contrasting fitness effects across environments, implicating two ecological drivers of selection on chemical profile: herbivory and drought. Phenotype-environment associations and molecular genetic analyses revealed additional evidence of past selection by these drivers. Together, these data are consistent with balancing selection on chemical profile, probably caused by pleiotropic effects of secondary chemical biosynthesis genes on herbivore defence and drought response.
   Evidence for balancing selection acting on loci that control complex traits is limited. Here, the authors show evidence for past selection on chemical profile in a perennial wildflower by two ecological drivers, herbivory and drought, consistent with balancing selection on this trait.

AB  - Interactions between species are widely understood to have promoted the diversification of life on Earth, but how interactions spur the formation of new species remains unclear. Interacting species often become locally adapted to each other, but they may also be subject to shared dispersal limitations and environmental conditions. Moreover, theory predicts that different kinds of interactions have different effects on diversification. To better understand how species interactions promote diversification, we compiled population genetic studies of host plants and intimately associated herbivores, parasites, and mutualists. We used Bayesian multiple regressions and the BEDASSLE modeling framework to test whether host and associate population structures were correlated over and above the potentially confounding effects of geography and shared environmental variation. We found that associates' population structure often paralleled their hosts' population structure, and that this effect is robust to accounting for geographic distance and climate. Associate genetic structure was significantly explained by plant genetic structure somewhat more often in antagonistic interactions than in mutualistic ones. This aligns with a key prediction of coevolutionary theory that antagonistic interactions promote diversity through local adaptation of antagonists to hosts, while mutualistic interactions more often promote diversity via the effect of hosts' geographic distribution on mutualists' dispersal.

AB  - Vibrio gazogenes PB1 is an estuarine bacterium that was first isolated from saltwater mud. This bacterial species possesses the metabolic capacity to produce prodigiosin which has potential uses as an anticancer agent, antibiotic, and a fungicide. We evaluated the feasibility of employing V. gazogenes PB1 as a bacterial host for the production of prodigiosin. V. gazogenes PB1 could be grown and maintained using the well-known lysogeny broth medium when supplemented with NaCl, and revived after storage at -80 degrees C. Under batch conditions, growth of V. gazogenes PB1 in minimal media and production of prodigiosin was observed over a wide range of NaCl concentrations from 1 to 5% (w/v). The production of prodigiosin was significantly influenced by the concentration of glucose (as the carbon source), ammonium chloride (as the nitrogen source), inorganic phosphate ions, as well as pH. The greatest titer (231 mg/L) was observed in minimal media that contained 1% (w/v) glucose, 100 mM ammonium chloride and 100 mM potassium phosphate buffer. The sequences and chromosomal locations of the pig genes associated with prodigiosin biosynthesis are revealed for the first time. PigA is an isolated gene on chromosome 2, while the remaining pig genes, from pigB to pigN, exist as a 20 kb gene cluster on chromosome 1. Given its excellent growth in a range of NaCl concentrations, wide availability from culture collections and low-risk status for experimental work, we would conclude that V. gazogenes PB1 is a promising bacterial host for the production of prodigiosin.

AB  - Consumers tend to perceive organic foods as more nutritious and safer in comparison to conventional, due to the perception that organic food is eco- and animal-friendly. Since fatty acids and fat-soluble vitamins in dairy produce are important nutrients, this study aims to assess possible differences in the amount of these components included in organic and conventional ewes and goat raw milk in Greece, while identifying the potential determining factors. A total of 48 samples were collected from organic and conventional sheep and goat farms in Greece (Thessaly) during the lactation period. A standardized questionnaire, including information about the farming system, and a sampling protocol were completed. Samples were studied for the fat-soluble vitamins (all-trans-retinol and alpha-tocopherol) and the fatty acids profile, while the outcomes were statistically analyzed to explore any associations with the questionnaire data for potential factors affecting the results. According to the obtained results there are slight differences in milk fatty acid content, which indicates that organic and conventional sheep and goat milk in Greece do not have any substantial differences in terms of feeding strategies. Regarding the content of fat-soluble vitamins, the organic milk is generally found to contain a higher amount than the conventional one.

AB  - Knowledge of where a threatened species occurs in a landscape is crucial for determining its habitat requirements and informing its conservation planning and management. We conducted the first broad-scale survey of the Endangered Alligator Rivers Yellow Chat Epthianura crocea tunneyi across much of its known range on drying coastal floodplains in northern Australia. Presence-absence records from 257 sites surveyed in the late dry season (August-December) of 2018 and 2019 were modelled using occupancy/detectability models. Occupancy was estimated to be 0.10 +/- 0.04 with a high detection probability (0.89 +/- 0.07). Modelling of 13 site-level environmental covariates found that chats were more likely to be detected at sites where the native shrub Sesbania sesban was present, were close to hydrogeological features such as depressions or channels, were long unburnt (5+ years) and/or with topsoil damage caused by feral pigs. Our estimates of chat occupancy, detectability, and the covariates that influence their occupancy, have improved our understanding of the role that fire and feral animals have on chat distribution and habitat selection, and can be used as a baseline for future monitoring. We also provide recommendations on how to design and implement future monitoring of this subspecies.

AB  - Marine mammal populations worldwide greatly benefitted from conservation measures put in place since the 1970s following overexploitation, and many pinniped populations have recovered. However, threats due to bycatch, interspecific interactions or climate change remain, and detailed knowledge on vital rates, population dynamics, and their responses to environmental changes is essential for efficient management and conservation of wild populations. In this study, we quantified pup abundance and survival of individually marked harbour seal (Phoca vitulina Linnaeus, 1758) pups during the preweaning period at Bic Island and Metis sites in the St. Lawrence Estuary from 1998 to 2019. We used mark-recapture models to evaluate competing hypotheses regarding variation in daily preweaning survival rates and capture probability during the pups' first 30 days of life. Pup abundance increased from 76 [95% CI: 59, 101] to 323 [95% CI: 233, 338] in the past two decades at Bic Island and from 66 [95% CI: 47, 91] to 285 [95% CI: 204, 318] at Metis. Preweaning survival was generally higher at Bic (0.73 [95% CI: 0.58, 0.82]) than at Metis (0.68 [95% CI: 0.52, 0.79]). We hypothesize that differences between habitats and human disturbance contribute to lower preweaning survival at Metis, but behavioural studies are needed to understand the impacts of disturbance on mother-pup interactions during the nursing period.

AB  - Plant reproduction is influenced by resource availability, environment and interactions with pollinators, pathogens and herbivores. In the Neotropical region, the leaf-cutting ants are voracious herbivores and soil engineers, potentially affecting plant performance. This study investigated the effects of herbivory and soil changes via nest construction and maintenance linked to Atta opaciceps (Hymenoptera: Formicidae) (Bormeier, 1939) on the reproductive success of two Leguminosae species (Cenostigma pyramidale (Tul.) E. Gagnon & G.P. Lewis and Indigofera suffruticosa Mill. Mill.) widely distributed in the Caatinga dry forest. We selected eight nests from A. opaciceps colonies, with both plant species nearby. For each colony, we selected similar-sized adult plants from foraging trail ends, where ants concentrate foraging efforts and herbivory is pronounced. We also selected plants located 20 m away from the foraging trail ends, representing herbivory-protected scenarios, secured by tanglefoot barriers. Additionally, to assess ant-related soil effects, we selected individuals from different nest-associated soils (i.e., nest mounds and external refuse dumps) and from locations 20 m away from the aforementioned locations. All these individuals were shielded with tanglefoot barriers. Herbivory and soil changes from A. opaciceps did not affect any metric evaluated of C. pyramidale. Yet, for I. suffruticosa, ant herbivory boosted fruit set, and nest-related soil changes, notably from refuse dumps, increased the number of flowers and fruits. Our findings indicate that leaf-cutting ant effects on plant performance are species-specific and may eventually benefit plant reproduction. Given the proliferation of leaf-cutting ants in human-modified landscapes of the Caatinga dry forest, positive interactions with plants might be vital to improving plant recruitment and forest regeneration dynamics.

AB  - Seagrass meadows serve as critical marine habitats, offering numerous benefits to both humans and wildlife. Taiping Island, situated in the South China Sea, has been historically known for its abundant seagrass meadows. However, satellite imagery suggested there was a low density of seagrasses around Taiping Island. On the other hand, many green turtles (Chelonia mydas) were observed from the shore. To investigate this phenomenon, we conducted drone surveys of the shallow reefs and discovered a density of 902 +/- 601 (mean +/- SD) individual turtles per square kilometer during high tides. In addition, we conducted a cage experiment to test the hypothesis that large herbivores are impacting seagrass abundance negatively. The results indicated that the blade lengths of seagrasses in cages were significantly longer than those outside. It is likely that large herbivores such as green sea turtles are the key consumers of seagrass on the shallow reef flats of Taiping Island. Accordingly, further research and management should take into account that the increasing number of sea turtles may deplete the seagrasses and have an impact on the seagrass ecosystems.

AB  - Background In polygynous mammals, signalling may play a decisive role in mating behavior, mediating the intensity of male fights and female mate choice. During the rutting season, male red deer may show a visible dark patch in their ventral fur. Recently, this patch has been suggested to act as a flexible sexual signal, due to its relationships with other variables such as age, body size, antler development, volatile compounds, or the competitive environment. The analysis of fur pigmentation at the ventral patch suggests that this might also visually indicate the male intrinsic predisposition to take part in mating competition. Results To assess the possible role of this trait as a communicative signal related to mate competition, we used red deer behavioral observations during the rut in Donana National Park (Spain) to examine the link between the degree of expression of the dark ventral patch and the rutting activity (assessed from both intra-and-inter-sexual behaviors). Consistent with our predictions, we found in a field study that males with large dark patches showed a higher frequency of rutting behaviors (mainly roaring and flehmen), more interactions with females, and attained larger harem sizes. Conclusions The dark ventral patch was a better predictor of male behavior than antler tines or territory holding, thus standing as a short-term indicator of male willingness to invest in mating competition.

AB  - In the context of climate change, it is necessary to establish forest management by balancing more products, using less area, and minimizing environmental impacts. The use of different industrial bio-based by-products as soil conditioners in the last few decades has gain more interest, because it leads to an extended use time of these products and supports the circular economy. The aim of this study was to determine the effect of fertiliser made from cattle and pig manure biogas fermentation digestate and wood ash from two cogeneration plants, applied in different mixture ratios, to test its suitability for fertilisation of deciduous trees, using the physiological, morphological, and chemical parameters of the leaves as an indicator. We selected two poplar clones: foreign 'OP42' (syn. Hybrid 275) and local 'AUCE' annual shoot stem cuttings as planting materials. A negative control group with acidic forest mineral soil as substrate and four fertilised groups with different applied digestate and wood ash ratio mixtures to forest soil was established (ash:digestate 0:0 (Control), 1:1, 2:1, 3:1, 4:1). Mixture application improved growing conditions because all fertilised group poplars had longer growth periods and photosynthetic rates in August than the control group. Both local and foreign clones showed a good response to fertilisation in terms of leaf parameters. Poplar is a suitable culture to fertilise with bio-waste biogenic products, because of its capacity to absorb nutrients and fast response to fertilisation.

AB  - Nonylphenol (NP), an endocrine disruptor absorbed through food intake, was investigated in this study for its potential dose-response relationship with the manifestation of depression-like behavior in rats. Based on this, the mechanisms of NP-induced depressive behavior, encompassing neurotransmitters, gut barrier function, inflammatory response, gut microbiota composition and metabolites were further explored. At medium and high NP doses, both mRNA and protein levels of zonula occludens protein-1 and claudin-1 were considerably downregulated, concomitant with an elevation in tumor necrosis factor-alpha and interleukin-1 beta expression in a dosedependent effect, resulting in damage to the gut mucosa. Despite a minimal impact on behavior and gut barriers at low NP doses, alterations in gut microbiota composition were observed. During NP exposure, dosedependent changes in the gut microbiota revealed a decline in microbial diversity linked to the synthesis of short-chain fatty acids. NP not only adversely affected the gut microbiota structure but also exacerbated central nervous system damage through the gut-brain axis. The accumulation of NP may cause neurotransmitter disturbances and inflammatory responses in the hippocampus, which also exacerbate depressed behavior in rats. Therefore, NP could exacerbate the inflammatory response in the hippocampus and colon by compromising intestinal barrier integrity, facilitating the proliferation of pathogenic bacteria, impairing butyrate metabolism, and perturbing neurotransmitter homeostasis, thus aggravating the depressive behavior of rats. It is noteworthy that the changes in these indicators were related to the NP exposure dose.

AB  - Wild ungulates play vital roles in maintaining a balanced ecosystem through herbivory and are also an important determinant of carnivores' density. The flare-horned markhor (Capra falconeri) is a threatened wild goat distributed across the mountain ranges of Pakistan, India, Afghanistan, Russia, Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan, and Tajikistan. The remote terrain and fragmented population limit our understanding of the population ecology of markhor, though knowledge of the target species population is vital for making informed management decisions. Therefore, the current study was designed to determine the markhor population across their range in Northern Pakistan and to evaluate the efforts made by the government and non-government organizations for the conservation of markhor. Double-observer surveys were conducted during 2019-2021 in nine major watersheds of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Gilgit-Baltistan covering an area of 4664 km(2). Secondary data were collected for unassessed areas to gain a holistic overview of the markhor population and density in the region. Results revealed a markhor population of 7579, with a density of 0.30 animals per km(2) in Northern Pakistan. Our analysis of the double-observer data through the Bayesian behavioral capture-recapture model estimated a population of 5993 individuals (95% CI) of markhor across nine study sites, with a density of 1.28 animals per km(2). A review of secondary data revealed that a population of about 1586 was present in the un-surveyed area (20,033.33 km(2)), with a density of 0.08 per km(2). A total of 146 groups of markhor were counted, with a mean group size of 23 (3-58) individuals. There were 109 males and 108 young per 100 females in the population. Among 1936 recorded males, Class I males accounted for 27.74%, followed by Class II (26.45%), Class IV (trophy-size) (23.40%), and Class III (22.42%). The overall detection probability was recorded as 0.87 and 0.68 for the first observer and second observer, respectively. Compared with the past reports, the population of markhor in Northern Pakistan appears to be increasing, particularly in protected areas (PAs) such as national parks and community-controlled hunting areas (CCHAs). Conservation programs, notably trophy hunting and PA networks, appear to be vital in sustaining markhor populations in parts of the species range. We recommend expansion in such programs in the markhor range in order to maintain a viable population of this majestic wild goat in the region.

AB  - The Tibetan Plateau (TP) is one of the most challenging areas for human long-term settlement due to its extreme living environment. Understanding the relationship between human activities and environmental changes in this extreme environment is important and can provide a historical reference for adapting to future climate change. In this study, we took the Angren Basin in the southern TP as a case study to elucidate the relationship since Little Ice Age (LIA). Using fecal stanol in feces, lake and river surface sediments, surface soils, and sediment core, we found that specific indices S1 and S2 from the composition of coprostanol, epicoprostanol, 58-ethylcoprostanol and 58-ethylepicoprostanol can reflect changes in human population and herbivores, respectively. Through the comparison between environmental changes determined by grain size, elements, sedimentation rate, and other climate records, the relationship between human activities and environmental changes was interpreted. Our results indicate that: (i) during 1480 -1820 CE, the fecal stanols in lake sediments mainly originated from livestock, and the human population was low. In contrast, during 1820 -2021 CE, the proportion and flux of S1 have been continuously increasing, indicating significant population growth. (ii) During the middle LIA, the cold -dry climate inhibited the development of agriculture and farming. However, the increased precipitation during the late LIA promoted that development, resulting in an increase in human population and livestock in a short term. (iii) Since 1951, people have reclaimed wasteland and developed husbandry, leading to increased soil erosion. (iv) Over the past 40 years, with a warm -humid climate and good policy support, human activities, such as agriculture and husbandry, have rapidly increased, but soil erosion has declined in the recent 20 years due to good soil -water conservation efforts. This study sheds light on the relationship between human activities and environmental changes and provides insights into future climate change responses.

AB  - Large carnivore populations are recovering across Europe, likely influencing human-wildlife interactions in the areas where both human and carnivore activity overlap, like wildland-urban interface (WUI). We analyzed over 3500 cases of damage caused by brown bears, wolves, and lynx in the Polish Carpathians (2010-2017) to identify spatial and temporal hot spots and their determinants. Wolf damage was associated with sheep density and historical WUI, while bear damage correlated with permanent bear occurrence and historical WUI. Contemporary WUI showed a negative relationship with damage occurrences. Incident-level analysis revealed that forest cover was a key factor for both species, while wolf damage was linked to sheep density and bear damage to proximity to buildings (reflecting beehive locations). Our findings emphasize the need to integrate current landscape characteristics with land use legacies to develop proactive, site-specific policies that mitigate carnivore impacts and promote resilient coexistence.

AB  - Stover and manure are the main solid waste in agricultural industry. The generation of stover and manure could lead to serious environmental pollution if not handled properly. Composting is the potential greener solution to remediate and reduce agricultural solid waste, through which stover and manure could be remediated and converted into organic fertilizer, but the long composting period and low efficiency of humic substance production are the key constraints in such remediation approach. In this study, we explore the effect of lignocellulose selective removal on composting by performing chemical pretreatment on agricultural waste followed by utilization of biochar to assist in the remediation by co-composting treatment and reveal the impacts of different lignocellulose component on organic fertilizer production. Aiming to discover the key factors that influence humification during composting process and improve the composting quality as well as comprehensive utilization of agricultural solid waste. The results demonstrated that the removal of selective lignin or hemicellulose led to the shift of abundances lignocellulose-degrading bacteria, which in turn accelerated the degradation of lignocellulose by almost 51.2%. The process also facilitated the remediation of organic waste via humification and increased the humic acid level and HA/FA ratio in just 22 days. The richness of media relies on their lignocellulose content, which is negatively correlated with total nitrogen content, humic acid (HA) content, germination index (GI), and pH, but positively correlated with fulvic acid (FA) and total organic carbon (TOC). The work provides a potential cost effective and efficient framework for agricultural solid waste remediation and reduction.

AB  - Direct and indirect interactions among predators affect predator fitness, distribution, and overall community structure. Yet, outside of experimental settings, such interactions are difficult to observe and thus poorly understood. Patterns of niche overlap among predators reflect and shape community interactions and may therefore help elucidate the nature and intensity of intraguild interactions. To better understand the coexistence of two apex predators, snow leopards (Panthera uncia) and wolves (Canis lupus), we investigated their spatial, temporal, and dietary niche overlap in summer in the Pamir Mountains of Tajikistan. We estimated population-level space use via spatial capture-recapture models based on noninvasive genetics and camera traps, diel activity patterns based on camera trap detections, and diet composition from prey remains in carnivore scats, from which we estimated coefficients between 0 and 1 for overlap in space, time, and diet, respectively. Snow leopards and wolves displayed moderate spatial partitioning (0.26, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.17-37), but overlapping temporal (0.77, 95% CI: 0.64-0.90) and dietary (0.97, 95% CI: 0.80-0.99) niches. Both predators relied on seasonally abundant marmots (Marmota caudata) rather than wild ungulates, their typical primary prey, suggesting that despite patterns of overlap that were superficially conducive to exploitation competition and predator facilitation, prey were likely not a limiting factor. Therefore, prey-mediated interactions, if present, were unlikely to be a major structuring force in the ecosystem. By implication, carnivore conservation planning and monitoring in the mountains of Central Asia should more fully account for the seasonal importance of marmots in the ecosystem.

AB  - The biodiversity of our planet is under threat, with approximately one million species expected to become extinct within decades. The reason: negative human actions, which include hunting, overfishing, pollution, and the conversion of land for urbanisation and agricultural purposes. Despite significant investment from charities and governments for activities that benefit nature, global wildlife populations continue to decline. Local wildlife guardians have historically played a critical role in global conservation efforts and have shown their ability to achieve sustainability at various levels. In 2021, COP26 recognised their contributions and pledged USD 1.7 billion per year; however this is a fraction of the global biodiversity budget available (between USD 124 billion and USD 143 billion annually) given they protect 80% of the planets biodiversity. This paper proposes a radical new solution based on "Interspecies Money", where animals own their own money. Creating a digital twin for each species allows animals to dispense funds to their guardians for the services they provide. For example, a rhinoceros may release a payment to its guardian each time it is detected in a camera trap as long as it remains alive and well. To test the efficacy of this approach, 27 camera traps were deployed over a 400 km2 area in Welgevonden Game Reserve in Limpopo Province in South Africa. The motion-triggered camera traps were operational for ten months and, using deep learning, we managed to capture images of 12 distinct animal species. For each species, a makeshift bank account was set up and credited with GBP 100. Each time an animal was captured in a camera and successfully classified, 1 penny (an arbitrary amount-mechanisms still need to be developed to determine the real value of species) was transferred from the animal account to its associated guardian. The trial demonstrated that it is possible to achieve high animal detection accuracy across the 12 species with a sensitivity of 96.38%, specificity of 99.62%, precision of 87.14%, F1 score of 90.33%, and an accuracy of 99.31%. The successful detections facilitated the transfer of GBP 185.20 between animals and their associated guardians.

Though herbivory is commonly recorded, only rarely has it been examined with fungal damage and through the lens of functional plant traits. Here, we introduce, date, and use a new well-preserved fossil flora to understand relationships between fungal damage, insect feeding, and leaf traits during a hothouse interval.MethodsWe constrained the age of Dolus Hill using uranium-lead radioisotopic dating of zircons from tuffaceous sandstone. We identified 611 eudicot leaf fossils, quantified insect feeding and fungal damage, and measured leaf traits on appropriate fossils. Generalized linear models, beta regressions, and Fisher's exact test were applied to elucidate relationships between damage and leaf traits.ResultsDolus Hill was dated to 52.22 +/- 0.21 (95% confidence) million years ago and has 18 eudicot morphospecies. Insect damage occurred on 82% of leaves, and 27% had fungal damage. Leaf mass per area had no relationship with any damage metric; leaf vein density had a positive relationship with the number of damage types on a leaf. Percentage area damaged and fungal damage were not affected by these leaf traits. Fungal and insect feeding damage significantly co-occurred.ConclusionsThe leaf fossils at the Dolus Hill from the Early Eocene Climatic Optimum provide new insight into plant-fungus interactions and the utility of certain plant trait metrics in the fossil record. These insights will enhance our understanding of plant-fungus-insect interactions within the regime of current rapid climate change.

AB  - Human-elephant coexistence remains a major conservation and livelihood challenge across elephant Loxodonta africana range in Africa. This study investigates the extent of elephant crop damage on 66 farms in the Selous-Niassa corridor (Tanzania), to search for potential management solutions to this problem. We found that the relative abundance of highly preferred crops (area covered by preferred crops divided by the total area of each farm) was by far the most important factor determining crop damage by elephants. Eighteen crop types were ranked according to their preference by elephants. Sweet potatoes, bananas, peanuts, onions, pumpkins and maize were the most preferred crops, with maize the most common crop among those highly preferred. On average elephants damaged 25.7% of the cultivated farmland they entered. A beta regression model suggests that a reduction in the cultivation of preferred crops from 75 to 25% of the farmland area decreases elephant crop damage by 64%. Water availability (distance to the nearest waterhole) and the presence of private investors (mostly hunting tourism companies) were of lower importance in determining elephant crop damage. Thus, damage by elephants increased with shorter distances to waterholes and decreased in areas with private investors. However, further studies are required, particularly of the perceived costs and benefits of elephants to local communities. Farm aggregation and the use of non-preferred crops that also require less water would potentially reduce elephant damage but would be a major lifestyle change for some local communities.

AB  - Predators impact prey directly, through consumption, and indirectly, through non-consumptive effects that modify prey physiology and behavior in ways that affect survival and reproduction. Non-consumptive effects (NCEs) are well documented across prey taxa in response to different predator cues. However, for most prey species, both the mechanisms underlying NCEs and the impacts of NCEs on broader ecological processes are poorly understood. We addressed these knowledge gaps for an aphid prey species (Myzus persicae) by studying dispersal, in-leaf feeding behavior, and plant virus transmission in response to chemical cues deposited by a walking predator (Hippodamia convergens), a non-predator, non-competitor (Drosophila melanogaster), and an artificial feeding deterrent (2% mineral oil). We used this approach to better understand the specificity of M. persicae responses to chemical footprints of threatening and non-threatening organisms, as well as the magnitude of behavioral responses relative to a known deterrent. We found that chemical footprints deposited by H. convergens stimulated M. persicae to disperse from a suitable host (Brassica napus) at a rate equivalent to the 2% mineral oil positive control, while footprints of D. melanogaster did not modify M. persicae dispersal. Through electrical penetration graphing (EPG) recordings, we found that mineral oil stimulated aphids to make more probes, but footprint treatments did not significantly modify feeding behavior. In mesocosm-based virus transmission assays, H. convergens footprints and 2% mineral oil also stimulated increased dispersal, but this did not translate into increased transmission of turnip mosaic virus. We identified components of H. convergens and D. melanogaster footprints using gas chromatography and mass spectrometry and found that H. convergens footprints are chemically similar to footprints of related Coccinellidae, but distinct from D. melanogaster footprints. Our results provide evidence of specificity in M. persicae responses to predator footprints, which may help this prey species avoid costly dispersal behavior in response to cues from non-predators. We also provide ecological context by demonstrating that increased dispersal in response to predator cues does not always lead to increased virus transmission, as previously assumed, particularly when in-leaf feeding behaviors underlying virus acquisition do not change in response to predator cues.

AB  - Organisms at the base of stream food webs are typically poor in long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (LC-PUFA), especially in docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), whereas consumers at higher trophic levels are often rich in LC-PUFA. For example, fish tissues, especially the brain, are DHA-rich. This obvious mismatch between consumer LC-PUFA and their basal dietary supply may result from selective retention and/or endogenous conversion of dietary precursors to LC-PUFA. To determine which is more likely, we investigated compound-specific carbon stable isotopes in PUFA (delta C-13(PUFA)) of potential basal resources (stream epilithon, leaf litter) and consumers (invertebrates, European bullhead, and two salmonid species and their brain, eye, liver, and muscle tissues). We predicted that consumer-PUFA, depleted in C-13 values relative to their dietary sources, would indicate internal de novo PUFA synthesis. Alternatively, higher consumer-delta C-13(PUFA) values would imply selective retention of aquatic (epilithon and conditioned leaves) rather than terrestrial resources or internal production, irrespective of trophic levels. Invertebrate grazers and predators resembled delta C-13 values of essential fatty acids (delta C-13(EFA)) of benthic algae, while shredder-delta C-13(EFA) values reflected those of conditioned rather than fresh leaves. Lower eye-delta C-13(EFA) values of salmonids than in livers indicated high retention of dietary PUFA sources (invertebrates and epilithon). Stable isotope values of eicosapentaenoic acid suggest that all consumers retained algal EPA, while insectivorous fish produced DHA in their liver. There is no further evidence from carbon stable isotopes for local PUFA conversion within neural tissues. Our study demonstrates that delta C-13(PUFA) can be used to track sources of these highly functional molecules in aquatic consumers and highlights the importance of algal derived-PUFA for these consumers in oligotrophic headwater streams.

AB  - The benchmarking of farm environmental sustainability and the monitoring of progress towards more sustainable farming systems is made difficult by the need to aggregate multiple indicators at the relevant spatial scales. We present a novel framework for identifying alternative pathways to improve environmental sustainability in farming systems that addresses this challenge by analysing the co-variance of indicators within a landscape context. A set of sustainability indicators was analysed within the framework of a published set of Farm Management Archetypes (FMAs) that maps the distribution of farming systems in England based on combinations of environmental and management variables. The archetype approach acknowledges that sustainability indicators do not vary independently and that there are regional constraints to potential trajectories of change. Using Pareto Optimisation, we identified optimal combinations of sustainability indicators ("Pareto nodes") for each FMA independently, and across all FMAs. The relative sustainability of the archetypes with respect to one another was compared based on the proportion of Pareto nodes in each FMA. Potential for improvement in sustainability was derived from distances to the nearest Pareto node (either within or across FMAs), incorporating the cost of transitioning to another archetype based on the similarity of its environmental variables. The indicators with the greatest potential to improve sustainability within archetypes (and, therefore, should have a greater emphasis in guiding management decisions) varied between FMAs. Relatively unsustainable FMAs were identified that also had limited potential to increase within archetype sustainability, indicating regions where more fundamental system changes may be required. The FMA representing the most intensive system of arable production, although relatively unsustainable when compared to all other archetypes, had the greatest internal potential for improvement without transitioning to a different farming system. In contrast, the intensive horticulture FMA had limited internal potential to improve sustainability. The FMAs with the greatest potential for system change as a viable pathway to improved sustainability were dairy, beef and sheep, and rough grazing, moving towards more mixed systems incorporating arable. Geographically, these transitions were concentrated in the west of England, introducing diversity into otherwise homogenous landscapes. Our method allows for an assessment of the potential to improve sustainability across spatial scales, is flexible relative to the choice of sustainability indicators, and-being data-driven-avoids the subjectivity of indicator weightings. The results allow decision makers to explore the opportunity space for beneficial change in a target landscape based on the indicators with most potential to improve sustainability.

AB  - Treated wastewater from livestock farms is an important reservoir for antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs), and is a main source of ARGs in the environment. However, the distribution and driving factors of ARGs in treated wastewater from different types of livestock farms are rarely reported. In this study, treated wastewater from 69 large-scale livestock farms of different types, including broiler, layer, and pig farms, was collected, and 11 subtypes of ARGs, 2 mobile genetic elements (MGEs) and bacterial community structure were analyzed. The results revealed detection rates of NDM-1 and mcr-1 of 90% and 43%, respectively, and the detection rates of other ARGs were 100%. The relative abundance of ARGs, such as tetA, tetX and strB, in broiler farms was significantly higher than that in layer farms, but the bacterial a diversity was significantly lower than that in other farm types. Furthermore, although the treatment process had a greater impact on the physicochemical properties of the treated wastewater than the livestock type, livestock type was the main factor affecting the bacterial community in the treated wastewater. The analysis of potential host bacteria of ARGs revealed significant differences in the host bacteria of ARGs in treated wastewater from different types of livestock farms. The host bacteria of ARGs in broiler farms mainly belonged to Actinobacteria, layer farms mainly belonged to Proteobacteria, and pig farms mainly belonged to Firmicutes. Additionally, redundancy analysis showed that the distribution of ARGs may have resulted from the combination of multiple driving factors in different types of livestock farms, among which tnpA and NH4+-N were themain influencing factors. This study revealedmultiple driving factors for the distribution of typical ARGs in treated wastewater from different types of livestock farms, providing basic data for the prevention and control of ARG pollution in agricultural environments.

AB  - Blood serum biochemical parameters of 32 Lacaune sheep divided into two groups by productivity (high- and low-producing) were studied. The surveys were conducted in three different seasons (summer, autumn and winter). An increase (p < 0.001) in blood serum urea was found during the summer compared to winter in both study groups. The total cholesterol in both study groups increased (p < 0.05) in the autumn compared to the summer. During the autumn, triglycerides increased (p < 0.01-p < 0.001) in low- and high-producing Lacaune sheep. A decrease (p < 0.001) in the level of AST was found in summer and autumn compared to winter in both studied groups of sheep. GGT levels decreased (p < 0.01) during the summer season in low -yielding sheep compared to the winter. In high-producing Lacaune sheep, the blood serum ALP decreased (p < 0.01) during the summer compared to the other two seasons. The total protein in the blood serum was not affected by the season in both groups of sheep. The studied blood serum biochemical parameters in Lacaune sheep were an objective factor for their welfare.

AB  - Background Several migratory ungulates, including caribou, are dramatically declining. Caribou of the Barren-ground ecotype, which forms its own subspecies, are known to be mainly migratory. By contrast, within the Woodland subspecies, animals of the Boreal ecotype are known to be mainly sedentary, while those within the Northern and Central Mountain ecotypes to be partially migratory, with only some individuals migrating. Promotion of conservation actions (e.g., habitat protection) that are specific to both residents and migrants, as well as to the areas they frequent seasonally (which may be separate for migrants), requires distinguishing migration from other movement behaviours, which might be a challenge. Methods We aimed at assessing seasonal movement behaviours, including migratory, resident, dispersing, and nomadic, for caribou belonging to the Barren-ground and Woodland subspecies and ecotypes. We examined seasonal displacement, both planar and altitudinal, and seasonal ranges overlap for 366 individuals that were GPS-collared in Northern and Western Canada. Lastly, we assessed the ability of caribou individuals to switch between migratory and non-migratory movement behaviours between years. Results We detected migratory behaviour within each of the studied subspecies and ecotypes. However, seasonal ranges overlap (an index of sedentary behaviour) varied, with proportions of clear migrants (0 overlap) of 40.94% for Barren-ground caribou and 23.34% for Woodland caribou, and of 32.95%, 54.87%, and 8.86% for its Northern Mountain, Central Mountain, and Boreal ecotype, respectively. Plastic switches of individuals were also detected between migratory, resident, dispersing, and nomadic seasonal movements performed across years. Conclusions Our unexpected findings of marked seasonal movement plasticity in caribou indicate that this phenomenon should be better studied to understand the resilience of this endangered species to habitat and climatic changes. Our results that a substantial proportion of individuals engaged in seasonal migration in all studied ecotypes indicate that caribou conservation plans should account for critical habitat in both summer and winter ranges. Accordingly, conservation strategies are being devised for the Woodland subspecies and its ecotypes, which were found to be at least partially migratory in this study. Our findings that migration is detectable with both planar and altitudinal analyses of seasonal displacement provide a tool to better define seasonal ranges, also in mountainous and hilly environments, and protect habitat there.

AB  - Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) class I molecules facilitate antiviral immunity through their polymorphic peptide-binding diversity. Tibetan wild boars, adapted to extreme plateau conditions, exhibit enhanced disease resistance. Here, we present the first three-dimensional structure of the Tibetan wild boar SLA-1*Z0301 in complex with the GP3-ALL9 peptide derived from porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV). Using X-ray crystallography and AlphaFold3 modeling, we characterized the peptide-binding motif of SLA-1*Z0301, which shares conserved binding pockets with SLA-1*08 alleles found in various domestic pigs, indicating convergent peptide presentation across wild and domestic swine lineages. Thermal stability assays revealed that the primary anchors of SLA-1*Z0301-P2 (B pocket, Tm = 42.5 degrees C) and P9 (F pocket, Tm = 47.6 degrees C)-exhibited greater stability compared to mutants in the Heishan pig SLA-3*hs0202 (P3-A = 40.0 degrees C, P9A = 38.3 degrees C), suggesting structural adaptations to high-altitude conditions. A genome-wide screening identified 125 nonapeptides from PRRSV-1 and PRRSV-2 that conform to the SLA-1*Z0301 motif, spanning structural (GP2-GP5) and nonstructural proteins. Notably, five epitopes overlapped with immunodominant responses observed in Large White and Yorkshire x Landrace, highlighting conserved antigen presentation across wild and domestic swine lineages. These results provide valuable insights into the development of cross-species antiviral strategies and vaccine design.

AB  - Intensive agriculture often comes at the expense of soil health. A shift towards practices that foster soil health will support yield and defences against pests and diseases. Growing crops in monoculture is the standard in modern agriculture, though strip-cropping, in which different crops are planted in strips, is a promising strategy in the transition towards sustainable agriculture. Increasing crop diversity is hypothesized to positively influence arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF), thereby enhancing soil health, but the mechanisms by which AMF-plant symbioses contribute to higher yields and reduced pest populations in strip-cropping systems remain unclear. We used a green-house experiment with potato plants to explore the soil legacy effects of mono-cropping versus strip-cropping systems, AMF inoculation and aphid infestation on AMF root colonization, the induction of plant defences (untargeted LCMS-based metabolomics), aphid population size and potato yield. We found that potato plants grown in strip-cropping soil had higher AMF colonization than plants grown in mono-cropping soil. Potato plants grown in strip-cropping soil also had higher shoot nitrogen content, increased solamargine levels, and reduced aphid populations. AMF root colonization was only enhanced by the addition of commercial AMF in mono-cropping soils. Potato plant metabolites were affected by strip-cropping soil, including jasmonic acid (JA) derivatives. Structural equation models revealed that strip-cropping soil directly reduced aphid populations and also had a negative direct effect on the JA precursor OPC-8, and hydroxyJA-glucosides, indicating complex effects of strip-cropping soils on JA-inducible plant defences. Indirect benefits of strip-cropping soil and AMF inoculation on tuber yield were mediated by their direct positive effects on plant nitrogen content. Our results emphasize the potential of strip-cropping to enhance AMF root colonization in the field. We show that soil legacy effects of strip-cropping alter the plant metabolome in ways that suppress of aphid populations. Strip-cropping legacy effects are the result of crop diversity, crop neighbour and edge effects resulting from crop management practices. While the mechanisms by which soil from strip-cropping supresses pest populations still need to be identified, our study underscores the potential for strip-cropping to enhance pest control and yield via soil mediated processes.

AB  - Health effects of dairy fats (DF) are difficult to evaluate, as DF intakes are hard to assess epidemiologically and DF have heterogeneous compositions that influence biological responses. We set out to find biomarkers of DF intake and assess biological response to a summer DF diet (R2), a winter DF diet (R3), and a R3 supplemented with calcium (R4) compared to a plant-fat-based diet (R1) in a randomized clinical trial (n = 173) and a 2-year study in mildly metabolically disturbed downsized pigs (n = 32). Conventional clinical measures were completed by LC/MS plasma metabolomics/lipidomics. The measured effects were modeled as biological functions to facilitate interpretation.DF intakes in pigs specifically induced a U-shaped metabolic trajectory, reprogramming metabolism to close to its initial status after a one-year turnaround. Twelve lipid species repeatably predicted DF intakes in both pigs and humans (6.6% errors). More broadly, in pigs, quality of DF modulated the time-related biological response (R2: 30 regulated functions, primarily at 6 months; R3: 26 regulated functions, mostly at 6-12 months; R4: 43 regulated functions, mostly at 18 months). Despite this heterogeneity, 9 functions overlapped under all 3 DF diets in both studies, related to a restricted area of amino acids metabolism, cofactors, nucleotides and xenobiotic pathways and the microbiota. In conclusion, over the long-term, DF reprograms metabolism to close to its initial biological status in metabolically-disrupted pigs. Quality of the DF modulates its metabolic influence, although some effects were common to all DF. A resilient signature of DF consumption found in pigs was validated in humans.(c) 2022 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - The Yellow River Source National Park (YRSP) is one of the most sensitive and fragile ecological regions in the world. The historical intensive grazing and climate change have resulted in ecological degradation that threatens the wildlife and livestock. Exploring the sustainable strategy is urgent for policy makers to meet the demands for wild ungulates and livestock. In our study, the grassland ecological carrying capability (GECC) was assessed based on the updated grass-livestock balance that considered the grass competition from wild ungulates. The balances between grass and livestock, and GECC and grassland pressure index (GPI) in the YRSP were measured through overlay analysis and geostatistic analysis. The results showed that: (1) the ratio of livestock to wild ungulates in the research area was approximately 4.56: 1, in which the proportion of livestock was 81.75% and the actual number of livestock was 33.84 x 10(4) standard sheep units; (2) Under the scenario of minimum grazing utilisation rate, the theoretical grazing capacity and GECC were 37.83 x 10(4) standard sheep units and -0.13, respectively. Under the maximum grazing utilisation rate, the theoretical grazing capacity and GECC were 41.93 x 10(4) standard sheep units and -0.21, respectively. Since GECC in both scenarios were both less than 0, the grassland was considered to be in surplus and the livestock was not overloaded. However, GPI in the two scenarios were 0.87 and 0.79, respectively, both of which exceeded the warning line of 0.70. Based on GECC, we recommend that the sustainable strategy in YRSP is either to increase the supplementary feeding about 6.40 x 10(4) standard sheep units or reduce the grazing livestock by about 3.50 x 10(4) standard sheep units.

AB  - Conventional tillage after wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) results in poor winter soil coverage, negatively affecting long-term soil health. Cover crops and no-tillage provide soil coverage, reducing soil erosion, and nitrate (NO3-N) leaching potential. The objective of this study was to evaluate maize (Zea mays L.) grain yield response and grain quality due to cover crops preceding maize. The experiment was organized as a randomized complete block design (RCBD) with a split-plot arrangement. The experiments were conducted under transitional no -till at Prosper and Hickson, North Dakota, from 2017 to 2019. Forage pea (Pisum sativum L.), faba bean (Vicia faba Roth), and winter camelina (Camelina sativa [L.] Crantz) were established into spring wheat stubble in August of 2017 and 2018. A check treatment with no cover crop was included. Cover crop fall biomass production and nitrogen (N) accumulation in plant tissue averaged across locations were 1.59 Mg ha-1 and 67.7 kg ha-1, respectively. Winter camelina survived the winters and accumulated biomass in the spring, resulting in significantly higher biomass (3.3 Mg ha-1) than the previous fall biomass. Winter camelina decreased spring water content in Prosper and Hickson in 2018, affecting maize seedling growth because of early competition. Soil NO3-N was not different among treatments. Maize was planted into the residue of fall -planted cover crops. Nitrogen rates of 0, 40, 80, and 160 kg N ha-1 were applied immediately after planting as urea. Maize grain yield increased with higher N rates and was significantly higher when grown in plots that had faba bean (9.7 Mg ha-1), forage pea (10.1 Mg ha-1), and the no-cover crop check (9.8 Mg ha-1), than those that had winter camelina (8.6 Mg ha-1). Leguminous cover crops resulted in a slight increase in maize grain yield compared with plots without cover crops. However, this increase did not reach statistical significance. To understand this response and the potential benefits of cover crops in maize cultivation, further research is needed, with varying seasonal weather conditions.

AB  - When introduced to new ecosystems, species' populations often grow immediately postrelease. Some introduced species, however, maintain a low population size for years or decades before sudden, rapid population growth is observed. Because exponential population growth always starts slowly, it can be difficult to distinguish species experiencing the early phases of slow exponential population growth (inherent lags) from those with actively delayed growth rates (prolonged lags). Introduced ungulates provide an excellent system in which to examine lags, because some introduced ungulate populations have demonstrated rapid population growth immediately postintroduction, while others have not. Using studies from the literature, we investigated which exotic ungulate species and populations (n = 36) showed prolonged population growth lags by comparing the doubling time of real ungulate populations to those predicted from exponential growth models for theoretical populations. Having identified the specific populations that displayed prolonged lags, we examined the impacts of several environmental and biological variables likely to influence the length of lag period. We found that seventeen populations (47%) showed significant prolonged population growth lags. We could not, however, determine the specific factors that contributed to the length of these lag phases, suggesting that these ungulate populations' growth is idiosyncratic and difficult to predict. Introduced species that exhibit delayed growth should be closely monitored by managers, who must be proactive in controlling their growth to minimize the impact such populations may have on their environment.

AB  - This study investigated the measurements of energy density and bioenergetic modelling for a pelagic ray, Mobula eregoodoo, to estimate its relative allocation to various bodily processes and especially reproduction. The data revealed M. eregoodoo uses up to 21.0% and 2.5% of its annual energy budget on growth and reproduction, respectively. During pregnancy, females depleted energy reserves in the liver, which, along with their biennial reproductive cycle, aligns with general theory that ectotherms are capital breeders and thus build energy reserves before reproduction. Nonetheless, the reduction in energy reserves did not account for all reproductive costs, and therefore, gravid females supplement reproductive costs through energy derived from the diet, according to an income-breeding strategy. These characteristics imply that M. eregoodoo exhibits some flexibility in fuelling reproduction depending on energy availability throughout the reproductive cycle, which may be prevalent in other elasmobranchs. The data represent the first estimates of both the metabolic costs of gestation in elasmobranchs and the relative cost of reproduction in rays. Energy costs and plasticity associated with highly variable reproductive strategies in elasmobranchs may influence long-term population viability under a rapidly changing environment.

AB  - Batoids comprise five of the seven most threatened families of sharks and rays. The East Asian endemic Naru eagle ray Aetobatus narutobiei is a large bodied ray whose estuarine habitat overlaps with an economically valuable bivalve fishery. In response to decreased bivalve yields, the government initiated a predator control program and as a result, Naru eagle rays have faced intense and targeted fishing pressure during the last two decades. The long-term impacts of the predator control program on the population of rays and bivalves and their balance in the ecosystem are unknown because the life history of the Naru eagle ray has not been characterized. To begin to fill these critical knowledge gaps, the reproductive life history of the Naru eagle was described. Females mature at a larger size than males and require nearly twice as many years to reach maturity (DW50, 952.0 mm vs. 764.2 mm; Age50, 6.0 years vs. 3.5 years). Both males and females reproduce annually and their reproductive cycles are synchronized and seasonal. Females have a single ovary and paired uteri, are viviparous, and reproduce via matrotrophic histotrophy. Mating occurs in August and September and gestation lasts approximately 12 months including a 9.5-month diapause that begins soon after mating and ends in June of the following year, leaving 2.5 months for embryos to complete development. Fecundity ranged from 1 to 7 embryos per brood (n = 158, mean +/- SD = 3.36 +/- 1.26) and was positively correlated with female disc width (linear regression; F = 105.73, d.f. = 151, P < 0.05). Naru eagle rays are vulnerable to overfishing because of their low fecundity, long reproductive cycle and long time to reach sexual maturity. Obligate embryonic diapause during overwintering and seasonal migrations is a survival strategy that benefits the adults and neonates. This research is a valuable resource to help guide science-based management, conservation and protection of the endemic Asian A. narutobiei and its nursery areas.

AB  - Plants have evolved a vast array of secondary metabolites that help defend them against natural enemy attack. The production of these secondary metabolites is influenced by environmental factors, such as temperature, rainfall (soil water availability) and atmospheric [CO2], which may be altered under climate change. This study aimed to test how two of these environmental factors, namely soil water availability and [CO2], will affect secondary metabolite and biomass production in Eucalypts. To investigate this, we measured secondary metabolite and biomass production of three Eucalypt species (Eucalyptus grandis, E. moluccana, E. saligna) grown under ambient and elevated [CO2] (400 and 600 ppm, respectively) and water-stressed and well-watered conditions, in a fully factorial glasshouse experiment. The secondary metabolites measured were foliar phenolic concentration as well as terpene and green leaf volatile emissions. We found that water stress did not alter secondary metabolite production. Unsurprisingly, the water-stressed plants maximised their water uptake potential by reducing shoot biomass but maintaining root biomass. The detrimental effects of water stress on shoot biomass production were not reduced under elevated [CO2] compared to ambient [CO2], despite all species experiencing significant reductions in stomatal conductance. Further, [CO2] as a single factor did not have a significant effect on species' net carbon gain, with an increase in green leaf volatile emissions under elevated [CO2] being mitigated by a reduction in shoot biomass production. These results suggest that reductions in carbon gains due to water stress will affect the growth of Eucalypts rather than their chemical defence capabilities.

AB  - In the context of ongoing threats to forest ecosystems, this study investigates the temporal and spatial dynamics of Lymantria dispar defoliation intensity over a period of three years. We analysed the relationship between the insects' reproductive and feeding behaviours and forest stand characteristics, exploring the key factors that shape this behaviour. The results revealed a dynamic pattern, with a significant escalation of defoliation starting from the second year and peaking in the third. The analysis highlighted that, among several forest stand characteristics, woody species abundance and specific forest composition significantly influence population density and defoliation intensity. Sporadic outbreaks of the insects were associated with stand features, posing major challenges to forest health. These findings make a significant contribution to understanding the population dynamics of L. dispar and provide essential insights for forest managers in efficiently managing this defoliator. By highlighting the complex interactions between the insect and its environment, this study lays the groundwork for conservation and protection strategies for forest ecosystems.

AB  - Marine megafauna plays an important functional role in marine ecosystems as top predators but are threatened by a wide range of anthropogenic activities. Bycatch, the incidental capture of non-targeted species in commercial and recreational fisheries, is of particular concern for small cetacean species, such as dolphins and porpoises. In the North-East Atlantic, common dolphin (Delphinus delphis, Linne 1758) bycatch has been increasing and associated with large numbers of animals stranding during winter on the French Atlantic seashore since at least 2017. However, uncertainties around the true magnitude of common dolphin bycatch and the fisheries involved have led to delays in the implementation of mitigation measures. Current data collection on dolphin bycatch in France is with non-dedicated observers deployed on vessels for the purpose of national fisheries sampling programmes. These data cannot be assumed representative of the whole fisheries' bycatch events. This feature makes it difficult to use classic ratio estimators since they require a truly randomised sample of the fishery by dedicated observers. We applied a newly developed approach, regularised multilevel regression with post-stratification, to estimate total bycatch from unrepresentative samples and total fishing effort. The latter is needed for post-stratification and the former is analysed in a Bayesian framework with multilevel regression to regularise and better predict bycatch risk. We estimated the number of bycaught dolphins for each week and 10 International Council for the Exploration of the Sea (ICES) divisions from 2004 to 2020 by estimating jointly bycatch risk, haul duration, and the number of hauls per days at sea (DaS). Bycatch risk in pair trawlers flying the French flag was the highest in winter 2017 and 2019 and was associated with the longest haul durations. ICES divisions 8.a and 8.b (shelf part of the Bay of Biscay) were estimated to have the highest common dolphin bycatch. Our results were consistent with independent estimates of common dolphin bycatch from strandings. Our method show cases how non-representative observer data can nevertheless be analysed to estimate fishing duration, bycatch risk and, ultimately, the number of bycaught dolphins. These weekly-estimates improve upon current knowledge of the nature of common dolphin bycatch and can be used to inform management and policy decisions at a finer spatio-temporal scale than has been possible to date. Our results suggest that limiting haul duration, especially in winter, could serve as an effective mitigation strategy.

AB  - Predicting future evolutionary change is a critical challenge in the Anthropocene as geographic range shifts and local extinction emerge as hallmarks of planetary change. Hence, spatial sorting-a driver of rapid evolution in which dispersal-associated traits accumulate along expanding range edges and within recolonized habitats-might be of growing importance in ecology and conservation. We report on the results of a natural experiment that monitored recolonization of host plants by the seed-feeding, red-shouldered soapberry bug, Jadera haematoloma, after local extinctions from catastrophic flooding in an extreme hurricane. We tested the contribution of spatial sorting to generate rapid and persistent evolution in dispersal traits, as well as in feeding traits unrelated to dispersal. Long-winged dispersal forms accumulated in recolonized habitats and due to genetic correlation, mouthparts also became longer and this shift persisted across generations. Those longer mouthparts were probably adaptive on one host plant species but maladaptive on two others based on matching the optimum depth of seeds within their host fruits. Moreover, spatial sorting eroded recently evolved adaptive divergence in mouthpart length among all host-associated biotypes, an outcome pointing to profound practical consequences of the extreme weather event for local adaptation, population resilience and evolutionary futures.
   Catastrophic flooding caused by an extreme hurricane offered a rare natural experiment monitoring recolonization of host plants by a herbivorous predator, in which the authors found that spatial sorting is responsible for the rapid and persistent evolution of dispersal and feeding traits in the red-shouldered soapberry bug.

AB  - In temperate regions, the annual pattern of spring onset can be envisioned as a 'green wave' of emerging vegetation that moves across continents from low to high latitudes, signifying increasing food availability for consumers. Many herbivorous migrants 'surf' such resource waves, timing their movements to exploit peak vegetation resources in early spring. Although less well studied at the individual level, secondary consumers such as insectivorous songbirds can track vegetation phenology during migration as well. We hypothesized that four species of ground-foraging songbirds in eastern North America-two warblers and two thrushes-time their spring migrations to coincide with later phases of vegetation phenology, corresponding to increased arthropod prey, and predicted they would match their migration rate to the green wave but trail behind it rather than surfing its leading edge. We further hypothesized that the rate at which spring onset progresses across the continent influences bird migration rates, such that individuals adjust migration timing within North America to phenological conditions they experience en route. To test our hypotheses, we used a continent-wide automated radio telemetry network to track individual songbirds on spring migration between the U.S. Gulf Coast region and northern locations closer to their breeding grounds. We measured vegetation phenology using two metrics of spring onset, the spring index first leaf date and the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), then calculated the rate and timing of spring onset relative to bird detections. All individuals arrived in the southeastern United States well after local spring onset. Counter to our expectations, we found that songbirds exhibited a 'catching up' pattern: Individuals migrated faster than the green wave of spring onset, effectively closing in on the start of spring as they approached breeding areas. While surfing of resource waves is a well-documented migration strategy for herbivorous waterfowl and ungulates, individual songbirds in our study migrated faster than the green wave and increasingly caught up to its leading edge en route. Consequently, songbirds experience a range of vegetation phenophases while migrating through North America, suggesting flexibility in their capacity to exploit variable resources in spring.

AB  - Climate change intensifies water scarcity and soil salinization, threatening agriculture and livestock systems, especially in arid Mediterranean regions. Halophytes and salt-tolerant plants offer sustainable alternatives to support ruminant health and productivity where traditional crops fail, helping mitigate climate impacts. This work evaluated seasonality effects on the biochemical properties, including proximate composition, minerals, antioxidant properties, and the phenolic composition of the aerial organs of halophytes and salt-tolerant species, aiming at their future exploitation in ruminant production as novel nutraceutical or phytotherapeutic products. Target species included four halophytic species according to the eHaloph database (Calystegia soldanella (L.) R. Br. 1810, Medicago marina L. 1753, Plantago coronopus L. 1753, and Limoniastrum monopetalum (L.) Boiss. 1848) and five salt-tolerant plants (Pistacia lentiscus L. 1753, Cladium mariscus (L.) Pohl 1809, Inula crithmoides L. (syn. Limbarda crithmoides Dumort. 1827), Helichrysum italicum subsp. picardii (Boiss. & Reut.) Franco 1984, and Crucianella maritima L. 1753). H. italicum, M. marina, and C. soldanella appear well-suited for nutraceutical applications, while P. lentiscus, L. monopetalum, and C. mariscus hold promise for the development of, for example, phytotherapeutic products. This research underscores the significance of seasonal and species-specific variations in nutrient and phytochemical composition, displaying a range of opportunities for novel, sustainable, and tailored solutions to ruminant production systems in arid environments.

AB  - Arctic cod (Boreogadus saida) strongly dominates the ichthyoplankton assemblages of High Arctic seas, hence competition with other native species seldom has been studied. Yet, interspecific competition could negatively impact the survival of early life stages of fishes in Arctic areas where higher diversity prevails. We surveyed the ichthyoplankton community of the Greenland Sea, in August-September 2017. Gadids (mostly Arctic cod, with a low number of ice cod Arctogadus glacialis) and non-gadids (bigeye sculpin Triglops nybelini and gelatinous snailfish Liparis fabricii) co-dominated age-0 fish assemblages. Here, we document their diet, prey selectivity, horizontal and vertical distributions as well as that of their prey to assess resource partitioning and the potential for interspecific competition. All fish species occupied the top 30 m of the water column, but Arctic cod occurred in highest abundances over the continental slope, whereas other species distributed almost exclusively over the continental shelf. A particle track analysis suggests that Arctic cod larvae could have hatched in the open waters of the Northeast Water Polynya, drifted with the East Greenland Current, and benefited from the high secondary production associated with these oceanographic features. The diet of gadids did not overlap significantly with the diet of non-gadids, but strong selectivity for Pseudocalanus spp. and Calanus spp. copepodites among the larvae suggests potential competition for these key prey items, although limited by size partitioning of the prey. We thus conclude that interspecific competition among early life stages of Arctic fishes is limited for now. However, changing conditions and the northward range expansion of boreal species following climate change could increase competition and, in turn, negatively affect the recruitment of Arctic ichthyoplankton.

AB  - Sea turtles, dolphins and dugongs can be exposed to large mixtures of contaminants due to the proximity of foraging locations to anthropogenic inputs. Differences in accumulation and effect result in differences of chemical risk to these species. However, little is known about the effect of contaminants in marine wildlife. Cellbased, or in vitro, exposure experiments offer an ethical alternative to investigate the effect of contaminants in wildlife. Data from in vitro studies can then be placed in an environmental context, by using screening risk assessments, comparing effect data with accumulation data from the literature, to identify risk to populations of marine wildlife. Cytotoxicity of Cr6+, Cd2+, Hg2+, 4,4'-DDE, and PFNA were investigated in primary skin fibroblasts of green turtles, loggerhead turtles, hawksbill turtles, dugongs, Burrunan dolphins, and common bottlenose dolphins. The general order of toxicity for all species was Hg2+> Cr6+ > Cd2+> 4,4 '-DDE > PFNA, and significant differences in cytotoxicity were found between species for Cr6+, Cd2+ and PFNA. For Cd2+, in particular, cells from turtle species were less sensitive than mammalian species, and dugong cells were by far the most sensitive. The results from the cytotoxicity assay were then used in combination with published data on tissue contaminant concentrations to calculate risk quotients for identifying populations of each species most at risk from these chemicals. Cr, Cd and Hg were identified as posing risk in all six species. Dugongs were particularly at risk from Cd accumulation and dolphin species were particularly at risk from Hg accumulation. These results demonstrate the importance of using species-specific effect and accumulation data for developing chemical risk assessments and can be used to inform managers of priority contaminants, species, or populations. Development of additional in vitro endpoints, and improving links between in vitro and in vivo effects, would further improve this approach to understanding chemical risk in marine megafauna.

AB  - The enemy release hypothesis predicts that invasive plant success is in part due to the absence of natural enemies in the invaded range. However, few studies have assessed how enemy release may vary over time or space. Norway has seen a large increase in non-native plant species over the past few decades. We used historical herbarium records to test whether 10 non-native plant species in Norway have suffered less from natural enemies (foliar herbivores) at different latitudes and over the past 195 years, compared to closely related (congeneric) native species. We analysed over 2200 specimens over 26 species. Chewing herbivory was lower at higher latitudes for both non-native and native species. However, there was no evidence of change over time in overall chewing herbivory for either native or non-native species on average. Chewing herbivory of native and non-native species differed within the genera Centaurea, Epilobium and Salix across latitudes, and in the genera Acer, Barbarea, Campanula and Epilobium across time. Synthesis: Our results suggest that enemy release is unlikely to facilitate these non-native plants in Norway since herbivory levels are similar between both non-native and native plant species. Herbivory of these non-native plants did not change over time, suggesting that they were quickly recognized as food sources by native herbivores. Lower levels of herbivory at higher latitudes suggest that herbivory is unlikely to limit non-native plants further north and that herbivory is likely to increase at higher latitudes as the climate warms.

AB  - Hypoxia is one of the factors severely affect renal function, and, in severe cases, it can lead to renal fibrosis. Although much progress has been made in identifying the molecular mediators of fibrosis, the mechanisms that govern renal fibrosis remain unclear, and there have been no effective therapeutic anti-fibrotic strategies to date. Mammals exposed to low oxygen in the plateau environment for a long time are prone to high-altitude disease, while yaks have been living in the plateau for generations do not develop kidney fibrosis caused by low oxygen. It has been suggested that metabolic reprogramming occurs in renal fibrosis and that pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 1 (PDK1) plays a crucial role in metabolic reprogramming as an important node between glycolysis and the tricarboxylic acid cycle. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of hypoxia on the renal tissues and renal interstitial fibroblasts of yaks. We found that, at the tissue level, HIF-1 alpha, PDK1, TGF-beta 1, Smad2, Smad3, and alpha-SMA were mainly distributed and expressed in tubular epithelial cells but were barely present in the renal mesenchymal fibroblasts of healthy cattle and yak kidneys. Anoptical density analysis showed that in healthy cattle kidneys, TGF-beta 1, Smad2, and Smad3 expression was significantly higher than in yak kidneys (p < 0.05), and HIF-1 alpha and PDK1 expression was significantly lower than in yak kidneys (p < 0.05). The results at the protein and gene levels showed the same trend. At the cellular level, prolonged hypoxia significantly elevated PDK1 expression in the renal mesangial fibroblasts of cattle and yak kidneys compared with normoxia (p < 0.05) and was proportional to the degree of cellular fibrosis. However, PDK1 expression remained stable in yaks compared with renal interstitial fibroblast-like cells in cattle during the same hypoxic time period. At the same time, prolonged hypoxia also promoted changes in cellular phenotype, promoting the proliferation, activation, glucose consumption, lactate production, and anti-apoptosis in the both of cattle and yaks renal interstitial fibroblasts The differences in kidney structure and expression of PDK1 and HIF-1 alpha in kidney tissue and renal interstitial fibroblasts induced by different oxygen concentrations suggest that there may be a regulatory relationship between yak kidney adaptation and hypoxic environment at high altitude. This provides strong support for the elucidation of the regulatory relationship between PDK1 and HIF-1 alpha, as well as a new direction for the treatment or delay of hypoxic renal fibrosis; additionally, these findings provide a basis for further analysis of the molecular mechanism of hypoxia adaptation-related factors and the adaptation of yaks to plateau hypoxia.

AB  - Marine mammals are exposed to increasing intensities of anthropogenic stressors such as acoustic disturbance and contaminants. Correlative studies have suggested concerning shifts in behavioral and physiological status of stress-exposed individuals, which could alter the health and survival of marine mammal populations. However, functional studies of the effects of multiple stressors on marine mammals are lacking. To fill in this gap, we recently developed an ex vivo approach of precision-cut adipose tissue slices (PCATS) to study the impact of stressors on the function of an essential endocrine organ: the adipose tissue. In the present study, we investigated the impact of hormones associated with the stress response on adipose tissue from northern elephant seals (Mirounga angustirostris). Blubber biopsies were collected from 17 weaned northern elephant seal pups, separated into inner and outer layers, dissected into PCATS, and cultured for 48 hours. To mimic prolonged and short-term exposure to physiological stress, PCATS were treated with 2 mu M cortisol (CORT) for the entire 48 hours or 100 nM epinephrine (EPI) for the last 12 hours of culture, respectively. Hormones were applied individually or in combination. CORT and EPI exhibited an interacting, blubber layer-dependent, effect on adipose tissue biology, as quantified by gene expression in PCATS, and release of glycerol, free fatty acids, leptin and polychlorinated biphenyls into culture media. EPI stimulated a higher rate of lipolysis than CORT in PCATS from both blubber layers. The combination of CORT and EPI upregulated the expression of adipose triglyceride lipase in inner blubber PCATS and downregulated hormone-sensitive lipase in outer blubber-derived PCATS. Expression of the leptin gene and secretion of the leptin adipokine were both decreased by EPI, while addition of CORT attenuated this effect in inner blubber PCATS only. CORT also increased the expression of the antioxidant enzyme glutathione peroxidase 3 in PCATS from both blubber layers. Polychlorinated biphenyls exhibited selective and limited mobilization from PCATS treated with stress hormones, highlighting the lipophilic properties of these toxic compounds. This study showed that physiological stress can impact several essential functions of marine mammal blubber, such as lipolysis and adipokine production.

AB  - Knowledge of the larval ecology of winter-spawning fish from the Estuary and Gulf of St. Lawrence, Canada, remains scarce due to the seasonal ice cover that prevents ichthyoplankton sampling using conventional methods. Two winter-spawning species, Atlantic halibut (AH, Hippoglossus hippoglossus) and Greenland halibut (GH, Reinhardtius hippoglossoides), support the most important groundfish fisheries of this area. In March 2020, the authors captured 10 halibut larvae ranging in size from 5 to 14 mm during an opportunistic survey in the GSL onboard an icebreaking vessel. Of these, eight were AH and two GH. Judging by their very small size, the larvae were only a few days old, suggesting that the spawning grounds are close to the capture sites. This effort constitutes a first step in validating the putative spawning areas for these two important GSL stocks. This knowledge is important for the conservation and sustainable management of these fisheries.

AB  - High post-settlement mortality in ex situ sexually propagated coral recruits remains a significant bottleneck to production of corals for reef restoration, scientific experiments and the ornamental trade. Co-culture with grazing herbivores represents a potentially cost-effective method to reduce recruit competition with algae, thus improving the survival and yield of corals. Here we examined the effectiveness of co-culture of coral recruits of Acropora millepora, A. tenuis, A. secale, Porites lobata and Platygyra daedalea with herbivorous gastropods, Calthalotia strigata and Turbo haynesi, and herbivorous juveniles of the Asteroid Acanthaster cf. solaris. Coral recruits (200 per species) were settled onto individual aragonite plugs, with 10 plugs per species introduced to twenty 50 L experimental tanks. Each tank was randomly assigned to one of five grazing treatments; (1) Thalotia, 30 C. strigata per tank, (2) Turbo, 30 T. haynesi per tank, (3) CoTS, 30 A. cf. solaris per tank, (4) Mix, 10 C. strigata, 10 T. haynesi and 20 A. cf. solaris per tank, and (5) Control, no grazers added. We found that over a 2-month period single species co-culture with C. strigata significantly improved the survival of A. millepora, A. tenuis, A. secale and P. lobata, whilst P. daedalea benefitted most from co-culture with T. haynesi. Over 6-months, C. strigata produced the highest survival in A. millepora (51.6% +/- 5.24%), A. tenuis (46.6% +/- 3.16%) and A. secale (38.5% +/- 3.48%), but T. haynesi co-culture resulted in higher survival in P. lobata (67.3% +/- 3.76%) and P. daedalea (100% +/- 0%). These results were all significantly higher than the survival of corals in controls, which after 6 months averaged similar to 1.87% for the Acropora species, 43.0% +/- 4.79% and 57.6% +/- 8.60% for P. lobata and P. daedalea respectively. Increase in basal surface area of recruits was varied, with the highest relative increases in recruit basal disk area occurring in Thalotia treatments for A. millepora and A. secale, in Turbo for A. tenuis, and in the Control tanks for P. lobata and P. daedalea. This study provides strong evidence that co-culture with C. strigata can improve ex situ sexual coral propagation, with minimal additional intervention from aquarists. The large increase (23.6x higher) in survival of ecologically and economically important coral species such as A. millepora demonstrates the potential of co-culture to enhance ex situ coral propagation.

AB  - Raccoon dogs Nyctereutes procyonoides are on the List of National Key Protected Wild Animals as Grade II in China; research on their wild populations is limited despite their conservation significance. In this context, we focused on seasonal activity changes from autumn to winter and their relationship to environmental and mammalian factors. Using 71 trail cameras from 15 October 2023 to 29 February 2024, in the Sizuolou Nature Reserve in Beijing, China, this study is the first to examine these specific aspects within the country. Our findings revealed a statistically significant change in raccoon dog activity from autumn to winter. This suggests they may enter short periods of winter sleep, as indicated by the 20-day intervals without camera detections. The average re-photographing interval was 2.62 +/- 3.41 (SD) days. In the daily activity pattern, kernel density estimation indicated that raccoon dogs were nocturnal in both seasons; however, daytime activity was observed only in autumn. Our results revealed that proximity to agricultural land negatively affected, and the presence of Siberian roe deer positively influenced, the number of raccoon dog events. Additionally, our results supported the previous categorisation of raccoon dogs into two habitat types, with our study population being near the type that avoids agricultural land. Our findings suggested that raccoon dogs and Siberian roe deer co-occur due to raccoon dogs preferring habitats that were also favoured by deer.

AB  - The wild boar (Sus scrofa) originates from warm islands but now inhabits large areas of the world, with Antarctica as the only continent not inhabited by this species. One might be tempted to think that its wide distribution results from increasing environmental temperatures. However, any effect of temperature is only indirect: Abundant availability of critical food resources can fully compensate the negative effects of cold winters on population growth. Here, we asked if temperature as a habitat factor is unimportant compared with other habitat indices, simply because wild boars are excellent thermoregulators. We found that the thermoneutral zone in summer was approximately 6-24 & DEG;C. In winter, the thermoneutral zone was lowered to 0-7 & DEG;C. The estimated increase in the heart rate and energy expenditure in the cold was less than 30% per 10 & DEG;C temperature decline. This relatively small increase of energy expenditure during cold exposure places the wild boar in the realm of arctic animals, such as the polar bear, whereas tropical mammals raise their energy expenditure several fold. The response of wild boars to high Ta was weak across all seasons. In the heat, wild boars avoid close contact to conspecifics and particularly use wallowing in mud or other wet substrates to cool and prevent hyperthermia. Wild boars also rely on daily cycles, especially of rhythms in subcutaneous temperature that enables them to cheaply build large core-shell gradients, which serve to lower heat loss. We argue it is predominantly this ability which allowed wild boars to inhabit most climatically diverse areas in the world.

AB  - Increase in atmospheric CO2 concentration expected in the near and distant future climate change scenario because of increasing emissions will change the quality of plant foliage which in turn effect the growth and development of herbivore insects. Feeding trials of Spodoptera litura Hub. for four successive generations were conducted by using the foliage of sunflower crop plants grown at four CO2 concentrations, 550 +/- 25 ppm (eCO(2)I), 700 +/- 25 ppm CO2 (eCO(2)II) and ambient CO2 (aCO(2)C), along with open field considered as 380 +/- 25 ppm (aCO(2)O). CO2 enrichment altered the biochemical constituents in sunflower foliage at both 30 & 60 days after sowing (DAS) and had lower nitrogen (20-23 %), protein (12-13 %) and aminoacid contents (15-25 %) with increased carbon (18-21 %) C: N ratio (59-65 %), carbohydrates (16-18 %) and tannins (22-25 %) compared to ambient CO2. The total consumption of sunflower foliage by S. litura larvae was significantly higher (15-62 %) with increased larval weights (5-17 %), lower relative growth rate (12-18 %) and lower food conversion efficiencies (21-34 %) at both levels of eCO(2) over ambient during four successive generations. Biochemical midgut analysis of S. litura larvae fed on sunflower foliage of eCO(2) levels indicated the lower esterase activity, proteins and aminoacids over ambient. Strong association was noted between biochemical constituents of sunflower foliage and insect parameters at two levels of eCO(2). The findings corroborate the host-mediated effect of eCO(2) on growth and development of S. litura on sunflower and imply that the pest activity may likely increase in future climate change scenario.

AB  - Populations of the iconic tiger shark, Galeocerdo cuvier, are in a state of global decline, with the species assessed as 'Near Threatened' on the IUCN Red List. Despite this, there is a lack of fundamental information required for regional management, such as those on life history and ecology. We bridge this knowledge gap by generating the first information on the population dynamics of G. cuvier from the Arabian Sea - one of the world's most important shark fishing regions. Length-frequency data of 629 G. cuvier landed at Cochin (Southwest coast of India) over 16 months in 2023-2024, revealed the dominance of 180-240 cm length class, with the largest individual measuring 405 cm TL. The von Bertalanffy curve fitted to the length-frequency data revealed greater asymptotic length (L infinity = 490.55 cm TL) and growth co-efficient (K = 0.250 y-1) compared to populations from the Atlantic and Pacific. Estimates of fishing mortality (F = 0.77) and exploitation rate (E = 0.71) suggest that G. cuvier face high levels of fishing pressure. The length at first capture (LC) indicates that close to 95 % of the catches are represented by immature individuals. In addition, young of the year G. cuvier (<150 cm TL) landed as 'bycatch' contributed to 23 % of the landings. To effectively mitigate these challenges, and secure the future of G. cuvier in the Arabian Sea, we propose the establishment of tiger shark conservation zones to help protect critical life-history stages, and implement size-based restrictions to reduce growth and recruitment overfishing.

AB  - Interactions such as mutualism and facilitation are common in ecosystems established by foundation species; however, their outcomes vary and show conditionality. In a Mexican Caribbean Bay, a seagrass-coralline algae (rhodoliths) mutualism protects the seagrass Thalassia testudinum from green turtle overgrazing. We postulate that the state of the seagrass meadow in this bay depends on the strengths of the interactions among seagrasses, green turtles, and coralline algae. Spatio-temporal changes through satellite imagery showed rhodolith bed developed rapidly from 2009 (undetected) to 2016 (bed of 6934 m2). Typically, such rapid expansion of the rhodoliths does not occur in seagrass meadows. An in situ growth experiment of coralline algae showed that a combination of reduction in light and wave movement (usual in dense seagrass meadows) significantly reduced their growth rates. In the rhodolith beds, the growth rates of the coralline algae Neogoniolithon sp. and Amphiroa sp. were high at 9.5 mm and 15.5 mm per growth tip y-1, respectively. In a second experiment, we found lower mortality in coralline algae within a rhodolith bed compared to algae placed outside the bed, likely explained by the reduced resuspension that we found in a third experiment, and this positive feedback may explain the high population increase in the rhodoliths, once established when the turtles grazed down the seagrass canopy. Therefore, the grazing-protection mutualism between seagrasses and coralline algae is thus conditional and came into existence under a co-occurrence of intensive grazing pressure and rapid population growth of coralline algae facilitated by positive feedback from increased growth and reduced sediment resuspension by the dense rhodolith bed.

AB  - This study conducted stable isotope analysis (delta C-13, delta N-15, and delta S-34) on the epidermis and two skeletal elements (rib and squamosal bones) of Hawaiian green turtles (Chelonia mydas) and putative diet items obtained from two neritic sites: the Kona/Kohala coast and Oahu. Turtle tissues were collected in 2018-2020 and diet samples in 2018, 2019, and 2021. The effect of body size and sampling locality on individual bulk tissue isotope values was evaluated, and stable isotope mixing models based on delta C-13, delta N-15, and delta S-34 values from those tissues and four groups of food sources were used to reconstruct diet histories of the turtles. Mixing models indicated that green turtles along the Kona/Kohala coast consumed an omnivorous diet, whereas those from Oahu had an herbivorous diet. These diet make-ups are consistent with published gut content analyses. However, mixing models using the stable isotope ratios in rib and squamosal bone failed to yield reasonable diet histories, probably due to inadequacies of the applied trophic discrimination factor (TDF), a key model parameter. These results further establish that stable isotope ratios in the epidermis can be used effectively to study green turtle diet, but also reveal that more validation-and establishment of appropriate TDFs-is needed before bone can be used reliably to assess green turtle diet.

AB  - The Pilbara leaf-nosed bat (Rhinonicteris aurantia 'Pilbara form') is a threatened insectivorous microbat endemic to the Pilbara region of Western Australia. It is at risk of significant population decline, particularly due to habitat loss from mining. To address its key threats, stakeholders from a range of backgrounds collectively listed and prioritised research actions in 2013. This exercise was repeated in 2022 to evaluate and update progress of the research priorities. We conducted a review of scientific and grey literature (2013-2023) to: (1) identify the work undertaken to date that addressed the research priorities identified in the 2013 stakeholder workshop; (2) identify the current knowledge gaps in Pilbara leaf-nosed bat ecology, conservation, and threatening processes; and (3) highlight how these gaps relate to the newly ranked 2022 priority list for both research and management outcomes. We found that the 2013 research priorities were largely unaddressed, with most publications and unpublished industry reports in the review period primarily reporting presence or monitoring data around areas of interest to the resources sector, with minimal focus on the species' conservation or management directly. Therefore, the knowledge gaps identified in 2013 were still largely relevant in 2022. Further targeted research is required to meet the 2022 priorities and better understand the habitat characteristics, movement ecology, disturbance buffer requirements, and cumulative impacts of mining on Pilbara leaf-nosed bat colonies. Overall, targeted research beyond traditional mining outputs, changes to regulatory procedure, and collaborative, adaptive management, are key to supporting the long-term persistence of Pilbara leaf-nosed bats.

AB  - Species range expansion induced by climate change and human activities threaten native populations and communities across the biosphere. Insect herbivores, important consumers of plants, are known to expand or contract their range under global change, with potential consequences to the newly reached environment. The selection of oviposition sites by herbivorous insects could notably impact offspring performance. However, the role of such effects in impacting the receiving ecosystem has been rarely explored. Here, we provide the first evidence showing that a terrestrial range-expanding phytophagous wood-borer moth (Zeuzera leuconotum Butler) heavily attacked the saplings of a foundation plant species tamarisk (Tamarix chinensis) in salt marshes. Long-term field surveys and laboratory behaviour experiments revealed that the oviposition preference of adult females was beneficial to their larval performance. The preference to oviposit on young branches of the new host plants, which were often softer and contained enough nutrients for larval development, indicates that females could still make the right choice on novel host-plants. This finding supports the 'mother knows best' hypothesis that female insects will evolve to oviposit on hosts on which their offspring fare best. Consequently, the survival of host-plant saplings decreased dramatically under this top-down control, revealing that herbivory of this range-expanding insect has a profound negative impact on the recruitment and succession of coastal foundation species, thereby potentially leading to saltmarsh degradation. These findings highlight the importance of the maternal oviposition effects in range-expanding insects and how these populations can establish using novel host-plants and threaten coastal wetlands.

AB  - Livestock manure, as a major source of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs), could further transfer ARGs from soil to vegetables when it's used as fertilizer in field and then pose threat to human health. Meanwhile, manure inputs and vegetable planting also affect soil bacterial communities, but these effects on the transmission of ARGs from soil to vegetable is still lacking. Here, lettuce and endive were cultivated in manure-amended soils using pot experiment. The distribution of bacterial community, ARGs and intI1 gene were studied in manure-amended soil and vegetable roots and leaves at harvest. High-throughput sequencing analysis demonstrated that planting vegetables exerted significant effect on soil bacterial communities, which partly explained the decrease of certain ARGs and the intI1 gene in planted soil than in control soil. ARGs in vegetable and soil were interconnected. The bacterial community compositions among root endophyte, leaf endophyte, and phyllosphere were varied by Hierarchical clustering analysis. Higher abundance of shared bacterial taxa was found between root endophytes and soil microbes, which could lead to a relative higher detection frequency of ARGs in root endophyte. Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria, Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes were dominant in the plant endophyte and phyllosphere microbes and had intensive correlations with ARGs. Taken together, our findings provided valuable insights into the role of bacterial community structure in the dissemination of ARGs from manure-amended soil to vegetables.

AB  - Advanced wastewater treatment plants are widely used in most large-scale pig farms in southern China. However, the fate of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) and their association with bacterial and archaeal communities during advanced wastewater treatment remain unclear. In this study, the profiles of ARGs in typical advanced wastewater treatment plants were surveyed using metagenomic analysis. The results showed that 279- 326 different subtypes of ARGs were detected in raw wastewater, with a total abundance of 5.98 +/- 0.48 copies per bacterial cell. During the advanced wastewater treatment, the abundance and number of ARGs were significantly reduced. Microbial communities (bacteria and archaea) contributed the most to the variation in ARG abundance and composition (PCA axis_1), accounting for 10.8 % and 15.7 %, respectively, followed by mobile genetic elements (MGEs) and physico-chemical factors. Special attention should be given to potential pathogenic bacteria such as Escherichia, Streptococcus, Enterococcus and Staphylococcus and archaea such as Methanocorpusculum, Candidatus Methanoplasma and Candidatus Methanomethylophilus, which were important potential ARG hosts. Bacterial communities may indirectly affect ARG variation by affecting archaeal communities. These findings indicated that ARG levels in pig farm wastewater can be effectively reduced during advanced treatment and highlighted the important role played by archaea, which should not be ignored.

AB  - Lady (= ladybird) beetles (Coleoptera: Coccinellidae) provide agroecosystem services as major predators of aphids and other pests of field crops. Several native coccinellids in North America have declined in association with the introduction of invasive species of lady beetles. In particular, populations of three native species declined drastically (Coccinella transversoguttata richardsoni) or effectively disappeared (Coccinella novemnotata, Adalia bipunctata) from agricultural landscapes in eastern South Dakota, U.S.A., following establishment of an invasive coccinellid (Coccinella septempunctata) in the 1980s. Since then, two other non-native coccinellids (Harmonia axyridis and Hippodamia variegata) have established in eastern South Dakota, but long-term analysis of their impact on the aphidophagous coccinellid guild is lacking. This paper summarizes long-term results from 14 years (2007-2020) of sampling coccinellids by sweepnet and timed searches in five field crops and restored prairie in eastern South Dakota. In all, 17,338 aphidophagous coccinellids comprising 10 species were sampled. Two invasive species (Coc. septempunctata, Har. axyridis) were the third- and fourth-most abundant species, respectively. The seven most abundant species constituted 99% of all coccinellids sampled and were recorded from all six habitats. However, coccinellid species ranged considerably in their evenness of habitat use, resulting in differences in rank abundance among habitats. Coccinellid assemblages were similar for alfalfa and winter wheat, but not for other habitats, which possessed distinct coccinellid assemblages based on rank abundance. Annual abundance of coccinellids varied considerably within habitats, but declining trends were evident from significant negative regressions in annual abundance for adult and immature coccinellids in corn and adults in soybean. As a group, native adult coccinellids showed a significant declining trend in corn but not in other habitats, whereas trends for non-native adult coccinellids were non-significant in all habitats. Sample rates of coccinellids in alfalfa, spring grains, and corn in this study were 74, 26, and 6%, respectively, compared to that of a previous study from the region, further indicating substantial decreases in coccinellid abundance. Possible explanations and implications for observed patterns in coccinellid diversity and individual species abundances in field crops and restored prairie of eastern South Dakota are discussed with respect to prey, agronomic trends, and landscape factors.

AB  - Brackish water is being progressively utilized in livestock farming across the globe where freshwater is scarce, potentially leading to detrimental consequences for animal health and performance. This study was conducted to determine effects of different brackish groundwater types on water and feed intake, nutrient utilization, ruminal fluid characteristics, and blood constituent concentrations in different breeds of goats and sheep in a 6 (animal types; AT) x 6 (water treatments; WT) Latin square design. Six AT (Boer, Spanish, and Tennessee Stiff-Leg does and Dorper, Katahdin, and St. Croix ewes) consumed drinking water differing in total dissolved solids (TDS) and mineral composition. Six WT were fresh water (FRW; 287 mg TDS/kg), a natural brackish water (BR) alone (100BR; 5734 mg TDS/kg), BR with concentrations of all minerals increased by about 100 % (200-BR; 10,603 mg TDS/kg), FRW added with NaCl having similar TDS level (6654 mg/kg) as 100-BR (100-SL), FRW added with NaCl having similar TDS (12,197 mg/kg) as 200-BR (200-SL), and water with similar TDS (10,643 mg/kg) level as 200-BR by adding NaCl to 100-BR (200-BR/SL). Water treatment only affected (P < 0.05) water intake, total volatile fatty acids in ruminal fluid, blood phosphorus, blood aldosterone, and plasma osmolality. Water intake was greater (P < 0.05), but total ruminal volatile fatty acid concentrations were lower (P < 0.05) for 200-SL than other WT. Plasma osmolality and aldosterone concentrations were lower (P < 0.05) for 200-SL and 200-BR/SL than FRW. There were no significant interactions between WT and AT for any variable. Water and feed intake, digestibilities, ruminal ammonia concentration, and methane emission were similar among AT (P > 0.05). There were differences (P < 0.05) among AT for many ruminal fermentation and blood characteristics. Although there were some differences among WT, no AT seemed adversely affected by water with a TDS level near or slightly above 10,000 mg/kg regardless of mineral sources.

AB  - The present study evaluated the use of camelina (CO) and black soldier fly larvae (BSFLO) oils as replacements of fish oil (FO) in diets for juvenile Totoaba macdonaldi, and their effect on growth, proximate composition, fatty acid (FA) profile of tissues, and gene expression of bile salt-dependent (BSDL) and colipase-dependent (CDPL) pancreatic lipases. Four isoproteic (51% crude protein) and isolipidic (14% crude fat) diets were formulated based on a 2 x 2 factorial design with two lipid sources, CO and BSFLO, each tested at two levels of replacement of FO, 30 and 60%. A control diet containing 100% FO was included as a reference. Fish with an overall initial weight (mean & PLUSMN; standard deviation, S.D.) of 3.0 & PLUSMN; 0.1 g were stocked at a density of 100 fish m(- 3). Each diet was randomly assigned to five replicate tanks, and four tanks for the control. After 7 weeks, weight gain (WG, P = 0.0302) and thermal growth coefficient (TGC, P = 0.0408) were significantly reduced in fish fed the 60% FO replacement level in comparison to the 30% level; fish fed diets containing 30% BSFLO were the only ones achieving statistically similar WG (59.40 g) and TGC (0.175) as fish fed the control diet (WG of 60.68 g and TGC of 0.177). Muscle and liver tissues of fish reflected the FA profiles of experimental diets; fish fed BSFLO showed greater content of lauric acid (12:0) in muscle (0.14-0.17 mg g(-1)), while alpha-linolenic acid (18:3n-3) was higher in those fed CO (0.25-0.51 mg g-1). Docosahexaenoic acid (22:6n-3) content was statistically similar in fillets from all different treatments, demonstrating selective retention of this biologically important FA, but eicosapentaenoic acid (20:5n-3) decreased as the level of FO replacement by CO or BSFLO in diets increased. The presence of BSDL and CDPL in the digestive tract of T. macdonaldi was confirmed for the first time, but regulation of their gene expression was not significantly affected at a transcriptional level by the progressive replacement of FO by CO or BSFLO under these experimental conditions. These findings suggest that 30% of FO can be successfully replaced by BSFLO in diets for juvenile T. macdonaldi, and a 100 g fillet from fish fed this diet would provide 284 mg of DHA + EPA, satisfying the daily intake recommended for adult consumers.

AB  - Large Language Models (LLMs) such as GPT, BART, and Gemini stand at the forefront of Generative Artificial Intelligence, showcasing remarkable prowess in natural language comprehension and task execution. This paper proposes a novel framework developed on the foundation of Llama 2, aiming to bridge the gap between natural language queries and executable code for geospatial analyses within the PyQGIS environment. It empowers non-expert users to leverage GIS technology without requiring deep knowledge of geospatial programming or tools. Through cutting-edge Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques, including tailored entity recognition and ontology mapping, the framework accurately interprets user intents and translates them into specific GIS operations. Integration of geospatial ontologies enriches semantic comprehension, ensuring precise alignment between user descriptions, geospatial datasets, and geospatial analysis tasks. A code generation module empowered by Llama 2 converts these interpretations into PyQGIS scripts, enabling the execution of geospatial analysis and results visualization. Rigorous testing across a spectrum of geospatial analysis tasks, with incremental complexity, evaluates the framework and the performance of such a system, with LLM at its core. The proposed system demonstrates proficiency in handling various geometries, spatial relationships, and attribute queries, enabling accurate and efficient analysis of spatial datasets. Moreover, it offers robust error-handling mechanisms and supports tasks related to map styling, visualization, and data manipulation. However, it has some limitations, such as occasional struggles with ambiguous attribute names and aliases, which leads to potential inaccuracies in the filtering and retrieval of features. Despite these limitations, the system presents a promising solution for applications integrating LLMs into GIS and offers a flexible and user-friendly approach to geospatial analysis.

AB  - For the purposes of testing the impacts of habitat expansion on elephant movement, six XL LoRa elephant radio collars were fixed on three adult male elephants and three adult female elephants prior to a fence being removed at Kariega Game Reserve, South Africa. While none of the collars on female elephants twisted, within five months, all the male elephant collars had twisted, with some triple and double twisting. Behavioural monitoring revealed indications of irritation that resulted in the removal and/or replacement of all twisted collars. It was discovered that two of the male elephants had developed wounds underneath their twisted collars, therefore, only one elephant was re-collared, with a collar that was modified to minimize further risk of twisting, however it twisted again. To investigate this rare incidence of elevated collar twisting, our study assessed the following: elephant behaviour to guide decision-making around interventions and well-being; when, where and how these incidents occurred to investigate the mechanism of twisting and the likelihood of human error; collar design and refurbishment to develop recommendations to minimize the likelihood of twisting; and data obtained from organizations using elephant collars for comparison. From this, it was theorized that browsing behaviour in bulls in dense vegetation, and inadequate collar design were the likely causes in twisting occurrence. We urge organizations using LoRa elephant collars to emphasize post-application monitoring, and exercise caution, when attaching on bulls in dense vegetation. We encourage collar manufacturers to thoroughly investigate twisting incidents and adjust collar structures accordingly and inform clients about the possibility of twisting. By addressing these issues, we can better ensure the well-being of elephants, research success, and improved device safety and efficacy.

AB  - Current theory (e.g., consumer-controlled theory) predicts that nutrient enrichment typically amplifies herbivory and thereby suppresses the growth and expansion of invasive plants. Herbivores can facilitate plant regrowth in the native community by stimulating complementary growth or ameliorating habitat conditions (e.g., by increasing soil oxygen and nutrient availability), but whether they have similar positive effects on invasive plants, especially under nutrient enrichment, remains unknown. Using a field nitrogen (N)-enrichment x crab exclusion experiment, we evaluated and compared the effects of both N enrichment and crab herbivory on the growth performance of a global invasive cordgrass, Spartina alterniflora, and a co-occurring native plant, Phragmites australis. We found that crabs consistently suppressed P. australis by density and aboveground biomass regardless of N enrichment. In contrast, for S. alterniflora, the negative effects of crabs under ambient N were replaced by positive effects under N enrichment, with crabs stimulating complementary increases in density and aboveground biomass. The differing effects between the N treatments were driven by crab burrowing activity, which increased soil N availability, and the nutrient-use efficiency of S. alterniflora. Our findings revealed that native herbivores can have opposing effects on native and invasive plants, which broadens our understanding of how exotic plants can achieve dominance in a changing world.

AB  - Understanding how and why livestock choose to graze on pasture can provide valuable information to farmers, such as overall pasture use, foraging patterns, and behavior trends. This information may be used to further assist farmers in making management decisions on how to increase production. This study specifically aimed to understand what the important drivers of grazing were, such as landscape attributes (pasture quality, distance to trees, distance to fences, distance to water) and climatic variables (rainfall, temperature), in paddocks comprising either native or improved/introduced grass species, in the Monaro region of SE Australia. Pasture quality was a highly important and a significant variable, along with temperature and elevation for the improved pasture paddock, in contrast to the native paddock, where in addition to elevation and temperature, near distance to trees was more important in determining sheep location. Results from research such as this can provide valuable insights into various grazing behaviors of sheep and also assist in shaping the sustainable management of sheep.Monitoring livestock allows insights to graziers on valuable information such as spatial distribution, foraging patterns, and animal behavior, which can significantly improve the management of livestock for optimal production. This study aimed to understand what potential variables are significant for predicting where sheep spent the most time in native (NP) and improved (IP) paddocks. Wethers (castrated male sheep) were tracked using Global Positioning System (GPS) collars on 15 sheep in the IP and 15 in the NP, respectively, on a property located in the Monaro region of Southern New South Wales, Australia. Trials were performed over four six-day periods in April, July, and November of 2014 and March in 2015. Data were analyzed to understand various trends that may have occurred during different seasons, using random forest models (RFMs). Of the factors investigated, Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) was significant (p < 0.01) and highly important for wethers in the IP, but not the NP, suggesting that quality of pasture was key for wethers in the IP. Elevation, temperature, and near distance to trees were important and significant for predicting residency of wethers in the IP, as well as the NP. The result of this study highlights the ability of predictive models to provide insights on behavior-based modelling of GPS data and further enhance current knowledge about location-based choices of sheep on paddocks.

AB  - A principal concern of ecological research is to unveil the causes behind observed spatio-temporal distributions of species. A key tactic is to correlate observed locations with environmental features, in the form of resource selection functions or other correlative species distribution models. In reality, however, the distribution of any population both affects and is affected by those surrounding it, creating a complex network of feedbacks causing emergent spatio-temporal features that may not correlate with any particular aspect of the underlying environment. Here, we study the way in which the movements of populations in response to one another can affect the spatio-temporal distributions of ecosystems. We construct a stochastic individual-based modelling (IBM) framework, based on stigmergent interactions (i.e. organisms leave marks which cause others to alter their movements) between and within populations. We show how to gain insight into this IBM via mathematical analysis of a partial differential equation (PDE) system given by a continuum limit. We show how the combination of stochastic simulations of the IBM and mathematical analysis of PDEs can be used to categorise emergent patterns into homogeneous versus heterogeneous, stationary versus perpetually-fluctuating and aggregation versus segregation. In doing so, we develop techniques for understanding spatial bifurcations in stochastic IBMs, grounded in mathematical analysis. Finally, we demonstrate through a simple example how the interplay between environmental features and between-population stigmergent interactions can give rise to predicted spatial distributions that are quite different to those predicted purely by accounting for environmental covariates.

AB  - The non-native invasive box-tree moth (Cydalima perspectalis) causes severe damage to ornamental box trees (Buxus spp.) and natural boxwood stands (Buxus sempervirens). Using two light traps, we recorded the seasonal flight activity and abundance of C. perspectalis in the suburbs of Basel (Switzerland) over a 15-year period (2009-2023) shortly after the moth's introduction to Europe in 2007. In each year, we also assessed the grazing damage and number of box-tree larvae in a nearby natural box-tree forest. We recorded two peaks in the number of C. perspectalis caught in the settlement area (2009-2010 and 2017-2018). Cross-correlation analysis showed that waves of C. perspectalis moths invaded the settlement area in the year after the peak years of forest damage. Moderate numbers of C. perspectalis were caught each year during off-peak periods. The outbreaks of C. perspectalis resulted in a complete defoliation of the box trees in the forest, after which the moth population collapsed. The slowly regenerating box-tree forest was recolonised by C. perspectalis, most probably from the settlement area. After the second outbreak, the box-tree forest did not appear to be able to fully recover, as moderate numbers of C. perspectalis larvae fed on the emerging new leaves. The annual mean temperature measured in Basel increased by 1.5 degrees C between 2009 and 2023. During this period, the first C. perspectalis moths were caught earlier each year and the last moths were caught later each year. Thus, the duration of flight activity of C. perspectalis (all three generations of a year combined) increased from 13 weeks in 2010 to 20 weeks in 2023, indicating the impact of climate warming. Our study shows that the dynamics of C. perspectalis in the settlement area are strongly influenced by the presence of box trees in the adjacent forest.

AB  - Recent sampling efforts and examinations of museum material provided evidence for a complex of species within Acroteriobatus leucospilus (Norman, 1926). The present manuscript contains a redescription of A. leucospilus involving the syntypes and additional material, as well as formal descriptions of two new species of Acroteriobatus Giltay, 1928. All specimens of both new species were found in the western Indian Ocean. Individuals of the first new species, hereafter referred to as Acroteriobatus andysabini sp. nov., were identified originating from Madagascar, and specimens of the second new species, hereafter referred to as Acroteriobatus stehmanni sp. nov., were only found off Socotra Islands at the junction between the Gulf of Aden and the Arabian Sea. Both new species appear to be endemic to the respective region and allopatric to A. leucospilus and occur in coastal waters to at least 80 m and 43 m depth, respectively. They differ from A. leucospilus in a number of characteristics including the maximum size and coloration in fresh. Acroteriobatus andysabini sp. nov. is a large species growing to more than 100 cm total length (TL) and with elongated bluish-gray spots on snout giving "stripe-nosed" appearance; numerous small bluish-gray spots on pectoral, pelvic, dorsal, and caudal fms; brown spots on trunk and fm bases; lateral tail folds striped orange and white; and ventral surface largely white but with a V-shape pattern of faint to dark speckled black spots on snout tip. Acroteriobatus stehmanni sp. nov. is a small species growing to similar to 62 cm TL and with sparse patterning with small bluish-gray circular spots confined to snout tip, posterior pectoral-fin margins, a pair on midbody, and few on posterior pelvic-fin margins, rather indistinct small to larger dark brown spots, and lateral tail folds and ventral surface white. Acroteriobatus leucospilus is a medium-sized species growing to similar to 96 cm TL and with patterning similar to A. andysabini sp. nov. but ventral surface uniformly white and lateral tail folds white or striped blue and brown. Taxonomical differences include nasal lamellae counts (42-48 in A. andysabini sp. nov. vs. 43-48 in A. stehmanni sp. nov. vs. 37-41 in A. leucospilus), snout angle (76-85 degrees vs. 71-77 degrees vs. 68-81 degrees), and dorsal head length (24.2-33.5% vs. 17.2-22.8% TL vs. 24.0-29.2% TL). A key to the species of Acroteriobatus is given for the first time.

AB  - Oxidized low-density lipoprotein receptor-1 (OLR1) encodes a low-density lipoprotein receptor belonging to the C-type lectin superfamily, which is closely related to reproduction. OLR1 is associated with fecundity in Awassi sheep. However, its effect on litter size has not been investigated in goats. In this study, OLR1 sequences and their mRNA expression levels in the gonadal axis of Guizhou white goats were evaluated to investigate the relationship between gene polymorphisms and litter size. In addition, the potential effects of a nonsynonymous substitution were evaluated using a bioinformatics approach. The expression levels of OLR1 were highest in the uterus of mothers with multiple kids and highest in the ovaries of mothers with single kids. OLR1 mRNA expression levels in the ovaries of mothers with single kids were two times higher than in the ovaries of mothers with multiple kids. The sequencing results revealed five SNPs in OLR1; however, only g.294 T > A, g.2260 T > C, and g.2268 C > T were significantly associated with litter size (P < 0.05). Linkage disequilibrium was detected between g.2260 T > C and g.2268 C > T (r2 1/4 0.322, D0 1/4 0.6). Additionally, goats with the Hap 1/1 diplotype had a greater litter size than others (P < 0.05). g.2260 T > C was a nonsynonymous mutation that resulted in the replacement of valine with alanine at the amino acid residue 54 of the OLR1 protein. Bioinformatic analyses revealed that the p.V54A locus was relatively conserved in cloven-hoofed species. Mutations at this locus could change the local conformation and reduce the stability of OLR1, affecting its half-life and the litter size of the nanny goat. These findings confirm that OLR1 affects goat kidding traits and provide a novel insight into the regulatory mechanism underlying the effect of OLR1 on litter size. (c) 2023 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Similarly to other European mountain areas, in Serra da Estrela the grazing pressure has been reducing due to social and economic drivers that have pushed shepherds and sheep to the foothill, or plainly out of the sector. Shrub encroachment on commons and other previously grazed land is one of the most tangible effects of pastoral abandonment in Serra de Estrela. The impacts of the resulting increase in landscape continuity and biomass availability were made clear in the severe fires of 2017 and 2022. As fire risk is likely to increase with climate change, it becomes urgent to understand what strategies can be deployed to keep fragmentation in these landscapes. Key actors such as shepherds should be involved in this discussion to understand their perceptions, points of view and reasons for abandoning upland pastures. In this study, we use fuzzy cognitive mapping to identify the key variables and mechanisms affecting the pastoral system according to local shepherds. In our study, we developed with local stakeholders a framework outlining the local pastoral system. Based on that, we carried out the fuzzy cognitive mapping collecting 14 questionnaires. We found that shepherds' income is a central issue, but that it is highly dependent on many factors. Increasing the Common Agricultural Policy payments alone is not enough to incentivise the use of upland pastures. More targeted strategies, such as more support for shrubclearing, and direct payments conditional to transhumance are more impactful. Despite a contentious discourse between conservation and shepherding values in Serra da Estrela, we find that shepherd's values are aligned with biodiversity conservation and a potential nature -based solution for minimizing fire risk through woody fuel management. This opens up possibilities for new governance strategies, that put Serra da Estrela's social, environmental and cultural values at its core.

AB  - Herbivory significantly influences plant-insect interactions. This study examined the relationship between leaf color and insect herbivory in cannonball trees (Lecythis pisonis), focusing on temporal patterns in herbivory and leaf defense as leaf color changes across seasons. We found that young pink leaves had smaller leaf areas and greater specific leaf area (SLA) compared to green leaves. Despite these differences, there was no significant effect of leaf color on herbivory levels during the month of bud burst. This suggests that pink, tender leaves may deter herbivores despite expectations of increased damage. Throughout the rainy season, green leaves experienced an average of 4.5% leaf area removed and a 9.3% frequency of leaves attacked, with no significant differences observed between color types. While several potential mechanisms may protect pink leaves, further research is needed to clarify the relationship between leaf pigments and defenses against herbivory in cannonball trees.

AB  - Background A newly discovered zoonotic infection carried by ixodid ticks, Anaplasma capra, affects a wide variety of hosts, including numerous mammals. A. capra most likely infects erythrocytes or endothelial cells in mammals. This study aimed to investigate the A. capra pathogen in goats in Turkiye's Van province.Methods A total of 200 goat blood samples were examined. Goat samples were subjected to partial amplification of the gltA gene fragment using a nested polymerase chain reaction.Results A. capra DNA was detected in 0.5% of goat blood samples. Phylogenetic analysis of a partial gltA gene fragment showed that the Eastern Turkiye isolate, closely grouped with A. capra isolates reported from wild and domestic ruminants in France, Turkiye, and Kyrgyzstan, formed a distinct clade.Conclusions This is the first report of A. capra in goats in Van province, Eastern Turkiye.

AB  - Males with damaged weapons often lose intraspecific contests; however, recent research suggests these males may use post-copulatory means to mitigate reduced reproduction. When intraspecific competition is absent, can weapon-damaged males produce more offspring in multi-mating scenarios relative to intact males? We examined the reproductive potential of weapon-damaged males in Narnia femorata (Hemiptera: Coreidae), a species that exhibits resource defense polygyny and is known to increase testes size when developmental weapon damage occurs. We induced weapon damage during development. Upon sexual maturation, we provided intact and weapon-damaged males with access to four unmated females successively and without any competitors. The mating partners of weapon-damaged males were more likely to have their eggs hatch. Furthermore, weapon-damaged males produced more offspring, though only with larger females. These results suggest that weapon-damaged males have enhanced fertilization outcomes, potentially minimizing reproductive costs of weapon damage. Significance statement Weapon damage is common in nature and can reduce pre-copulatory success. However, few studies have examined the reproductive consequences of weapon damage. We tested the hypothesis that weapon-damaged males can compensate for a pre-copulatory disadvantage through increased investment in traits that improve post-copulatory fertilization success. To examine the reproductive potential of weapon-damaged males, we provided males with four females in succession, then measured reproductive outcomes. We found that mating partners of weapon-damaged males were more likely to have their eggs hatch relative to the mating partners of intact males. Furthermore, we found that weapon-damaged males produced a larger number of offspring than intact males. This evidence reveals that weapon damage allows males to boost reproductive outcomes in non-competitive contexts.

AB  - Background and Aims Research has extensively examined how adaptations to extreme environments shape the highly specialized phenotypes of alpine subnival plants; however, large-scale biogeographical patterns of these specialized plant phenotypes remain largely unexplored.Methods This study investigated the elevational patterns of leaf trichome density in the alpine subnival woolly plant Eriophyton wallichii, alongside its abiotic and biotic correlates, as well as the effect of trichome variation on chemical defence and chlorophyll content. We sampled 11 populations of E. wallichii spanning an elevation range of 4000-4800 m a.s.l., covering most of this species' altitudinal distribution and exhibiting significant variation in abiotic conditions, plant traits and leaf herbivory.Key Results Our results revealed significant variation in leaf trichome density among populations, with a notable increase at higher elevations. This elevational trend was strongly negatively associated with mean temperature during the growing season and, to a lesser extent, positively associated with leaf herbivory. In contrast, precipitation and solar radiation during the growing season showed minimal influence on trichome variation. Interestingly, phenolic compound concentrations in leaves decreased with increasing trichome density, whereas leaf chlorophyll content remained unchanged.Conclusions Our results indicate that adaptation to low temperatures is a key driver in the evolution of woolly plant phenotypes in alpine subnival environments, highlighting potential consequences for these adaptations under global climate change and species distribution shifts. Additionally, the trade-off between trichome density and chemical defences may have significant implications for plant survival strategies in resource-limited environments. Our data also suggest that biotic interactions, especially those involving herbivores, may play an important role in shaping the adaptive mechanisms of some alpine subnival plants.

AB  - Many rare plant species lack up-to-date research about their reproductive ecology, which challenges effective in situ and ex situ conservation, particularly in the face of ongoing environmental and anthropogenic changes. For protected species, outdated and incomplete information also creates barriers to successful recovery planning and delisting. In this study, we gathered a range of reproductive metrics for the federally threatened and state endangered Florida endemic mint, Macbridea alba Chapman (Lamiaceae). We collected data at seven populations within Apalachicola National Forest (Florida, USA) and conducted germination trials to estimate reproductive potential. Additionally, we observed a previously undocumented lepidopteran seed predator for the species and confirmed the occurrence of vivipary. The seed set was low with less than 20% of flowers per inflorescence producing seed across populations; however, germination was high with more than 60% of seeds germinating in five of seven populations. When comparing our results to previous research conducted more than 20 years ago, the results were similar overall (i.e., germination, vivipary); however, new information emerged (i.e., herbivore pressure). As M. alba undergoes reassessment as a potential candidate for delisting from the Endangered Species Act (ESA) list, this information is critical for assessing recovery goals and decisions regarding the species' protected status. For recovery needs related to propagation and reintroduction, these results can inform future seed collection and propagation efforts for the species.

AB  - Kyasanur Forest Disease (KFD), first reported in 1957 in the Shimoga district of Karnataka, India, has spread significantly over the past two decades, reaching both northern and southern states, with reports of monkey deaths. Haemaphysalis spp. ticks are the primary vectors, transmitting the disease to monkeys, humans, and other mammals. This study aimed to assess the prevalence, mean abundance, and mean intensity of Ixodidae ticks, including the KFD vector, in domestic animals across selected localities of the Western Ghats. A total of 2877 domestic animals were surveyed, revealing an overall tick prevalence of 44.91% (CI: 43.10-46.73), with sheep showing the highest prevalence at 47.92% (CI: 40.96-54.95). The most abundant tick species was Rhipicephalus (Boophilus) microplus, with a mean of 2.53 +/- 0.66 ticks per host, which also represented the most proportionally dominant species, accounting for 39.63% of the total ticks collected. The highest mean intensity was recorded for Haemaphysalis intermedia (7.35 +/- 2.03 ticks per infested animal). Regionally, Rh. (Bo.) microplus was found in 96.15% of buffaloes examined in Tamil Nadu, Haemaphysalis bispinosa in 85.19% of cattle in Maharashtra, and in 98.46% of goats in Goa. Ha. intermedia was common in 99.11% of sheep examined in Karnataka, while Ha. bispinosa was observed in 90.82% of goats in Kerala. The proportional representation of the KFD vector Haemaphysalis spinigera was 0.97%, with a mean intensity of 2.34 +/- 0.04 ticks per infested animal and an overall mean abundance of 0.06 +/- 0.01 ticks per host. Adult Ha. spinigera were recorded from cattle, buffaloes, sheep, goats, and dogs; however, no nymphs were detected. This study also reports the first documented occurrence of Ixodes ceylonensis in domestic animals. These findings suggest a notable presence of tick infestations in the region and emphasize the importance of continued surveillance and targeted control measures to better understand and manage potential KFD transmission risks in the Western Ghats.

AB  - Intensive pig production by and large depends on high quality boarejaculates to accomplish steady fertilization rates. To maximize the breeding process, malesare introduced to the production as soon as possible. Nevertheless, this study suggests thatyoung boars produce spermatozoa with less stable membranes and mitochondrial activitythat are more susceptible to oxidative damage and bacteriospermia. Such predispositionsmay result in low sperm survival following liquid storage which may affect the success ofartificial insemination. Similarly, a decline of sperm quality was observed in senior boars,that is affected by higher cell senescence and susceptibility to DNA damage, and hence to alower ability of the sperm cell to successfully accomplish fertilization. This study strove to investigate the effect of boar age on conventional and non-conventional quality traits of fresh and liquid-stored semen. Sixty boars were allocated into 3 groups: 8-12 months (young); 24-36 months (adult); and 48-60 months (senior). Ejaculates were divided into two parts; the first one was assessed in native state while the second one was extended in the Androstar Plus extender containing gentamycin, stored at 5 degrees C and evaluated following 72 h. Young animals presented with a significantly lower sperm motility (p < 0.01), membrane and acrosome integrity (p < 0.0001), and mitochondrial activity (p < 0.0001) against adult boars. Significantly higher levels of free radicals and tumor necrosis factor alpha (p < 0.001), interleukin 1 and 6 (p < 0.0001) were found in young boars in comparison to adult boars. The assessment of liquid-stored semen revealed a significantly lower sperm motility, membrane, and acrosome integrity (p < 0.0001) in young boars when compared to adult boars. Moreover, Clostridium difficile, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Rothia nasimurium remained in liquid-stored semen obtained from young boars, while Corynebacterium sp. and Escherichia coli continued to be identified in samples collected from adult boars. In conclusion, age contributes to the overall quality of fresh as well as liquid-stored boar semen.

AB  - Climate change can affect biological pest control by altering trophic interactions. Elevated carbon dioxide (CO2) concentrations can reduce host plant quality and, in turn, alter herbivore and natural enemy preference and performance. Using the Geisenheim VineyardFACE (free-air carbon dioxide enrichment) facility, we studied plant- and herbivore-mediated bottom-up effects of elevated CO2 concentration on the European grapevine moth, Lobesia botrana, and the parasitoid Trichogramma cacoeciae. Grapevine inflorescences of two cultivars cultivated at ambient or elevated CO2 (aCO(2) and eCO(2): 400 and 480 ppm) in the VineyardFACE were incorporated into L. botrana artificial diet. Eggs laid by the respective adults were parasitized by T. cacoeciae. Egg size and emergence rate of L. botrana as well as parasitism rate, parasitoid emergence rate and egg size preference of T. cacoeciae were evaluated. We observed an indirect grapevine cultivar-dependent bottom-up effect of CO2 on both herbivore and egg parasitoid. Compared to aCO(2), eCO(2) resulted in larger host eggs and higher parasitism rates regarding Riesling-feeding but not regarding Cabernet Sauvignon-feeding L. botrana larvae. Parasitoid emergence rate was higher when L. botrana had fed on Riesling compared to Cabernet Sauvignon-diet. Egg size preference depended on the host's diet: T. cacoeciae preferred larger L. botrana eggs when the larvae had fed on grapevine-containing diet but not when they fed on standard artificial diet. Our results highlight the importance of the host's diet for the parasitoid's preference and performance. They furthermore suggest that the future efficiency of L. botrana-biocontrol by T. cacoeciae will not decrease under elevated CO2 concentrations.

AB  - All vertebrate genomes have been colonized by retroviruses along their evolutionary trajectory. Although endogenous retroviruses (ERVs) can contribute important physiological functions to contemporary hosts, such benefits are attributed to long-term coevolution of ERV and host because germline infections are rare and expansion is slow, and because the host effectively silences them. The genomes of several outbred species including mule deer (Odocoileus hemionus) are currently being colonized by ERVs, which provides an opportunity to study ERV dynamics at a time when few are fixed. We previously established the locus-specific distribution of cervid ERV (CrERV) in populations of mule deer. In this study, we determine the molecular evolutionary processes acting on CrERV at each locus in the context of phylogenetic origin, genome location, and population prevalence. A mule deer genome was de novo assembled from short- and long-insert mate pair reads and CrERV sequence generated at each locus. We report that CrERV composition and diversity have recently measurably increased by horizontal acquisition of a new retrovirus lineage. This new lineage has further expanded CrERV burden and CrERV genomic diversity by activating and recombining with existing CrERV. Resulting interlineage recombinants then endogenize and subsequently expand. CrERV loci are significantly closer to genes than expected if integration were random and gene proximity might explain the recent expansion of one recombinant CrERV lineage. Thus, in mule deer, retroviral colonization is a dynamic period in the molecular evolution of CrERV that also provides a burst of genomic diversity to the host population.

AB  - As a result of climate change, global temperatures are increasing, and water scarcity is on the rise. Soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr] is one of the most important crops in the world due to its importance as food and feed. One of the major limiting factors for soybean production is drought, which can cause up to 80% reduction in yield. Therefore, growers and plant breeders are turning to soybean accessions that demonstrate better water use efficiency (WUE). However, in addition to drought, insect herbivory by soybean looper (Chrysodeixis includens, SBL) and fall armyworm (Spodoptera frugiperda, FAW) can also reduce soybean yield by feeding on foliar and floral organs. Using soybean accessions that differ in their wilting speed, we examined the relationship between physiological traits associated with WUE, and how they affect both herbivore and host plant growth and development. Results showed that both fast- and slow-wilting genotypes displayed strong overcompensation in terms of growth and development, but slow-wilting genotypes produced higher-quality pods and seeds. Regardless of treatment effects, FAW fed at a significantly higher rate than SBL despite being less specialized to feed on soybeans. While fast-wilting plants produced more pods than slow-wilting plants regardless of treatment, slow-wilting plants produced heavier pods with larger and heavier seeds. Collectively, we show that despite fast-wilting plants overcompensating in pod production and growth traits, slow-wilting plants may still be better fit through seed functions.

AB  - This preliminary study investigated the provision of shade on heat stress indicators of South African Mutton Merino (SAMM) and Dormer lambs shortly after birth, during the autumn 2017 and 2018 lambing seasons. Newborn lambs were assessed to determine whether welfare, as assessed by respiratory response and rectal temperature as heat stress indicators, survival and early growth benefitted from the provision of shade. Groups consisting of 4-17 pregnant SAMM and Dormer ewes were randomly allocated to 5-10 paddocks with natural shade from trees and 5-9 paddocks that were directly in the sun with no shade available. The lambs were recorded within 24 h of birth at noon. Climate data were obtained from a nearby weather station. The lambs were also weighed at 12 (SD = 2) days of age at tail-docking. Tree shade had a moderating effect on temperature, resulting in lower maximum daytime and higher minimum night-time temperatures. There was an interaction between a temperature-humidity index (THI) and the treatments (access to shade or no access to shade) for respiration and rectal temperature (P < 0.01). Both traits were relatively unaffected by the THI at values below 77. Unshaded lambs exhibited a pronounced upwards trend following a THI-threshold of 77-78. Tailing weight tended to be higher while lamb survival of live-born lambs to tail-docking was lower in lambs born in shaded paddocks but these trends did not persist to weaning. Shade is needed to enhance animal welfare by alleviating the effect of high THI-values on hot days in an autumn lambing season.

AB  - Simple Summary The European pig industry needs to adapt to growing social interest regarding animal welfare. One of these concerns is the surgical castration of male piglets-a common practice primarily performed to avoid the risk of boar taint released from the meat of uncastrated males, especially during heat treatment. Several EU countries are trying to stop the surgical castration of pigs. The European Commission (EC) strongly supports these activities. One of the two currently feasible alternatives to the production of castrates is the fattening of entire male pigs. It is well known that skatole, one of two main compounds responsible for boar taint, can be eliminated or reduced by feeding additives. Recently, some promising results have been achieved using hydrolysable tannins in the diet of entire males. However, it should be mentioned that these studies focused on the influence of tannins on fattening, carcass value, meat quality and the deposition of androstenone and skatole in adipose tissue but not their influence on sensory characteristics. Therefore, the objective of this study was, in addition to determining the effects of tannins on skatole and androstenone accumulation in fatty tissue, to assess the sensory attributes of pork from entire males after supplementation of the diet with 1-4% tannins. The results showed that 2-4% supplementation of tannins in the feed reduced the accumulation of skatole in fatty tissue. The odour and flavour of pork were not influenced by tannin supplementation, but higher doses of tannins decreased the juiciness and tenderness of pork from entire males but only in men's evaluation. The effect of the sex of the panellists on both of these sensory traits was observed in both the control and tannin-supplemented groups. Boar taint is an unpleasant odour and flavour released during heat treatment of pork from uncastrated male pigs. The two main compounds responsible for boar taint are androstenone and skatole. Androstenone is a steroid hormone formed in the testis during sexual maturity. Skatole is a product of microbial degradation of the amino acid tryptophan in the hindgut of pigs. Both of these compounds are lipophilic, which means that they can be deposited in adipose tissue. Several studies have reported heritability estimates for their deposition from medium (skatole) to high magnitudes (androstenone). In addition to efforts to influence boar taint through genetic selection, much attention has also been paid to reducing its incidence using various feeding strategies. From this point of view, research has focused especially on the reduction in skatole content by supplementation of feed additives into the nutrition of entire male pigs. Promising results have been achieved using hydrolysable tannins in the diet. To date, most studies have investigated the effects of tannins on the production and accumulation of skatole in adipose tissue, intestinal microbiota, growth rate, carcasses and pork quality. Thus, the objective of this study was, in addition to determining the effects of tannins on androstenone and skatole accumulation, to assess the effects of tannins on the sensory traits of meat from entire males. The experiment was performed on 80 young boars-progeny of several hybrid sire lines. Animals were randomly assigned to one control and four experimental groups (each numbering 16). The control group (T0) received a standard diet without any tannin supplementation.
   Experimental groups were supplemented with 1% (T1), 2% (T2), 3% (T3) or 4% (T4) SCWE (sweet chestnut wood extract) rich in hydrolysable tannins (Farmatan). Pigs received this supplement for 40 days prior to slaughter. Subsequently, the pigs were slaughtered, and sensory analysis was applied to evaluate the odour, flavour, tenderness and juiciness of the pork. The results showed a significant effect of tannins on skatole accumulation in adipose tissue (p = 0.052-0.055). The odour and flavour of the pork were not affected by tannins. However, juiciness and tenderness were reduced by higher tannin supplementation (T3-T4) compared to the controls (p < 0.05), but these results were sex-dependent (in favour of men compared to women). Generally, women rated tenderness and juiciness worse than men regardless of the type of diet.

AB  - Flower strips can enhance biodiversity and predation on pests by attracting predators. To improve their effectiveness in natural pest control and crop production, we need to understand the mechanisms that determine their success or failure. We studied the impact of Shechuang (Cnidium monnieri) flower strips on the predation of peanut aphids (Aphis craccivora), a major pest in organic peanut farming. Using spatiotemporal patterns in the abundance of pests and their predators and molecular diet analysis of predators, along with data on crop yield, we found that planting Shechuang flower strips near peanut fields can significantly decrease peanut aphid density and subsequent crop damage. The flower strips supported four species of predator (Hippodamia variegate, Harmonia axyridis, Propylea japonica, and Orius sauteri). Aphid densities decreased up to 20 m into fields with flower strips compared to those without. Molecular analysis confirmed predator consumption of peanut aphids, particularly early in the growing season. Notably, due to a significant yield increase of 796 kg/ha, the overall peanut yield did not decrease despite 4 % of the land being allocated to flower strips. Pod maturity index was negatively correlated to the peanut aphid density, while peanut yield was positively correlated to the pod maturity index. This suggests that reduced aphid density adjacent to flower strips improved pod maturity index, ultimately leading to increased crop yield. Our results indicate that incorporating Shechuang flower strips into peanut production systems could offer effective pest management while potentially boosting crop productivity.

AB  - Q fever represents an important 'neglected zoonosis', with high prevalences recorded across the Middle East region. Among rural desert-dwelling communities in the region, camel milk is largely consumed raw, due to perceptions of dromedaries as a uniquely clean livestock species mentioned in the Qur'an and Islamic hadith, while milk from other livestock species is usually boiled. As a result, camels present a unique public health threat among such communities from milk-borne pathogens, including Coxiella burnetii. In view of this, a cross-sectional study was conducted among dromedary herds in southern Jordan between September 2017 and October 2018, including 404 camels from 121 randomly selected herds. In addition, 510 household members associated with these herds were interviewed regarding potential high-risk practices for zoonotic transmission. Weight adjusted camel population seroprevalence for C. burnetii was 49.6% (95% CI: 44.7-54.5), with evidence of maternally derived immunity in calves & LE;6 months old. Adjusted herd-level prevalence was 76.0% (95% CI 72.7-80.2). It was estimated 30.4% (144/477) of individuals consumed raw milk from infected herds monthly or more. Following multivariable logistic regression analysis, seropositive status in camels was found to be associated with increasing age, high herd tick burdens, keeping the herd together throughout the year including when calving, and owning larger (> 50) sheep and goat flocks, with goats presenting a higher risk than sheep. Racing camel status was found to be protective. Socioculturally appropriate interventions aimed at raising awareness of potential risks associated with drinking raw camel milk, alongside appropriate livestock management interventions, should be considered.

AB  - Climate change is shifting animal distributions. However, the extent to which future global habitats of threatened marine megafauna will overlap existing human threats remains unresolved. Here we use global climate models and habitat suitability estimated from long-term satellite-tracking data of the world's largest fish, the whale shark, to show that redistributions of present-day habitats are projected to increase the species' co-occurrence with global shipping. Our model projects core habitat area losses of >50% within some national waters by 2100, with geographic shifts of over 1,000 km (similar to 12 km yr(-1)). Greater habitat suitability is predicted in current range-edge areas, increasing the co-occurrence of sharks with large ships. This future increase was similar to 15,000 times greater under high emissions compared with a sustainable development scenario. Results demonstrate that climate-induced global species redistributions that increase exposure to direct sources of mortality are possible, emphasizing the need for quantitative climate-threat predictions in conservation assessments of endangered marine megafauna.

AB  - Simple Summary This literature review focused on the reproductive technologies used in female neo-tropical hystricomorphic rodents. Reproductive technologies aid in efficient reproduction, which is important in these species as they are hunted and valued for their meat. Knowledge of the anatomy and physiology would aid in assisted reproductive techniques, thus attention was given to these areas. Within this group of rodent species there were similar characteristics, some of which have been highlighted as well as any unique features. Some reproductive technologies used included colpocytology, ultrasonography, and hormonal analysis. This is the second of two literature reviews that focuses on the female reproductive anatomy and reproductive technologies used in selected neo-tropical hystricomorphic rodents. The rodents chosen included the agouti (Dasyprocta leporina), the capybara (Hydrochoerus hydrochaeris), and the paca (Cuniculus paca). Over seventy references were used, spanning the years 1919-2021. Knowledge of the reproductive tract is important in understanding any unique features, which may affect the use of reproductive technologies. Some unique characteristics common to these species included the presence of a vaginal closure membrane and a lobulated placenta with a vascular sub-placenta. The capybara had hyperpigmentation of the vagina that was unique to each individual, while the agouti and paca had accessory corpora lutea, in addition to the main one. Some reproductive technologies have been used, with attempts at estrous induction and synchronization taking place within the past five years. Even though most work has been done over the past twenty years, there is still a dearth of information.

AB  - The present study evaluated the effects of dietary rumen-protected taurine (RPT) supplementation on ruminal fermentation, hematological parameters, liver function, stress-related hormones, and immune responses in yaks. Eighteen yaks were randomly allocated to three groups: a control group receiving no RPT (CON), a low-dose group receiving 20 g/day (RPT20), and a high-dose group receiving 40 g/day (RPT40). Supplementation with RPT did not significantly affect ruminal pH, microbial protein concentration, ammonia nitrogen, total volatile fatty acids, or the individual volatile fatty acid profiles (p > 0.05). A decreasing trend in red blood cell count was observed (p = 0.050), while no significant changes were detected in white blood cell or platelet indices (p > 0.05). Liver function markers, including albumin, alanine transaminase, aspartate transaminase, and total protein, remained unchanged, although a trend toward altered alkaline phosphatase activity was noted (p = 0.074). No significant effects were observed on acute-phase proteins (serum amyloid A, C-reactive protein) or stress-related hormones (epinephrine, adrenocorticotropic hormone, cortisol) (p > 0.05). Importantly, serum immunoglobulin A and immunoglobulin G levels were significantly increased in response to RPT supplementation (p = 0.029 and p = 0.043, respectively), suggesting enhanced humoral immunity. These findings indicate that RPT may improve immune function in yaks without negatively affecting rumen fermentation or liver health.

AB  - We use data collected by onboard observers to assess the bycatch and immediate mortality of sea turtles in the Canary Current Large Marine Ecosystem (CCLME) and adjoining areas from 2016 to 2021. First, a dataset including 698 sets by drifting longliners, 6300 tows by trawlers and 1029 sets by purse seiners was used to calculate the catch per unit of effort for each species and fleet. Second, effort data compiled by the International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas (ICCAT) and Global Fishing Watch were used to escalate bycatch to the whole fleet. Third, we used post-release mortality rates from the literature to estimate the total number of turtles killed annually and provide a baseline to assess their potential demographic impact. Accordingly, the international fleet of longliners was estimated to cause the annual mortality of 6800 loggerhead turtles Caretta caretta (95% CI: 5825-7628), 740 olive ridley turtles Lepidochelys olivacea (95% CI: 560-926) and smaller numbers of hawksbill Eretmochelys imbricate and green turtles Chelonia mydas. Nothing is known about the post release mortality rate of leatherback turtles, but bycatch was estimated as 3529 leatherback turtles (95% CI: 2463-4889). Regarding bottom trawling, the whole fleet was estimated to case annually the death of 151 green turtles (95% CI: 67-191), 95 loggerhead turtles (95% CI:33-108) and 42 olive ridley turtles (95% CI: 23-87). Finally, purse seiners were estimated to cause negligible mortality to loggerhead and leatherback turtles, the only species bycaught by that fleet. Our study provides comprehensive and precise baseline data on sea turtle bycatch within the three main industrial fishing activities, crucial for understanding the demographic impacts on sea turtle populations. Moreover, it underscores the CCLME as a significant hotspot for marine megafauna bycatch.

AB  - Umbrella species are widely used as conservation strategies for the design of reserves. However, empirical data on their potential effectiveness, particularly in the context of climate change, is limited and inconclusive. Here, we evaluated the potential umbrella effectiveness of the giant panda (Ailuropoda melanoleuca) and its reserve network in the Qinling Mountains for the conservation of sympatric golden snub-nosed monkeys (Rhinopithecus roxellana) under climate change. We modeled their current and future habitat suitability index (HSI) by using the MaxEnt model and analyzed their current and future spatial congruence of HSI. Their suitable areas were also overlaid onto the boundaries and management zones of the reserve network. Subsequently, we designed a series of indices to assess the potential umbrella effectiveness of the reserve network under climate change. Our results indicate that their habitat spatial congruence will remain high in the future. The suitable habitat of giant pandas overlaps substantially with that of golden snub-nosed monkeys in both present and future. Importantly, the umbrella effectiveness of the reserve network for the golden snub-nosed monkey will not decrease. However, there are still some protection gaps shared by them outside the reserve network. Overall, our results demonstrate that the giant panda and its reserve network can serve as an effective umbrella for the golden snub-nosed monkey under climate change, providing theoretical support to the application of umbrella species under climate change.

AB  - Wolf behavioural, spatial, and serological data over 26 years show that wolf territory overlap with areas of high cougar density is a significant predictor of T. gondii infection. Further, infection increases the likelihood that wolves make high-risk decisions such as dispersing and becoming a pack leader.
   Toxoplasma gondii is a protozoan parasite capable of infecting any warm-blooded species and can increase risk-taking in intermediate hosts. Despite extensive laboratory research on the effects of T. gondii infection on behaviour, little is understood about the effects of toxoplasmosis on wild intermediate host behavior. Yellowstone National Park, Wyoming, USA, has a diverse carnivore community including gray wolves (Canis lupus) and cougars (Puma concolor), intermediate and definitive hosts of T. gondii, respectively. Here, we used 26 years of wolf behavioural, spatial, and serological data to show that wolf territory overlap with areas of high cougar density was an important predictor of infection. In addition, seropositive wolves were more likely to make high-risk decisions such as dispersing and becoming a pack leader, both factors critical to individual fitness and wolf vital rates. Due to the social hierarchy within a wolf pack, we hypothesize that the behavioural effects of toxoplasmosis may create a feedback loop that increases spatial overlap and disease transmission between wolves and cougars. These findings demonstrate that parasites have important implications for intermediate hosts, beyond acute infections, through behavioural impacts. Particularly in a social species, these impacts can surge beyond individuals to affect groups, populations, and even ecosystem processes.

AB  - Sexual selection has been proposed as a force that could help maintain the diversity of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) genes in vertebrates. Potential selective mechanisms can be divided into pre-copulatory and post-copulatory, and in both cases, the evidence for occurrence is mixed, especially in natural populations. In this study, we used a large number of parent-offspring trios that were diplotyped for MHC class II genes in a wild population of Soay sheep (Ovis aries) to examine whether there was within-trio post-copulatory selection on MHC class II genes at both the haplotype and diplotype levels. We found there was transmission ratio distortion of one of the eight MHC class II haplotypes (E) which was transmitted less than expected by fathers, and transmission ratio distortion of another haplotype (A) which was transmitted more than expected by chance to male offspring. However, in both cases, these deviations were not significant after correction for multiple tests. In addition, we did not find any evidence of post-copulatory selection at the diplotype level. These results imply that, given known parents, there is no strong post-copulatory selection on MHC class II genes in this population.

AB  - Horse flies and deer flies are important components of habitat for many species, but how logging may alter the communities of biting flies in the boreal forest is largely unexplored. Such knowledge is important to conservation, because biting flies can shape the behaviour and sometimes even the demography of vertebrates in the boreal forest. We compared the abundance and distribution of Tabanidae species in managed boreal forest stands in northwestern Ontario with three harvest histories. Using sweep nets during 2 summers, we collected specimens from forest stands that were young (harvested 20-35 years ago), intermediate (harvested 36-69 years ago), and old (unharvested or harvested & GE; 70 years ago). We tested the hypothesis that greater harassment potential in young stands was due not only to more abundant tabanids, but more abundant obligate blood-feeding (anautogenous) tabanids, which are more persistent in host seeking. We caught 8,895 specimens from 44 species. The oldest stands had the highest species richness, but the lowest abundance of individuals, whereas young stands had the highest relative abundance and the most anautogenous specimens, potentially causing more stress to hosts in young stands. These results demonstrate that forest harvesting may reduce habitat suitability for many large mammals due to an altered tabanid community.

AB  - Herbivory plays a central role in the structure of plant communities. However, there is a scarcity of research that simultaneously examines the impact of herbivory on both vegetative and reproductive traits. Using two species of Malpighiaceae as ecological models, Byrsonima intermedia and Peixotoa tomentosa, we hypothesized that plants that are free from herbivory exhibit greater growth and higher performance in vegetative (number of leaves) and reproductive (number of buds, flowers, and fruits) traits compared to plants subjected to natural herbivory. We conducted an experimental field study regarding the presence or absence of insect herbivores on plants and assessed plant traits for a 5-month interval in a Brazilian savanna area, the Cerrado. Our results revealed that B. intermedia individuals free from herbivory produced 4.3 times more young leaves compared to those subjected to herbivory. Regarding reproductive traits, we observed that the percentage of buds that successfully flowered was significantly higher in P. tomentosa individuals without herbivory than in those experiencing herbivory. Therefore, we suggest that the leaf herbivory may affect the plant's vegetative and reproductive structures differently according to their ontogeny. The production of young leaves and the maturation of flower buds into flowers is lower when leaf herbivory occurs. However, to confirm this pattern, long-term studies should be carried out and consider the chemical compounds of the plants and the nutritional composition of the soil.

AB  - Audio recordings have emerged as a pivotal tool in field observations, enriching environmental monitoring in both the spatial and temporal dimensions. However, the richness and complexity of these recordings pose significant challenges, primarily when extracting specific sound clips from long recordings owing to the presence of ambient noise and other irrelevant sounds. Traditional methods, such as manual extraction or a sliding window over audio segments, hinder practical bioacoustic applications. Therefore, we propose a framework that begins with a robust segmentation method for extracting sound clips that potentially contain deer vocalizations. This segmentation method relies on acoustic anomaly detection and can markedly improve computational efficiency, facilitating deployment in environments with limited resources. Subsequently, the isolated clips were classified into deer and non-deer categories using machine learning models. Our investigation assessed three state-of-theart deep learning models, ResNet50, MobileNetV2, and EfficientNet-B2, considering various hyperparameter configurations to optimize the performance. We utilized 3842 clips from two sites, Oze National Park and Taki, for training and testing. The outcomes demonstrated that all models exhibited comparable performances, with median accuracies of 98.3 % and 92.9 % during the validation and testing stages, respectively. However, no single model outperformed the others across all the evaluation metrics. For instance, ResNet50 in different configurations led to the best accuracy, F1 score, precision, and specificity, whereas MobileNetV2 had the best recall. Therefore, we adopted a consensus-based ensemble scoring system in which an audio clip was classified as a deer call when at least two of three models concurred in their classification to enhance the reliability of our classifications. Our findings demonstrated that the Ensemble approach significantly enhanced the classification performance, achieving an accuracy of 99.2 % in the test stage. The proposed approach was successfully deployed during the deer rutting seasons in Oze and Taki in 2019 and 2021, respectively. We gained invaluable insights into deer behavior by analyzing deer calls' frequency, timing, and duration. Additionally, the spatial distribution of deer calls in Taki enabled us to detect a breach in the city's protective fencing and an association between the spatial patterns of deer calls and crop damage in the two fields. We aimed to draw a comprehensive picture of deer activity, which has significant implications for both conservation efforts and understanding animal behavior in various habitats. The insights gathered from this research contribute to the scientific understanding of deer behavior and serve as a foundation for future studies and conservation initiatives. By incorporating advanced machine learning models into environmental monitoring, we have paved the way for more data-driven approaches in wildlife research.

AB  - Anaplasma phagocytophilum is a tick-borne pathogen that has been detected in many tick and vertebrate species. It is among the most widespread tick-borne pathogens in animals in Europe. The bacterium can be genetically divided into four ecotypes, which are linked to distinct but overlapping host species. However, knowledge about the transmission dynamics of the enzootic cycles of the different ecotypes is limited. Here, we quantified the link between the ecotypes of A. phagocytophilum, the different life stages of the tick Ixodes ricinus, and vertebrate host groups through a meta-analysis. We extracted data on the mean I. ricinus burden and the A. phagocytophilum infection prevalence in both hosts and feeding I. ricinus from 197 papers on 77 wildlife species. With this information, we modeled the relative importance of different host taxonomic groups for the circulation of the different ecotypes of A. phagocytophilum in a theoretical assemblage of hosts with varying presence of red deer (Cervus elaphus) and densities of small mammals. We showed that the composition of the vertebrate community affects the relative abundance of different ecotypes of A. phagocytophilum in the different life stages of I. ricinus. The presence of red deer is likely to increase the infection prevalence of Ecotype 1 in ticks, while small mammal densities drive the prevalence in ticks of mainly Ecotype 3, and to a lesser extent Ecotype 1. In Europe, vertebrate communities are changing, with an increase in red deer abundance and changes in the population dynamics of small mammals. Our results suggest that these changes could imply an increase in the circulation of A. phagocytophilum and thus an increase in the risk for public and veterinary health.

AB  - To obtain proper estimates of wildlife abundance by harvest-based models (HBMs), an understanding of the model structure and data properties is required. Otherwise, there may be a risk of failure to obtaining adequate estimates. In this study, we estimated the abundance of sika deer using several spatially fine-scale HBMs with different structures and aimed to clarify the effects of the model structure and data quality on estimates. We used monitoring data collected by the Gifu Prefectural Government and other data collected by the authors. Four HBMs were constructed according to the combinations of the model structure (considering overdispersion in the observation models) and data (with or without additional observation data), and their parameters were estimated. The results showed that among the four HBMs, reasonable deer abundance was estimated by two HBMs in which overdispersion was considered in the observation models of the less precision data only. As the parameters failed to converge in the other two HBMs in which overdispersion was considered in all observation models, the abundance would be overestimated. Thus, our results confirmed that understanding the model structure and data properties was essential for obtaining proper estimates of wildlife abundance from currently available data with HBM.

AB  - Toxoplasma gondii is a zoonotic protozoan parasite capable of infecting possibly all warm-blooded animals including humans, and is one of the most widespread zoonotic pathogens known. Free-ranging wildlife can be valuable sentinels for oocyst contaminated environments, as well as a potential source for human foodborne infection with T. gondii. Here we aimed to determine the sero-prevalence of T. gondii in Danish wild deer pop-ulations and examine risk factors associated with increased exposure to the parasite. Blood samples were collected from 428 cervids (87 fallow deer (Dama dama), 272 red deer (Cervus elaphus), 55 roe deer (Capreolus capreolus) and 14 sika deer (Cervus Nippon) from 23 hunting sites in Denmark. The animals were shot during the hunting season 2017/2018, and screened for antibodies against T. gondii using a commercial ELISA kit. One hundred and five (24.5%) cervids were sero-positive. Sero-prevalence was significantly different between species (p < 0.05), with odds of sero-positivity being 4.5 times higher in roe deer than fallow deer, and 3.0 times higher in red deer than in fallow deer. A significant increase in sero-prevalence with age was observed, driven by a significant increase in risk in adult red deer compared to calves (OR: 13.22; 95% CI: 5.96-33.7). The only other significant risk factor associated with wild cervid T. gondii sero-positivity was fencing, with the highest exposure associated with deer from non-fenced hunting areas (OR: 2.21; 95% CI: 1.05-4.99). This study documented a widespread exposure to T. gondii in Danish cervids. Therefore the meat of the wild deer, in particular from roe deer and red deer, should be considered a significant risk of T. gondii infections to humans, if not properly cooked. Further, molecular studies to confirm the presence of infective parasitic stages in the muscles of deer used for consumption is recommended.

AB  - BACKGROUND Goat milk can be important for human nutrition because of its nutritional value, which may be attributed to its richness in protein, lactose, fat, and other bioactive components. This study compared the diversity and composition of gut microbiota in response to whole goat milk and its major fractions (milk fat, casein, milk whey, whey protein, and whey supernatant). Goat milk, its major fractions, and sterile distilled water (for the control group) were administered to mice intragastrically, and gut microbiota were compared in these groups using metagenomic analysis. RESULTS We observed distinct patterns of gut microbiota from different diet groups. The sample distance heatmap showed that, compared with other goat milk fractions, gut microbiota in the casein group was more similar to that in the whole goat-milk group. The relative abundance of the genus Lactobacillus increased significantly after whole goat-milk treatment; the milk whey fraction increased the abundance of Blautia; milk fat and milk whey related fractions treatment promoted the population of Bacteroides. The network analysis showed that genera Lactobacillus and Lactococcus were negatively associated with Helicobacter and Acinetobacter, respectively. CONCLUSION Fractions of goat milk could contain different gut microbiota from whole goat milk. Consumption of certain goat milk fractions could increase the ingestion of beneficial bacteria and inhibit the growth of some pathogenic bacteria. Our results could provide the basis for the research into and development of goat-milk based functional foods. (c) 2021 Society of Chemical Industry.

AB  - Ecosystem functions underpin productivity and key services to humans, such as food provision. However, as the severity of environmental stressors intensifies, it is becoming increasingly unclear if, and to what extent, critical functions and services can be sustained. This issue is epitomised on coral reefs, an ecosystem at the forefront of environmental transitions. We provide a functional profile of a coral reef ecosystem, linking time-series data to quantified processes. The data reveal a prolonged collapse of ecosystem functions in this previously resilient system. The results suggest that sediment accumulation in algal turfs has led to a decline in resource yields to herbivorous fishes and a decrease in fish-based ecosystem functions, including a collapse of both fish biomass and productivity. Unfortunately, at present, algal turf sediment accumulation is rarely monitored nor managed in coral reef systems. Our examination of functions through time highlights the value of directly assessing functions, their potential vulnerability, and the capacity of algal turf sediments to overwhelm productive high-diversity coral reef ecosystems.

AB  - Between 1996-2012, two outbreaks of animal tuberculosis were noted in the free-living European bison population in the Bieszczady Mountains, Poland. As the European bison is an endangered species and is particularly susceptible to tuberculosis, not to mention a national icon, the decision was made to test all deceased bison for TB in Poland. The screened bison were obtained by elimination due to poor health or natural death. A total of 159 animals have been examined over the last 10 years. Mycobacterium bovis and Mycobacterium avium spp. hominisuis were identified in two different herds. The isolation of M. bovis from European bison is the first case described in Poland. Previously, the only causative agent of tuberculosis identified in European bison in Poland, both in the wild and in captive herds, was Mycobacterium caprae. In the period 1996-2012, two outbreaks of animal tuberculosis were noted in the population of free-living European bison (Bison bonasus caucasicus) in the Bieszczady Mountains, Southern Poland. As the European bison is an endangered species and particularly susceptible to tuberculosis, not to mention a national icon, the decision was made to test all deceased bison for TB in Poland. The screened bison were obtained by elimination due to poor health or natural death. A total of 159 European bison have been examined over the last 10 years. The individuals came from four regions of Poland (Bialowie.za Forest, Bieszczady Mountains, Borecka Forest, Knyszy ' nska Forest), not only from the area where tuberculosis is still endemic. Mycobacterium bovis and Mycobacterium avium spp. hominisuis were identified in two different herds. The isolation of M. bovis from European bison was the first case described in Poland. So far, the only causative agent of tuberculosis identified in European bison in Poland, both in the wild and in captive herds, was Mycobacterium caprae. The isolated M. bovis spoligotype has not previously been registered in international spoligotype databases so far. The obtained results highlight the need to monitor TB in European bison in Poland.

AB  - Poverty is multi-dimensional global challenge that impedes individual and community capacities to satisfy basic needs. These capacities are shaped by locally configured institutional and biophysical processes that are often hidden from external researchers and practitioners. To explore this worldwide aspect, we adopt participatory rural appraisal (PRA) methods to expose barriers to implementing livelihood strategies to address poverty in Ethiopia's upper Blue Nile basin, where 85 % of the population are subsistence farmers reliant on local ecosystem services (ES). We identify local barriers to poverty alleviation in three steps. First, we classify major ES-livelihood interrelationships among communities of Debre Mawi catchment in upper Blue Nile. Secondly we assess ongoing struggles in these interrelations using combined biophysical and social assessment criteria to evaluate how poverty relates to current patterns of ES management. The analysis identifies complex interdependencies between livelihoods and regulating (crop pest controls), provisioning (water, land, and feed availability, soil fertility) and cultural (top-down ES management, population growth) ES that create bottlenecks to effectively 'lock in' poverty. Thirdly, we identify potential new ES management strategies, focused on dry season water availability. We conduct participatory field experiments on rooftop water harvesting to show this is a promising approach for increasing water availability to enhance agricultural production. Depending on the rooftop area, our modelling suggests that farmers can improve household income by US$136- 14,876 from 5 months beef fattening and US$69-7704 from 4 months sheep fattening. Except these specific livelihood strategies, the findings are replicable to the world's ES-dependent regions.

AB  - This account presents information on all aspects of the biology of Hammarbya paludosa (L.) Kuntze (bog orchid, bog adder's-mouth orchid) (Malaxis paludosa (L.) Sw., Ophrys paludosa L.), that are relevant to understanding its ecological characteristics and behaviour. The main topics are presented within the standard framework of the Biological Flora of Britain and Ireland: distribution, habitat, communities, responses to biotic factors, responses to environment, structure and physiology, phenology, floral and seed characters, herbivores and disease, history and conservation. Hammarbya paludosa is a small bisexual perennial forb. It occurs in open habitats in bogs, mires and heaths as well as semi-shaded open woodland and, in some areas, in shaded coniferous forest. It is found in a few locations in the southern England (the New Forest, Dorset, Devon and Cornwall), in Cumbria and Northumberland, and in western counties in Wales. It is rare in Ireland but wide spread but very local in Scotland. H. paludosa has a Holarctic circumboreal range. Ninety per cent of known locations are recorded in Northern Europe and the British Isles. Hammarbya paludosa occurs in Sphagnum, other mosses and bare peat, overlying a variety of superficial deposits and sedimentary, metamorphic and igneous rocks. The pH of the rooting substrates ranges from acidic to neutral and slightly alkaline. Its nutrient status is oligotrophic, although occasionally mesotrophic, and very rarely eutrophic. It grows well in conditions of consistent lateral flow of water in the substratum. Hammarbya paludosa is visited by small insects of the order Diptera. Two species of gnats are recorded as orchid pollinators: Phronia digitata and Sciara thomae. It produces a small amount of nectar but is often considered as non-rewarding. The seeds are dust-like, dispersed by wind and water and the species has a short-term seed bank. Tiny bulbils (propagules) are formed on the leaf margins. They are dispersed by water. Hammarbya paludosa has declined in Britain since the late 19th century primarily due to drainage of its mire habitats in lowland regions of southern and eastern England and Wales. The decline slowed down by the 2000s, and new locations have been found in Scotland and Ireland.

AB  - Herbivory is a major fitness pressure for plants and a key driver of crop losses in agroecosystems. Dense monocultures are expected to favor specialist herbivorous insects, particularly those who primarily consume crop species; yet, levels and types of herbivory are not uniform within regional cropping systems. It is essential to determine which local and regional ecological factors drive variation in herbivory in order to support functional agroecosystems that rely less on chemical inputs. Crops in the genus Cucurbita host a suite of both generalist and specialist herbivores that inflict significant damage, yet little is known about the relative contribution of these herbivores to variation in herbivory and how local- and landscape -scale Cucurbita resource concentrations, management practices, and natural enemies mediate this relationship. In this study, we tested whether three foundational ecological hypotheses influenced Cucurbita herbivory across 20 pumpkin fields in the semi -arid Southern High Plains Region of Texas. We used generalized linear mixed models and confirmatory path analysis to assess whether the Density -dependent Herbivory Hypothesis, Resource Concentration Hypothesis, or the Natural Enemies Hypothesis, could explain variation in Cucurbita herbivory and insect dynamics in the context of conventional agronomic practices. We found that herbivory increased over time, indicating that herbivores were causing sustained damage throughout the growing season. We also found that fields with higher local Cucurbita resources had lower herbivory, suggesting a resource dilution effect. Natural enemy communities were more abundant and taxonomically rich in sites with greater generalist herbivore abundance, though predator abundance declined over time, indicating that late -season crop fields are most at risk given high herbivory and low natural enemy -based control. Our findings also suggest that while local resource availability may drive the abundance and richness of arthropod communities, additional agronomic and phenological information is needed to anticipate herbivory risk in an agriculturally dominated landscape.

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic has brought attention to the need for Indonesia to prepare for future food challenges. The government is focusing on developing underdeveloped areas, including peatlands, which have great potential for integrated farming systems. Bangsal is a village with peat swamp lands that serve as a source of food in OKI Regency, South Sumatera. During the dry season, the land is used for agriculture, while during the rainy season, it is used for fisheries. This paper analyzes (a) the village-based farming patterns in peatland areas, (b) the institutional framework of peatland farmer groups in Bangsal, and (c) the strategy for sustainable peatland utilization for food security. The study used both qualitative and quantitative data analysis methods. The research showed that the role of the Ulak Kuto Mandiri effectively and efficiently increased community income and food self-sufficiency. Integrated farming systems, including swamp buffalo farming, swamp fish farming, and swamp agriculture, optimally and sustainably increased the potential of peatlands. Sustainable peatland utilization through integrated farming systems technically preserves the peatland ecosystem from land conversion, is economically feasible, increases the income of farmers, livestock breeders, and local cultural traditions, and empowers women in farming activities. It also reduces forest fire risks, chemical fertilizer and pesticide use, and increases peatland productivity.

AB  - Eriophyoid mites (Acari: Eriophyoidea) are among the smallest of terrestrial arthropods and the most species-rich group of herbivorous mites with a high host specificity. However, knowledge of their species diversity has been impeded by the difficulty of their morphological differentiation. This study assembles a DNA barcode reference library that includes 1850 mitochondrial COI sequences which provides coverage for 45% of the 930 species of eriophyoid mites known from China, and for 37 North American species. Sequence analysis showed a clear barcode gap in nearly all species, reflecting the fact that intraspecific divergences averaged 0.97% versus a mean of 18.51% for interspecific divergences (minimum nearest-neighbour distances) in taxa belonging to three families. Based on these results, we used DNA barcoding to explore the species diversity of eriophyoid mites as well as their host interactions. The 1850 sequences were assigned to 531 barcode index numbers (BINs). Analyses examining the correspondence between these BINs and species identifications based on morphology revealed that members of 45 species were assigned to two or more BINs, resulting in 1.16 times more BINs than morphospecies. Richness projections suggest that over 2345 BINs occurred at the sampled locations. Host plant analysis showed that 89% of these mites (BINs) attack only one or two congeneric host species, but the others have several hosts. Furthermore, host-mite network analyses demonstrate that eriophyoid mites are high host-specific, and modularity is high in plant-mite networks. By creating a highly effective identification system for eriophyoid mites in the Barcode of Life Data Systems database (BOLD), DNA barcoding will advance our understanding of the diversity of eriophyoid mites and their host interactions.

AB  - Aim: Literature and fossil records document the long-term occurrence sites of large herbivorous mammals in China. These sites exhibit spatially uneven distribution, potentially reflecting constraints on the dispersal of large herbivorous mammals imposed by stable geomorphic factors. In this study, we examine the impact of landforms on the dispersal of four taxa of large herbivorous mammals across China. Location: China. Taxon: Rhinocerotidae, Elephantidae, Equus, Camelus. Methods: We employed the Omniscape algorithm to create a connectivity model from geomorphic data (slope, elevation and ground cover), assessing the extent to which Chinese landforms obstruct large herbivore dispersal. This model utilised historical distribution sites to delineate barrier strips. Results: Dispersal barriers show regional variation, segmenting China into four distinct regions. The Tibetan Plateau, Taklamakan Desert and Qinling Mountains constitute Region A, presenting the most significant barrier. Region B, characterised by dense, continuous mountain ranges and arid landforms in Northwest China, poses a secondary barrier. Region C, with fragmented mountain ranges in Southwest China, exhibits a diminished barrier effect. Region D features the eastern coastal plains with minimal geomorphic constraints. Conclusions: The edge mountains of the Tibetan Plateau form a continuous barrier strip. The Qinling-Taihang-Yanshan mountain chain constitutes a discontinuous barrier strip. This is because the mountain chain belongs to two geological structural units and is eroded by rivers, creating many corridors.

AB  - Variation in age of primiparity is important for population dynamics and wildlife management because it can affect population growth. Using a novel technique based on the trade-off between annual horn growth and reproduction, we estimated the age of primiparity for 2274 female mountain goats (Oreamnos americanus (Blainville, 1816)) harvested across British Columbia, Canada, from 1976 to 2019. We then investigated spatio-temporal variation in the probability that harvested females were primiparous when aged 3, 4, or 5 years and older using Bayesian ordinal regressions. We found that the probability of primiparity at 3 years decreased over time in nearly all mountain ranges. In the Coastal Mountain range, however, the probability of primiparity at age 3 significantly increased. These results suggest that the large coastal populations of mountain goats could be more resilient to harvest than other populations in British Columbia, which may be experiencing environmental effects promoting later primiparity. Models predicting age of primiparity from annual growth measures are a valuable tool for wildlife management and could help conservation of many species.

AB  - The biomedical literature has consistently highlighted that long-term elevation of glucocorticoids might impair immune functions. However, patterns are less clear in wild animals. Here, we re-explored the stress-immunity relationship considering the potential effects of behavioural profiles. Thirteen captive roe deer (Capreolus capreolus) were monitored over an eight-week period encompassing two capture events. We assessed how changes in baseline faecal cortisol metabolite (FCM) concentrations following a standardized capture protocol and an immune challenge using anti-rabies vaccination affected changes in 13 immune parameters of innate and adaptive immunity, and whether these changes in baseline FCM levels and immune parameters related to behavioural profiles. We found that individuals with increased baseline FCM levels also exhibited increased immunity and were characterized by more reactive behavioural profiles (low activity levels, docility to manipulation and neophilia). Our results suggest that the immunity of large mammals may be influenced by glucocorticoids, but also behavioural profiles, as it is predicted by the pace-of-life syndrome hypothesis. Our results highlight the need to consider covariations between behaviour, immunity and glucocorticoids in order to improve our understanding of the among-individual variability in the stress-immunity relationships observed in wildlife, as they may be underpinned by different life-history strategies.

AB  - Baited camera surveys are often used to study white-tailed deer Odocoileus virginianus populations and inform harvest decisions. Surveys are commonly conducted in late summer or early fall when deer populations are expected to be segregated sexually, whereas hunting seasons typically occur during the breeding season when sexes are likely to be mixed. However, the effects of socio-sexual shifts in space use on pre-season camera surveys has not been evaluated. We conducted a baited survey before the hunting season followed by passive camera surveys during the hunting season on three properties in southwestern Georgia, USA. We collected 51 106 images of deer before and during the hunting season from baited and passive cameras. Based on interpolated maps of camera detections, the populations were highly segregated during the September baited surveys. In contrast, subsequent passive camera surveys indicated high overlap of males and females during the breeding months, with males shifting their distribution towards females. Because most management units on private lands are substantially smaller than our camera arrays (typically < 1000 ha), our results suggest that pre-season surveys may not accurately reflect the population available for harvest during the hunting season. Establishment of cooperative management programs among adjacent landholdings may improve management effectiveness. In addition, managers should anticipate shifts in male distributions during the breeding months and real-time analytical approaches could be developed with the use of cellular-based cameras to rapidly alter harvest objectives.

AB  - The microbiome is critical to an organism's phenotype, and its composition is shaped by, and a driver of, eco-evolutionary interactions. We investigated how host ancestry, habitat and diet shape gut microbial composition in a mammalian hybrid zone between Neotoma lepida and N. bryanti that occurs across an ecotone between distinct vegetation communities. We found that habitat is the primary determinant of diet, while host genotype is the primary determinant of the gut microbiome-a finding further supported by intermediate microbiome composition in first-generation hybrids. Despite these distinct primary drivers, microbial richness was correlated with diet richness, and individuals that maintained higher dietary richness had greater gut microbial community stability. Both relationships were stronger in the relative dietary generalist of the two parental species. Our findings show that host ancestry interacts with dietary habits to shape the microbiome, ultimately resulting in the phenotypic plasticity that host-microbial interactions allow.

AB  - Wildlife-vehicle collisions (WVCs) are a critical threat to biodiversity and human safety. To implement WVC mitigation measures where most needed, we need to link models predicting the probability of the presence of species, at large spatial scales, with the likelihood of occurring collisions along roads. Here, we propose a framework for the prioritization of road sections for implementing mitigation measures using ecologically based information. Within this framework, we first model the likelihood of WVC occurrence for focal species in road vicinity areas. We then use spatial prioritization tools to select road sections that entail a higher probability of WVC across the focal species using user-defined criteria for weighting species records. We applied this framework to Mato Grosso do Sul state (Brazil), using systematic information on WVC collected over 3 years along ca. 2000 km of roads. We focused on the WVC involving three large mammals commonly road-killed therein, which represent a threat to humans when involved in WVC: the lowland tapir Tapirus terrestris, giant anteater Myrmecophaga tridactyla and capybara Hydrochoerus hydrochaeris. We were able to identify road sections (< 10% of the road network) that should be prioritized for implementing mitigation actions, which could significantly reduce the number of WVCs. However, the large extent of the road network classified as a priority for mitigation suggests the need to engage the public and private sectors in the early stages of the decision-making process, in order to reach a consensus on the prioritization. Our framework may improve the environmental licensing process, namely by guiding where mitigation measures should be implemented first.

AB  - The early social environment an animal experiences may have pervasive effects on its behaviour. The social decision-making network (SDMN), consisting of interconnected brain nuclei from the forebrain and midbrain, is involved in the regulation of behaviours during social interactions. In species with advanced sociality such as cooperative breeders, offspring are exposed to a large number and a great diversity of social interactions every day of their early life. This diverse social environment may have life-long consequences on the development of several neurophysiological systems within the SDMN, although these effects are largely unknown. We studied these life-long effects in a cooperatively breeding fish, Neolamprologus pulcher, focusing on the expression of genes involved in the monoaminergic and stress response systems in the SDMN. N. pulcher fry were raised until an age of 2 months either with their parents, subordinate helpers and same-clutch siblings (+F), or with same-clutch siblings only (-F). Analysis of the expression of glucocorticoid receptor, mineralocorticoid receptor, corticotropin releasing factor, dopamine receptors 1 and 2, serotonin transporter and DNA methyltransferase 1 genes showed that early social experiences altered the neurogenomic profile of the preoptic area. Moreover, the dopamine receptor 1 gene was up-regulated in the preoptic area of -F fish compared to +F fish. -F fish also showed up-regulation of GR1 expression in the dorsal medial telencephalon (functional equivalent to the basolateral amygdala), and in the dorsolateral telencephalon (functional equivalent to the hippocampus). Our results suggest that early social environment has life-long effects on the development of several neurophysiological systems within the SDMN.

AB  - Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) and herbivore insects are essential elements of ecosystems. They can influence each other on their common host plant. AMF support the plant growth by protecting against herbivore insect stresses. Opuntia ficus-indica (L.) miller is a multipurpose species which is under serious threat by cochineal insect (Dactylopius coccus (C.). The AMF and cochineal insect interaction on O. ficus-indica plants were not studied. This paper analyzed AMF spore density and root colonization of O. ficus-indica population in cochineal-infested and uninfested cultivated areas. Soil depth, season, and altitude were main environmental factors for the result observations. Soil and root samples were collected from the rhizosphere of O. ficus-indica plants. AMF spore density and root colonization were higher in uninfested plants than cochineal infested. AMF genus significantly varied along altitude and soil depth. Root colonization was higher during the rainy season than dry season, while spore density was lower in the rainy season. In the cochineal infested populations, spore density did not significantly varied with seasons. Spore density and root colonization were significantly higher on the upper soil depth than lower depth. Rhizosphere soil properties varied with altitude and soil depth. Soil available phosphorus (AVP) was significantly higher in the cochineal-infested populations. AVP showed significant negative correlation with mycorrhizal colonization. AMF-cochineal interaction in O. ficus-indica populations needs to be experimentally tested to understand the facilitative role of AMF to increase the performance of O. ficus-indica plants and to defend against the infestation of cochineal.

AB  - Defensive traits are hypothesized to benefit prey by reducing predation risk from a focal predator but come at a cost to the fitness of the prey. Variation in the expression of defensive traits is seen among individuals within the same population, and in the same individual in response to changes in the environment (i.e., phenotypically plastic responses). It is the relative magnitude of the cost and benefit of the defensive trait that underlies the defensive trait expression and its consequences to the community. However, whereas the cost has received much attention in ecological research, the benefit is seldom examined. Even in a defensive trait as extensively studied as vigilance, there are few studies of the purported benefit of the behavior, namely that vigilance enhances survival. We examined whether prey vigilance increased survival and quantified that benefit in a natural system, with white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) experiencing unmanipulated levels of predation risk from Florida panther (Puma concolor coryi). Deer that spent more time vigilant (as measured by head position using camera trap data) had a higher probability of survival. Indeed, an individual deer that was vigilant 75% of the time was more than three times as likely to be killed by panthers over the course of a year than a deer that was vigilant 95% of the time. Our results therefore show that within-population variation in the expression of a defensive trait has profound consequences for the benefit it confers. Our results provide empirical evidence supporting a long-held but seldom-tested hypothesis, that vigilance is a behavior that reduces the probability of predation and quantifies the benefit of this defensive trait. Our work furthers an understanding of the net effects of a trait on prey fitness and predator-prey interactions, within-population variation in traits, and predation risk effects.

AB  - At unsustainable rates and in illegal contexts, the wild meat trade is a driver of species extinction; it can also threaten ecosystem services, local food security and contribute to the risk of zoonotic disease spread. The restaurant and catering sectors are understudied groups in conservation, both with regards to the legal and illegal wild meat trade and particularly in urban areas. Restaurateurs are key actors between wild meat consumers and suppliers and thus play a central role in the supply chain. This study applied a crime science hot product approach to characterize: (a) restaurateur perceptions of urban wild meat consumption; (b) wildlife species most at risk in the urban wild meat trade; and (c) the differences between restaurants in Kinshasa (Democratic Republic of the Congo) and Brazzaville (Republic of the Congo). Through focus groups in both cities, participants affirmed that in urban centers wild meat is considered a luxury item and sign of wealth. Monkeys were seen as a hot product in both cities, but we found a greater variety of hot wild meat products in Brazzaville. When looking at the differences between the restaurant tier levels, middle-tiered restaurants identified pangolin and antelopes as being hot products, rather than monkeys as with upper and lower-tiered restaurants. By applying a hot product analysis, we identified the wild meat groups most likely to be targeted by the urban wild meat trade. Findings herein offer novel opportunities to better tailor and prioritize conservation interventions against illegal trade using design against crime or other crime prevention strategies.

AB  - Climate change is reshaping agriculture and insect biodiversity worldwide. With rising temperatures, many insect species are expected to be pushed beyond their current thermal limits, and losses related to herbivory and diseases transmitted by them will be experienced in new regions. Here, we propose that climate change's impact on agriculture can be forecast by studying migratory leafhoppers. From 2021 to 2022, we measured leafhopper numbers in eastern Canada's strawberry fields to test our hypothesis, observing that leafhopper species and phytoplasma disease-affected strawberry plants both doubled, trends influenced by temperature changes. A further post-insecticide application study reveals that insecticides used by strawberry growers could be ineffective in controlling leafhopper populations, possibly due to changes observed in their microbiome. Our research provides evidence that leafhoppers are sensitive to the effects of climate change, making them ideal markers to research the effect of climate change on agriculture.

AB  - With the advent of automated recording units, bioacoustic monitoring has become a popular tool for the collection of long-term data across extensive landscapes. Such methods involve two main components: hardware for audio data acquisition and software for analysis. In the acoustic monitoring of threatened species, a species-specific framework is often essential. Jerdon's courser Rhinoptilus bitorquatus is a Critically Endangered nocturnal bird endemic to a small region of the Eastern Ghats of India, last reported in 2008. Here we describe a reproducible and scalable acoustic detection framework for the species, comparing several commonly available hardware and detection methods and using existing software. We tested this protocol by collecting 24,349 h of data during 5 months. We analysed the data with two commercially available sound analysis programmes, following an analysis pipeline created for this species. Although we did not detect vocalizations of Jerdon's courser, this study provides a framework using a combination of hardware and software for future research that other conservation practitioners can implement. Vocal mimicry can aid or confound in detection and we highlight the potential role of mimicry in the detection of such threatened species. This species-specific acoustic detection framework can be scaled and tailored to monitor other species.

AB  - The fish families Scaridae and Acanthuridae are herbivorous that control algal growth on corals. Their exclusion due to illegal fishing and coastal development quickly leads to the dominance of macroalgae on the reef. To estimate the density and intensity of grazing of Scaridae and Acanthuridae and their relationship with macroalgae cover, two terraces were selected in the Guanahacabibes National Park (PNG) and one in Havana (LH), the latter with high andropic degradation. Video-quadrants of 1 m(2) were used to obtain the density of fish (individuals/m(2)) and grazing intensity (bites/5 minutes*m(2)) and quadrants of 25x25 cm for the relative abundance of macroalgae. Ten species were identified, Scaridae predominated in PNG and Acanthuridae in LH. The loss of Scaridae in LH implies that Acanthuridae represents an excess of a functional group that does not provide the bare substrate for coral recruitment. There was a strong positive correlation between the density and intensity of grazing of Scaridac with Halimeda, since in PNG this alga is favored and constitutes a recurrent and efficient food for Scaridae. In LH, eutrophication bioindicator algae such as Stypopodium predominated and only showed a positive correlation with Acanthuridae. These fish consume the epiphytes on Stypopodium, and their grazing rates are higher, which contributes to the cultivation of turf algae, strong competitors for space with corals. Hence the importance of presenting more equitable communities with different functional groups of herbivorous fish that contribute to a more effective control of macroalgac.

AB  - The recent energy crisis has increased the cost of fertilization for olive growers. This is why alternative nutrient sources, such as manures and other organic materials, could be used to sustain olive production within the framework of sustainable agriculture, by decreasing chemical fertilization inputs. A greenhouse pot experiment was established with a marl soil substrate that was modified with three amendments (sheep manure, or SM; litter from evergreen broadleaf species, or EBLS, such as Quercus sp.; their combination, i.e., SM + EBLS) and a control soil (no application of amendments) to investigate their influence on the nutrition, physiology, and leaf sugar concentrations of olive plants. Plant growth was not significantly affected by the amendments, while the lowest leaf N, K, and Zn concentrations were determined in the control soil. Significantly higher photosynthetic rate was determined in the SM + EBLS, compared to SM. Significantly higher intercellular CO2 was found in the EBLS and SM + EBLS, while significantly higher intrinsic water use efficiency (WUEi) was found in the SM + EBLS and the control. Significantly higher translocated sugar content was recorded in the SM + EBLS compared to the control. Overall, it was concluded that the optimum treatment was SM + EBLS, i.e., the combinational application of SM and EBLS. However, multi-year research under field conditions is necessary to draw more stable conclusions about the beneficial role of organic amendments on the nutrition and physiology of olive trees.

AB  - China promotes nature-based solutions (NbS) as key approaches to addressing climate change, ecosystem damage, and biodiversity loss. However, indigenous and local knowledge (ILK), which is recognized by international scholars as an essential element of successful NbS, has not been thoroughly studied in the Chinese context. By conducting a comprehensive review of Chinese central governmental policies and semi-structured interviews with typical cases, this study finds diversified sources of ILK and five pathways of ILK integration, including education, supervision, participation, knowledge preservation, and knowledge adoption. An increasing emphasis on community engagement has been driven by central policies, such as ecological civilization, carbon peaking, and carbon neutrality goals. From a practical perspective, consistent core ideas of ILK exist in selected typical Chinese cases and studies in other countries, namely co-existence and reciprocity with nature. While supportive central policies can set the scene, ILK integration could not be realized without local governmental endorsement, context-based implementation, and long-term multi-stakeholder participation. Furthermore, this study also figures out a potential deficiency in terms of realizing effective ILK integration in mainstream and conventional practices, which can be further investigated by future studies.

AB  - Livers of caribou and reindeer (Rangifer tarandus) from Canada (n = 146), Greenland (n = 30), Svalbard (n = 7), and Sweden (n = 60) were analyzed for concentrations of eight perfluoroalkyl carboxylic acids and four perfluoroalkane sulfonic acids. In Canadian caribou, PFNA (range < 0.01-7.4 ng/g wet weight, ww) and PFUnDA (<0.01-5.6 ng/g ww) dominated, whereas PFOS predominated in samples from South Greenland, Svalbard, and Sweden, although the highest concentrations were found in caribou from Southwest Greenland (up to 28 ng/g ww). We found the highest median concentrations of all PFAS except PFHxS in Akia-Maniitsoq caribou (Southwest Greenland, PFOS 7.2-19 ng/g ww, median 15 ng/g ww). The highest concentrations of sigma PFAS were also found in Akia-Maniitoq caribou (101 ng/g ww) followed by the nearby Kangerlussuaq caribou (45 ng/g ww), where the largest airport in Greenland is situated, along with a former military base. Decreasing trends in concentrations were seen for PFOS in the one Canadian and three Swedish populations. Furthermore, PFNA, PFDA, PFUnDA, PFDoDA, and PFTrDA showed decreasing trends in Canada's Porcupine caribou between 2005 and 2016. In Sweden, PFHxS increased in the reindeer from Norrbotten between 2003 and 2011. The reindeer from Vasterbotten had higher concentrations of PFNA and lower concentrations of PFHxS in 2010 compared to 2002. Finally, we observed higher concentrations in 2010 compared to 2002 (albeit statistically insignificant) for PFHxS in Jamtland, while PFNA, PFDA, PFUnDA, PFDoDA, and PFTrDA showed no difference at all.

AB  - Among tetrapods, grasping is an essential function involved in many vital behaviours. The selective pressures that led to this function were widely investigated in species with prehensile hands and feet. Previous studies namely highlighted a strong effect of item properties but also of the species habitat on manual grasping behaviour. African savannah elephants (Loxodonta africana) are known to display various prehensile abilities and use their trunk in a large diversity of habitats. Composed of muscles and without a rigid structure, the trunk is a muscular hydrostat with great freedom of movement. This multitasking organ is particularly recruited for grasping food items while foraging. Yet, the diet of African savannah elephants varies widely between groups living in different habitats. Moreover, they have tusks alongside the trunk which can assist in grasping behaviours, and their tusk morphologies are known to vary considerably between groups. Therefore, in this study, we investigate the food grasping techniques used by the trunk of two elephant groups that live in different habitats: an arid study site in Etosha National Park in Namibia, and an area with consistent water presence in Kruger National Park in South Africa. We characterised the tusks profiles and compared the grasping techniques and their frequencies of use for different foods. Our results show differences in food-grasping techniques between the two groups. These differences are related to the food item property and tusk profile discrepancies highlighted between the two groups. We suggest that habitat heterogeneity, particularly aridity gaps, may induce these differences. This may reveal an optimisation of grasping types depending on habitat, food size and accessibility, as well as tusk profiles.

AB  - Game animal damage in the forests and fields of Central Europe, which dramatically increased at the turn of the 21st century, has undermined the reliability of the size of game population estimates. It is hypothesized that this problem can be attributed to errors in the assessment of animal density. This study conducted game inventories in a region characterized by a large ungulate population using a count method with drivers in line formation (direct counts in control plots). The size of the red deer population in the investigated area was estimated using generalized linear models assuming a negative binomial distribution based on the compound distribution (including the zero-inflated model). The mean red deer density in spring 2012 was 21.5 animals/km2 of forest. The number of red deer determined during this study is often higher that hunters indicated in annual game management plans. For the rational management of populations, it is therefore necessary to verify those estimates periodically, e.g. every five years. The statistical analysis of data from tyraliera method counts may show the actual population size during spring. Thus, it can be the basis for adequately planning hunting bags. Adjusting the population density to the carrying environmental capacity should make it possible to reduce the pressure of red deer on forests and agricultural land.

AB  - Exposure to lead (Pb) is a global health problem for both humans and wildlife. Despite a dramatic decline in human Pb exposure following restrictions of leaded gasoline and industry and thereby an overall reduction of Pb entering the environment, Pb exposure continues to be a problem for wildlife species. Literature on scavenging terrestrial mammals, including interactions between Pb exposure and life history, is however limited. We quantified Pb concentration in 153 blood samples from 110 free-ranging Scandinavian brown bears (Ursus arctos), 1-25 years old, using inductively coupled plasma sector field mass spectrometry. We used generalized linear models to test effects of age, body mass, reproduction status and spatial distribution on the blood Pb concentrations of 56 female bears. We sampled 28 females together with 56 dependent cubs and paired their blood Pb concentrations. From 20 lactating females, we measured the Pb concentration in milk. The mean blood Pb concentration was 96.6 mu g/L (range: 38.7-220.5 mu g/L). Both the mean and range are well above established threshold concentrations for developmental neurotoxicity (12 mu g/L), increased systolic blood pressure (36 mu g/L) and prevalence of kidney disease in humans (15 mu g/L). Lactating females had higher Pb blood concentrations compared to younger, non-lactating females. Blood Pb concentrations of dependent cubs were correlated with their mother's blood Pb concentration, which in turn was correlated with the Pb concentration in the milk. Life-long Pb exposure in Scandinavian brown bears may have adverse effects both on individual and population levels. The high blood Pb concentrations found in brown bears contrast the general reduction in environmental Pb contamination over the past decades in Scandinavia and more research is needed to identify the sources and pathways of Pb exposure in the brown bears.

AB  - Algal turfs form a critical interface on coral reefs that interacts with several key ecosystem processes. While we know these turfs have a remarkable propensity to accumulate sediments, which can have a range of ecosystem impacts, their role as sinks for heavy metals remains largely unexamined. Here we quantified the concentration of 15 metals in algal turf sediments from Lizard Island and Orpheus Island on the Great Barrier Reef, and specifically explored how the loads of arsenic, cobalt, iron and lead were related to turf length. Metal composition differed markedly between the two islands, with the composition at Orpheus Island suggesting closer links to terrestrial sediment sources. Furthermore, metal loads increased significantly with turf length, suggesting that longer turfs can accumulate these pollutants on reefs. Given that algal turfs are a crucial component of herbivorous/detritivorous trophic pathways, this could represent a key juncture at which these metals enter food chains.

AB  - Simple Summary: We conducted a study in central Spain to understand the dietary habits of the Iberian wolf. Our aim was to evaluate the extent to which they prey on domestic ungulates. We analyzed the composition of their diet by examining prey hairs found in 671 wolf scat samples collected between 2017 and 2021. The wolves predominantly consumed wild ungulates rather than domestic ones. Among their preferred prey were wild boar and roe deer. Although their diet varied with seasons, years, and forest regions, a preference for wild ungulates over domestic ones remained consistent.
   The Iberian wolf (Canis lupus signatus) is recolonizing historical distribution areas after decades of absence. As in other human-dominated landscapes, finding a balance to protect this species by favoring recolonization and mitigating human-wildlife conflicts is a challenge. Since wolves are often generalist opportunistic predators, we studied their diet composition in central Spain to evaluate the consumption of domestic ungulates and provide reliable data that could help local authorities to deal with the current wolf-cattle ranchers conflict and coexistence. Diet composition (% prey occurrence, % prey ingested biomass) was analyzed through the identification of prey hairs present in 671 scats collected between 2017 and 2021. The wolves fed more on wild ungulates (82% occurrence) than domestic ones (18%). Wild boar (Sus scrofa, 44% occurrence) and roe deer (Capreolus capreolus, 35%) were the most consumed prey. The wolves positively selected these two species. The wolves' diets varied between seasons, years, and forest regions, but a diet based on wild ungulates predominated over domestic ones. Food niche breadth showed variations depending on seasons and years. Preserving the availability and diversity of wild ungulates may favor reducing livestock attacks and would be an achievable goal that would help to conserve this species and reduce conservation conflicts.

AB  - BackgroundThere is need of information on ecological interactions that keystone species such as apex predators establish in ecosystems recently recolonised. Interactions among carnivore species have the potential to influence community-level processes, with consequences for ecosystem dynamics. Although avoidance of apex predators by smaller carnivores has been reported, there is increasing evidence that the potential for competitive-to-facilitative interactions is context-dependent. In a protected area recently recolonised by the wolf Canis lupus and hosting abundant wild prey (3 ungulate species, 20-30 individuals/km(2), together), we used 5-year food habit analyses and 3-year camera trapping to (i) investigate the role of mesocarnivores (4 species) in the wolf diet; (ii) test for temporal, spatial, and fine-scale spatiotemporal association between mesocarnivores and the wolf.ResultsWolf diet was dominated by large herbivores (86% occurrences, N = 2201 scats), with mesocarnivores occurring in 2% scats. We collected 12,808 carnivore detections over > 19,000 camera trapping days. We found substantial (i.e., generally >= 0.75, 0-1 scale) temporal overlap between mesocarnivores-in particular red fox-and the wolf, with no support for negative temporal or spatial associations between mesocarnivore and wolf detection rates. All the species were nocturnal/crepuscular and results suggested a minor role of human activity in modifying interspecific spatiotemporal partitioning.ConclusionsResults suggest that the local great availability of large prey to wolves limited negative interactions towards smaller carnivores, thus reducing the potential for spatiotemporal avoidance. Our study emphasises that avoidance patterns leading to substantial spatiotemporal partitioning are not ubiquitous in carnivore guilds.

AB  - Gut bacterial composition is closely associated with the food intake and developmental age of herbivorous insects. In this study, we aimed to investigate the diversity of larval gut bacteria in different instar stages of Tuta absoluta (Meyrick) (Lepidoptera: Gelechiidae) feeding on different hosts. Gut bacterial DNA was extracted from the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, and 4th instar larvae of T. absoluta feeding on tomatoes, potatoes, and wolfberries for three generations. Subsequently, diversity and richness of gut bacteria were analyzed via the second-generation Illumina MiSeq high-throughput sequencing. Alpha diversity index analysis revealed the highest diversity and abundance of gut bacteria in the T. absoluta larvae fed wolfberry and potato leaves, respectively. The highest gut bacterial diversity and richness were observed in the 1st-instar larvae feeding on potato and tomato leaves. Tuta absoluta feeding on wolfberry leaves exhibited the lowest gut bacterial diversity in the 1st-instar stage and highest abundance in the 2nd-instar stage. Proteobacteria was the dominant phylum in the gut bacteria of stages 1-4 instar larvae feeding on different host plants. The dominant genus was Enterobacter (60.1%) in the 4th-instar T. absoluta larvae feeding on tomatoes and Wolbachia in those feeding on other plants. PICRUSt2 gene function prediction revealed that the larval gut bacteria of T. absoluta played essential roles in food digestion and nutrient supply. Specifically, Wolbachia may enhance nucleotide metabolism in T. absoluta feeding on potatoes. Overall, this study provides a basis to explore the interactions of T. absoluta with gut bacteria and suggests directions for its adaptive evolution and integrated management.

AB  - Arthropod biomass is a key element in ecosystem functionality and a basic food item for many species. It must be estimated through traditional costly field sampling, normally at just a few sampling points. Arthropod biomass and plant productivity should be narrowly related because a large majority of arthropods are herbivorous, and others depend on these. Quantifying plant productivity with satellite or aerial vehicle imagery is an easy and fast procedure already tested and implemented in agriculture and field ecology. However, the capability of satellite or aerial vehicle imagery for quantifying arthropod biomass and its relationship with plant productivity has been scarcely addressed. Here, we used unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) and satellite Sentinel-2 (S2) imagery to establish a relationship between plant productivity and arthropod biomass estimated through ground-truth field sampling in shrub steppes. We UAV-sampled seven plots of 47.6-72.3 ha at a 4-cm pixel resolution, subsequently downscaling spatial resolution to 50 cm resolution. In parallel, we used S2 imagery from the same and other dates and locations at 10-m spatial resolution. We related several vegetation indices (VIs) with arthropod biomass (epigeous, coprophagous, and four functional consumer groups: predatory, detritivore, phytophagous, and diverse) estimated at 41-48 sampling stations for UAV flying plots and in 67-79 sampling stations for S2. VIs derived from UAV were consistently and positively related to all arthropod biomass groups. Three out of seven and six out of seven S2-derived VIs were positively related to epigeous and coprophagous arthropod biomass, respectively. The blue normalized difference VI (BNDVI) and enhanced normalized difference VI (ENDVI) showed consistent and positive relationships with arthropod biomass, regardless of the arthropod group or spatial resolution. Our results showed that UAV and S2-VI imagery data may be viable and cost-efficient alternatives for quantifying arthropod biomass at large scales in shrub steppes. The relationship between VI and arthropod biomass is probably habitat-dependent, so future research should address this relationship and include several habitats to validate VIs as proxies of arthropod biomass.

AB  - Hunting is a widespread but often overlooked land-use activity, providing major benefits to society. Hunting takes placein most landscapes, yet it remains unclear which types of landscapes foster or dampen hunting-related services, and how hunting relatesto other land uses. A better understanding of these relationships is key for sustainable land-use planning that integrates wildlifemanagement. This is particularly urgent for Europe, where wildlife populations are increasing. Focusing on Sweden, we explored thespatial associations among hunting, agriculture, and forestry to identify archetypical combinations of these land uses. Specifically, wecombined indicators on the extent and intensity of agriculture and forestry, with data on hunting bags for 63 game species using self-organizing maps, a non-parametric clustering approach. We identified 15 typical bundles of co-occurring land uses at the municipalitylevel across Sweden. The harvest of forest grouse, bears, and moose co-occurred with forestry in northern Sweden, whereas the harvestof small game, different deer species, and wild boar co-occurred with agriculture across southern Sweden, reflecting species' biology,environmental factors, and management. Our findings also highlight the strength of associations among hunting and other land uses.Importantly, we identified large areas in central Sweden where harvest of game was below average, possibly indicating that intensityof hunting is out of balance with that of agriculture or forestry, potentially fostering conflict between wildlife and land use. Collectively,our results suggest that (1) hunting should be considered a major land use that, in Sweden, is more widespread than agriculture andforestry; (2) land-use planning must therefore integrate wildlife management; and (3) such an integration should occur in a regionalizedmanner that considers social-ecological context. Our approach identifies a first spatial template within which such context-specificland-use planning, aiming at aligning wildlife and diverse land uses, can take places.

AB  - Simple Summary Common ragwort (Senecio jacobaea L.) is a worldwide established plant containing toxic pyrrolizidine alkaloids (PA), which can lead to liver cirrhosis in livestock, especially cattle and horses. Controlling ragwort, particularly in conservation areas, is difficult. As sheep seem more resistant to PA, sheep might be a natural defense against the observed spread of ragwort. We tested this in a two-year study on a ragwort-rich pasture with 12 sheep/hectare from May to October 2020-2021. We addressed three questions: (1) To what extent do sheep voluntarily ingest ragwort? (2) In what respect do feeding behavior and nutritional parameters correlate? (3) What impact does grazing have on the yield proportion and number of flowers of dominant plants? We showed that sheep preferred ragwort without any harmful effects. The more ragwort was available and the more it contained sugar, the higher the amount ingested by the sheep. Ragwort accounted for a significantly lower yield proportion of ingested biomass in the second year even though its number of flowers doubled. The yield of biomass of other herbs increased. From the point of view of animal health and nature conservation, sheep grazing on ragwort might be an option to reduce the amount of ragwort in pastures. Species-rich pastures naturally contain potentially toxic plants such as common ragwort (Senecio jacobaea L.), whose pyrrolizidine alkaloids (PA) impose a risk, mainly for cattle and horses. Although in vitro studies showed detoxification capacity of PA in sheep, few field data are available to ascertain whether grazing sheep can both tolerate and reduce ragwort. In a two-year study in a ragwort-rich pasture with a stocking density of 12 sheep/hectare, we documented (1) the extent of voluntarily ingested ragwort, (2) the correlation of nutritional parameters and feeding behavior, and (3) the impact of grazing on the yield proportion and number of flowers of dominant plants. Every six weeks the vegetation underwent a botanical survey and a chemical analysis. Sheep continuously ingested ragwort between 1.2 and 4.9 kg (2020) and 1.0 and 2.2 kg (2021) per individual per day without any impact on animal health. The more biomass ragwort produced, the more it contained sugar (r = 0.59-0.74), and the more sheep ingested it (r = 0.94-0.95). Other herbs increased their yield proportion from 23.3 to 36.5%, while that of ragwort decreased from 26.3 to 18.8% (2020/2021), doubling its flowers. Sheep preferred and tolerated ragwort, making their grazing an option to control ragwort from both an animal health and a nature conservation perspective.

AB  - Inbreeding threatens the survival of small populations by producing inbreeding depression, but also exposes recessive deleterious effects in homozygosis allowing for genetic purging. Using inbreeding-purging theory, we analyze early survival in four pedigreed captive breeding programs of endangered ungulates where population growth was prioritized so that most adult females were allowed to contribute offspring according to their fitness. We find evidence that purging can substantially reduce inbreeding depression in Gazella cuvieri (with effective population size N-e = 14) and Nanger dama (N-e = 11). No purging is detected in Ammotragus lervia (N-e = 4), in agreement with the notion that drift overcomes purging under fast inbreeding, nor in G. dorcas (N-e = 39) where, due to the larger population size, purging is slower and detection is expected to require more generations. Thus, although smaller populations are always expected to show smaller fitness (as well as less adaptive potential) than larger ones due to higher homozygosis and deleterious fixation, our results show that a substantial fraction of their inbreeding load and inbreeding depression can be purged when breeding contributions are governed by natural selection. Since management strategies intended to maximize the ratio from the effective to the actual population size tend to reduce purging, the search for a compromise between these strategies and purging could be beneficial in the long term. This could be achieved either by allowing some level of random mating and some role of natural selection in determining breeding contributions, or by undertaking reintroductions into the wild at the earliest opportunity.

AB  - Custom camera traps were positioned at American pika (Ochotona princeps) haypiles in 12 warm, low-elevation locations of eastern California over 5 years and during warm and cold seasons. These camera traps detected 26 mammal and 10 bird species, including 4331 pika events as well as visits by 16 sympatric herbivores and 7 pika predators. Camera traps documented pika occupancy at some sites that had been evaluated from field surveys as extirpated, and they also confirmed field assessments of extirpation at other sites. Individual pikas could be distinguished by scars, size, and pelage diagnostics, allowing animals to be followed through sequences of photos and enabling behavioral interpretations and documentation of winter and warm-season activities. Temperature measurements at haypiles and talus interiors corroborated prior findings that rocky interiors are much cooler than surfaces, have highly attenuated daily temperature fluctuations, and offer refuge for pikas from high daytime temperatures. Nocturnal activity was recorded for pikas as well as for many other species, but we found little evidence that night activity of pikas at haypiles increased when prior day temperatures were excessively warm. The capacity of pikas to be active at all times of the day adds to their resilience in the face of predators, foraging needs, and changing climates.

AB  - Drained peatlands support highly profitable agriculture, but also represent a globally important source of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Grasslands can typically be maintained at higher water levels than croplands, so conversion of cropland to grassland represents a potential CO2 mitigation strategy that allows for continued agricultural production. However, the presence of high water levels and livestock on grasslands risks generating high emissions of N2O, particularly associated with livestock urine patches. In the present study, a controlled mesocosm experiment was carried out to quantify the interactive impacts of groundwater level (10 cm, 30 cm and 50 cm water table depth, WTD) and sheep urine deposition on GHG emissions from peat soils. Our results showed that N2O emissions were significantly higher at 30 cm for both urine-treated and control mesocosms, due to the conditions favouring the interplay of nitrification and incomplete denitrification. The urine N2O emission factor was 0.25 +/- 0.17% at the 30 cm WTD and 0.20 +/- 0.07% at 50 cm WTD, lower than typical values for grasslands. No significant difference was observed in ecosystem respiration or methane flux between 30 cm and 50 cm WTDs. Overall, we conclude that strategies to raise water levels in drained peatlands through conversion of cropland to grassland need to account for the potential impacts of N2O emissions when seeking to minimise overall GHG emissions. Shifting from cropland to grassland management on peatlands for climate change mitigation also requires consideration of the effects of livestock methane emissions, and displaced emissions resulting from increased land demand for crop production elsewhere.

AB  - Pigmentation anomalies (e.g., albinism, leucism) in Neotropical mammals are considered rare. Identifying the spatiotemporal distribution and prevalence of pigmentation anomalies is important to better assess the evolutionary basis of color variation. The southernmost population of the marsh deer (Blastocerus dichotomus) occurs within a relatively small area (< 2700 km(2)) of the Delta of the Parana River, being fragmented into three subpopulations with low gene flow among them. Typically, the marsh deer has a brownish red to bright rufous chestnut-colored coat; at least two albino individuals have been reported in other populations of the species, but other anomalous colorations (i.e., leucism) have not been described for this species. Here, we present seven records of leucistic marsh deer from the Delta of the Parana River, with the coloration of these individuals showing different levels of contrast from typically pigmented conspecifics. The presence of the leucistic phenotype in this population could be the product of its high level of homozygosis, but further studies are needed to confirm this relationship. Since the observed leucistic individuals were adults and apparently of breeding age, the possible maladaptive condition of this phenotype in this population remains to be evaluated.

AB  - Feral pigs threaten biodiversity in 54 countries and cause an estimated $120 billion in damages annually in the USA. They endanger over 600 native species and have driven 14 to extinction. Additionally, they pose a significant zoonotic disease risk, carrying pathogens such as Brucella, leptospirosis, and Japanese encephalitis. Understanding and controlling disease spread relies on models of social dynamics, but these vary widely across regions, limiting the transferability of findings from the USA and Europe to other locations like Australia. This study addresses this gap by analysing the social interactions of 146 GPS-tracked feral pigs in Australia using a proximity-based social network approach. Findings reveal that females exhibit stronger group cohesion, while males act as key connectors between groups. Contact rates are high within groups, facilitating rapid intra-group disease spread, whereas inter-group transmission is slower. Seasonal variations further impact dynamics, with increased contact in summer. These insights suggest that targeting adult males in control programs could help limit disease outbreaks. Given the rising economic and public health concerns associated with animal diseases, the study highlights the need for localized strategies based on feral pig social behaviour to enhance global control efforts.

AB  - Insect herbivores, such as lepidopteran larvae, often have close evolutionary relationships with their host plants, with which they may be locked in an evolutionary arms race. Larval grouping behaviour may be one behavioural adaptation that improves host plant feeding, but aggregation also comes with costs, such as higher competition and limited resource access. Here, we use the Heliconiini butterfly tribe to explore the impact of host plant traits on the evolution of larval gregariousness. Heliconiini almost exclusively utilise species from the Passifloraceae as larval host plants. Passifloraceae display incredible diversity in leaf shape and a range of anti-herbivore defences, suggesting they are responding to, and influencing, the evolution of Heliconiini larvae. By analysing larval social behaviour as both a binary (solitary or gregarious) and categorical (increasing larval group size) trait, we revisit the multiple origins of larval gregariousness across Heliconiini. We investigate whether host habitat, leaf defences and leaf size are important drivers of, or constraints on, larval gregariousness. Whereas our data do not reveal links between larval gregariousness and the host plant traits included in this study, we do find an interaction between host plant specialisation and larval behaviour, revealing gregarious larvae to be more likely to feed on a narrower range of host plant species than solitary larvae. We also find evidence that this increased specialisation typically precedes the evolutionary transition to gregarious behaviour. The comparatively greater host specialisation of gregarious larvae suggests that there are specific morphological and/or ecological features of their host plants that favour this behaviour.

AB  - Simple Summary Heat stress negatively affects animal welfare, health, and production efficiency, especially in pigs. Pigs have few functional sweat glands and are further hindered by a thick subcutaneous adipose tissue layer, which impedes heat dissipation in warm conditions. Outdoor pigs cope with hot periods by choosing their own environment (e.g., looking for shade and wallowing in mud). However, heat-stressed pigs raised in intensive, confined housing wallow in their manure to cool themselves, despite not being their preferred substrate, while avoiding contact with other pigs. In addition, pigs implement physiological adaptations in an attempt to cope with heat stress, with negative consequences on pigs' performance and carcass quality, causing dramatic losses in the swine industry worldwide. For this reason, to counteract the impact of heat stress in intensive pig farming, the implementation of multiple mitigation strategies is required. Thus far, the effect of the use of cooling systems and/or reducing the stocking density on pig welfare and performance has not been quantified, and the results can be of interest to the swine industry. This study is aimed at evaluating the effect of reducing stocking density and using cooling systems to mitigate the negative effects of high temperatures in growing pigs (females and castrated males) reared in intensive conditions (from 25 to 100 kg) during summer (June to October 2020). The experimental design was a 2 x 2 factorial where pigs were provided with an evaporative cooling system and/or raised at regular or at lower stocking densities (i.e., 0.68 to 0.80 m(2)/animal). Treatments were distributed in four different rooms containing sex-balanced pens with either castrated males or females. Temperature and humidity were recorded throughout the experiment, and the temperature-humidity index was calculated. Heat stress (HS) on pigs was measured through changes in animals' performance, animal-based indicators (dirtiness and activity budget) and physiological indicators (neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio and hair cortisol). The use of cooling, lowering stocking density and the combination of both strategies had positive effects on pigs' final body weight (+5 kg, +3 kg, +9 kg, respectively; p < 0.001). The prevalence of dirtiness was similar at the stocking densities tested, and no clear effect of the cooling system was found. Both mitigation strategies lowered the physiological indicators of stress, although only hair cortisone can be considered an indicator of HS. In conclusion, both mitigation strategies are effective in improving pig welfare and performance, especially when both are combined. The severity of the stocking density effect may depend on the severity of the temperature.

AB  - The adverse effects of climate change on livestock farming and how to overcome such effects is a situation that requires critical attention. In Ghana, livestock farming contributes to household welfare and economic growth; however, studies on livestock production are few. This study investigates the impact of climate change adaptation strategies on farm household income in Ghana utilizing data obtained from goat farmers. The endogenous switching regression (ESR) model is employed to achieve the study's aim. The results show that age, education, access to credit, extension visits, smartphone use, and peer influence significantly influence farmers' decision to adopt climate change (CC) adaptation strategies. Also, it is observed that the adoption of CC adaptation strategies increases farm and household income. The study recommended that policymakers, the national government, and NGOs should target promoting climate change adaptation technologies for rural growth. Our findings highlight that CC adaptation strategies can be a transmission route to enhance livestock farmers' livelihood.

AB  - Protected areas (PA) to conserve wildlife are the cornerstone of biodiversity conservation but they can also result in increased human-wildlife conflict (HWC), which poses a serious challenge to jointly achieving sustainable development goals of food security and biodiversity conservation, particular in regions with high conservation values and subsistence farmers. In the Himalayan Kingdom of Bhutan, expanding PAs and other conservation efforts have led to increased wildlife populations that are causing more damage to crop and livestock and impacting on the livelihoods of subsistence farmers and herders. In this study, we used a social-ecological sys-tems framework to quantify the intensity this impact and associated economic losses with identified wildlife species and compared differences between livelihood types (crop farming versus livestock husbandry) and land tenure (inside versus outside protected areas). Results indicated that Meso-scale wildlife species that are not the focus of conservation caused higher economic losses. Approximately 43% of total economic loss through crop depredation was attributed to wild pig (Sus scrofa) and 56% of the total economic loss through livestock pre-dation was caused by wild dogs (Cuon alpinus). Losses borne by respondents whose livelihoods depend mainly on livestock were significantly higher, with a mean loss equivalent to US$1328 per household per annum, than those depending on crop production (US$171 per household per annum). Economic losses incurred through crop and livestock depredation were significantly higher for the respondents residing inside PAs, which is attributed by those households to a perceived increase in wildlife populations because of conservation policies. In-terventions for prevention and mitigation of these impacts should recognize these varying unintended effects of wildlife and be better targeted at groups living in different parts of the landscape. These include expanding compensation scheme to losses caused by wild dogs and pigs, supporting ecotourism ventures within PAs to diversify income options and introducing control measures for these animals.

AB  - Ticks are hematophagous arthropods and, during feeding, may transmit pathogens to vertebrate hosts, including humans. This study aimed to investigate the presence of Rickettsia spp. in ticks collected between 2010 and 2013 from free-ranging capybaras (Hydrochoerus hydrochaeris) and opossums (Didelphis albiventris) that inhabit Sabia Park in Uberlandia, Brazil. Overall, 1,860 ticks were collected: 1,272 (68.4%) from capybaras (487 of the species Amblyomma sculptum, 475 adults and 12 nymphs; 778 Amblyomma dubitatum, 727 adults and 51 nymphs; and seven larva clusters of the genus Amblyomma); and 588 (31.6%) from opossums (21 A. sculptum, one adult and 20 nymphs; 79 A. dubitatum, all nymphs; 15 Ixodes loricatus, 12 adults and three nymphs; 457 Amblyomma sp. larva clusters; 15 Ixodes sp. larva clusters; and one Argasidae larva cluster). Out of 201 DNA samples tested for the presence of Rickettsia spp. DNA using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) 12 showed amplification of a gtlA gene segment that was specific to Rickettsia bellii, a bacterium non-pathogenic to humans. As there has been a report showing serological evidence of infections caused by Rickettsia species of the spotted fever group (SFG) in capybaras and opossums in the park, including Rickettsia rickettsii, the etiological agent of Brazilian spotted fever, and considering the presence of A. sculptum ticks, which are aggressive to humans, as well as these vertebrate hosts, which are amplifiers of R. rickettsii, it is important to monitor the presence of SFG rickettsiae in the Sabia Park, which is visited daily by thousands of people.

AB  - The cactus Leptocereus grantianus is an endangered species endemic to the island municipality of Culebra, Puerto Rico. Given its critical population status, several conservation and restoration actions have been developed to restore its dwindling populations. However, the limited understanding of its biology and ecology has constrained such efforts. Our project aims to enhance the knowledge of L. grantianus demography by monitoring survival, growth, and phenology in three natural populations. After one year, survival rates ranged from 70% to 100%. The observed mortality was linked to basal dislodgement, which resulted from an unstable substrate. Conversely, growth rates (net change in branch length) were low, with mean rates not exceeding 0.32 cm per month in any of the studied populations. Nevertheless, significant seasonal variations were observed, with 46% of individuals exhibiting a reduction in length during the dry season compared to only 11% during the wet season. Flower-budding occurred year-round in all populations; however, flowering and fruit production were rare. The observed low growth rate and reproductive output may be adaptive strategies to enhance survival in the harsh environmental conditions of Culebra. Therefore, conservation and restoration initiatives should incorporate these insights to effectively address the challenges faced by L. grantianus and support its recovery.

AB  - Contact among animals is crucial for various ecological processes, including social behaviors, disease transmission, and predator-prey interactions. However, the distribution of contact events across time and space is heterogeneous, influenced by environmental factors and biological purposes. Previous studies have assumed that areas with abundant resources and preferred habitats attract more individuals and, therefore, lead to more contact. To examine the accuracy of this assumption, we used a use-available framework to compare landscape factors influencing the location of contacts between wild pigs (Sus scrofa) in two study areas in Florida and Texas (USA) from those influencing non-contact space use. We employed a contact-resource selection function (RSF) model, where contact locations were defined as used points and locations without contact as available points. By comparing outputs from this contact RSF with a general, population-level RSF, we assessed the factors driving both habitat selection and contact. We found that the landscape predictors (e.g., wetland, linear features, and food resources) played different roles in habitat selection from contact processes for wild pigs in both study areas. This indicated that pigs interacted with their landscapes differently when choosing habitats compared to when they encountered other individuals. Consequently, relying solely on the spatial overlap of individual or population-level RSF models may lead to a misleading understanding of contact-related ecology. Our findings challenge prevailing assumptions about contact and introduce innovative approaches to better understand the ecological drivers of spatially explicit contact. By accurately predicting the spatial distribution of contact events, we can enhance our understanding of contact based ecological processes and their spatial dynamics.

AB  - The assessment of spatiotemporal behaviour patterns of wild species is pivotal both for conservation and for management, especially when involving rare or elusive species, or species living in delicate ecosystems, e.g. mountains. The Siberian roe deer Capreolus pygargus is a native Asian ungulate, whose ecology is still poorly known, especially on mountain ecosystems. In particular, information on its spatial behaviour and temporal patterns of activity is poor. We have assessed its patterns of circadian rhythms in relation to moon phases, with some conclusions on spatial behaviour in respect to potential predation and slope inclination. Data were collected between August and October 2019, with 35 camera-traps deployed over an area of mountain forests alternated to steppe, in Central Mongolia. Camera trap data were analyzed with occupancy models and kernel smoothers, providing a reliable assessment of the presence of Siberian roe deer, with only 1 % of false absence and a very high detection probability. This ungulate showed a bimodal temporal behaviour, with activity peaks at dawn and at early night, irrespective from moon phases. The detection of Siberian roe deer was negatively influenced by the presence of large carnivores and by increasing slope steepness.

AB  - Elasmobranchs represent a well-defined group, composed of about 1,150 species inhabiting diverse aquatic environments. Currently, several of these species have been classified as threaten due to overexploitation. Therefore, we used DNA barcode to identify traded species of sharks and stingrays in the municipality of Braganca (Amazon coastal region), a major fishery landing site in northern Brazil. We collected a total of 127 samples labeled into 24 commercial nomenclatures over 1-year period. Twenty species were discriminated and 13 of them are recognized under some threatening status. In relation to sharks, Carcharhinidae showed the highest number of species, half of them classified as endangered, followed by hammerhead sharks (Sphyrnidae), with four species also regarded as threatened with extinction. The Rhinopteridae and Dasyatidae rays were the most abundant groups, with trade records of the following threatened species: Rhinoptera brasiliensis, Rhinoptera bonasus, Hypanus berthalutzae, and Fontitrygon geijskesi. It is noteworthy that threatened species of elasmobranchs have been frequently and regularly exploited because of inefficient fishery management policies. Therefore, effective inspection practices need to be incorporated in fisheries, including the use of DNA barcode to enable a reliable method of species authentication and to assure the proper commercialization.

AB  - Multilevel societies (MLSs) are present in several animal clades and our understanding of them is growing at a time with increasing habitat loss. The ways individuals in these complex societies respond to habitat restriction and fragmentation are unknown. We examined ranging and feeding competition in a Ruwenzori Angolan colobus MLS in a forest fragment at Nabugabo, Uganda. We analyzed GPS points collected over 2 years and scan samples collected over 10 months on 12 core units in one band to compare sex- and core unit-specific activity budgets and near-neighbor distances. The 95% home range size estimate of this band was 1.75 km(2), much smaller than the ranges of similar-sized bands of primate MLS in continuous habitats. Day range length was also shorter. The colobus rarely utilized the matrix and over the two-year period core units' home ranges overlapped by 93%. Indicators of scramble competition included more time spent feeding in larger core units, near-neighbors at greater distances when feeding relative to resting, and greater feeding for females compared to males. A quadratic relationship was found between core unit size and home range and core area size, where intermediate-sized units showed the smallest ranges. All units showed similarly tortuous paths; however, the smallest core units had the longest day range lengths and the fastest rates of travel. We conclude that while large core units suffer some food competition, small units may be displaced more in inter-unit contests because they appear to suffer the highest energetic costs searching for food within this constricted area. Significance statement Wildlife worldwide is faced with increasing habitat loss and fragmentation. How this impacts animals that live in large, complex societies (e.g., multilevel societies) is an important question to investigate for future conservation. We examined ranging behavior and food competition for a multilevel society of Rwenzori Angolan colobus monkeys (12 core units, 139 monkeys) in Uganda that occupies a relatively small forest fragment. We found scramble competition for food, especially in the largest core units. However, membership in the smallest core units seemed to be the most energetically costly. These units moved the most per day and the fastest, perhaps because they were unable to displace larger core units from food patches. Overall, this multilevel society occupied an area many times smaller than similar-sized primate multilevel societies in continuous habitat and moved far less, suggesting that fragmentation is constraining their range.

AB  - Many remote islands present barriers to effective wildlife monitoring in terms of challenging terrain and frequency of visits. The sub-Antarctic islands of South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands are home to globally significant populations of seabirds and marine mammals. South Georgia hosts the largest breeding populations of Antarctic fur seals, southern elephant seals and king penguins as well as significant populations of wandering, black-browed and grey-headed albatross. The island also holds important populations of macaroni and gentoo penguins. The South Sandwich Islands host the world's largest colony of chinstrap penguins in addition to major populations of Adelie and macaroni penguins. A marine protected area was created around these islands in 2012 but monitoring populations of marine predators remains a challenge, particularly as these species breed over large areas in remote and often inaccessible locations. During the 2019/20 austral summer, we trialled the use of an unoccupied aerial vehicle (UAV; drone) to monitor populations of seals, penguins and albatross and here we report our initial findings, including considerations about the advantages and limitations of the methodology. Three extensive southern elephant seal breeding sites were surveyed with complete counts made around the peak pupping date, two of these sites were last surveyed 24 years ago. A total of nine islands, historically recorded as breeding sites for wandering albatross, were surveyed with 144 fledglings and 48 adults identified from the aerial imagery. The UAV was effective at surveying populations of penguins that nest on flat, open terrain, such as Adelie and chinstrap penguin colonies at the South Sandwich Islands, and an extensive king penguin colony on South Georgia, but proved ineffective for monitoring macaroni penguins nesting in tussock habitat on South Georgia as individuals were obscured or hidden by vegetation. Overall, we show that UAV surveys can allow regular and accurate monitoring of these important wildlife populations.

AB  - The rapidly growing global road networks put serious pressures on terrestrial ecosystems and increase the number and severity of human-wildlife conflicts, which in most cases manifest in animal-vehicle collisions (AVCs). AVCs pose serious problems both for biodiversity conservation and traffic safety: each year, millions of vertebrates are roadkilled globally and the related economic damage is also substantial. For a comprehensive understanding of factors influencing AVC it is essential to explore the human factor, that is, the habits and attitude of drivers; however, to date, comprehensive surveys are lacking on this topic. Here we addressed this knowledge gap and surveyed the habits of drivers and their experience and attitude towards AVCs by a comprehensive questionnaire covering a large geographical area and involving a large number of respondents (1942 completed questionnaires). We aimed to reveal how driving habits affect the chance of AVC, and explored the attitude of the drivers regarding AVC. We found that the number of lifetime AVC cases was higher for male drivers, for those who drove longer distances per year, had more driven years, used country roads or drove large vehicles. Our results showed that almost half of the drivers surveyed had experienced at least one AVC in their lifetime. Drivers' attitudes towards the importance of nature conservation or traffic safety in the aspect of AVC, and fear of collision showed a significant correlation with experienced AVC cases. Drivers' opinions indicated that the most trusted and desired AVC prevention measures were physical objects such as fences and wildlife crossings. Our research provides guidelines for developing targeted initiatives in the future to increase awareness about the significance of AVC and target those drivers who are most vulnerable to AVC.

AB  - Since 2012, control of invasive wild pigs (Sus scrofa) in the United States (US) has become a state and national priority due to their propensity to damage agricultural commodities and infrastructure, transmit disease, detrimentally affect ecological processes, and compete with native wildlife for resources. While several lifehistory characteristics certainly aided their proliferation, the recreational value of wild pigs was likely the stimulus for translocation and subsequent establishment of populations in >= 35 states, causing an annual economic burden of $1.5 billion in the US. Consequently, state-level legislative procedures regarding wild pigs are expanding in scope and priority, but policy among states lacks uniformity. States vary in their treatment of wild pig control based on differing resource appropriations and stakeholder interests. We conducted an evaluation to determine if policy was associated with state-level 1) presence of wild pigs, 2) spatial extent of wild pig population occupancy, and 3) trajectory of wild pig population occupancy. Our results suggest the presence of wild pigs in various states was influenced by hunting preserves and the sale of hunting opportunities. In occupied states, the spatial extent of wild pigs was again associated with the sale of hunting opportunities and a wild pig hunting culture. Finally, the trajectory of state-level wild pig spatial occupancy was positively influenced by the sale of hunting opportunities, and negatively influenced by transportation policies. Based on these findings, we propose state governments standardize transportation policy and fenced hunting regulations across regions of the US in a more prohibitive fashion to diminish range expansion through illegal and negligent introductions via transportation, release, and escapes from game farms. Moreover, in states where wild pigs have yet to establish, we strongly recommend states proactively prohibit transportation through intra- and interstate movement.

AB  - Simple Summary This study investigated the current conservation status, including the genetic diversity, the family structure, and inbreeding, of the Licha black pig population on Jiaodong Peninsula (Shandong Province, China). The results provide insights into the management and conservation of a local pig breed. Breeders are encouraged to utilize genomic data to improve mating schemes based on the family information obtained in this study, such as keeping an equivalent number of boars and sows in each family and selecting individuals with a kinship coefficient of less than 0.1 for mating. The Licha black pig, a popular indigenous Chinese pig breed, is known for its multi-vertebral trait and higher lean meat rate. Understanding the current conservation status, family structure, and degree of inbreeding of the Licha black pig population will be useful to maintain a sufficient level of genetic diversity in these animal resources. In the present study, the genetic diversity, population structure, and inbreeding coefficient of this conserved population were analyzed using SNP genotyping data from 209 Licha black pigs. Based on the genomic information, this population was divided into eight different families with boars. The effective population size (N-e), polymorphic marker ratio (P-N), expected heterozygosity (H-e), and observed heterozygosity (H-o) of this population were 8.7, 0.827, 0.3576, and 0.3512, respectively. In addition, a total of 5976 runs of homozygosity (ROHs) were identified, and most of the ROHs (54.9%) were greater than 5 Mb. The genomic inbreeding coefficient of each individual was estimated based on ROHs (F-ROH) with an average inbreeding coefficient of 0.11 for the population. Five statistics (N-e, P-N, H-o, H-e, and F-ROH) showed a decrease in the level of genetic diversity and a high degree of inbreeding in this population. Thus, special preservation programs need to be implemented in the future, such as introducing new individuals or improving the mating plan. Altogether, our study provides the first genomic overview of the genetic diversity and population structure of Licha black pigs, which will be useful for the management and long-term preservation of this breed.

AB  - Macropods play an important ecological role in the Australian environment; however, at high population densities can adversely affect biodiversity and primary production and result in human-wildlife conflicts. While shooting is recognised as the most humane and species-specific method for controlling macropod populations, in peri-urban situations fertility control provides an attractive option to replace or reduce lethal interventions. An appropriate fertility control agent for managing overabundant macropods needs to provide long-lasting infertility following a single treatment, be species-specific in its action or administration method, and be safe, humane, and cost-effective. Several contraceptive methods that induce infertility for multiple years have been tested on macropods. These include surgical techniques; hormonal implants containing deslorelin, a gonadotrophin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonist, or levonorgestrel, a progestin; and immunocontraceptive vaccines (zona pellucida vaccine and the GnRH-based vaccine, GonaCon). These methods vary in the complexity of delivery and therefore their potential for adverse welfare impacts. Minimal side effects on behaviour and health have been observed. Despite some recent progress with remote dart delivery of deslorelin implants and GonaCon, efficient deployment of all existing methods is currently restricted to either captive or small, wild populations where individuals can be approached closely enough for safe capture and treatment. Of the currently available methods, levonorgestrel and GonaCon are the most suited to population-scale management. To date, studies addressing the effect of fertility control on the growth rate of macropod populations have been limited but are essential to enable full evaluation of the efficacy and cost/benefit analysis of the different approaches. Mathematical modelling to identify the level of infertility required to meet population management goals, as well as comparing integrated management strategies, will support planning of large-scale field trials. Improving dart delivery of existing contraceptive agents and developing new methods, such as an oral contraceptive, would increase the cost-effectiveness of applying fertility control to free-ranging macropods and may make treating larger populations feasible.

AB  - Yeast strains are widely used in ruminant production. However, knowledge about the effects of rumen native yeasts on ruminants is limited. Therefore, this study aimed to obtain a rumen native yeast isolate and investigate its effects on growth performance, nutrient digestibility, rumen fermentation and microbiota in Hu sheep. Yeasts were isolated by picking up colonies from agar plates, and identified by sequencing the ITS sequences. One isolate belonging to Pichia kudriavzevii had the highest optical density among these isolates obtained. This isolate was prepared to perform an animal feeding trial. A randomized block design was used for the animal trial. Sixteen Hu sheep were randomly assigned to the control (CON, fed basal diet, n = 8) and treatment group (LPK, fed basal diet plus P. kudriavzevii, CFU = 8 x 10(9) head/d, n = 8). Sheep were housed individually and treated for 4 weeks. Compared to CON, LPK increased final body weight, nutrient digestibility and rumen acetate concentration and acetate-to-propionate ratio in sheep. The results of Illumina MiSeq PE 300 sequencing showed that LPK increased the relative abundance of lipolytic bacteria (Anaerovibrio spp. and Pseudomonas spp.) and probiotic bacteria (Faecalibacterium spp. and Bifidobacterium spp.). For rumen eukaryotes, LPK increased the genera associated with fiber degradation, including protozoan Polyplastron and fungus Pichia. Our results discovered that rumen native yeast isolate P. kudriavzevii might promote the digestion of fibers and lipids by modulating specific microbial populations with enhancing acetate-type fermentation.

AB  - Simple SummaryAlthough the transcriptome of dairy cow mammary tissue has been reported, the transcriptome of yak mammary tissue remains unknown. The objective of this study was to assess the transcriptome of the mammary tissue of four yaks during the whole lactation cycle. The statistical analysis identified >6000 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) throughout lactation, with a large number of DEGs observed at the onset (1 d vs. -15 d) and at the end of lactation (240 d vs. 180 d). Bioinformatics analysis revealed a major role of lactation-associated genes on BTA3, BTA4, BTA6, BTA9, BTA14, and BTA28. Functions affected by the transcriptomic adaptation to lactation in mammary tissue of yak were very similar to those observed in dairy cows. Our study provides fundamental resources on yak mammary tissue transcriptome for the research community.The objective of this study was to assess the transcriptome of the mammary tissue of four yaks during the whole lactation cycle. For this purpose, biopsies of the mammary gland were performed at -30, -15, 1, 15, 30, 60, 120, 180, and 240 days relative to parturition (d). The transcriptome analysis was performed using a commercial bovine microarray platform and the results were analyzed using several bioinformatic tools. The statistical analysis using an overall false discovery rate <= 0.05 for the effect of whole lactation and p < 0.05 for each comparison identified >6000 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) throughout lactation, with a large number of DEGs observed at the onset (1 d vs. -15 d) and at the end of lactation (240 d vs. 180 d). Bioinformatics analysis revealed a major role of genes associated with BTA3, BTA4, BTA6, BTA9, BTA14, and BTA28 in lactation. Functional analysis of DEG underlined an overall induction of lipid metabolism, suggesting an increase in triglycerides synthesis, likely regulated by PPAR signaling. The same analysis revealed an induction of amino acid metabolism and secretion of protein, with a concomitant decrease in proteasome, indicating a major role of amino acid handling and reduced protein degradation in the synthesis and secretion of milk proteins. Glycan biosynthesis was induced for both N-glycan and O-glycan, suggesting increased glycan content in the milk. The cell cycle and immune response, especially antigen processing and presentation, were strongly inhibited during lactation, suggesting that morphological changes are minimized during lactation, while the mammary gland prevents immune hyper-response. Transcripts associated with response to radiation and low oxygen were enriched in the down-regulated DEG affected by the stage of lactation. Except for this last finding, the functions affected by the transcriptomic adaptation to lactation in mammary tissue of yak are very similar to those observed in dairy cows.

AB  - Aim During naturalization, many species undergo climatic niche expansion, in which they spread into climates with which they have not been associated previously. This suggests that species are absent from some climatically suitable areas in their native range, but the reason for this is unknown. We aimed to evaluate whether the climatic conditions in which expansion occurs provide information about the causes of niche expansion. Location Global. Time period Contemporary. Major taxa studied Terrestrial plants. Methods We compiled native and naturalized occurrence data for 606 terrestrial plant species and compared their native and naturalized climatic niches to detect evidence of climatic niche expansion. Where species showed evidence of niche expansion, we used a variety of circular modelling techniques to investigate further whether species were more likely to expand, or expand further, along some climatic axes than others. We also asked, with or without expansion, whether species were more successful at colonizing the hottest, coldest, wettest or driest portions of their potential niche. Results We found climatic niche expansion in 45% of naturalizations of 606 terrestrial plants. Species expanded predominantly into wetter climate than their native niche, somewhat less frequently into drier climate, and only in rare instances into hotter or colder climate. Species were least likely to naturalize in the hottest or coldest portions of their native climatic niche. Main conclusions Our results could suggest that the wetter margins of native niches are limited by biotic interactions that are relaxed in the naturalized range. Our results could also suggest that evolutionary adaptation to novel precipitation regimes is occurring, and/or there are time lags caused by slow population growth rates in cold and hot conditions. Regardless of the explanation, range margins associated with precipitation might be the least predictable during naturalization or environmental change.

AB  - Land conversion is causing habitat loss and fragmentation worldwide, particularly in Africa, where the proliferation of agricultural development corridors may threaten vital areas for ecological connectivity and wildlife survival. To conserve connectivity, careful landscape planning is necessary, which strongly relies on remotely sensed land cover maps. Here, we present a remote sensing-based framework that efficiently identifies priority locations for connectivity conservation. We applied the framework in the Kilombero catchment and development cluster of the Southern Agricultural Growth Corridor (SAGCOT) in Tanzania, where new agricultural development projects could act as barriers for connectivity. Using satellite imagery from Sentinel-1 and 2, we mapped the mixture of mountain and lowland land covers and habitats with an overall accuracy of 75%. Then, we assessed ecological connectivity to predict African elephant corridors and prioritize them in two ways. First, we identified elephant corridors that contribute the most to current landscape connectivity, and second, we identified those whose restoration would significantly enhance landscape functionality and improve the current connectivity level. We mapped 214 potential elephant corridors, identified 43 of them as priority for conservation, and 43 as target for restoration. Our model predicted four already known corridor areas in and around the Kilombero valley floodplain, and other important corridors not yet identified by previous studies in the south of the basin. Priority elephant corridors inside the floodplain showed narrow widths and low permeability, indicating low functionality in the connectivity network. Nevertheless, the abundance of priority corridors for restoration suggests that connectivity could be recovered if the recommended measures are applied during SAGCOT planning and implementation process.

AB  - Hypersaline Great Salt Lake's (GSL: Utah, USA) pelagic food web is dominated by the herbivore, Artemia franciscana. Artemia demographic responses (survival, developmental transition, and reproduction) to GSL salinities, temperatures, common phytoplankton and yeast, and food levels were examined by factorial experiment. Survival across developmental stages was best at 90 ppt salinity, and decreased as temperature increased. Transition between life stages was best at 45 ppt salinity, and increased as temperature increased. Food was most important with both survival and transitioning responding similarly to food types and increasing with amount of food. Artemia reproduce in two ways (diapausing cysts - oviparity, live young - ovoviviparity): ovoviviparous and total reproduction were greatest at 90 ppt salinity and 20 degrees C, while oviparous reproduction was weakly affected by salinity and greatest at 20 degrees C. Oviparity was greatest at low food availability, while ovoviviparity and total reproduction increased with food availability, so reproduction shifted from oviparity to ovoviviparity as food increased. Maternal effects were observed for cyst hatchability, and ovoviviparous nauplii survival and transitioning to the juvenile stage. Combinations of salinity, temperature, food taxa and food amount strongly affect demography, making single factor studies of limited value. Results explain Artemia abundance in different parts of GSL and among years.

AB  - Volatile terpenes serve multiple biological roles including tree resistance against herbivores. The increased frequency and severity of drought stress observed in forests across the globe may hinder trees from producing defense-related volatiles in response to biotic stress. To assess how drought-induced physiological stress alters volatile emissions alone and in combination with a biotic challenge, we monitored pre-dawn water potential, gas-exchange, needle terpene concentrations and terpene volatile emissions of ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa) saplings during three periods of drought and in response to simulated herbivory via methyl jasmonate application. Although 3-, 6- and 7-week drought treatments reduced net photosynthetic rates by 20, 89 and 105%, respectively, the magnitude of volatile fluxes remained generally resistant to drought. Herbivore-induced emissions, however, exhibited threshold-like behavior; saplings were unable to induce emissions above constitutive levels when pre-dawn water potentials were below the approximate zero-assimilation point. By comparing compositional shifts in emissions to needle terpene concentrations, we found evidence that drought effects on constitutive and herbivore-induced volatile flux and composition are primarily via constraints on the de novo fraction, suggesting that reduced photosynthesis during drought limits the carbon substrate available for de novo volatile synthesis. However, results from a subsequent (CO2)-C-13 pulse-chase labeling experiment then confirmed that both constitutive (<3% labeled) and herbivore-induced (<8% labeled) de novo emissions from ponderosa pine are synthesized predominantly from older carbon sources with little contribution from new photosynthates. Taken together, we provide evidence that in ponderosa pine, drought does not constrain herbivore-induced de novo emissions through substrate limitation via reduced photosynthesis, but rather through more sophisticated molecular and/or biophysical mechanisms that manifest as saplings reach the zero-assimilation point. These results highlight the importance of considering drought severity when assessing impacts on the herbivore-induced response and suggest that drought-altered volatile metabolism constrains induced emissions once a physiological threshold is surpassed.

AB  - The evolution of innate behaviours is ultimately due to genetic variation likely acting in the nervous system. Gene regulation may be particularly important because it can evolve in a modular brain-region specific fashion through the concerted action of cis- and trans-regulatory changes. Here, to investigate transcriptional variation and its regulatory basis across the brain, we perform RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) on ten brain subregions in two sister species of deer mice (Peromyscus maniculatus and P. polionotus)-which differ in a range of innate behaviours, including their social system-and their F-1 hybrids. We find that most of the variation in gene expression distinguishes subregions, followed by species. Interspecific differential expression (DE) is pervasive (52-59% of expressed genes), whereas the number of DE genes between sexes is modest overall (similar to 3%). Interestingly, the identity of DE genes varies considerably across brain regions. Much of this modularity is due to cis-regulatory divergence, and while 43% of genes were consistently assigned to the same gene regulatory class across subregions (e.g. conserved, cis- or trans-regulatory divergence), a similar number were assigned to two or more different gene regulatory classes. Together, these results highlight the modularity of gene expression differences and divergence in the brain, which may be key to explain how the evolution of brain gene expression can contribute to the astonishing diversity of animal behaviours.

AB  - To investigate the paleoclimate and paleoenvironment of central Italy during the Middle Pleistocene, we analyzed the carbon and oxygen stable isotope composition of the carbonate component of sequential enamel samples from twenty-four rhinoceros (Stephanorhinus spp.) teeth. The samples come from two key archeological and paleontological sites located in the Molise region: Isernia La Pineta (ILP;-600 ka) and Guado San Nicola (GSN;-400 ka).
   Carbon isotope ratios of enamel from both ILP and GSN indicate feeding in a pure C3 ecosystem that consisted predominantly of woodlands and/or mesic C3 grasslands with the possible sparse presence of closed canopy forests at or near ILP-600 ka. The average (+/- 1 sigma) enamel delta C-13 for ILP (-13.6 +/- 0.6%0) is lower than that for GSN (-12.1 +/- 0.4%0), suggesting higher mean annual precipitation and lesser aridity-600 vs.-400 ka. Average intra-tooth variability in enamel delta C-13 from both sites is low (-1 parts per thousand), likely indicating seasonally uniform diets, plant carbon isotope compositions, and precipitation amounts. However, the low intra-tooth variability in enamel delta C-13 may also reflect amplitude attenuation of the isotopic signal of the plants into tooth enamel.
   With respect to oxygen isotopes, the average (+/- 1 sigma) enamel delta O-18 for ILP (24.2 +/- 0.7 parts per thousand) is slightly lower than that for GSN (25.0 +/- 0.7 parts per thousand), likely reflecting the higher elevation of ILP as well as lesser aridity and/or slightly lower mean annual temperature in the region-600 vs.-400 ka. The delta O-18 values of meteoric precipitation (--7 parts per thousand) calculated from enamel compositions are indistinguishable from the modern values, suggesting that mean annual temperatures were broadly similar to today (-13 degrees C). Both sites exhibit a moderate average intratooth variability in enamel delta O-18 (-2 parts per thousand), likely indicating a temperature seasonality similar or slightly decreased relative to today. The temperate climate and the increase in aridity that occurred sometime between-600 and-400 ka were potentially important factors for the human colonization of the Italian peninsula and for the cultural and behavioral evolution of the early hominins during the Middle Pleistocene.

   Under a cold environment, the animal's weight is reduced and even health is affected. As we all know, microbiota is beneficial to animal health. It can produce metabolites to improve animal immunity and avoid damage. Therefore, we aimed to understand the self-protection mechanisms of sheep under cold stress. To investigate this mechanism, we designed two experiments to explore the effects of low temperature and wind speed on sheep phenotypes, rumen microbes, immune cytokines and oxidative stress. Our results identified that the sheep remained healthy in a cold environment. This may be due to the enrichment of Lachnospiraceae in the rumen. A large amount of propionate may enter into the gluconeogenesis reaction, resulting in a decrease in the content of propionate in the rumen, thereby reducing animal's immunity. In summary, the increase of Lachnospiraceae and propionate in the rumen may help sheep live in a cold environment. Our experiments provide some direction for the healthy feeding of animals in cold environments.
   Low-temperature environments can strongly affect the normal growth and health of livestock. In winter, cold weather can be accompanied by strong winds that aggravate the effects of cold on livestock. In this study, two experiments were conducted to investigate the effect of low temperature and/or wind speed on physiological indices, rumen microbiota, immune responses and oxidative stress in sheep. When sheep were exposed to cold temperature and/or stronger wind speeds, the average daily gain (ADG) decreased (p < 0.05), and the abundance of Lachnospiraceae was significantly higher (p < 0.05). The acetate and propionate contents and the proportion of propionate in the rumen also significantly reduced (p < 0.05). The immunoglobulin G (IgG) and TH1-related cytokines in the blood were significantly lower (p < 0.05). However, antioxidant enzyme contents were significantly increased and the concentration of malondialdehyde (MDA) was reduced (p < 0.05). In a cold environment, the abundance of Lachnospiraceae in the rumen of sheep was highly enriched, and the decreasing of propionate might be one of the factors affecting the immunity of the animals, the sheep did not suffer from oxidative damage during the experiment.

AB  - Soil aggregation is deeply impacted by the quality of organic materials. However, the organic material features that control soil aggregation dynamics are still largely unknown. In this study, a total of 11 organic residues including vetch (alfalfa, hairy, and Chinese milk), straw (rice, maize, wheat, miscanthus, soybean, and sorghum) and manures (cattle and pig) were characterized by stoichiometric, biochemical and C functional features. The soil respiration, mean weight diameter (MWD) and glomalin-related soil protein (GRSP) levels were measured during 56 d of incubation. The results showed that stoichiometric features had no impact on soil respiration and aggregate stability except the N content. Residue decomposition was positively affected by soluble sugars but negatively affected by lignin and cellulose in the first 14 d (P < 0.05). Soluble sugars positively influenced the MWD up to 28 d, and cellulose continued this effect at 56 d (P < 0.05). Soil respiration and MWD were positively associated with alkyl and carbonyl C but negatively related to the alkyl and di-O-alkyl C fractions in the first two weeks, while adverse effects on the MWD were found at 56 d of incubation (P < 0.05). Organic residue input increased the GRSP level in the order of manure > straw > vetch. The GRSP content had a negative effect on the MWD up to 28 d (P < 0.05) but was not related at 56 d of incubation. Overall, high levels of soluble sugars of residues resulted in transient aggregate stability, but persistent aggregate stability was mainly contributed by the cellulose, O-alkyl C and di-O-alkyl C features.

AB  - Conservation translocations have traditionally focused on ecological aspects while overlooking or underestimating the importance of human dimensions. Here, we present a feasibility analysis for a conservation translocation that up front took a holistic approach by investigating both ecological and socio-economic suitability of reinforcing mountain bongo in Eburu National Forest, Kenya. From 2018 to 2019, we set up 50 cameras to detect mountain bongo and searched for secondary signs in a grid overlaying Eburu. We also conducted surveys with 200 households surrounding the forest and interviewed 300 students to understand local perceptions of and interactions with Eburu Forest and their desire for a mountain bongo translocation. We used data from camera trapping and secondary signs in a MaxEnt model to determine the amount and location of available habitat for a bongo conservation translocation. Camera traps recorded only five bongo events in the 2-year study, and MaxEnt models revealed that these antelopes were relegated to less than 2.5 km of available habitat. Socio-economic surveys indicated local support for the conservation of bongo and their habitat, and yet our camera traps uncovered threatening illicit activities that could jeopardize both bongo survival and any attempt at boosting the remnant population with captive-bred individuals. We report how we built on long-term community and stakeholder engagement to mitigate these threats and provide concrete recommendations for how to proceed with a conservation translocation in terms of both the biological aspects and continued efforts to integrate socio-economic needs and community engagement.

AB  - Rainfall manipulation experiments are a powerful tool to investigate how drought in isolation or combined with other stresses and disturbance drivers (e.g., fire, herbivory, heatwaves) affects diverse ecological processes. Using passive rainout shelters (intercepting a fixed amount of precipitation) coupled with control plots (receiving ambient precipitation), hundreds of studies have greatly advanced our understanding of drought impacts on plant and soil communities. Despite the existence of guidelines of how to properly design and implement experimental droughts, methodological issues still hinder a correct interpretation of some rainfall manipulation studies. Because of the use of improper metrics to detect drought intensity, it is sometimes unclear whether drought plots really experienced dry conditions and whether control plots experienced near-average mean annual precipitation throughout the experimental period. Here, we reanalyzed three recently published rainfall manipulation studies to illustrate how multi-scalar drought indices (such as SPEI) can be used to better quantify the intensity of the experimental drought imposed and to place it in the historical climate context of each studied area. We also provide additional guidelines to improve the experimental design of future rainfall manipulation studies.

AB  - 1. Secondary metabolites play an important role in plant adaptation, because they can mitigate biotic and abiotic environmental stresses. However, their production and allocation incur different costs and benefits, and are therefore subject to trade -offs, which are less studied.2. To understand large -scale geographic patterns of secondary metabolites, and their environmental drivers and trade -offs, we studied 39 natural populations of the perennial herb Japanese knotweed (Reynoutria japonica) along a large latitudinal gradient in China. We measured the concentrations of six polyphenols in leaves and rhizomes of R. japonica, and associated the variation in these metabolites with biotic and abiotic environmental factors as well as with functional plant traits and putative costs of secondary metabolites.3. We found that climate was an important driver of variation in secondary metabolites, both above-and below-ground. Remarkably, the patterns of association differed between leaves and rhizomes, as well as between putative low -cost versus high -cost compounds. While annual mean temperature was a stronger predictor of above-ground metabolites, annual precipitation was more frequently associated with variation in below-ground metabolites. Moreover, annual temperature was positively associated with high -cost metabolites, but negatively with low -cost metabolites. Above-ground secondary metabolites were generally more strongly associated with functional traits (e.g. specific leaf area) than below-ground metabolites, and in all cases the directions of correlation were opposite for lowcost versus high -cost metabolites above-ground. The patterns of association also varied with latitude such that leaf concentrations of low cost metabolites (quercetin) increased but those of high cost metabolites (resveratrol, piceid and emodin) decreased at higher latitudes. In rhizomes, in contrast, the concentrations of high cost metabolites (piceid and emodin) increased with latitude.4. Synthesis. Our findings indicate that allocation strategies differ between above and below-ground tissues of Reynoutria japonica. As latitude increases, R. japonica invests relatively more into below-ground metabolites. We propose that reduced high cost metabolites in the leaves at higher latitudes may help to conserve nutrients after defoliation, while maintaining high cost metabolites in rhizomes may be important for persistent allelopathic effects and resource conservation below-ground. The divergent patterns of above-and below-ground metabolite allocation thus likely reflect the multiple functions of metabolites and the plants' adaptation to different environments.

AB  - Anaplasma ovis is a tick-borne obligated intraerythrocytic bacterium that infects domestic sheep, goats, and wild ruminants. Recently, several studies have been carried out using 16S rRNA and msp4 genes to identify the genetic diversity of A. ovis. Instead of these genes, which are known to be highly stable among heterologous strains, Msp1a, which is accepted as a stable molecular marker to classify A. marginale strains, was used in A. ovis genetic diversity studies. The genetic diversity of A. ovis strains according to the Msp1a gene has not been extensively reported. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to examine the genetic diversity of A. ovis in goats specifically using analysis of the Msp1a gene. Blood samples were taken from the vena jugularis to the EDTA tubes from 293 randomly selected goats (apparently healthy) in the Antalya and Mersin provinces of Mediterranean region of Turkiye. The Msp1a gene of A. ovis was amplified in all DNA samples through the use of PCR, using a specific set of primers named AoMsp1aF and AoMsp1aR. Among the amplified products, well-defined bands with different band sizes were subjected to sequence analysis. The obtained sequence data were converted into amino acid sequences using an online bioinformatics program and the tandem regions were examined. The Msp1a gene of A. ovis was amplified in 46.1% (135 out of 293) of the goats. Through tandem analysis, five distinct tandems (Ao8, Ao18, Tr15-16-17) were identified, and it was found that three of these tandems (Tr15-16-17) were previously unknown and were therefore defined as new tandems. The study also involved examination of ticks from goats. It was observed that the goats in the area were infested with several tick species, including Rhipicephalus bursa (888/1091, 81.4%), R. turanicus (96/1091, 8.8%), Dermacentor raskemensis (92/1091, 8.4%), Hyalomma marginatum (9/1091, 0.8%), and R. sanguineus s.l. (6/1091, 0.5%). This study provides important data for understanding the genetic diversity and evolution of A. ovis based on tandem repeats in the Msp1a protein.

AB  - The invasion of the Asian longhorned tick, Haemaphysalis longicornis Neumann, into the United States poses a significant ecological, veterinarian, and public health threat. We conducted a comprehensive tick survey using standard tick flagging protocol for collection over 3 field seasons, March-August, and 56 surveyed sites to identify the presence of H. longicornis in the native ecosystem and prove its establishment according to USDA criteria. Of the total 56 state parks and wildlife management areas (WMA) surveyed, only one was found to be invaded by H. longicornis; detection of H. longicornis occurred at Buck Shoals Wildlife Management area in White County, GA. This site is maintained by the state of Georgia, has no agricultural animals present, and hosts a large white-tailed deer population. After the initial detection of H. longicornis in 2022, an additional field season occurred in 2023, where H. longicornis was confirmed as established based on USDA criteria. The increase in H. longicornis populations from 2021 to 2023 at Buck Shoals WMA points to the rapid spread of this tick within the environment. Our findings provide evidence of the rapid establishment of H. longicornis in the southern edge of suitability for this tick and within the native ecosystem beyond farmlands and private land.

AB  - Biological invasions are a great threat to biodiversity. Invasive plants targeted for control with introduced biological control agents are also exposed to indigenous herbivores in the invaded range. The density of native herbivores may affect the interactions between biological control agents and those native herbivores. We conducted a common-garden experiment to examine the interactive effects between a native natural enemy, the root-knot nematode Meloidogyne incognita (Kofold & White), and the leaf beetle Agasicles hygrophila Selma & Vogt, an introduced biological control agent of the invasive alligator weed, Alternantera philoxeroides (Mart.) Griseb., and its native congener Alternantera sessilis (Linn.) DC. We also manipulated the density of the two herbivores to examine the role of herbivore density in modulating plant-herbivore interactions. We found that (1) the performance of A. hygrophila on A. philoxeroides was inhibited by the nematode regardless of nematode initial density, (2) A. philoxeroides plants subject to herbivory by two beetles had more leaves and fine roots under the high nematode density than those not exposed to nematodes, and (3) the stem diameter of A. philoxeroides subject to herbivory by one beetle was smaller under the moderate nematode density than for plants not exposed to nematodes. However, under the high initial nematode density, both the native and introduced plants had fewer root-knots when co-exposed to herbivory by one beetle than when co-exposed to plants with two beetles. Under the high initial nematode density, A. philoxeroides produced more aboveground biomass but less root biomass than did plants not exposed to nematodes. However, A. sessilis plants exposed to the high initial nematode density produced more root biomass but produced similar aboveground biomass than did plants not exposed to nematodes. These findings suggest that the biological control efficiency of biological control agents may be potentially affected by other herbivores such as nematodes from the soil, and herbivores' densities may determine the nature of the interactive impacts among multiple herbivores on invasive plants.

AB  - Interactions between plants and leaf herbivores have long been implicated as the major driver of plant secondary metabolite diversity. However, other plant-animal interactions, such as those between fruits and frugivores, may also be involved in phytochemical diversification. Using 12 species of Piper, we conducted untargeted metabolomics and molecular networking with extracts of fruits and leaves. We evaluated organ-specific secondary metabolite composition and compared multiple dimensions of phytochemical diversity across organs, including richness, structural complexity, and variability across samples at multiple scales within and across species. Plant organ identity, species identity, and the interaction between the two all significantly influenced secondary metabolite composition. Leaves and fruit shared a majority of compounds, but fruits contained more unique compounds and had higher total estimated chemical richness. While the relative levels of chemical richness and structural complexity across organs varied substantially across species, fruit diversity exceeded leaf diversity in more species than the reverse. Furthermore, the variance in chemical composition across samples was higher for fruits than leaves. By documenting a broad pattern of high phytochemical diversity in fruits relative to leaves, this study lays groundwork for incorporating fruit into a comprehensive and integrative understanding of the ecological and evolutionary factors shaping secondary metabolite composition at the whole-plant level.

AB  - Previous studies suggested that the increase in surface chlorophyll a (Chl a) is due to nutrient upwelling or to the upward mixing of the subsurface Chl a maximum layer under the influence of tropical cyclones, while often ignoring the influence of the subsurface Chl a minimum layer and horizontal advection on Chl a. In this study, we show the important roles of the upward mixing of the subsurface Chl a minimum layer, horizontal advection, as well as the upwelling of the subsurface Chl a maximum layer, taking a looping super typhoon "Saola" in the northwest Pacific in August 2023 as an example. The temporal and spatial changes of Chl a and its physical properties were investigated by combining satellite, Argo, reanalysis, and model data. The results indicate that the combined effects of the upwelling of the subsurface Chl a maximum layer caused by wind stress curls and concurrent near-surface wind mixing were responsible for the surface Chl a increase in the looping area during the typhoon, while the 13% increase in the depth-integrated Chl a after the typhoon is mainly due to the nutrients brought by upwelling and subsequent biochemical processes. In the edge area affected by the typhoon, the surface Chl a decrease during the typhoon was mainly due to the upward mixing of the subsurface Chl a minimum layer (the effect of upwelling in this area is relatively weak). Furthermore, the horizontal advection led to a continuous surface Chl a decrease in the edge area after the typhoon. These findings could enhance understanding of Chl a dynamics post-tropical cyclones, aiding marine ecosystem prediction.

AB  - Dating bone collagen has been problematic in the Argentinean Pampas. Many bone samples do not have collagen or have poor preservation giving collagen of questionably quality, in many cases it is contaminated by humic substances. The combination of these factors has produced suspicious results, leading to the proposition of the Holocene survival in the region of the extinct Pleistocene megamammals such as the Megatherium Holocene ages from the Campo Laborde site. However, new dates from the same sample, purified from humates with ?-2 resin, gave results of -10,650 14C years BP. In this article, we apply different methodological procedures (chemical, geoarchaeological and taphonomic analysis) in order to reconstruct the formation at the Campo Laborde the site and identify the processes and agents that affected its chronology. The previously obtained Early Holocene ages of megafauna bones resulted from the interrelation of various factors as physical and chemical weathering, humification processes linked to pedogenesis, and diagenetic processes. In sum, they caused the degradation of collagen and the subsequent contamination by fulvic acids from the overlaying soil, which classic pretreatment techniques could not remove. We conclude that the obtained results do not support the Holocene survival of the megafauna in the Pampas.

AB  - Simple Summary Simple Summary: Local breeds of pigs often do not require special housing and feeding conditions. This makes it possible to obtain high-quality meat products under eco-friendly conditions. The Livni breed is a local Russian pig breed, which is the only one adapted to pasture-based housing and produces pork of excellent quality in environmentally friendly conditions. We evaluated the genetic diversity of the Livni breed in comparison with the Large White and Landrace breeds and investigated changes in the Livni breed populations' structure over the period from the 1970s to the present, using whole-genome single nucleotide polymorphisms. Both the museum and modern Livni pig populations are characterized by higher genetic diversity and were subject to less selection pressure than commercial pig populations. Present-day populations of the Livni pigs have retained their historical genomic components despite the use of commercial breeds in breeding efforts. This suggests their potential suitability for future breeding programs.Abstract The pig industry is usually considered an intensive livestock industry, mainly supported by hybrid breeding between commercial pig breeds. However, people's pursuit of a more natural environment and higher meat quality has led to an increasing demand for eco-friendly and diverse pig feeding systems. Therefore, the importance of rearing and conserving local pig breeds is increasing. The Livni pig is a local breed with good adaptability to the environmental and fodder conditions in central Russia. In this study, we aimed to analyze the genetic diversity and population structure of Livni pigs using whole-genome single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) data. We utilized the Porcine GGP HD BeadChip on genotype samples from old (n = 32, 2004) and modern (n = 32, 2019) populations of Livni pigs. For the museum samples of Livni pigs (n = 3), we extracted DNA from their teeth, performed genomic sequencing, and obtained SNP genotypes from the whole-genome sequences. SNP genotypes of Landrace (n = 32) and Large White (n = 32) pigs were included for comparative analysis. We observed that the allelic richness of Livni pigs was higher than those of Landrace and Large White pigs (AR = 1.775-1.798 vs. 1.703 and 1.668, respectively). The effective population size estimates (NE5 = 108 for Livni pigs, NE5 = 59 for Landrace and Large White pigs) confirmed their genetic diversity tendency. This was further supported by the length and number of runs of homozygosity, as well as the genomic inbreeding coefficient (almost twofold lower in Livni pigs compared to Landrace and Large White pigs). These findings suggest that the Livni pig population exhibits higher genetic diversity and experiences lower selection pressure compared to commercial pig populations. Furthermore, both principal component and network tree analyses demonstrated a clear differentiation between Livni pigs and transboundary commercial pigs. The TreeMix results indicated gene flow from Landrace ancestors to Livni pigs (2019) and from Large White ancestors to Livni pigs (2004), which was consistent with their respective historical breeding backgrounds. The comparative analysis of museum, old, and modern Livni pigs indicated that the modern Livni pig populations have preserved their historical genomic components, suggesting their potential suitability for future design selection programs.

AB  - Soil drought and rehydration have an immense impact on plant physiology and productivity, whereas the response of plant-microbe interactions to varied water availability remains largely elusive. In this study, two tea (Camellia sinensis L.) cultivars, Longjing43 and Yingshuang, were subjected to drought followed by rehydration. Soil drought significantly induced the elongation of taproots in the Yingshuang cultivar after two weeks of drought. Moreover, the four-week drought significantly reduced the root dry mass and root nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium concentrations in both tea cultivars. Two-week rehydration recovered the root potassium concentration in the two tea cultivars, revealing the rapid response of root potassium levels to water conditions. Drought and rehydration also resulted in shifts in rhizosphere microbial diversity. A four-week drought reduced microbial alpha diversity in Longjing43 but not in the Yingshuang cultivar, and rehydration was effective in restoring alpha diversity in Longjing43. The rhizosphere microbial community tended to recover to the initial stages after rehydration in Longjing43 but not in the other cultivar. In addition, 18 microbial genera were identified as the featured microbial taxa in response to varied water availability, and a rare genus Ignavibacterium was significantly increased in the Longjing43 cultivar by rehydration after a four-week drought. Furthermore, root nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium levels, and dry mass were positively correlated with the microbial alpha diversity, while the taproot length was negatively correlated, suggesting the crucial role of plant-microbe interactions in response to drought and rehydration. Moreover, the root phosphorus concentration and taproot length also had significant effects on microbial beta diversity, further confirming their effects on the community structure of the rhizosphere microbiome. Overall, this study provides insights into the effects of drought on plant-microbe interactions in the rhizosphere of tea plants. These findings are important for harnessing the roles of the tea rhizosphere microbiome under drought.

AB  - The Community Multiscale Air Quality (CMAQ) model can predict air pollutant concentrations at every predetermined location but usually suffers from considerable systematic bias. By post-process the CAMQ simulations with ground observations, K-means-cluster-Observation-examiner-Boundary-denoiser (KOB) model was developed as an unsupervised hybrid model, to segment regions by capturing spatial dependencies of CMAQ time-series and systematically reduce the bias of CMAQ simulations. The KOB model was then applied in 2019 to improve the CMAQ predictions of respirable suspended particulates (RSP) concentrations in the Pearl River Delta (PRD) region of southern China. Compared to the CMAQ simulations, the KOB model is implemented with hourly CMAQ simulations and significantly improves the 1-h predictions of RSP at all stations, with the index of agreement (IOA) increasing from 0.70 to 0.86 and average root mean square error (RMSE) reducing from 28.4 to 20.0 mu g/m(3). A better agreement was also achieved between the monthly average RSP from predictions using the KOB model and ground observations, with IOA increased from 0.87 to 0.93 and RMSE decreased from 12.4 to 8.2 mu g/m(3). In addition, the capability of the KOB model to predict extreme pollution was greatly improved, with the RMSE reduced from 76.3 to 50.8 mu g/m3. Furthermore, the improvement was identified not only for the next 1-h predictions, but also for the predictions in the next 6 h and after 6 h the SBC method outperforms the KOB model. Through data fusion, our hybrid clustering model can achieve robust real-time air quality forecasting.

AB  - Phenological mismatches between migratory birds and food availability driven by global warming have been found to influence the fitness and population dynamics of several herbivorous goose species in Arctic breeding sites. However, the effect of phenological mismatches at wintering sites have been inadequately studied. We used long-term data to explore the consequences of water regime changes on phenological mismatch (i.e., days between arrival of geese and timing of the optimal Normalized Difference Vegetation Index [NDVIopt]) and detect the relative role of the mismatch as a driver of annual variations in abundance and distribution of the Lesser White-fronted Goose Anser erythropus (a vulnerable species on the IUCN Red List) in East Dongting Lake, which is the one of this species' largest wintering sites worldwide. The NDVI of the Carex meadow (i.e., the dominant vegetation in East Dongting Lake wetland and also the major food resource for the geese) was used as the phenology metric. Results showed that the water recession pattern greatly influenced food conditions when geese arrived at the site. Early water recession led to significantly higher NDVI, whereas late water recession led to significantly lower NDVI than did the optimal water recession. However, the suitable habitat area was significantly larger under the optimal water recession pattern. Both early and late water level recessions caused greater mismatches and resulted in lower geese abundance and a more concentrated distribution. NDVI was positively correlated with aboveground biomass and negatively correlated with N% of Carex spp. High biomass and low N% related to high NDVI caused by early water recession may indicate unfavorable food conditions at the time that geese arrive and reduced sustainable food availability in mid-winter, while a low NDVI and limited habitat area caused by late water recession may indicate an insufficient food supply. In conclusion, non-optimal water recession led to a greater phenological mismatch and resulted in limited habitat quality (e.g., lower leaf N%) under early water recession but limited habitat quantity (e.g., smaller habitat area and lower aboveground biomass) under late water recession, and ultimately threatened the Lesser White-fronted Goose. Our results contributed to explaining the decline of the Lesser White-fronted Goose population in this wintering site.

AB  - Feasting played an important role in cementing social bonds between prehistoric communities. At Early Neolithic Asiab, western Iran, ceremonial feasting is evidenced by the butchered skulls of nineteen wild boars (Sus scrofa), an animal that was not commonly hunted in the region at the time. Here we use microscopic dental growth patterns to guide geochemical analyses of five wild boar teeth from Asiab and examine the geographical scope from which the animals derived. Our dataset includes 165 stable oxygen isotope values, 107 strontium isotope ratios, and Barium concentration maps. The findings indicate that despite Asiab's location in an environment favourable to wild boars, the animals used for ceremonial feasting originated from a wide geographical catchment, with at least some necessitating transport over substantial distance across mountainous terrain. This deepens our understanding of the effort invested by the participating pre-agricultural communities for celebrating social connectivity across the wider landscape.

AB  - The local populations of relict plant taxa living near the limits of their geographical range are particularly vulnerable to extinction. For example, Salix lapponum is one of the rarest and most endangered glacial relicts in Western and Central Europe. In Poland, the number of its sites has dramatically decreased over the past few decades, prompting us to take conservation measures focused on saving endangered populations. During a field experiment aimed at the reconstruction of the downy willow population in the Knyszyn Forest (NE Poland), 730 individuals of the species were planted in four different natural sites. The seedlings were obtained by micropropagation from parts of vegetative individuals taken from the most abundant population of this species in eastern Poland (Lake Bikcze). The success of the reintroduction, measured by the number of individuals that survived 2-3 years in the wild and took up growth, was about 67%, however, with low flowering efficiency (7.5%). Additionally, monitoring showed significant differences in plant survival and growth rates under different habitat conditions prevailing at the site and with different cover from competing species, especially tall grasses. However, the restoration projects for relict shrub species should include periodic removal of competing plants and protection of plants from trampling and browsing by herbivorous mammals to increase reintroduction success.

AB  - Reef halos are rings of bare sand that surround coral reef patches. Halo formation is likely to be the indirectly result of interactions between relatively healthy predator and herbivore populations. To reduce the risk of predation, herbivores preferentially graze close to the safety of the reef, potentially affecting the presence and size of the halo. Reef halos are readily visible in remotely sensed imagery, and monitoring their presence and changes in size may therefore offer clues as to how predator and herbivore populations are faring. However, manually identifying and measuring halos is slow and limits the spatial and temporal scope of studies. There are currently no existing tools to automatically identify single reef halos and measure their size to speed up their identification and improve our ability to quantify their variability over space and time. Here we present a set of convolutional neural networks aimed at identifying and measuring reef halos from very high-resolution satellite imagery (i.e., similar to 0.6 m spatial resolution). We show that deep learning algorithms can successfully detect and measure reef halos with a high degree of accuracy (F1 = 0.824), thereby enabling faster, more accurate spatio-temporal monitoring of halo size. This tool will aid in the global study of reef halos, and potentially coral reef ecosystem monitoring, by facilitating our discovery of the ecological dynamics underlying reef halo presence and variability.

AB  - Deep-sea cephalopods are diverse, abundant, and poorly understood. The Cirrata are gelatinous finned octopods and among the deepest-living cephalopods ever recorded. Their natural feeding behaviour remains undocumented. During deep-sea surveys in the Arctic, we observed Cirroteuthis muelleri. Octopods were encountered with their web spread wide, motionless and drifting in the water column 500-2600 m from the seafloor. Individuals of C. muelleri were also repeatedly observed on the seafloor where they exhibited a repeated, behavioural sequence interpreted as feeding. The sequence (11-21 s) consisted of arm web spreading, enveloping and retreating. Prey capture happened during the enveloping phase and lasted 5-49 s. Numerous traces of feeding activity were also observed on the seafloor. The utilization of the water column for drifting and the deep seafloor for feeding is a novel migration behaviour for cephalopods, but known from gelatinous fishes and holothurians. By benthic feeding, the octopods benefit from the enhanced nutrient availability on the seafloor. Drifting in the water column may be an energetically efficient way of transportation while simultaneously avoiding seafloor-associated predators. In situ observations are indispensable to discover the behaviour of abundant megafauna, and the energetic coupling between the pelagic and benthic deep sea.

AB  - Feed efficiency is one of the most important economic traits in animal production. Improving feed efficiency through genetic selection or other approaches will reduce production costs and mitigate environmental impacts. Residual feed intake (RFI) has some advantages over traditional feed efficiency metrics as a selection criterion for improving feed efficiency, because it is not a ratio and unrelated to growth. In this study, high RFI (HRFI) and low RFI (LRFI) Jian carp (Cyprinus carpio var. Jian) were tested for feed efficiency traits and serum biochemical indices. No significant differences were observed in the growth rates between HRFI and LRFI group, but daily feed intake of LRFI was significantly lower than that of the HRFI group. The results indicated that significantly higher content of triglyceride (TG) and total cholesterol (T-CHO) in the LRFI group was significantly correlated with RFI. We also selected HRFI and LRFI carp for transcriptomic analysis to determine differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in the liver tissues of 12 individuals. A total of 830 DEGs were identified between HRFI and LRFI group, of which 486 genes were up-regulated and 344 genes were down-regulated. Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment analysis revealed that DEGs were mainly enriched in fatty acid metabolism, ErbB signaling pathway, phosphatidylinositol signaling system, and autophagy. Lipid metabolism and autophagy-related genes, were considered candidate genes that played a crucial role in regulating feed efficiency. Taken together, these results indicated that differences in RFI affect Jian carp metabolism and cell fate, and that alterations in fatty acid metabolism and autophagy are key physiological modes of regulation in low RFI Jian carp. Our data provide valuable candidate genes and candidate pathways, which will help to study the molecular mechanisms of feed efficiency in carp.

AB  - The Inner Asian Mountain Corridor (IAMC) acted as a crossroads of trans-Eurasian exchange since approximately 6000 cal.yr BP. The history of the introduction and utilization of crops and livestock in the area has been intensively discussed, while geographical-temporal variations of human activities and subsistence strategies remain unclear. Here we report new zooarchaeological data and radiocarbon dates from the Naba Cemeteries, revealing herbivorous livestock were predominant animal resource during both the Bronze and Early Iron Ages, and sheep/goat and horse were paramount sacrificial animals in these two periods, respectively. In tandem with published radiocarbon dates, zooarchaeological and archaeobotanical data from IAMC's prehistoric sites, we detect humans mainly engaged in hunting-gathering games in the IAMC during 8000-5000 cal. yr BP. During 5000-4000 cal. yr BP, the territory of agro-pastoral groups evidently expanded in the IAMC with a hotspot in the Altai Region, and wheat and barley were introduced into the area. In the following two millennia, herding became an economic mainstay, and cultivations of crops were ubiquitous in the IAMC's oases. We argue that prehistoric human activities in the IAMC were mainly affected by agro-pastoral expansions associated with exchanges across the Eurasia, which was likely promoted by climate change.

AB  - African elephant populations are under substantial anthropogenic pressure, but these are not spatially homogenous. Elephant densities are high in parts of southern Africa, leading to conflict with human populations. Conservationists working to mitigate impacts of human-elephant conflict (HEC) will turn to mechanisms or incentives to achieve this, mostly financial (such as compensation, or income generation through tourism). Little is known about the attitudes of stakeholders' (such as farmers) toward financial incentives used to mitigate conflict. Here we carried out a content analysis of stakeholder evaluative expression, or valence, using reports from the southern African news media. We sourced 428 separate news articles over the past ten years, and quantitatively assessed stakeholder valence on the financial mechanisms used to mitigate human-elephant conflict. We found that stakeholder attitudes or valence differed across countries and that stakeholders were generally positive, even with regard to controversial mechanisms such as trophy hunting. Our work has some implication for conservation policy.

AB  - Populations of Reeves' muntjac (Muntiacus reevesi) have become well established in central, southern and eastern England as a result of introduction and colonisation. Although it is widely acknowledged as a species capable of damaging conservation woodland, information on its impacts has often been difficult to unravel because of the presence of other species of deer. In the county of Cambridgeshire, however, it is the most abundant and widespread species, allowing the nature and extent of its impacts to be described in woods where other deer are absent or rare. This article reviews published information and presents new analysis of data. The muntjac has significantly impacted a substantial proportion of conservation woodlands in the county, forming especially high densities in larger woods which are often designated as Sites of Special Scientific Interest. Management by means of fencing and particularly by culling has proved effective in reducing impacts by muntjac in individual woods and in the county as a whole. Timescales of colonisation leading up to causing impacts are also discussed to provide information to assist decision making in other regions or countries where muntjac are currently colonising or may colonise in the future.

AB  - Since its introduction to the Americas in the early 20th century, the wild boar (Sus scrofa) has affected Brazilian ecosystems and may have contributed to the spread of zoonotic diseases, especially rabies. Its interactions with the common vampire bat (Desmodus rotundus) can increase the risk of rabies transmission. These interactions remain poorly documented, particularly in the S & atilde;o Francisco Forest State Park, a conservation unit in the north of Paran & aacute;. In this study, we used camera traps to record three interactions between D. rotundus and S. scrofa, revealing a potential new route for zoonotic spread. Urbanization expansion and forest fragmentation further raise the risk of rabies transmission to animals and humans. Our findings highlight the need for policies and strategies to control wild boar populations and monitor vampire bats to protect public and environmental health in the region.

AB  - Due to their biological characteristics, elasmobranchs are highly vulnerable to overfishing and habitat degradation. Environmental pollution has also been shown to increasingly affect elasmobranch microbiota composition, yet studies in this area remain scarce. This study aimed to provide a baseline assessment of enteric bacterial species detected in various shark and ray species from the Brazilian Amazon Coast. Enterobacteria samples were collected through cloacal smears from elasmobranchs, cultured, isolated, and biochemically identified (e.g., Vibrio, Aeromonas, Enterobacterales). Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays were conducted to identify Aeromonas spp. pathotypes. The most frequently detected enteric bacteria were Klebsiella pneumoniae (47%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (38%), Citrobacter freundii (22%), and Serratia sp. (13%). Less commonly detected species included Plesiomonas shigelloides, Vibrio gazogenes, and Yersinia pseudotuberculosis (<= 25%), categorized as rare among the assessed elasmobranchs. Notably, several bacterial species identified in this study (e.g., Acinetobacter baumannii, Klebsiella ozaenae, Klebsiella rhinoscleromatis, Pseudomonas luteola, Salmonella choleraesuis, Vibrio gazogenes, and Yersinia pseudotuberculosis) are reported for the first time in Brazilian elasmobranchs. Many of these bacteria are opportunistic pathogens to both animals and humans, posing potential risks of disease to colonized elasmobranchs and to humans who consume their meat. These findings underscore ecological and public health concerns within a One Health framework, highlighting the need for further research and monitoring.

AB  - The essential point of current study was to investigate the effect of a Fenton -like system established by oxalic acid and Fe(II) on gas emission, organic matter decomposition and humification during composting. Branches were pretreated with Fenton reagents (0.02 M FeCl2 & sdot;4H2O + 1.5 M H2O2) and then adding 10 % oxalic acid (OA). The treatments were marked as B1 (control), B2 (Fenton reagent), B3 (10% OA) and B4 (Fenton -like reagent). The results collected from 80 d of composting showed that adding Fenton -like reagent benefited the degradation of organic substances, as reflected by the total organic carbon and dissolved organic carbon, and the maximum decomposition rate was observed in B4. In addition, the Fenton -like reagent could improve the synthesis of humus characterized by complex and stable compounds, which was consistent with the spectral parameters (SUVA254, SUVA280, E253/E203 and Fourier transform -infrared indicators) of DOC. Furthermore, the functional microbial succession performance and linear discriminant effect size analyses provided microbial evidence of humification improvement. Notably, compared with the control, the minimum value of CH4 cumulation was reported in B4, which decreased by 30.44 %. Concluded together, the addition of a Fenton -like reagent composed by OA and Fe(II) is a practical way to improve the humification. Furthermore, the mechanisms related to the promotion of humification should be investigated from free radicals, functional genes, and metabolic pathways.

AB  - Most Central African rainforest canopies consist of light-demanding tree species that hold high commercial value but also suffer locally from regeneration deficits, raising concerns about the sustainability of logging. Regen-eration is influenced by factors such as past perturbations (including human activity), mating systems, and seed/ pollen dispersal processes that impact demographic, spatial, and genetic structures within populations. To gain a better understanding of these interactions, we studied the spatial distribution and trunk diameter structure of Cylicodiscus gabunensis (Fabaceae) -a wind-dispersed, insect-pollinated, timber species -in three plots ranging from 400 to 839 ha situated in various environmental contexts (e.g. forest types and elephant densities) across Central Africa. We also genotyped adults and juveniles using microsatellite markers to analyze the spatial genetic structure of each population and infer the selfing rate, seed and pollen dispersal capacities and selection gra-dients using the 'neighborhood model'. The selfing rate was low (3 - 4 %), and seed dispersal distances (ds = 184 m) were much shorter than pollen dispersal distances (dp > 2 km). The three populations displayed contrasted spatial, demographic and genetic structures. One population showed no spatial aggregation or genetic structure, and a multimodal diameter structure indicating pulses of regeneration events. Two populations showed strong spatial aggregation and genetic structures. One exhibited a unimodal diameter structure indicating one ancient pulse of regeneration, while the other displayed a 'reverse J-shaped' diameter structure, typical of ongoing regeneration. In the latter, reproductive success appeared leptokurtic, three mother trees accounting for over 90 % of the regeneration and no tree below the minimum cutting diameter implemented by logging companies had offspring. The idiosyncratic nature of population characteristics observed in C. gabunensis suggests that, for sustainable management, a nuanced approach is needed. This involves protecting productive seed trees in areas where natural regeneration is occurring and actively supporting regeneration in areas exhibiting deficits, especially in contexts with low elephant densities.

AB  - The objective of this study was to assess N dynamics in the soil, and the response in regard to dry matter yield (DM yield; kg.DM.ha(-1)), N yield (g.N.m(-2)) and N concentration (g.N.kg(-1) DM) under urine patches and dung pats and in the affected zone of the grassland soil over 304 days. The amount of N under the urine and dung patches increased until day 10 and then started to decrease until the end of the experiment, reaching control treatment levels. The DM yield in the urine patch zone and the 0-10 cm zone around the dung pat was higher than in the control treatment throughout the evaluated period, while in the 0-30 cm zone around the urine patch and the 10-20 cm zone around the dung pat the DM yield was negatively affected by the application of excreta. The maximum accumulated N yield was up to two times higher than the control in the 0-10 cm zone of the dung pat, while the mean concentration of N throughout the period was 42% higher than the control for the "urine patch" zone and 47% higher in the 0-10 cm area around the dung pat. The total absorbed N was 19% and 15% for urine and dung excreta, respectively. Further research is needed to explain the variables that might affect the results obtained, and it is necessary to evaluate the botanical composition as a factor that contributes to this effect.

AB  - Soil fertility is understood to act in many indirect ways, in addition to directly providing nutrients to plants. Given that higher order indirect interactions frequently are key to understanding community structure, it would be natural to expect that indirect mutualisms should be as important as other interactions in generating such structure. Although mutualisms are ubiquitous in nature, exploring the myriad ways in which they interconnect with other elements of a system is less common. That soil fertility has an indirect effect on community structure is well known, suggests that soil fertility may be important in determining the effect of mutualisms on the structure of the ecological communities in which they are embedded. Here we report on a laboratory study that specifically examines the direct connection between the behavior of a mutualist and nutritional properties of the soil. We tested the effects of soil fertilization (high, medium and low levels) on the Azteca seriseasur-Coccus viridis mutualism on coffee plants in Mexico. We found that ants foraged significantly more on plants that were infected with C. viridis over control plants. Moreover, ants preferred to tend C. viridis on high fertilized over medium and low fertilized plants. This study highlights the importance of the links between soil nutrient properties and their effects on a key ant-hemipteran mutualism, illustrating the cascading effects on other interactions involving this keystone ant species.

AB  - Palms, like all plants, show coevolutionary relationships with animals that have been traditionally categorized as mutualistic (seed dispersers and pollinators) or antagonistic (seed predators). This dual perspective, however, has prevented a full understanding of their true interactions with some animal groups, mainly those that do not ingest entire fruits. One clear example is parrots, which have been described to use palm species as feeding resources, while their role as seed dispersers has been largely neglected. Here, we combined fieldwork data with information from the literature and citizen science (i.e., naturalists and nature photographers) on parrot foraging ecology worldwide to evaluate the spatial and taxonomic extent of parrot-palm interactions and to identify the eco-evolutionary factors involved. We identified 1,189 interactions between 135 parrots and 107 palm species in more than 50 countries across the six realms where palms are present as natives or introduced. Combining this information, we identified 427 unique parrot-palm interacting pairs (i.e., a parrot species interacting with a palm species). Pure antagonistic interactions (i.e., parrots just preying on seeds or eating or destroying their non-reproductive parts) were less common (5%) than mutualistic ones (i.e., parrots benefiting by partially preying on the seed or fruit or consuming the pulp of the fruit or the flower but also contributing to seed dispersal and, potentially, pollination; 89%). After controlling for phylogeny, the size of consumed seeds and parrot body mass were positively related. Seed dispersal distances varied among palm species (range of estimated median dispersal distances: 9-250 m), with larger parrots dispersing seeds at greater distances, especially large fruits commonly categorized as megafauna anachronisms (>4 cm length). Although parrot-palm interactions are widespread, several factors (e.g., social behavior, predation fear, food availability, or seasonality) may affect the actual position of parrots on the antagonism-mutualism continuum for different palm species and regions, deserving further research. Meanwhile, the pervasiveness of parrot-palm mutualistic interactions, mainly involving seed dispersal and pollination, should not be overlooked in studies of palm ecology and evolution.

AB  - In present study, the taxonomic variation of antibiotic resistant bacteria (ARB) in pig manure (PM) composting with coconut shell biochar (CSB) and bamboo biochar (BE) addition was investigated. The experiment was divided into three treatments: T1 (as control or without biochar amendment), T2 was added 10% coconut shell biochar and T3 supplemented with 10% bamboo biochar. The initial feed stock were properly homogenized using a mechanical crusher. PM and wheat straw (INS) were mixed in a 5: 1 dry weight ratio to adjust the initial carbon/nitrogen ratio 25:1, bulk density to similar to 0.5 (kg/L) and similar to 60% moisture content, respectively. This experiment was lasted for 42 days. The results indicated the bacterial communities in the three treatments were more different in terms of relative abundance and diversity of dominant bacteria. The control group had the highest abundance of Kingdome bacteria. The changes in ARE was noticed by variation in the relative abundances of Actinobacteria, Pmtsobacteria, Firrnicutes and Bacteroidota. At the cnd of composting (on day 42), the total RAs of ARB at the class, order, and family levels were considerably reduced in T2 and T3 by similar to 35.78-38.75%, 36.42-40.63% and 45.82-47.70%, respectively. But in T1 was decreased by 6.16-8.62%, 7.93-8.72% and 8.70-10.15%, as compared with the day 0 sample. However, the CSR was much more effective to reduce 55 to 60% of ARE than T3 or BB applied treatment has 40 to 42% ARE reduction, while control has certainly very less RAa of ARE reduction. Finally, the biochar amendment was significant approach to mitigate the total ARE abundance in compost and it's further used for organic farming purposes.

AB  - Monitoring big game populations is necessary for making well-informed management decisions. In the eastern Sierra Nevada in California, USA, mule deer (Odocoileus hemionus) herds have been monitored using traditional mark-resight methods on winter ranges since the 1990s. Although mark-resight methods work well for estimating abundance, animal capture for marking is expensive, invasive, and risky. We were motivated to evaluate fecal DNA-based capture-recapture for estimating abundance on winter ranges based on the effectiveness of this new technique in other populations in California. This method has been successful for estimating abundance when animals are concentrated around a required resource or pellets are collected from game trails, but it has not been evaluated using randomly selected transects on winter ranges where traditional methods work well. We compared precision (CV) and cost of fecal DNA capture-recapture surveys to aerial mark-resight surveys for estimating population abundance. In the Round Valley and Goodale study areas in the eastern Sierra Nevada, we conducted annual aerial mark-resight surveys and collected fecal pellet samples in Round Valley during winter 2020. We genotyped fecal DNA from pellets to identify unique individuals and sex. Population abundance estimates from aerial mark-resight surveys were more precise in Round Valley (CV = 6.6%) compared to abundance estimates from fecal DNA capture-recapture (CV = 20.4%). But based on simulations from Round Valley data, to obtain the same CV (CV = 10%), fecal DNA capture-recapture was about 63% less expensive than aerial mark-resight using very high frequency collars and 70% less expensive than aerial mark-resight using global positioning system collars. In contrast, fecal DNA capture-recapture did not succeed in the Goodale study area because of weather and logistical constraints. Determining which method is best depends on the situation, but fecal DNA capture-recapture provides another tool for estimating population size on winter range. We conclude that fecal DNA capture-recapture is a cost-effective alternative for estimating abundance of ungulates on winter ranges when weather is not limiting and when researchers can survey an adequate proportion of the study area and collect an adequate number of samples.

AB  - Potentially toxic elements (PTEs) are widespread pollutants in agricultural fields, presenting significant challenges to the maintenance of soil ecological functions while simultaneously reducing their concentrations. This study detailed the development of a high-strength reusable silicate magnetic composite biochar sphere (SMBCS) characterized by superior magnetic and adsorption properties, synthesized from natural minerals and biochar. The application of SMBCS over three consecutive remediation cycles led to reductions in cadmium (Cd), lead (Pb), and arsenic (As) concentrations in soil by 28.6%, 26.6%, and 42.9%, respectively, accompanied by corresponding decreases in bioavailability of 52.7%, 49.4%, and 39.4%. The accumulation of Cd, Pb, and As in rice seedlings cultivated in the remediated soil decreased by 79.50-85.47%, 38.05-38.99%, and 39.56-77.10%, respectively. However, the removal of essential mineral nutrients (Al, Fe, K, Ca, Mg, Si, N, Zn, Mn, and Cu) from the soil ranged from 3.26% to 36.28%, which adversely affected seed germination and rice seedling growth. Preplanting fertilization with rice straw (RS), pig manure (PM), biochar (RSB and PMB), and regenerated SMBCS (RSMBCS1 and RSMBCS2) effectively reduced Cd (0.20-45.40%) and Pb (8.70-35.36%) uptake while enhancing the bioavailability of mineral nutrients, thereby promoting crop growth and physiological traits. The SMBCSfertilization technique emerges as a viable approach for the removal of PTEs in agricultural soils, facilitating the restoration of ecological functions and ensuring safe agricultural production.

AB  - This research concentrated on the soil nematode communities inhabiting a reclaimed municipal waste landfill situated in Giedlarowa, southeastern Poland. The landfill, which was layered with natural soil in 2008 and cultivated with grass, served as the primary focus of the study. Samples for analysis were taken four times (October 2020 (Pf1), March 2021 (Pf2), October 2021 (Pf3), and March 2022 (Pf4)), with each time comprising three repetitions. The analysis was conducted employing microscopic examination, which enabled the identification of up to five trophic groups and species of plant-parasitic nematodes. During the assessment of nematode activity in the initial and subsequent growing seasons, it was found that Pratylenchus crenatus emerged as the predominant species among herbivorous nematodes in the plant-parasitic nematode (PPNs) community. Criconemoides informis, another nematode species, held a significant rank as well; their population during the third growing season formed the most substantial group among the PPN organisms dwelling in the soil. Nevertheless, interesting results were also obtained by populations of nematodes of the genus Hemicyclophora and Loofia, which were characterized by high densities. The analyzed soil environment showcased a C:N ratio spanning from 0.69 to 3.13. Furthermore, the soil samples exhibited variations in phosphorus content (P2O5), ranging from 4.02 mg/100 g to 10.09 mg/100 g. Criconemoides informis, Longidorus attenuates, Mesocriconema spp., and Bitylenchus maximus exhibited a positive correlation with soil mineral levels of calcium (Ca) and magnesium (Mg).

AB  - For contributing to a better understanding of the phylogenetic position and evolutionary history of Turkish roe deer, mitochondrial DNA sequence data belonging to a population from Artvin, Turkey were introduced by this study. The cytochrome b (cyt b) and cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (COI) genes of mitochondrial DNA belonging to the four samples of Capreolus capreolus were partially sequenced and analyzed alongside the sequences obtained from GenBank. The cyt b and COI data sets included sequences that were 1059 and 646 bp long, respectively. The Turkish roe deer population in Artvin had a relatively low nucleotide diversity and high haplotype diversity. A total of two haplotypes were identified for cyt b, while three haplotypes were identified for COI. Of the haplotypes detected, two cyt b and two COI haplotypes were specific to Turkey. Molecular phylogenetic analyses; Maximum Likelihood (ML), Bayesian Inference (BI), and Network revealed topologies and evolutionary networks which were not definitely resolved. Consequently, Turkish roe deer haplotypes were intertwined with the roe deer haplotypes from Central Europe instead of forming an independent evolutionary clade, and were also, found genetically close to Central European haplotypes. According to the evolutionary dating analysis, the divergence of C. capreolus populations in Europe started at the beginning of the Pleistocene (approximately 2.72 mya). This analysis also demonstrated that the divergence of Turkish roe deer began at approximately 0.58 mya. Given the existence of, shared haplotypes, the relative positions of Turkish roe deer haplotypes in the topologies of the ML and BI phylogenetic trees and evolutionary networks, and the times of evolutionary divergence events within this species; the following results may be inferred: (1) roe deer individuals with the same genotype as those in Europe can also be found in areas further east, such as Turkey; (2) these could be considered to be representatives, which may have contributed to the formation and shaping processes of the known admixed genetic structure of European roe deer populations in Europe; and finally, (3) the roe deer populations may have probably entered Turkey from Europe when evolutionary divergence times based on BI analysis are considered.

AB  - The conservation of biodiversity and the balance between ecological and societal needs are critical but often contested global issues. Wildlife-vehicle collision (WVC) on vital infrastructure, especially linear infrastructure, remains a persistent challenge from policy to practice and poses a serious life-threatening implication to humans and other non-human lives. Addressing this issue effectively requires solutions that provide win-win outcomes from both ecological and societal perspectives. This study critically analyzes a decade of roadkill incidents along Nepal's longest East-West national highway, which passes through a biologically diverse national park in the western Terai Arc Landscape Area (TAL). Findings are drawn from field-based primary data collection of the period 2012-2022, secondary literature review, key informant interviews, and spatial analysis. The study reveals significant variations in roadkill incidence across areas and years. Despite Bardia National Park being larger and having a higher wildlife density, Banke National Park recorded higher roadkill rates. This is attributed to insufficient mitigation measures and law enforcement, more straight highway segments, and the absence of buffer zones between the core park and adjacent forest areas-only a road separates them. Wild boars (Sus scrofa) and spotted deer (Axis axis), the primary prey of Bengal tigers (Panthera tigris tigris), were the most frequently road-killed species. This may contribute to human-tiger conflicts, as observed in the study areas. Seasonal trends showed that reptiles were at higher risk during the wet season and mammals during winter. Hotspots were often located near checkpoints and water bodies, highlighting the need for targeted mitigation efforts such as wildlife crossings and provisioning wildlife requirements such as water, grassland, and shelter away from the regular traffic roads. Roadkill frequency was also influenced by forest cover and time of day, with more incidents occurring at dawn and dusk when most of the herbivores become more active in search of food, shelter, water, and their herds. The findings underscore the importance of road characteristics, animal behavior, and landscape features in roadkill occurrences. Effective mitigation strategies include wildlife crossings, speed limits, warning signs, and public education campaigns. Further research is needed to understand the factors in driving variations between parks and to assess the effectiveness of mitigation measures.

AB  - Simple Summary Yaks are an important for the economy and livelihood of local herders in the Tibetan Plateau and are their main source of income. They are mainly fed on natural pastures, especially during the warm season. Information on the effects of concentrate supplementation on the growth performance, rumen fermentation, and bacterial community composition of grazing yaks during the warm season is limited. Our study showed that concentrate supplementation increased the relative abundances of Firmicutes, Succiniclasticum, Prevotellaceae_UCG_003, Prevotellaceae_UCG_005, and Ruminococcus_1. Supplementation increased the average daily gain (ADG) and serum concentrations of glucose (GLU), total protein (TP), and aspartate aminotransferase (AST). Furthermore, the concentrations of ruminal ammonia-N (NH3-N), microbial protein (MCP), and volatile fatty acids (VFAs) increased in the supplement group. We concluded that supplementary feed improved ruminal fermentation, and altered the bacterial community composition in yaks during the warm season, thereby improving growth performance. This study aimed to evaluate the effects of concentrate supplementation on the growth performance, serum biochemical parameters, rumen fermentation, and bacterial community composition of grazing yaks during the warm season. Eight male yaks (body weight, 123.96 +/- 7.43 kg; 3-years) were randomly allocated to two treatments groups: grazing (n = 4, GY) and concentrate supplement group (n = 4, GYS). Concentrate supplementation increased the average daily gain (ADG) (p < 0.05). Glucose (GLU), total protein (TP), and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) serum concentrations were significantly higher in the GYS group than in the GY group (p < 0.05). Ammonia-N, MCP: microbial protein, and total volatile fatty acid concentrations were significantly higher in the GYS group than in the GY group (p < 0.01), whereas the pH and acetate: propionate values were significantly decreased (p < 0.01). The relative abundance of Firmicutes in the rumen fluid was significantly higher in the GYS group than in the GY group (p < 0.01). At the genus level, the relative abundances of Succiniclasticum, Prevotellaceae_UCG_003, Prevotellaceae_UCG_005, and Ruminococcus_1 were significantly greater in the GY group than in the GYS group (p < 0.01). In conclusion, concentrate supplementation improved yaks' growth potential during the warm season, improved ruminal fermentation, and altered core bacteria abundance.

AB  - The current scientific literature predominantly focuses on pilot-scale studies concerning the effectiveness of membrane covers in reducing gas emissions during cattle manure composting. Our study centers on the application of a leading market commercial membrane cover (ePTE-TEXcomm) and a locally manufactured one (ProfiCover (R)) at industrial processing levels, evaluating their efficacy in mitigating gas emission during the fifth day of the thermophilic phase. Taking into account material inhomogeneities, work environment impact, and efficiency, the results are characteristic of industrial-scale processes rarely discussed in the scientific literature. Our results, obtained with a portable gas sampler and FTIR spectroscopy measurements using corresponding standards, indicate that ePTE-TEXcomm manifested a reduction of 90.8% for NH3 and 59.6% for CO2. CH4 emissions increased, suggesting their potential entrapment. N2O and propane equivalent experienced reductions of 23.1% and 44.8%, respectively. On the other hand, ProfiCover (R) presented emission reductions for NH3 and CO2 of 93.3% and 85.9%, respectively. CH4, contrasting with ePTE-TEXcomm, showed a significant reduction of 55.6%. N2O and propane equivalent followed with reductions of 56.7% and 84.5%, respectively. All of this divergence in performance implies a potential trade-off in emission reduction efficacy between the covers. Knowledge sharing between researchers and industry partners is key to translating these technologies into widespread adoption.

AB  - Insect-associated microbes, including pathogens, parasites, and symbionts, influence the interactions of herbivorous insects and pollinators with their host plants. Moreover, herbivory-induced changes in plant resource allocation and defensive chemistry can influence pollinator behavior. This suggests that the outcomes of interactions between herbivores, their microbes and host plants could have implications for pollinators. As epizootic diseases occur at high population densities, pathogen and parasite-mediated effects on plants could have landscape-level impacts on foraging pollinators. The goal of this minireview is to highlight the potential for an herbivore's multitrophic interactions to trigger plant-mediated effects on the immunity and health of pollinators. We highlight the importance of plant quality and gut microbiomes in bee health, and how caterpillars as model herbivores interact with pathogens, parasites, and symbionts to affect plant quality, which forms the centerpiece of multitrophic interactions between herbivores and pollinators. We also discuss the impacts of other herbivore-associated factors, such as agricultural inputs aimed at decreasing herbivorous pests, on pollinator microbiomes.

AB  - Australian cownose rays (Rhinoptera neglecta) and whitespotted eagle rays (Aetobatus ocellatus) are large myliobatiform rays that co-occur off temperate eastern Australia. Here, we performed stable-isotope analyses (delta C-13, delta N-15 and delta S-34) on fin clips of both species to gain insights into their trophic interactions and isotopic niches, and assess the effect of preservation (ethanol-stored versus frozen) on isotopic values of fin-clip tissue of R. neglecta. Linear mixed models identified species as the main factor contributing to variation among delta N-15 and delta S-34 values, and disc width for delta C-13. Bayesian ecological niche modelling indicated a 57.4% to 74.5% overlap of trophic niches, with the niche of R. neglecta being smaller and more constrained. Because values of delta C-13 were similar between species, variation in isotopic niches were due to differences in delta N-15 and delta S-34 values. Linear mixed models failed to detect differences in isotopic values of ethanol-stored and frozen fin tissue of R. neglecta. This study provides the first examination of the trophic ecology of R. neglecta and the comparison of isotopic niche with A. ocellatus, which will facilitate future research into the trophic interactions of these species and aid better resource management.

AB  - Simple Summary: Ticks, as blood feeders and vectors of many diseases, can negatively impact livestock and human health, with potential economic impacts on the livestock industry. In this study, we documented the occurrence of four tick species (Hyalomma dromedarii, Hyalomma anatolicum, Rhipicephalus sanguineus, and Amblyomma lepidum) on camels, cows, sheep, and goats from three areas in the United Arab Emirates (UAE). Our findings indicated that H. dromedarii was the most prevalent tick species on camels. The other tick species were present at varying levels on hosts. Some of the tick species collected in this study are potential carriers of tick-borne diseases that are serious and sometimes fatal to humans and animals. Thus, there is a need for more research on ticks and tick-borne diseases in the UAE.
   Ticks are important arthropod vectors that serve as reservoirs of pathogens. Rapid urbanization and changes in animal breeding practices could be causing a rise in tick burden on animals. Studies on tick distribution on livestock and tick molecular diversity from the United Arab Emirates (UAE) are limited. The aim of this study was to (i) provide molecular and morphological identification of tick species, (ii) compare tick infestation between different hosts, (iii) compare tick infestation in relation to the sex of the host, and (iv) assess the prevalence of tick species on hosts. A total of 5950 ticks were collected from camels (4803 ticks), cows (651 ticks), goats (219 ticks), and sheep (277 ticks). Ticks were identified based on morphological characters at the species level using taxonomic keys. In addition, Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) amplification of the cytochrome oxidase subunit 1 (cox1) and 16S rRNA mitochondrial genes was used to identify ticks. Four species were confirmed based on molecular and morphological characterization, namely, Hyalomma dromedarii, Hyalomma anatolicum, Rhipicephalus sanguineus, and Amblyomma lepidum. Hyalomma dromedarii (94.3%) was the most abundant species, followed by H. anatolicum (32.8%). Camels were heavily infested (94%) with ticks as compared to cows (38%), sheep (37%), and goats (14%). Widespread occurrence of these four tick species in the UAE poses a risk of spreading tick-borne pathogens wherever the conditions of infection prevail.

AB  - Although the use of genetic analyses of sedimentary DNA to track changes in biodiversity has increased over the last decade, questions remain as to how well DNA captures past ecological conditions. Even less is known about how extracellular and intracellular DNA are archived in lake sediments and whether the two fractions yield similar information. Here we characterized the changes of micro-eukaryotic communities over the past similar to 200years in Cultus Lake (British Columbia, Canada), for which a rich body of limnological data and a pre-existing multi-proxy paleolimnological study exist. We generated and analyzed 18S rRNA gene amplicons and found that extracellular and intracellular DNA provided different insights, with the preservation of extracellular DNA compromised in sediments older than similar to 30years. Principal Coordinates and indicator species analyses based on intracellular DNA showed that changes in micro-eukaryotic diversity occurred at similar time periods as those identified with the classical paleolimnological study. For instance, decreases of Opisthokonta amplicons occurred during years with elevated numbers of sockeye salmon spawners, which might be associated with an increase of herbivory by juvenile sockeye salmon. Furthermore, two diatom species identified morphologically exhibited similar temporal dynamics to two diatom taxa identified genetically, suggesting that sedimentary DNA can track past diatom species changes as well as micro-eukaryotic community changes. Overall, our study provides insights into the use of extracellular and intracellular DNA in sedimentary records and showed that sedimentary DNA enriches our understanding of micro-eukaryotic community changes over centennial time scales.

AB  - Objectives Ancient hunter-gatherer diets were heterogeneous, varying substantially across time and space, and frequently showing considerable intrapopulation variation. The diet composition of these human groups depended primarily on resource availability, but also on the active selection of certain prey due to different bio-cultural factors. In this context, we explore resource availability, diet composition, and prey choice in the human populations of the Middle-Late Holocene from Northwest Patagonia. Material and Methods We employ species distribution models using current and zooarchaeological data to estimate species availability throughout Northwest Patagonia, and we use Bayesian stable isotope mixing models on a large number of samples to analyze human diet composition at the individual level during the Middle-Late Holocene. Finally, we calculate a prey selectivity index to address the different dietary choices of human individuals in the region. Results Our results show large differences in species available for consumption throughout the region, as well as a high dietary variation between human individuals, which is mainly related to their spatial location. Some species, such as guanaco, were widely distributed and consumed in the region. Notably, species of small mammals were actively selected in several areas, indicating greater importance in human diets than previously appreciated. Discussion Species availability does not appear as the only factor driving human diets in the region, since prey choice seems to have been a recurring phenomenon among these populations. The novel approach used in this study overcomes several limitations of previous studies employing isotopic analysis in prehistoric human diets, allowing new insights into the bioarchaeology of the region.

AB  - To investigate the effects of claw lesion types and bone mineral density on lameness in boars, the data of claw lesion score, gait score, and bone mineral density, measured by a Miniomin ultrasound bone densitometer, were collected from a total of 739 Duroc boars. Firstly, we discovered that the prevalence of claw lesions was as high as 95.26% in boars. The percentage of lameness of boars with SWE was higher than those with other claw lesions. Meanwhile, the results showed that the probability of lameness was higher in boars with lower bone mineral density (p < 0.05). Logistic regression models, including variables of boar age, body weight, serum mineral level, and housing type, were used to identify the influencing factors of bone mineral density in this study. The results found that bone mineral density increases with age before reaching a maximum value at 43 months of age, and begins to decrease after 43 months of age. Elevated serum Ca levels were significantly associated with an increase in bone mineral density (p < 0.05). Aside from the above findings, we also made an interesting discovery that boars in the individual pen model significantly increased bone mineral density compared to those in the individual stall model. In conclusion, claw lesions and bone mineral density were significantly associated with lameness. Age, serum Ca, and housing type are the potential influencing factors for bone mineral density in boars.

AB  - The production of small ruminant autochthonous breeds in the Centre region of Portugal is practiced in a semi-extensive husbandry system, exposing animals to parasitic infections. The main objective of this study was to estimate the prevalence of lungworm infection and identify risk factors. Fecal samples of 203 goats and 208 sheep from 30 herds were collected per rectum and subjected to the modified Baermann test. The overall prevalence of infection was 57.7%, significantly higher in goats (95.6%) than in sheep (20.7%) (p < 0.001). According to the binary logistic regression model, sheep dewormed with albendazole, mebendazole plus closantel, or ivermectin plus clorsulon presented a risk of Protostrongylidae infection 29.702, 7.426, or 8.720 times higher, respectively, than those dewormed with eprinomectin. Additionally, the presence of gastrointestinal parasites was investigated in 307 fecal samples using Mini-FLOTAC (R). The overall prevalence of infection was 86.3%, also significantly higher in goats (93.2%) than in sheep (79.9%) (p < 0.001). Strongyle-type eggs were the most frequently identified, both in sheep (69.8%) and goats (87.8%), followed by Eimeria oocysts (40.3% in sheep and 68.9% in goats). Considering the high prevalence and the burden of lungworm parasitic infection, it is urgent to determine its economic impact and the repercussions in animal health in the Centre region of Portugal to establish appropriate therapeutic guidelines.

AB  - Persian walnut (Juglans regia L., Juglandaceae), one of the essential nut crops, is affected by different diseases, including mite attacks which result in gall and erineum formation. As the proportion of leaf area covered by mite galls or erineum is typically relatively low, the impact on tree photosynthetic productivity is often considered minor, and no pest control management is usually suggested. However, the effect of erineum-forming mites on walnut photosynthesis might be disproportionately larger than can be predicted from the leaf area impacted. In the present study, we studied how the foliage photosynthetic characteristics, pigment contents, and stress-induced volatile organic compounds scaled with the severity of infection varied from 0% (control trees) to 9.9%, by erineum-forming mite Aceria erinea in J. regia. Both leaf net assimilation rate (up to 75% reduction) and stomatal conductance (up to 82%) decreased disproportionately, increasing infection severity. Leaf total chlorophyll and beta-carotene contents also decreased with infection severity, although the reduction was less than for photosynthetic characteristics (28% for chlorophyll and 25% for beta-carotene). The infection induced significant emissions of green leaves volatiles ((Z)-3-hexenol, (E)-2-hexenal, (Z)-3-hexenyl acetate and 1-hexanol), monoterpenes and the homoterpene 3-(E)-4,8-dimethyl-1,3,7-nonatriene, and these emissions scaled positively with the percentage of leaf area infected. These results collectively indicate that erineum-forming mite infection of walnut leaves results in profound modifications in foliage physiological characteristics that can significantly impact tree photosynthetic productivity.

AB  - Simple Summary The genome of domestic sheep (Ovis aries) harbors at least twenty-seven copies of enJSRVs, endogenous retroviruses (ERVs) highly related to the exogenous and pathogenic Jaagsiekte sheep betaretrovirus (JSRV). Interestingly, some of these loci are insertionally polymorphic, that is they are present only in some individuals or populations of their host species. This differential distribution of enJSRVs has provided important insights into tracing host and viral evolution. In this study, we report the first comparative fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) mapping of genetically characterized enJSRVs in domestic sheep (2n = 54) and river buffalo (Bubalus bubalis, 2n = 50), and reveal a high conservation of enJSRVs chromosome localization between these two species. Endogenous retroviruses (ERVs) are the remnants of ancient infections of host germline cells, thus representing key tools to study host and viral evolution. Homologous ERV sequences often map at the same genomic locus of different species, indicating that retroviral integration occurred in the genomes of the common ancestors of those species. The genome of domestic sheep (Ovis aries) harbors at least twenty-seven copies of ERVs related to the exogenous and pathogenic Jaagsiekte sheep retrovirus (JSRVs), thus referred to as enJSRVs. Some of these loci are unequally distributed between breeds and individuals of the host species due to polymorphic insertions, thereby representing invaluable tools to trace the evolutionary dynamics of virus populations within their hosts. In this study, we extend the cytogenetic physical maps of sheep and river buffalo by performing fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) mapping of twenty-three genetically characterized enJSRVs. Additionally, we report the first comparative FISH mapping of enJSRVs in domestic sheep (2n = 54) and river buffalo (Bubalus bubalis, 2n = 50). Finally, we demonstrate that enJSRV loci are conserved in the homologous chromosomes and chromosome bands of both species. Altogether, our results support the hypothesis that enJSRVs were present in the genomes of both species before they differentiated within the Bovidae family.

AB  - Deer are keystone hosts for adult ticks and have enabled the spread of tick distributions. The '4-Poster' deer bait station was developed by the United States Department of Agriculture to control ticks feeding on free-ranging deer. Although effective in certain scenarios, '4-Poster' deer treatment stations require the use of bait to attract deer to one location, which may cause increased deer disease transmission rates and habitat damage. To better understand and manage the impact of baited '4-Poster' stations on deer movements, we captured and GPS-monitored 35 deer as part of an integrated pest management project. Fifteen '4-Poster' stations were deployed among three suburban county parks to control ticks. To quantify the effects of '4-Poster' stations, we calculated deer movement metrics before and after feeders were filled with whole kernel corn, and we gathered information on visitation rates to feeders. Overall, 83.3% of collared deer visited a feeder and revisited approximately every 5 days. After feeders were refilled, collared deer were similar to 5% closer to feeders and conspecifics than before filling. Males used a higher percentage of available feeders and visited them more throughout the deployment periods. Although these nuanced alterations in behavior may not be strong enough to increase local deer abundance, in light of infectious diseases affecting deer populations and effective '4-Poster' densities, the core range shifts and clustering after refilling bait may be a cause for concern. As such, trade-offs between conflicting management goals should be carefully considered when deploying '4-Poster' stations.

AB  - Protected areas have been gazetted to protect natural resources and biodiversity, but evaluations of effectiveness rarely include measures of species population change. We compiled annual site-level spending and elephant population data for 102 protected areas conserving either savannah (Loxodonta africana) or forest (Loxodonta cyclotis) elephants, which showed a median annual population decline of -0.78% across the protected areas. Site-level population change was strongly associated with funding and government effectiveness. Annual funding deficits occurred in 78% of the protected areas, and when comparing necessary levels of annual spend to stabilize elephant populations, we estimate a US$1.5 billion annual funding deficit across all the protected areas. While financial investment can improve elephant conservation outcomes, there is still a need to identify where and how to best finance elephant poaching interventions, requiring a global commitment to improve the socioeconomic impacts of protected areas on local communities and reduce ivory demand.

AB  - Two species may share a mutualistic interaction if the benefits gained by the interaction outweigh the costs incurred. In this study, we tested experimentally how the identity of ants (pinned) and floral visitors of an extrafloral nectary (EFN)-bearing plant can affect plant fitness. We quantified ant activity and floral visitor visitation overlap over time, floral visitor behaviour, amount of floral resources collected, and plant fitness as influenced by the ant species identity in an EFN-bearing plant from Brazilian Cerrado savanna, Qualea multiflora (Vochysiaceae). We found that: (i) ant activity and floral visitation overlap greatly in time; (ii) floral visitors vary in their response to the presence of ants; (iii) different ant species have different impacts on floral visitors; (iv) ants affected the amount of floral resources collected by pollinators, but their levels were contingent on ant identity; and (v) plant fitness components (fruit production, seed weight, and seed size) were most strongly affected by the largest and most aggressive ant species. Our results suggest that the balance of the trade-off between the beneficial effects of ant protection against herbivorous insects and the negative consequences for plant fitness by deterring pollinators depends on the species identity of both the ants and the floral visitors to the plant.

AB  - Wild boar (Sus scrofa L., 1758), was once native to Eurasia, is currently one of the most widely distributed species in the world. Apart from its economic values, the species is considered as a pest (e.g., for rooting behavior, agricultural damages and influencing livestock) and vector for spreading diseases (e.g., swine fever) particularly by farmers, villagers, and epidemiologists. Global climate change has shown to influence population growth and geographical distributions in a wide range of species. Expanding our knowledge on the potential distribution of S. scrofa under current and future climate change conditions is useful for effective management strategies. For example, for managing human-wildlife conflicts, locating and controlling the spread of diseases, population control, and reducing ecological threats. Using the maximum entropy (MaxEnt) algorithm and geographic information system (GIS) techniques, we aimed at (i) modeling current known distribution and predict the potential distribution of S. scrofa in the northeast of Iraq; (ii) modeling potential future distribution of the species under climate change scenarios; and (iii) identifying the most relevant environmental predictors influencing the spatial distribution. Sus scrofa populations are mainly distributed in the mountainous areas, within the optimal altitude range of 750 -1250 m a.s.l. The range of contraction would be larger than the expansion range. Future distribution of the species would be toward the mountain forests of the east (mainly) and southeast of the Zagros Mountains where the forests are denser. Mixed oak forests and mosaic landscapes of grassland, shrubland, and croplands provide hideout, shade and abundant food choices for S. scrofa populations. Management strategies should focus primarily on the mixed forests and croplands, for locating and controlling the possible spread of diseases, population control, reducing ecological threats, and controlling human-wildlife conflicts. Current and future distribution maps (categorized maps) generated from the study provide invaluable baseline information for further research on the forest and mountain ecosystems in Iraq and across the Zagros Mountains.

AB  - The degree of dietary generalization versus specialization exhibited by populations can impact their ability to respond to changing environmental conditions. Naturally shed hair and epidermis are easily collected and may provide a suitable substrate for stable isotope analysis to assess trophic niche specialization. Whether fasting influences the isotopic composition of molted tissues has not been assessed. Here, we gauged the validity of using carbon (delta C-13) and nitrogen (delta N-15) isotope analysis of molted hair and the outermost epidermis as proxies to study the foraging ecology of southern elephant seals Mirounga leonina at Marion Island in the southern Indian Ocean. Similarity in both bulk tissue (delta C-13 and delta N-15) and amino acid (delta N-15) isotope values of molted tissues and whiskers known to reflect fasting confirmed that physiological changes associated with fasting influenced hair and epidermis isotope values. We recommend caution when using the isotopic composition of molted hair and epidermis to make ecological inferences regarding diet and/or movement. Despite these limitations, molted hair can be used to detect extreme foraging behaviors, which we show using an extensive data set of hair sampled from marked individuals (n = 331) that hauled out on Marion Island during the 2012-2013 annual pelage molt. Other factors, such as ontogenetic shifts in diet and potential environmental (baseline) isotopic variation, also influence hair delta C-13 and delta N-15 values, which complicates the use of isotopic data from molted tissues to assess the temporal consistency of an individuals' isotopic niche.

AB  - Wildlife conservation on private land is an important approach that is increasingly utilized to protect biodiversity and can help contribute to the 30 by 30 target of the Global Biodiversity Framework. In 2018, a Chilean non-profit conservation organization launched a land conservation programme aiming to build long-term partnerships with private landowners to protect critical habitat for threatened amphibians in Chilean Patagonia. Here we describe a new locality record of the micro-endemic, Endangered Barrio's frog Insuetophrynus acarpicus found at a site that joined the programme in 2020. Barrio's frog is ranked 11th in the list of Evolutionarily Distinct and Globally Endangered amphibians. Our systematic literature search showed that most aspects of the natural history and ecology of this species are unknown, limiting our ability to provide actionable science to inform its conservation. The newly described Barrio's frog population is the eighth known locality of this species and one of only three occurring within a protected area. Habitat quality assessments indicated optimal conditions for most of the measured habitat parameters in the high-gradient stream where the species occurs. This case study illustrates that long-term partnerships between private landowners and conservationists can be used as an effective tool to protect the habitat of highly threatened amphibians.

AB  - While the conservation of forest elephants is a global concern, human-elephant conflict (HEC), especially crop-raiding by elephants, is a serious threat to both human livelihoods and conservation efforts. However, only a few studies have explored elephant crop-raiding and related damage mitigation strategies in Central Africa's forest landscapes, which are characterized by low human and high animal densities and shifting cultivation practices. This study investigates HEC in rural Gabon, where human activities are limited, and local livelihoods are severely threatened by crop-raiding elephants. Through long-term ethnographic research and an in-depth analysis of damage mitigation practices by local people, the study unveils serious crop-raiding by elephants, leading to a significant change in the local lifestyle. Most households spend the majority of days in the field protecting crops, resulting in the village becoming almost empty. In addition to the physical burden of staying in poor living conditions, there is a considerable psychological burden for local people. Establishing effective elephant conservation systems requires understanding each local situation and evaluating the various costs to local people. To sustain livelihoods and address the challenge of HEC, it is crucial for local communities and various stakeholders to act collectively.

AB  - Simple Summary Describing global biodiversity involves identifying species and describing their distributions. The subterranean termite genus Reticulitermes represents an important group of wood-destroying organisms; however, little is known about their species-specific distribution across the three northern hemisphere continents where they are endemic. We combined several taxonomic methods to identify the species of over 4000 specimens in the first statewide survey of subterranean termites from Georgia, USA. The area surveyed, 153,900 km(2), represents eco-regions typical of most of the southeast and eastern seaboard of the United States. There were three species, R. flavipes, R. virginicus, and R. nelsonae, found throughout Georgia. R. malletei was predominantly collected in the northern Piedmont soil province, while R. hageni, the least encountered species, was not collected from South Georgia. Our findings support the need for a taxonomic revision of the genus Reticulitermes, agreement on an appropriate integrated taxonomic approach for species determination, and should stimulate future research on diverse topics such as biodiversity, monitoring for these structural pests, and identifying their role in forest ecosystems. Reticulitermes subterranean termites are widely distributed ecosystem engineers and structural pests, yet describing their species distribution worldwide or regionally has been hindered by taxonomic uncertainties. Morphological plasticity confounds the use of taxonomic keys, while recent species descriptions and molecular techniques lacking taxonomic support have caused a muddle in interpreting the literature on Reticulitermes species distributions. We employed an integrative taxonomic approach combining behavioral, morphological, and molecular techniques to identify 4371 Reticulitermes samples to species. Five Reticulitermes species were collected from wood-on-ground at 1570 sites covering 153,900 km(2) in the state of Georgia, USA. Three species were collected throughout Georgia, with R. flavipes identified from every one of the 159 counties. R. nelsonae was the second most frequently collected species, found in 128 counties, with R. virginicus third with 122. Two species had distributions confined to the northern part of the state. R. malletei was collected from 73 counties, while the least collected species, R. hageni, was found in 16. Results show that the most recently described species (R. nelsonae, 2012) is widely distributed and the second-most frequently encountered termite, representing 23% of all samples. The invasive species R. flavipes represented half of all the samples collected, while R. hageni, the least at less than 1%. A search of GenBank identified a number of accessions mismatched to a species designation resulting in the literature under-reporting the biodiversity of the genus. We, therefore, outline a path to standardize methods for species identification using an integrated taxonomic approach with appropriate barcodes for consistent identification across research teams worldwide. The data also illuminate new opportunities to examine questions related to the ecology, evolution, dispersal, and resource partitioning behaviors of these sympatric species across distinct geographical regions.

AB  - Driptips play important roles in controlling soil erosion and in the water cycle. The driptips size distribution and the morphology of water droplets on the leaves among rubber (Hevea brasiliensis) and intercropping species (Camellia sinensis, Citrus reticulata, Flemingia macrophylla and Theobroma cacao) were measured. Driptip-producing experiments were conducted indoors on stabilized leaves of five species with artificially mist spray. In all five foliage species, the diameter of the driptips from rubber leaves was the lowest. Furthermore, the relationship between driptips size and the mean leaf width at 3 mm from the rubber leaf tip was significantly positively correlated. Leaf wettability as measured by water droplets height linearly increase with the total volume of water which dropped on the leaves of all five species. The contact angle of the water droplets and the total volume of the droplet were significantly negatively correlated. Based on physical theory, the kinetic energy of the driptips was calculated by estimating the diameters of the driptip from all five species. The results indicated that it was important to consider the kinetic energy of driptips in selection of intercropping species when constructing rubber-based agroforestry plantations. Understanding the relationship between driptips size and the development of leaf tips (leaf width at 3 mm from the leaf tip) will require more experiments with different leaf inclinations, and the results also confirmed that using the contact angle of water droplets to assess leaf wettability. This study can help to predict canopy water processes, such as canopy water storage and drainage.

AB  - Key message Seed priming with pig blood protein hydrolysate improves tomato seed germination and seedling growth via regulation of reserve mobilization, osmotic adjustment, and antioxidant mechanism under drought conditions. Protein hydrolysates obtained from agro-industrial byproducts are widely recognized because of their positive roles in regulating plant responses to environmental stresses. However, little is known regarding the roles of animal protein hydrolysates in mediating seed drought tolerance and its underlying mechanisms. This study investigated the potential effects of seed priming on tomato seed germination and seedling growth under PEG-induced drought stress using protein hydrolysates derived from pig blood (PP). PP priming effectively alleviated the drought-induced reduction in seed germination traits, resulting in improved tomato seedling growth. PP priming enhanced the gene expressions and activities of amylase and sucrose synthase and soluble sugar, soluble protein, and free amino acid levels, thereby promoting reserve mobilization in seeds. PP priming also reduced osmotic toxicity through increased accumulations of proline, soluble protein, and soluble sugar. Drought stress substantially enhanced reactive oxygen species production and the subsequent increases in malondialdehyde levels and Evans blue solution uptake, which were substantially alleviated after PP priming via the improved activities of enzymatic and non-enzymatic antioxidants. Moreover, the increased DPPH free radical scavenging capacity and ferric reducing antioxidant power indicated that PP-treated tomato seedings had high antioxidant activities under drought stress. Therefore, PP priming is a novel, promising, and practicable method for improving tomato seed germination and seedling growth under drought stress.

AB  - Cobalt (Co) bioaccumulation, contamination, and toxicity in the soil environment, plant growth, and cattles' health are becoming a severe matter that can cause unembellished consequences in environmental safety and human health. The present research was conducted for the assurance of cobalt (Co) amassing in three forage plant species (Zea mays, Sorghum bicolor, Trifolium alaxandrium), from four ecological sites, and sewage water and in buffaloes blood was investigated. The analysis of variance showed significant differences for Co concentration in the soil and sewage water collected from all ecological sites. Meanwhile, summer and winter seasons and forage ecotypes significantly influenced the quantity of Co. The forage pastures also vary significantly in the concentration of Co in the above-ground parts. The highest Co level was present in Trifolium alaxandrium at ecological site-5. Cobalt taken from wastewater had a higher concentration in Trifolium alaxandrium during the winter. The samples which are collected from site-V and site-IV have the maximum concentration of Co because these areas receive highly contaminated water for irrigation. Cobalt tends to be bioaccumulated in the food chain and can cause serious problems in humans and animals. Bioaccumulation of cobalt in collected samples could be accredited to anthropogenic activities. Pollution load index values for all samples fell in the range below 1. The health risk index indicated the probability of health damage caused by the ingestion of contaminated fodder. An increase of Co concentration in soil, fodder, and blood owing to wastewater irrigation to crops was indicated as an outcome of this investigation. The results indicate that the Co toxicity in forage crops is attributed to Co bioaccumulation, transfer, and pollution load in the soil-water-cattle triangle. Efforts should be extended to avoid contamination of the food chain via Co-rich sewage water. Other nonconventional water resources should be used for forage irrigation.

AB  - Soil water storage properties, which are affected by land management practices, alter the water balance and flow regimes in watersheds; thus, it is highly plausible to clarify the influence of such management practices on the water storage condition by analyzing the long-term variations in discharge. In this study, the changes in soil water storage characteristics of the Ogouchi Dam watershed, which had undergone intensive forest management through the decades, were investigated using two approaches. Reported results from the rainfall-runoff correlation analysis show a gradual and steady increase in the soil water storage capacity at weaker continuous-rainfall events, i.e., uninterrupted wet days accumulating less than 70 mm. Meanwhile, the second approach utilizing the parameter calibration in the SWAT discharge model illustrated a constant trend in the runoff potential and the high possibility of a steady improvement in the soil available water capacity. Overall, the established decadal trends were able to prove the capability of sustainable forest management, i.e., thinning, regeneration cutting, multi-layer planting, deer-prevention fences, and earth-retaining fences (lined felled trees), in improving the water conservation function of the catchment.

AB  - The Hippophae Linn species exhibits resistance to drought, wind, and sand, and is rich in nutrients, thus possessing extremely high economic and ecological value. However, the potential distribution areas of Hippophae Linn and the key factors that will influence its distribution in the future remain unclear. The potential global distribution of Hippophae Linn in 2050s and 2070s was predicted under different emission scenarios using MaxEnt modelling. The results indicated that the Hippophae Linn species is currently distributed primarily in Europe and East Asia. Compared with its current distribution, the suitable distribution area for the Hippophae Linn species will increase by 0.45-0.48% in the future, and the centre of the distribution area will migrate to high altitudes or latitudes. The potential geographical distribution of Hippophae Linn is influenced by temperature, precipitation and ultraviolet radiation. Our study predicted changes in the distribution area of Hippophae Linn caused by global climate change, which will aid in understanding the biogeography of Hippophae Linn and enacting conservation strategies.

AB  - Stakeholder input is part of the decision-making process in wildlife management but reaching a decision that satisfies everyone may be impractical when stakeholders are divided on a particular issue or regulation. Antler point restrictions for white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) are intended to protect yearling males from harvest by hunters. Still, stakeholders debate the value of using antler restrictions to achieve harvest goals. In 2013, Michigan implemented antler point restrictions in 12 counties in the northwest area of the state. Using a series of piecewise regressions and annual harvest data from 23 counties in Michigan, we tested the hypotheses that antler point restrictions caused a change in the age structure of harvested male deer (H-1), antlerless harvest (H-2), and hunter numbers (H-3). We found support for H-1, but we did not find support for the other hypotheses. Based on our results, antler point restrictions would be a useful tool where the management goal is to advance the age structure of the male segment of the white-tailed deer harvest. However, we found no evidence that implementing antler point restrictions would help managers increase the antlerless harvest or recruit more hunters to the area. Therefore, managers might consider using antler point restrictions to reduce the harvest of yearling males, but these regulations are unlikely to have notable or lasting impacts on antlerless harvest or hunter numbers.

AB  - The dung of the Indian wild ass was analyzed using biotic and abiotic proxies to determine its dietary habits in relation to the plant diversity and ecology in the arid region of western India. The presence of both micro and macrobotanical remains of Poaceae, Chenopodiaceae, and Fabaceae indicates they are the primary food plants of the wild ass. The continuous recovery of arboreal pollen taxa chiefly, Prosopis, Acacia, and Ephedra is indicative of dry thorny forest under semi-arid to arid conditions which display the existing vegetation and climate in the region. The recovery of marshy pollen taxa like Cyperaceae and Onagraceae along with Arcella indicates utilization of water-logged environments in the habitat. Spores of coprophilous fungi, Sporormiella, Sordaria, and Podospora are also present in the dung samples. The low value of stellate trichomes in winter dung samples reflects the seasonal migration of wild ass. Average delta C-13 values ranging between -15.8 parts per thousand and-26.3 parts per thousand are indicative of a mixed diet of both C-3 and C-4 plants. The generated multiproxy data from dung samples can provide a reliable counterpart to modern data for the interpretation of the palaeoecology in relation to the palaeoherbivory and palaeodietary analysis in the region. This study also provides a basis to distinguish between wild and domesticated herbivores by analyzing coprolites and cultural sediments in archaeological sites. (C) 2022 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The invasion and expansion of Spartina alterniflora have led to a certain degree of degradation in the ecological environment of coastal wetlands. To discuss the impacts of Spartina alterniflora expansion on the tidal channels, we took the third core area of the Dafeng Elk National Nature Reserve in Yancheng, Jiangsu Province as the study area, retrieved the spatial distribution of Spartina alterniflora by random forest algorithm based on long time series of Landsat and Sentinel-2 images, analysed the expansion models. The tidal channels were obtained by the image segmentation based on MSAVI and visual interpretation and the spatiotemporal evolution traits were finally analysed. The results revealed that the area and perimeter of Spartina alterniflora are continuously increasing, with a wide-ranging invasion. The coverage area peaks at 13.4%, making it the dominant species in the study area. When excluding the influence of human activities, a significant negative correlation emerges between the invasion rate and compactness of Spartina alterniflora and the spatio-temporal evolution of tidal channels. Faster invasion rates and greater compactness correspond to a deceleration in tidal channel morphology development. Additionally, we also found that the growth of Spartina alterniflora has a positive influence on the growth and reproduction of elk.

AB  - Despite extreme changes of ecosystems made by breeding colonies of great cormorants (Phalacrocorax carbo), these territories are still used by mammals. We present results of the analysis of mammal seasonal and daily activity patterns, registered by camera traps in two colonies of the great cormorants in Lithuania. Red foxes and raccoon dogs mainly visited colonies in the cormorant breeding time, April to July. In the inland colony of great cormorants in Lukstas Lake, average red fox relative shooting frequency in cormorant breeding time considerably exceeded that in non-breeding time (on average, 41.8 and 5.9 photos/100 days respectively). In the peninsular colony of great cormorants in Juodkrante average relative shooting frequency of red fox in the breeding time was 7.8 versus 3.4 photos/100 days in non-breeding time, relative shooting frequencies of raccoon dog were 50.0 versus 1.3 photos/100 days, respectively. Daily activity patterns of wild boar and red fox in both colonies, as well as activity patterns of raccoon dog in Lukstas were related to the activity of cormorants with various degree of significance.

AB  - Nutrient pollution, defined as excess nitrogen and phosphorus related to human activities, is a widespread anthropogenic impact that decreases water quality and limits light penetration in estuarine habitats. These factors can lead to shifts in primary producer communities, but the association between these changes and marine consumer patterns of abundance and growth is relatively unknown. Understanding these relationships is necessary for herbivorous species of conservation concern like the green turtle (Chelonia mydas). We used generalized additive models to analyze concurrent 18-yr data sets of seagrass cover, drift macroalgae cover, juvenile green turtle abundance, and growth to (1) evaluate long-term trends in primary producer cover and green turtle demographics; and (2) gain insights into their interrelatedness at a study site known to be affected by nutrient pollution throughout the study period. We found that seagrass cover sharply declined during our study period while macroalgae cover was more resilient with trends varying over time. Juvenile green turtle abundance slowly declined throughout the study period with altered intra-annual trends, while growth rates remained relatively stable. The incongruence of these trends suggests that relationships between marine consumers and nutrient pollution are more complex than effects on food availability alone. Our results focus on the green turtle but highlight the need for greater understanding of relationships between marine consumer species and nutrient pollution at both local and regional scales.

AB  - In this update paper, we present the latest developments in the OMA browser knowledgebase, which aims to provide high-quality orthology inferences and facilitate the study of gene families, genomes and their evolution. First, we discuss the addition of new species in the database, particularly an expanded representation of prokaryotic species. The OMA browser now offers Ancestral Genome pages and an Ancestral Gene Order viewer, allowing users to explore the evolutionary history and gene content of ancestral genomes. We also introduce a revamped Local Synteny Viewer to compare genomic neighborhoods across both extant and ancestral genomes. Hierarchical Orthologous Groups (HOGs) are now annotated with Gene Ontology annotations, and users can easily perform extant or ancestral GO enrichments. Finally, we recap new tools in the OMA Ecosystem, including OMAmer for proteome mapping, OMArk for proteome quality assessment, OMAMO for model organism selection and Read2Tree for phylogenetic species tree construction from reads. These new features provide exciting opportunities for orthology analysis and comparative genomics. OMA is accessible at https://omabrowser.org.

AB  - Reproductive success in flowering plants depends on floral biology, breeding system, and availability of compatible mates and pollinators. Here, we examine the pollination biology of Linum arenicola (Small) H.J.P Winkler (Linaceae), sand flax, a federally endangered herb of pine rocklands in the Lower Florida Keys (USA). We observed the timing of floral anthesis, fruiting, florivory, and frequency of flower visits by insects. We compared fruiting in flowers that were open-pollinated, bagged to exclude floral visitors, and self-pollinated by hand to determine whether pollinator visits enhance or are necessary for reproduction. Fruit set was equally high be-tween flowers open to pollinators and those that were hand-pollinated, but both were significantly higher compared to flowers from which pollinators were excluded. We observed that the wilting of petals late in the day in unvisited flowers often initiates self-pollination, but flowers are frequently visited by small bees and flies earlier in the day, suggesting that early day visits by those insects increase pollen deposition and potential for outcrossing. Despite high fruit set from autonomous self-pollination and occasional flower visitation, sexual reproduction is limited by herbivores: nearly half of all flowers produced were consumed by Key deer and galling midges. Optimum fruit set is not achieved from autonomous selfing alone, and pollinators play an important role in fruit production of the rare sand flax. Conservation efforts that enhance populations of suitable pollinators could increase the likelihood of fruit set from a diversity of pollen parents in rare plants like the endangered sand flax.

AB  - Simple Summary
   Helicobacter pylori and H. suis are associated with gastric pathologies in humans. To obtain better insights into the potential role of wild boars as reservoirs of these pathogens, gastric samples of 14 animals were tested for the presence of H. pylori and H. suis DNA. Two wild boars were found PCR-positive for H. pylori and one for H. suis. This indicates that these microorganisms may colonize the stomach of wild boars.
   Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) is a Gram-negative bacterium that infects half of the human population worldwide, causing gastric disorders, such as chronic gastritis, gastric or duodenal ulcers, and gastric malignancies. Helicobacter suis (H. suis) is mainly associated with pigs, but can also colonize the stomach of humans, resulting in gastric pathologies. In pigs, H. suis can induce gastritis and seems to play a role in gastric ulcer disease, seriously affecting animal production and welfare. Since close interactions between domestic animals, wildlife, and humans can increase bacterial transmission risk between species, samples of gastric tissue of 14 free range wild boars (Sus scrofa) were evaluated for the presence of H. pylori and H. suis using PCR. Samples from the antral gastric mucosa from two animals were PCR-positive for H. pylori and another one for H. suis. These findings indicate that these microorganisms were able to colonize the stomach of wild boars and raise awareness for their putative intervention in Helicobacter spp. transmission cycle.

AB  - To identify general patterns in the effect of climate-driven changes in the outbreak frequency of forest defoliating species, we examined 60 years of records (1950-2010) of outbreaks of five defoliating species. Data on Lymantria dispar, Lymantria monacha, Bupalus piniarius, Panolis flammea, and Operophtera brumata from five Central European countries (Slovakia, Czech Republic, Austria, Hungary, and Germany), where the current climate is comparable with the projections of climate for the Eastern Baltic region by the end of the 21st century, were analyzed. Time series approach was applied to estimate the linkage between outbreaks and climate warming. Mean annual, summer, and winter deviations for the period of 1850 to 1900 were assessed as proxies of warming. To estimate the legacy effect, warming proxies were lagged by one year. Among those tested, warming proxies showed a linkage with outbreaks. Three significant outbreaks occurred in the analyzed period (at the beginning and end of the period). During the middle part of the analyzed period, the frequency and magnitude of outbreaks were low, implicating a higher insect outbreak risk with warming in Central Europe. In the latter part of the analyzed period, more frequent yet smaller outbreaks occurred, which supports the outbreak linkage with one-year lag, summer, and annual temperatures.

AB  - Simple Summary In the modern pig reproduction system, boar semen is a high-quality but perishable product that is distributed from only a few central boar stations to the sow farms. Like all parts of the production chain, the shipment of boar semen can affect sperm quality to varying degrees. In the present study, the loss of quality in response to increasing intensities and duration of vibration emissions was examined, and interaction of both factors was found. During normal transport conditions, vibration emissions are expected to be low, resulting in a low loss of quality. Nevertheless, the duration of transport should also be considered for the maintenance of boar semen quality at a high level. Vibration emissions during the transport of boar semen for artificial insemination (AI) affect sperm quality. In the present study, the common influence of the following factors was investigated: vibrations (displacement index (D-i) = 0.5 to 6.0), duration of transport (0 to 12 h) and storage time (days 1 to 4). Normospermic ejaculates were collected from 39 fertile Pietrain boars (aged 18.6 +/- 4.5 months) and diluted in a one-step procedure with an isothermic (32 degrees C) BTS (Minitub) extender (n = 546 samples). Sperm concentration was adjusted to 22 x 10(6) sperm center dot mL(-1). Extended semen (85 +/- 1 mL) was filled into 95 mL QuickTip Flexitubes (Minitub). For transport simulation on day 0, a laboratory shaker IKA MTS 4 was used. Total sperm motility (TSM) was evaluated on days 1 to 4. Thermo-resistance test (TRT), mitochondrial activity (MITO) and plasma membrane integrity (PMI) were assessed on day 4. Sperm quality dropped with increasing vibration intensity and transport duration, and the effect was enhanced by a longer storage time. A linear regression was performed using a mixed model, accounting for the boar as a random effect. The interaction between D-i and transport duration significantly (p < 0.001) explained data for TSM (-0.30 +/- 0.03%), TRT (-0.39 +/- 0.06%), MITO (-0.45 +/- 0.06%) and PMI (-0.43 +/- 0.05%). Additionally, TSM decreased by 0.66 +/- 0.08% with each day of storage (p < 0.001). It can be concluded that boar semen extended in BTS should be transported carefully. If this is not possible or the semen doses are transported a long way, the storage time should be reduced to a minimum.

AB  - Efficient ecological restoration techniques are urgently required to minimize seed consumption and labor requirements. Here, we determined the optimal sowing period for two native species, Agastache rugosa (Korean mint) and Astilbe rubra (False goat's beard), toward their use for ecological restoration of Mt. Gariwang, a site damaged by the 2018 PyeongChang Winter Olympics' activities. We investigated the effects of daily mean temperature (DMT) and daily temperature range (DTR) on seed germination percentage, which decreased for both species with decreasing DTR and was optimal at a DMT of 25 degrees C and 17.5 degrees C for A. rugosa and A. rubra, respectively. We developed a single multiple regression equation that evaluated the effects of DMT and DTR simultaneously and determined the temperature scores when the germination percentage reached 85%. We applied the developed multiple regression equation by analyzing the temperature data of the restoration site. In addition, precipitation data analysis was added to set the optimal sowing period. As a result, the optimal sowing period for the two species was determined from May 21 to the end of May. This makes it possible to minimize seed consumption and labor requirements when sowing seeds. The model developed herein will be useful not only to guide the ecological restoration of Mt. Gariwang, but also for other regions using site-specific temperature data.

AB  - The objective of this work was to study the agronomic effects of the application of agri-food composts in almond trees (Prunus dulcis L.) cultivated in two different areas with different almond varieties (cv. Guara and cv. Ferraduel), with both in organic farming conditions throughout two cropping cycles. To reach this objective, almond production and quality issues (seed production, kernel yield, nutrient contents and kernel quality), as well as several physico-chemical and biological properties of the amended soils at the beginning and at the end of each campaign were studied. The four composts used (C1, C2, C3 and C4) were elaborated mainly using exhausted grape marc (EGM) and other wastes (waste from orange juice production, OW; waste from tomato soup production, TW; cattle manure, CM; and sheep manure, SM). Two treatments were used as control treatments, one based on sheep manure and another without any amendment. The composts used produced similar results in kernel yield and production compared to the traditional treatment (sheep manure). However, the thickness of the kernel was higher in the treatments using composts with exhausted grape marc and sheep manure or tomato soup waste. In relation to the almond quality, few differences related to the effect of treatments were observed, except for the content of proteins, sucrose, some fatty acids and vegetal sterols.

AB  - Taguatagua 1 is a late Pleistocene open-air archaeological site located on an ancient lakeshore in central Chile and dated to around 12,600 cal BP. It presents clear evidence of human and megafauna (Equidae, Gomphotheriidae and Cervidae) interaction that includes burned, fractured and cut-marked bones, as well as tusk and bone-made instruments. Mixed with artefacts and megafauna bones, an outstanding small vertebrate record (Class Actinopterygii, Amphibia, Reptilia, Aves and Mammalia) has also been reported, which has remained largely unstudied. In this paper, we present the first comprehensive taphonomic study of a selected sample of this ensemble. Birds are the most common taxa, followed by anurans, fish and rodents. Surface modifications, bone breakage, skeletal frequencies and the sample's ecological/biological attributes indicate different taphonomic trajectories for an averaged sample. A portion of the ensemble entered the context via predators and natural deaths, but the presence of anthropogenic marks, especially in aquatic birds, and to a lesser extent in Myocastor coypus and Calyptocephalella sp., indicates cultural exploitation of these taxa. These results portray a more precise image of the late Pleistocene hunter-gatherer subsistence strategies in central Chile, which is consistent with the settlement's lacustrine context.(c) 2022 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Plant-soil feedback (PSF) may influence plant-insect interactions. Although plant defense differs between shoot and root tissues, few studies have examined root-feeding insect herbivores in a PSF context. We examined here how plant growth and resistance against root-feeding Delia radicum larvae was influenced by PSF. We conditioned soil with cabbage plants that were infested with herbivores that affect D. radicum through plant-mediated effects: leaf-feeding Plutella xylostella caterpillars and Brevicoryne brassicae aphids, root-feeding D. radicum larvae, and/or added rhizobacterium Pseudomonas simiae WCS417r. We analyzed the rhizosphere microbial community, and in a second set of conspecific plants exposed to conditioned soil, we assessed growth, expression of defense-related genes, and D. radicum performance. The rhizosphere microbiome differed mainly between shoot and root herbivory treatments. Addition of Pseudomonas simiae did not influence rhizosphere microbiome composition. Plant shoot biomass, gene expression, and plant resistance against D. radicum larvae was affected by PSF in a treatment-specific manner. Soil conditioning overall reduced plant shoot biomass, Pseudomonas simiae-amended soil causing the largest growth reduction. In conclusion, shoot and root insect herbivores alter the rhizosphere microbiome differently, with consequences for growth and resistance of plants subsequently exposed to conditioned soil.

AB  - Entire male pigs are more active than castrated male pigs and their social behaviour may be harmful to their penmates. Even if the average number of skin lesions does not differ between castrated and entire males, it is possible that the distribution of injurious interactions among individuals is different and that the welfare of highly affected individuals is compromised. Therefore, using data from 531 ear-tagged entire males (39 groups) and 305 castrates (22 groups) from five organic farms, we examined whether higher standard deviations (SD) of skin lesions on the front or the rear body indicated a higher concentration of injurious interactions on some individuals in groups of entire compared to castrated males, and whether the proportion of moderately and severely injured pigs differed. Potential effects of space allowance, female contact, and weight heterogeneity per group were also considered. We further investigated what characterised individual entire or castrated males with a higher number of skin lesions and whether more entire than castrated males were repeatedly injured. Pigs were weighed at the start and end of fattening, Additionally, they were scored for skin lesions at around 80 kg and 130 kg live weight, and after first split marketing. Compared to castrates, the proportions of moderately and severely injured pigs per group and the SD of skin lesions were higher in entire males with no direct contact to females, but did not differ when entire males were kept next to female pigs. Individual castrated but not entire males with a lower relative live weight at the start of fattening had more lesions, and castrates with more lesions also had lower lifetime weight gain. Together this may point to some differences in motivation for agonistic interactions between castrated and uncastrated male pigs. There was a general mitigating effect of higher space allowances, with a higher importance for entire males on the individual level. Rates of repeated moderate or severe injury at around 80 kg and 130 kg liveweight did not differ with 15 % (castrated) and 16 % (uncastrated) injured pigs. We conclude that the fattening of entire males under organic conditions can bear a higher injury risk for some individuals, but that this can be prevented by appropriate husbandry conditions, such as housing female pigs in the neighbouring pen. In general, higher space allowances help to reduce negative consequences of social behaviour.

AB  - Herbivorous insects have evolved counteradaptations to overcome the chemical defences of their host plants. Several of these counteradaptations have been elucidated at the molecular level, in particular for insects specialized on cruciferous host plants. While the importance of these counteradaptations for host plant colonization is well established, little is known about their microevolutionary dynamics in the field. In particular, it is not known whether and how host plant diversity shapes diversity in insect counteradaptations. In this study, we examine patterns of host plant use and insect counteradaptation in three Pieris butterfly species across Japan. The larvae of these butterflies express nitrile-specifier protein (NSP) and its paralogue major allergen (MA) in their gut to overcome the highly diversified glucosinolate-myrosinase defence system of their cruciferous host plants. Pieris napi and Pieris melete colonize wild Brassicaceae whereas Pieris rapae typically uses cultivated Brassica as a host, regardless of the local composition of wild crucifers. As expected, NSP and MA diversity was independent of the local composition of wild Brassicaceae in P. rapae. In contrast, NSP diversity correlated with local host plant diversity in both species that preferred wild Brassicaceae. Both P. melete and P. napi revealed two distinct major NSP alleles, which shaped diversity among local populations, albeit with different evolutionary trajectories. In comparison, MA showed no indication for local adaptation. Altogether, MA appeared to be evolutionary more conserved than NSP, suggesting that both genes play different roles in diverting host plant chemical defence.

AB  - Paramyxoviruses are important pathogens affecting various animals, including humans. In this study, we identified a paramyxovirus in 2004 (180608_2004), isolated from a sample of the femoral marrow bone of a wild boar carcass imported from Australia. Antigenic and morphological characteristics indicated that this virus was similar to members of the family Paramyxoviridae. The complete genome phylogenetic analysis grouped this virus into genotype A of bovine parainfluenza virus type 3 (BPIV-3), recently renamed bovine respirovirus type 3 (BRV3), which also includes two swine paramyxoviruses (SPMV)-Texas-81 and ISU-92-isolated from encephalitic pigs in the United States in 1982 and 1992, respectively. The wild boar 180608_2004 strain was more closely related to both the BRV3 shipping fever (SF) strain and the SPMV Texas-81 strain at the nucleotide and amino acid levels than the SPMV ISU-92 strain. The high sequence identity to BRV3 suggested that this virus can be transferred from cattle to wild boars. The potential for cross-species transmission in the Respirovirus genus makes it essential for intensified genomic surveillance.

AB  - When encountering an insect species that targets high-value plants, such as acacia in large-scale tree programs like the Great Green Wall (GGW), it is essential to assess the phytosanitary risks associated with this species. When it has not previously been described locally, accurate taxonomic identification is a crucial pre-requisite. The DNA-barcoding approach is relevant for delineating and assigning unidentified specimens to species or molecular operational taxonomic units already listed in reference DNA databases. From 2020 to 2023, in the Ferlo region of Senegal, where GGW's reforestation activities were implemented, a defoliator caterpillar species not previously reported in the region was observed causing damage to three indigenous acacia species (Vachellia tortilis raddiana, V. nilotica, Senegalia senegal). The barcoding approach coupled with external and/or internal morphological observations of the various stages collected enabled us to assign the specimens to Isturgia pulinda deerraria (Geometridae) but confronted us with the ongoing nomenclatural problem associated with this taxon. Interestingly, based on 122 mitochondrial barcode sequences (78 from our study, 44 retrieved from genetic databases), high intraspecific genetic diversity was revealed both in Senegal and worldwide, with two weakly divergent geographical lineages, an African-Eastern lineage and a Mediterranean lineage. The observation of the species from 2020 to 2023, both at the end of the rainy season and during the dry season on nurseries or plantations of acacia (Fabaceae) in the 5 localities studied and incidentally on Moringa oleifera (Moringaceae) suggests that, even at low numbers, it could pose an additional biotic threat to woody vegetation-based programs.

AB  - The invasive snake Hemorrhois hippocrepis colonized the island of Ibiza (Balearic Islands) in 2003 as stowaways inside trunks of olive trees imported for gardening. It has quickly spread since 2010, posing a threat to the island's only remaining endemic vertebrate, the Ibiza wall lizard Podarcis pityusensis. We map the yearly expansion rate of the snake and estimate via transect surveys how severely it affects the distribution and abundance of the endemic lizard. As well, we surveyed 9 of 30 small lizard populations on islets surrounding Ibiza that have been isolated since the Last Glacial Maximum. Snakes had invaded 49% of Ibiza's land area by 2018, and censuses show a critical contrast in lizard abundance between areas with and without snakes; almost all censuses in areas without snakes show lizard presence whereas nearly all censuses in areas with H. hippocrepis lack lizard sightings. Moreover, at least one subspecies previously thriving on one of the offshore islets has become extinct, and there have been several snakes recorded swimming between Ibiza and the surrounding islets. Therefore, lizard populations have been dramatically reduced or have vanished within the range of the snake, and our results quantitatively support upgrading this species' threat level for extinction. This study can inform to programs to manage invasive snake populations and to conservation actions to recover the endemic lizard.

AB  - The study of insect fauna and their development and succession patterns on decaying cadavers is crucial to promoting insect evidence as a useful tool in forensic science, particularly for estimating the postmortem interval (PMI). Body decomposition and arthropod succession are affected by many factors and exhibit substantial regional variations; therefore, detailed succession studies in different biogeographic regions are required for understanding the successional patterns of insects in various environments. This study was conducted in the summer of 2021 using three domestic pig carcasses (Sus scrofa domestica L., 1758) in the field of Shizuishan City, Ningxia, Northwest China. A total of 40 species of necrophagous insects belonging to three orders and 16 families were collected. Among Diptera, Lucilia sericata (Meigen,1826), Chrysomya megacephala (Fabricius,1794), and Phormia regina (Meigen,1826) (Diptera: Calliphoridae) were the dominant species. As for Coleoptera, the dominant species changed throughout the process of carcass decomposition from Saprinus semipunctatus (Fabricius,1792) (Coleoptera: Histeridae) to Dermestes maculatus DeGeer,1774 and Dermestes frischii Kugelann,1792 (Coleoptera: Dermestidae). The carcasses desiccated rapidly and reached the remains stage under extreme conditions of high temperatures and low humidity, after which a large amount of dried tissue of the carcasses attracted populations of Coleoptera, particularly Dermstidae, which were abundant and remained until the end of the experiment on day 50. The current study is the first forensic entomological investigation of succession in Northwest China and provides basic data for the estimation of PMI during summer in this region.

AB  - Phenological escape, whereby species alter the timing of life-history events to avoid seasonal antagonists, is usually analyzed either as a potential evolutionary outcome given current selection coefficients, or as a realized outcome in response to known enemies. We here gain mechanistic insights into the evolutionary trajectory of phenological escape in the brassicaceous herb Cardamine pratensis, by comparing the flowering schedules of two sympatric ecotypes in different stages of a disruptive response to egg-laying pressure imposed by the pierid butterfly Anthocharis cardamines, whose larvae are pre-dispersal seed predators (reducing realized fecundity by similar to 70%). When the focal point of highest intensity selection (peak egg-laying) occurs early in the flowering schedule, selection for late flowering dependent on reduced egg-laying combined with selection for early flowering dependent on reduced predator survival results in a symmetrical bimodal flowering curve; when the focal point occurs late, an asymmetrical flowering curve results with a large early flowering mode due to selection for reduced egg-laying augmented by selection for infested plants to outrun larval development and dehisce prior to seed-pod consumption. Unequal selection pressures on high and low fecundity ramets, due to asynchronous flowering and morphologically targeted (size-dependent) egg-laying, constrain phenological escape, with bimodal flowering evolving primarily in response to disruptive selection on high fecundity phenotypes. These results emphasize the importance of analyzing variation in selection coefficients among morphological phenotypes over the entire flowering schedule to predict how populations will evolve in response to altered phenologies resulting from climate change.

AB  - BackgroundFoot and mouth disease (FMD) is a highly contagious disease that impacts cloven-hoofed animals globally. The illegal trade of livestock between the border regions of Pakistan and Afghanistan can contribute to the spread of this disease. This study focuses on investigating the outbreaks of FMD that occurred in this area from June 2020 to May 2021. ResultsA total of 233 epithelial tissue samples were collected, and 77% were found positive for FMDV through an antigen-detection by ELISA and molecular conformation through RT-PCR. The study found three serotypes of FMDV dominating in the border area of Pakistan with Afghanistan: O, A, and Asia-1. The outbreak activity was peaked between August/September followed by July/October 2020. Phylogenetic analysis conducted using the VP1 region sequence showed that serotype O isolates belonged to the Middle East-South Asia (ME-SA) topotype, PanAsia-2 lineage, and ANT-10 sub-lineage, while serotype Asia-1 isolates belonged to a novel lineage BD-18.The highest prevalence of serotype O of FMDV was found in cattle and buffalo of 1-2 year age group, while the highest outbreak ratio of serotype O was recorded in goats of 0-1 year age group and sheep of > 2 year age group. The serotype O was more prevalent in male than female sheep. The type A was more prevalent in females of sheep and goats than their corresponding males. The serotype Asia-1 was more prevalent in females of cattle and sheep than their corresponding males. The outbreak epidemiology of FMD varied significantly between various regions, months of study, animal species, age groups, and gender. ConclusionsThe study found that FMD outbreaks in the border area of Pakistan and Afghanistan were diverse and complicated, and that different types of FMDV were circulating. The study recommended effective actions to stop FMD transmission in this area.

AB  - Knowledge about the environment is fundamentally important to move, find resources and forage efficiently. This information can either be acquired through individual exploration (personal information) or from other group members (social information). We experimentally assessed the use of social information and its influence on foraging efficiency in sheep, Ovis aries. Naive individuals paired with an informed partner that knew the food patch location, found the patch significantly faster compared to naive individuals paired with another naive individual. Similarly, they spent a significantly lower proportion of time exploring areas away from the food patch. We further found that the outcome of using social information in one directly previous trial (success = access to feed vs failure = no access to feed) had no impact and sheep continued to use social information in the subsequent foraging trial and foraged similarly efficient. Our results suggest, naive sheep that are unfamiliar with resource locations, forage more efficiently when informed individuals are present compared to when all individuals are naive. If informed individuals play a similar role in larger groups, new management practices that integrate informed sheep could be developed to improve foraging efficiency when sheep are moved to new paddocks or in paddocks with heterogenous and dynamic resource distribution.

AB  - Background color in aquaculture has been paid more attention due to the effect on fish growth, survival, health, and reproduction. In the present study, we evaluated the background color preference of the lined seahorse (Hippocampus erectus) and its relationship with personality. Preference was assessed over 10 consecutive days through allowing the lined seahorse to freely choose six different colored compartments, i.e., white, red, green, black, yellow, and blue backgrounds. To minimize the spurious preference response, the individual preference index (PI) was applied to calculate the preference intensity of the background colors. Preference reliability was further verified by a binary choice test through the choice for the most preferred or non-preferred color. Preference consistency under stress situation was assessed by a "knock-at-the-door" test as confining the seahorse in a transparent circle after a 30-s air exposure and measuring the proportion of knock toward different colored backgrounds. The personality was conjointly analyzed by new environment test and novel object test. Overall, the lined seahorse showed a general preference for white and blue while avoidance of black and red backgrounds at either unstressed or stressed situations. The shyer the seahorse was, the more preference for white background it displayed. Thus, white and blue background colors are recommended for culturing the lined seahorse. Furthermore, white color preference is a potential indicator in personality study of the lined seahorse.

AB  - Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is a serious problem for public and animal health, and also for the environment. Monitoring and reporting the occurrence of AMR determinants and bacteria with the potential to disseminate is a priority for health surveillance programs around the world and critical to the One Health concept. Wildlife is a reservoir of AMR, and human activities can strongly influence their resistome. The main goal of this work was to study the resistome of wild boar faecal microbiome, one of the most important game species in Europe using metagenomic and culturing approaches. The most abundant genes identified by the high-throughput qPCR array encode mobile genetic elements, including integrons, which can promote the dissemination of AMR determinants. A diverse set of genes (n = 62) conferring resistance to several classes of antibiotics (ARGs), some of them included in the WHO list of critically important antimicrobials were also detected. The most abundant ARGs confer resistance to tetracyclines and aminoglycosides. The phenotypic resistance of E. coli and Enterococcus spp. were also investigated, and together supported the metagenomic results. As the wild boar is an omnivorous animal, it can be a disseminator of AMR bacteria and ARGs to livestock, humans, and the environment. This study supports that wild boar can be a key sentinel species in ecosystems surveillance and should be included in National Action Plans to fight AMR, adopting a One Health approach.

AB  - The Acanthaceae tribe Barlerieae is an understudied lineage that consists of ca. 500 species, many of which are rare and range restricted. Though understudied, it is clear that many species play vital roles in tropical ecosystems, including supporting a wide range of pollinators and herbivores. The tribe contains 13 genera, the two largest and most widespread of which are the primarily Paleotropical Barleria (ca. 300 spp.) and pantropical Lepidagathis (ca. 150 spp.). In a recent reclassification of Acanthaceae, three subtribes were informally proposed based on corolla and calyx characters: (1) Barleria, (2) Crabbea and allies, and (3) Lepidagathis and allies. Using a next-generation sequencing approach, double-digest restriction associated DNA sequencing (ddRADseq), this study estimates a well-sampled phylogeny of the Barlerieae tribe, tests genera and infrageneric groups for monophyly, and identifies morphological characters that support monophyletic groups. Our study reveals strong support for the monophyly of Barlerieae and resolves relationships among all 13 genera currently recognized in the tribe. There is strong support for the three proposed subtribes. Our results also suggest that taxonomic revision of Lepidagathis is necessary. Species of Lepidagathis are found in three clades: (A) Lepidagathis s.str., (B) Lophostachys s.l., and (C) Teliostachya, each of which can be distinguished by inflorescence and stamen characters. The phylogenetic relationships recovered here indicate that each of the three clades should be classified as a separate genus. This research lays the groundwork for future taxonomic revisionary work as well as the construction of updated identification keys that will aid in conservation efforts and provide insight into the evolutionary processes that shape biodiversity in this remarkable lineage.

AB  - Animals perceive human activities as risky and generally respond with fear-induced proactive behaviors to buffer the circadian patterns of lethal and nonlethal disturbances, such as diel migrations (DMs) between risky places during safe nighttime and safer places during risky daytime. However, such responses potentially incur costs through movement or reduced foraging time, so individuals should adjust their tolerance when human activities are harmless, through habituation. Yet this is a challenging cognitive task when lethal and nonlethal risks co-occur, forming complex landscapes of fear. The consequences of this human-induced complexity have, however, rarely been assessed. We studied the individual DM dynamics of chamois (Rupicapra rupicapra rupicapra), 89 GPS-tracked individual-years, from/to trails in the French Alps in areas with co-occurring lethal (hunting) and nonlethal (hiking and skiing) disturbances, with different intensities across seasons. We developed a conceptual framework relying on the risk-disturbance hypothesis and habituation to predict tolerance adjustments of chamois under various disturbance contexts and across contrasted seasonal periods. Based on spatial and statistical analyses combining periodograms and multinomial logistic models, we found that DM in relation to distance to a trail was a consistent response by chamois (similar to 85% of individuals) to avoid human disturbance during daytime, especially during the hiking and hunting periods. Such behavior revealed a low tolerance of most chamois to human activities, although there was considerable interindividual heterogeneity in DM. Interestingly, there was an increased tolerance among the most disturbed diel migrants, potentially through habituation, with chamois performing shorter DMs in areas highly disturbed by hikers. Crucially, chamois that were most human-habituated during the hiking period remained more tolerant in the subsequent harvesting period, which could increase their risk of being harvested. In contrast, individuals less tolerant to hiking performed longer DMs when hunting risk increased, and compared to hiking, hunting exacerbated the threshold distance to trails triggering DMs. No carryover effect of hunting beyond the hunting period was observed. In conclusion, complex human-induced landscapes of fear with co-occurring disturbances by nature-based tourism and hunting may shape unexpected patterns of tolerance to human activities, whereby animal tolerance could become potentially deleterious for individual survival.

AB  - The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of supplemental feeding of fenugreek (Trigonella foenum-graecum L.) seed on milk yield, composition and some blood parameters in lactating goats. In this study, ten lactating goats in the second lactation were used. Their milk yields were closer to each other. Experimental goats were divided into 2 groups as control (C) and Fenugreek (F), equally. They were individually kept in pen sized 2x2 m. C goats did not consume fenugreek seed while F goats were allowed to consume daily 50 g fenugreek seed for each just before the meal in the mornings. The experiment lasted for 63 days of which 7 days are for adaptation and 56 days are for treatment period. Results showed that fenugreek seeds supplementation increased feed intake (2876.4 vs 2716.4 g, P<0.01) and milk yield (1010.6 g vs 879.7 g, P<0.01) in lactating goats. Fat corrected milk yield was higher in F goats (865.2 g) than that of C goats (780.0 g) (P<0.01). Serum glucose, total cholesterol and protein levels were not affected while serum triglyceride level and prolactin hormone level increased by fenugreek seed supplementation (P<0.05). Fenugreek seed supplementation did not affect milk organoleptic properties such as smell, taste and appearance. To conclude, fenugreek seed in lactating goats can be used as natural supplement to increase milk yield since fenugreek seed had no effect on sensory properties of milk.

AB  - The sensitivity of larval sea lamprey (Petromyzon marinus) to the lampricide 3-trifluoromethyl-4-nitrophenol (TFM) varies with season, with highest sensitivity in spring and tolerance increasing by 2-to 3-fold in the mid-late summer. Until recently, the physiological basis for these differences was unresolved. Using previously published and unpublished findings, we illustrate how the acute toxicity of TFM (12-h LC50, 12-h LC99.9) changes with season in two populations of larval sea lamprey collected through the spring, summer and fall from Deer Creek and the Au Sable River, Michigan, U.S.A. Our findings reveal that the greater TFM tolerance of larval sea lamprey in the summer is most closely related to increases in water temperature. Although the energy reserves (glycogen, lipid) and body condition of larval sea lamprey may be lower in the spring after overwintering, these physiological indices have little impact on TFM sensitivity. We therefore conclude that water temperature, rather than energy stores or body condition, explains the greater tolerance of sea lamprey to TFM in the summer. We propose that as water temperature increases through the spring and summer, and approaches the thermal optima of larval sea lamprey, their metabolic rate and capacity to detoxify TFM increases, which slows the rate at which TFM accumulates in the body, despite concurrent increases in TFM uptake rate. We therefore recommend that water temperature be considered when planning and executing lampricide applications to mitigate temperature-induced increases in sea lamprey tolerance to TFM that could undermine sea lamprey control efforts in the Great Lakes.

AB  - Peatland permafrost landforms, such as palsas and peat plateaus, often represent the most southern lowland permafrost occurrences in the Northern Hemisphere. While peatland permafrost is often found in continental conditions, over a thousand permafrost peatlands were recently identified along the previously understudied coastline of the Labrador Sea in northeastern Canada. The vulnerability of these landscapes to thaw is unknown but is expected to have hydrological and ecological impacts on important caribou habitat, the abundance of culturally relevant berries, and permafrost carbon storage. Using a combination of aerial photography (from 1948, 1985, 1992, 1994, and 2021) and high-resolution satellite imagery (from 2017, 2020, and 2021), we assess multi-decadal areal changes to peatland permafrost landforms at seven peatlands along the Labrador Sea coastline spanning from Red Bay (51.7 degrees N) to north of Hopedale (55.7 degrees N). Analyses reveal declines in permafrost extent of 33%-93% at individual sites, occurring at mean rates of 0.8%-1.5%/a. Permafrost loss was found to occur most rapidly at mixed palsa and peat plateau sites (mean rate of 1.4%/a), followed by palsa sites (mean rate of 1.2%/a) and peat plateau sites (mean rate of 0.9%/a). Patterns of permafrost loss also differed between landform types, with more complete loss of individual landforms at palsa sites and more lateral and internal loss of existing landforms at peat plateau and mixed sites. This widespread degradation of peatland permafrost over the past 28-73 years is attributed to regional warming and peatland greening. Understanding recent change to permafrost peatlands in coastal Labrador is an important step towards predicting future habitat change in northeastern Canada and will inform regional land management in areas dominated by these culturally important landforms.

AB  - Objectives: Gigantopithecus blacki, the largest hominoid known, is one of the representative Pleistocene mammals in southern China and northern Southeast Asia. Here we investigate the feeding ecology of G. blacki in its core habitat (Guangxi, Southern China) during the early Early Pleistocene, which was the early period in its evolution.
   Materials and methods: The stable isotopic (C, O) analysis of tooth enamel of the fauna associated with G. blacki (n = 58), including the largest number of G. blacki teeth (n = 12) to date from the Liucheng Gigantopithecus Cave (similar to 2 Ma), Guangxi, China, is undertaken.
   Results: The delta C-13 values of Liucheng fauna range from -12.9 to -19.0 parts per thousand with an average of -16.1 +/- 1.3 parts per thousand (n = 58) and the delta O-18 values range from -4.3 to -9.6 parts per thousand with an average of -6.9 +/- 1.2 parts per thousand (n = 58). The delta C-13 values of G. blacki range from -15.9 parts per thousand to -17.0 parts per thousand with an average of -16.5 +/- 0.4 parts per thousand (n = 12), and the delta O-18 values vary from -5.9 parts per thousand to -7.5 parts per thousand with an average of -6.6 +/- 0.5 parts per thousand (n = 12).
   Conclusions: The isotopic data show Guangxi was characterized by closed C-3 forest and humid climate in the early Early Pleistocene. Niche partitioning is found among G. blacki, Sinomastodon, Ailuropoda and Stegodon, the typical megafauna in South China in the early Early Pleistocene. This could be one of the important factors for them to co-exist until the Middle Pleistocene. Smallest isotopic variations of G. blacki are found compared with those of contemporary animals, indicating a conservative foraging ecology i.e., limited foraging area and/or narrow dietary flexibility. Furthermore, the more confined foraging ecology of G. blacki is also seen in comparison with fossil and extant large-bodied primates. However, the unique dietary pattern of G. blacki does not seem to have hindered its survival. The environment in Guangxi during the early Early Pleistocene offered the suitable conditions for G. blacki to become one of the typical species in the faunal assemblages.

AB  - As a significant threat to agriculture, pests have caused a great disservice to crop production and food security. Understanding the mechanisms of pests' outbreaks and invasion is critical in giving sound suggestions on their control and prevention strategies. The African rhinoceros beetle, Oryctes monoceros (Olivier), as the most damaging pest of palms, banana, sugarcane, and pineapple, severely threatens their production due to its ability to kill both young and matured hosts. Analyzing the effect of climate change on major parameters of O. monoceros life history has been an important issue recently, given its sensitivity to thermal conditions. However, information on how climate change alters geographical distribution of O. monoceros is poorly understood. By combining environmental variables and occurrence records, we were able to assess environmental risk factors for O. monoceros and create risk maps for the pest using the Boosted Regression Tree model. Our results significance of environmental variables showed that the annual temperature variation (39.45%), seasonality of temperature (23.00%), the isothermality (18.76%), precipitation of the hottest quarter months (6.07%), average variation of day time temperature (3.27%), were relatively important environmental factors that affected the distribution O. monoceros. We also found that the projected potential distributions of the pest's habitats in all future global warming scenarios exceeded its present known distribution. The model predicts that habitat suitability for O. monoceros is predominantly concentrated along Africa's west and east coastlines, Asia's south coasts, South America's north and east coasts, and a few locations spread over North America's southern coasts and coastal regions. These outputs provide a solid theoretical foundation for O. monoceros risk evaluations and control.

AB  - Cryptophytes, to which the Pyrenomonadaceae family belongs, are interesting organisms that occur almost all over the world and they are an important element of trophic chains in many ecosystems. The development of research methods and techniques, including electron microscopy and molecular studies, allowed for a better understanding of taxonomic relationships in this group of organisms. The Pyrenomonadaceae family currently includes three genera: Rhodomonas, Rhinomonas, and Storeatula, but their validity is being debated in the light of the latest data. The state of knowledge and the problems faced in the taxonomic revision of this family of cryptophytes are summarized in this article.

AB  - Caribbean coral reefs have been declining at unprecedented rates, with about 50% of live coral cover lost over the past 50 years. The description of benthic and associated fish assemblages in remote areas, supposedly less vulnerable to human stressors, is necessary to better understand the spatial extent of declining trends, and to target areas for special management and protection. We present results from an expedition to Silver Bank (SiBa), Dominican Republic, aimed at providing the first quantitative assessment of benthic and fish assemblages in the area in the last 20 years. In April 2022, seven sites were surveyed using the Global Coral Reef Monitoring Network and the Atlantic Gulf Rapid Reef Assessment protocols, to determine benthic composition, coral richness, prevalence of diseases, invertebrates, and fish assemblages. Contrary to our expectations, reefs showed severe signs of deterioration, with coral cover seldom exceeding 11% on average, with no more than 14 species (from the more than 60 for the Caribbean region). Turf algae and macroalgae dominated the reefs (37-90%). Coral disease prevalence did not exceed 1-2%, and no evidence of epizootic Stony Coral Tissue Loss Disease (SCTLD) was noticed. Clear signs of overfishing were recorded, with carnivores above 15 cm being scarce across all sites. Furthermore, herbivorous species also depicted sizes below 15 cm, with no more than eight species. Our results change the previous conception that reefs at Silver Bank are healthier than coastal reefs because they benefit from low anthropogenic pressures. This serves as an alert to local environmental authorities to improve surveillance and management actions to preserve this area.

AB  - Body condition integrates the effects of habitat on individuals and consequently population performance of cervids. However, most condition data is likely to come from harvested males, which may not reflect absolute condition of, or habitat quality for, adult females because of basic ecological differences. To test whether condition of males reflected condition of females, we compared three indices of nutritional condition (rump body condition score, maximum subcutaneous fat thickness, and percent body fat) of adult male, lactating adult female, and dry adult female mule deer over multiple years in 2 sites in New Mexico, USA. Males consistently achieved significantly higher levels of condition than females for all indices of condition, regardless of whether indices for males were scaled for metabolic size or not. Because population productivity and rate-of-increase is driven by condition and consequent performance of females, population monitoring strategies that assess only condition of males may not reflect absolute condition of females and thus habitat quality as it fundamentally relates to population dynamics of cervids. Condition of males, however, can likely index relative habitat quality if not absolute.

AB  - Context In this study, single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were used to investigate kinship for the green sawfish (Pristis zijsron). Aims To examine the relatedness of P. zijsron across an expansive coastline in Western Australia. Methods Sampling was conducted between the Fitzroy River estuary and Bay of Rest in the eastern Indian Ocean (north-western Australia) between 2003 and 2022. SNPs were generated from tissues collected from 137 live and 1 recently deceased P. zijsron. Key results Overall, 62 individual P. zijsron were assigned to 25 litters of full siblings, with litter sizes ranging from 2 to 5 pups, and 76 P. zijsron individuals were assigned to 96 half sibling pairwise relationships. Four pairs of half siblings were captured more than 500 km and born at least 6 years apart, including one pair of neonates captured similar to 870 km and 8 years apart, in the Ashburton River estuary (Pilbara) and Cable Beach (Broome). Furthermore, a pair of full-sibling pups (i.e. young of the year) caught at Cape Keraudren (Pilbara) in 2008 were half siblings of a pup caught in the Ashburton River in 2014. Conclusions This study provides evidence of long-distance, likely parental, movement of P. zijsron. Implications Dispersal of P. zijsron over large spatial scales indicates that populations could be replenished from elsewhere should they experience a decline, thereby reducing the risk of localised extinction for this species.

AB  - The association of endophytic fungi with the host plant is called a symbiotic relationship. Studies of the endophytic fungi from tea have been reported in numerous documents, but researchers still largely focus on tea endophytic fungi as they have ability to produce bioactive compounds which have numerous applications. The present work characterizes the fungal endophytic communities associated with healthy tea leaves in Yunnan Province, China. A total of 287 fungal strains were isolated from healthy leaf tissues of tea plants using a culture-dependent approach. Based on nuclear ribosomal DNA internal transcribed spacer (ITS) sequence analyses taken from the fungal cultures, strains were classified into 28 fungal genera with high similarity matches to known sequences in GenBank. The majority of genera (98.25%) belong to the phylum Ascomycota and most of the dominating fungal endophytes are from the genera Colletotrichum and Clonostachys.

AB  - This study illustrates the contribution of plant and faecal microfossil records to interdisciplinary approaches on the identification, composition, taphonomy and seasonality of livestock dung materials. The focus is on the taphonomy of opal phytoliths and calcitic dung spherulites embedded within modern faecal pellets collected from pasture grounds and pens from a range of animals, including cattle, sheep and pigs from three different farms and seasons of the year in Menorca (Balearic Islands, Spain) declared a Biosphere Reserve by UNESCO. Modern reference materials provide comparative plant and dung microfossil indicators on factors affecting the formation, composition, preservation and decay of animal faeces, as well as on the diverse environmental and anthropogenic aspects influencing these. The reported results show relevant changes in phytolith and spherulite composition according to animal species and age, livestock management, seasonality, and grazing and foddering regimes. Both microfossil records provide fundamental information on taphonomic issues that are understudied, such as the variation in the digestibility among different species, including under investigated animals such as pigs, as well on the seasonality of plant and faecal microfossils that are excreted with dung as an important material for reconstructing human-environment interactions which is commonly overlooked in archaeology.

AB  - Aerial wildlife surveys with fixed-wing airplanes and helicopters are used more often than on-the-ground field surveys to cover areas that are both extensive and often inaccessible. Drones with high-resolution thermal sensors are being widely accepted as research tools to aid in monitoring wildlife species and their habitats. Therefore, our goal was to assess the feasibility of detecting northern bobwhite quail (Colinus virginianus, hereafter 'bobwhite') using drones with a high-resolution thermal sensor. Our objectives were (1) to identify the altitudes at which bobwhites can be detected and (2) compare the two most used color palettes to detect species (black-hot and isotherm). We achieved this goal by performing drone flights at different altitudes over caged tame bobwhites and capturing still images and video recordings at altitudes from 18 to 42 m. We did not observe or detect any obvious signs of distress, movement, or fluttering of bobwhites inside cages caused by the noise or presence of the drone during data acquisition. We observed the highest counts of individual bobwhites with the black-hot thermal palette at 18 m (92%; x over bar = 47 bobwhites; SE = 0.41) and at 24 m (81%; x over bar = 41 bobwhites; SE = 0.89). The isotherm thermal palette had lower count proportions. The use of video to count quail was not feasible due to the low resolution of the video and the species size. Flying drones with high-resolution thermal sensors provided reliable imagery to detect roosting bobwhite individuals in South Texas during the winter.

AB  - Allelopathic activity of wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) has previously been associated with the production of phenolic acids and flavonoids (PAF), benzoxazinones (BXZs) and phenoxazinones (PXZs). The biosynthesis of BXZs is closely regulated during cereal growth, with accumulation highest in young tissues with variation associated with genotype and environmental conditions. This review is focused on BXZ metabolites and their impact on germination, seedling growth and physiological, biochemical, transcriptional and proteome traits of surrounding plants and weeds. The major pathways employed by plants for benzoxazinoid detoxification involve hydroxylation and glucosylation and polymerisation of intermediates in these pathways. Allelochemicals from various wheat genotypes have been shown to inhibit the growth of selected weed species, including Bromus japonicus, Chenopodium album, Portulaca oleracea, Avena fatua and Lolium rigidum. Wheat allelopathy is potentially exploited from the standpoint of crop mulches, incorporation of crop residues, tissue disruption, intercropping with allelopathic cultivars and application of aqueous wheat extracts. BXZs have been shown to suppress the growth and development of certain agricultural pests, including insects, fungal pathogens, and weeds. Many native plants, fungi and insect herbivores inherently possess varying tolerance levels towards BXZs. However, other BXZ- susceptible species are adversely impacted by elevated BXZ levels in crop plants. Thus, considerations for the selection and breeding of wheat genotypes possessing enhanced defensive ability via elevated BXZ contents are discussed. Here, these objectives are reconsidered with a focus on co-evolutionary aspects and their potential impacts on biodiversity in the agroecosystems under study. For future breeding efforts to be successful, it is important to take such potential adverse environmental impacts into account, in combination with an increased focus on enhancing beneficial allelopathic effects within agricultural systems.

The bio-stimulatory effect of SG, SG + saliva and SG + semen on young boar for semen collection as well were employed to study bio-stimulatory effects on gilts and sows. Distilled water (DW) exposure was kept as control. SG, saliva and semen were screened for total 105, 96 and 89 compounds. The highest concentration was of alkanes followed by sugar alcohols, then hydrocarbons, amino acids and fatty acids. Elaidic acid was the novel compound identified in pigs. Significantly higher (p < 0.05) number of males got trained in exposure to SG (80%), SG + saliva (75%) and SG + semen (75%) than control (0%). The time (hrs) taken by young boars to get trained on exposure to combination of SG + saliva (244 +/- 22.19) and SG + semen (216 +/- 13.14) was lesser (p < 0.05) than SG (356 +/- 61.85) alone. Interval (hrs) from initiation of exposure for exhibition of different sexual behaviour by males on exposure to SG, saliva and semen was lesser (p < 0.05) than control. Significantly (p < 0.05) higher number of females showed estrus response to exposure of SG (72.72%), SG + saliva (69.23%) and SG + semen (76.92%) than control (0). Interval (hrs) taken to exhibit estrus was shorter (p < 0.05) in females exposed to SG + saliva (201.88 +/- 12.66), SG + semen (198.20 +/- 9.42) than SG (262.14 +/- 20.06) alone. Interval (hrs) for exhibition of different sexual behaviour by females on exposure to SG + saliva and SG + semen was lesser (p < 0.05) than control. In conclusion, novel compounds were identified in boar seminal gel, saliva and semen with biostimulatory properties have been identified in boar SG, saliva and semen. The combined exposure of SG with saliva and semen has more intense biostimulation effect than SG alone for training of young boars and estrus induction in gilts and sows. Such compounds biostimulatory effects can be exploited for augmenting reproductive efficiency in pigs.

AB  - The role of TANK-binding kinase 1 (TBK1) of humans and mice in innate immunity is well elucidated. Still, the molecular characterization and biological function of the TBK1 gene in herbivorous animals are less studied. Here, the open reading frame (ORF) of TBK1 of the cow and goat was firstly cloned and successfully expressed. The Phylogenetic tree analysis reveals that the TBK1 gene of goats and cows is similar to chicken and mute swans, respectively. Some evolutionary distances of the TBK1 gene were still present among different species. A slightly subcellular distribution difference was observed among full-length and truncated TBK1 of goats and cows. Dual-luciferase reporter assay has shown that the full-length TBK1 of goats and cows plays a vital role in the induction of IFN-8 production. The viral infection experiment showed that the over-expression of the fulllength TBK1 gene of the cow and goat significantly suppresses intracellular viral replication of the Lumpy skin disease virus (LSDV) in infected cells. Our study showed that TBK1 in the cows and goats is a crucial immunoregulatory for IFN-8 production during viral infection, contributing to a better understanding of innate immunity in the herbivorous animal.

AB  - Herbivorous fishes are the major consumers of macroalgae on coral reefs. Macroalgae are then degraded by fish gut microbiota. Despite the importance of this process, there remains a lack of information about the gut bacterial community of herbivorous fishes in coral reefs. This study examined the composition and potential metabolic functions of gut microbiota through full-length 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing for coral reef fish species from the Xisha islands of China, including five herbivorous species (Naso unicornis, N. lituratus, N. brevirostris, Ctenochaetus striatus, and Siganus argenteus) and one carnivorous species (Myripristis kuntee). The composition of the gut bacterial community and potential functional genes were observed and significant differences were identified between herbivorous and carnivorous fish species. The bacterial diversity (Shannon and Simpson indexes) in herbivorous fish was significantly higher than in carnivorous fish. Clostridium was significantly more abundant in carnivorous fish than herbivorous fish (p < 0.05). Conversely, Niameybacter, Alistipes, Desulfovibrio, and Akkermansia were more abundant in herbivorous fish (p < 0.05). These bacterial genera, which are shared among herbivorous fish, are believed to play crucial roles in macroalgae metabolism. A principal coordinate analysis further revealed that the gut bacterial composition of the five herbivorous fish species could be divided into two distinct clusters, which was influenced by selective feeding behaviors on different macro-algae types. Functional analysis of gut bacteria in herbivorous fishes showed a high abundance of carbohydrate metabolism pathways. Through comparison with the carbohydrate-active enzyme (CAZy) database, eight glycoside hydrolases (GHs) and one glycosyltransferase (GT) were identified in herbivorous fishes, providing further insights into the roles of gut microbiota in macroalgae metabolism. This study provides valuable insights into the roles of the gut microbiota in herbivorous fishes with regard to metabolizing various types of macroalgae.

AB  - Plants are often attacked by multiple antagonists and traits of the attacking organisms and their order of arrival onto hosts may affect plant defences. However, few studies have assessed how multiple antagonists, and varying attack order, affect plant defence or nutrition. To address this, we assessed defensive and nutritional responses of Pisum sativum plants after attack by a vector herbivore (Acrythosiphon pisum), a nonvector herbivore (Sitona lineatus), and a pathogen (Pea enation mosaic virus, PEMV). We show viruliferous A. pisum induced several antipathogen plant defence signals, but these defences were inhibited by S. lineatus feeding on peas infected with PEMV. In contrast, S. lineatus feeding induced antiherbivore defence signals, and these plant defences were enhanced by PEMV. Sitona lineatus also increased abundance of plant amino acids, but only when they attacked after viruliferous A. pisum. Our results suggest that diverse communities of biotic antagonists alter defence and nutritional traits of plants through complex pathways that depend on the identity of attackers and their order of arrival onto hosts. Moreover, we show interactions among a group of biotic stressors can vary along a spectrum from antagonism to enhancement/synergism based on the identity and order of attackers, and these interactions are mediated by a multitude of phytohormone pathways.

AB  - This paper analyzes the current use pattern, farmers' preferences, and conservation issues of fodders and forages growing in the agropastoral semi-arid lowlands of Kasur District, Pakistan. The data was collected through semi-structured interviews and participatory methodologies. Multiple data analyses (Relative frequency citation and Pairwise Comparison) and statistical tools (correlation and Tableau) were used for interpretations of ethnobotanical data. The current study reported 75 fodder/forage species belonging to 58 genera and 25 families. Poaceae (28%) was the most popular family followed by Fabaceae (20%). Most of the plants were herbaceous (40%) and were growing in the wild (85.3%). It was observed that livestock preferred shoot consumption (50%) in comparison to other parts. In addition, 37.3% of species were used as fresh feed, 44% of species were freely grazed and 18.7% were used as mixed feed. These plants were more palatable to goats (29%) followed by cows (23%), buffalos (20%), and sheep (15%). Moreover, 23 plants were considered to be high-value fodders and 08 species (Dicliptera bipleuroides, Ehretia acuminate, Kochia indica, Cassia obtusifolia, Melilotus albus, Hibiscus rosa-sinensis, Poa pratensis and Lycium shawii) were recorded as fodder/forage for the first time in this geographical regime. Results reported only 7% abundant and 3% rare species in the study area which reflected the overexploitation of these natural feed resources. This study provided baseline data for the development of feeding strategies and also highlighted a serious conservation concern of these fodder plants. Proper cultivation, farming and in-situ conservation would underpin the sustainability of these plant resources.

AB  - Attacks by large predators on livestock are an important driver of conflicts. Consequently, knowledge about where predators occur, where livestock depredation takes place and what factors influence it will aid the mitigation of stakeholder conflicts. Following legal protection, wolves (Canis lupus) in Central Europe are recently spreading to areas dominated by agriculture, bringing them in closer contact with livestock. Here, we analyzed habitat selection and livestock depredation rates of 43 wolves identified by genotyping on the Jutland peninsula, consisting of mainland Denmark and the northernmost German federal state Schleswig-Holstein. Occupancy by resident wolves correlated positively with forest and other non-forested semi-natural land cover (habitat for natural ungulate prey), whereas occupancy by non-resident wolves correlated with increasing forest cover and sheep density. The latter effect likely reflected increased sampling probability of highly mobile dispersers killing livestock. We recorded 565 livestock depredation events (85 in Denmark and 480 in Schleswig-Holstein), of which 42% (55 in DK and 185 in SH) could be assigned to 27 individual wolves based on DNA evidence. Livestock (mostly sheep) were killed by wolves in 16% of the study area. Our results indicate that wolves mostly killed livestock as a context-dependent response, i.e., being dispersers in agricultural areas with low availability of wild ungulate prey and high livestock densities, and not because of behavioral preferences for sheep. Moreover, the livestock depredation was lower in areas with livestock protection measures (implemented in areas with established pairs/packs). We conclude that while wolf attacks on livestock in established wolf territories generally can be reduced through improvement of fences, livestock depredation by non-resident wolves in agricultural areas constitutes a bigger challenge. Albeit technically possible, the economic costs of implementing predator-proof fences and other preventive measures in such pastoral areas infrequently visited by wolves will be considerable. Experiences so far further indicate that lethal removal of identified "problem wolves" may be inefficient in practice.

AB  - Tree-kangaroos of the genus Dendrolagus occupy forest habitats of New Guinea and extreme northeastern Australia, but their evolutionary history is poorly known. Descriptions in the 2000s of near-complete Pleistocene skeletons belonging to larger-bodied species in the now-extinct genus Bohra broadened our understanding of morphological variation in the group and have since helped us to identify unassigned fossils in museum collections, as well as to reassign species previously placed in other genera. Here we describe these fossils and analyse tree-kangaroo systematics via comparative osteology. Including B. planei sp. nov., B. bandharr comb. nov. and B. bila comb. nov., we recognise the existence of at least seven late Cenozoic species of Bohra, with a maximum of three in any one assemblage. All tree-kangaroos (Dendrolagina subtribe nov.) exhibit skeletal adaptations reflective of greater joint flexibility and manoeuvrability, particularly in the hindlimb, compared with other macropodids. The Pliocene species of Bohra retained the stepped calcaneocuboid articulation characteristic of ground-dwelling macropodids, but this became smoothed to allow greater hindfoot rotation in the later species of Bohra and in Dendrolagus. Tree-kangaroo diversification may have been tied to the expansion of forest habitats in the early Pliocene. Following the onset of late Pliocene aridity, some tree-kangaroo species took advantage of the consequent spread of more open habitats, becoming among the largest late Cenozoic tree-dwellers on the continent. Arboreal Old World primates and late Quaternary lemurs may be the closest ecological analogues to the species of Bohra.

AB  - Tropical forests are undergoing land use change in many regions of the world, with an increasingly prominent trend of landscape fragmentation. Nevertheless, the Asian elephant (Elephas maximus) population in tropical forests of China has continued to increase, and their distribution range is expanding to human-modified landscapes, resulting in increased severe human-elephant conflicts. Little is known about the habitat adaptation strategies of Asian elephants in human-dominated habitats. Here, we applied maximum entropy modeling to extensive occurrence data (21,011 independent records) of Asian elephants in southwest China to explore temporal changes in their distribution under climate change. We also identified critical factors shaping their current distribution and habitat selection strategies concerning human-induced land-use changes at multiple spatial scales. We found that the area of suitable habitats for Asian elephants will slightly increase in the future (7,025 km2) compared with the present climatic scenario (6,468 km2). At a finer spatial scale, topographic variables such as elevation (74%) and slope (11%) are the dominant factors shaping the habitat selection of Asian elephants. However, at a larger spatial scale, anthropogenic variables are the main factors associated with the habitat preference of Asian elephants. Most suitable and sub-suitable habitats (65%) of Asian elephants overlap with human-dominated areas. Our findings suggest that the effects of human activity on Asian elephants are scale-dependent and demonstrate that the suitable habitats of Asian elephants in China are shifting to human-dominated regions.

AB  - Reducing food waste could lower pressures on land resources and thereby contribute to the mitigation of global biodiversity loss. The reduction of food waste and biodiversity loss are also specified in the Sustainable Development Goals 12.3 and 15 of the United Nations. However, which supply chain stages and food products to target with policy measures is hardly known. Especially, a differentiation of the impact after sub-stages and taxa is still missing and is therefore quantified in the present study. The food waste mass at five supply chain stages and seven sub-stages in Germany was calculated and differentiated after 204 food products. All products were traced back to their countries of origin, in which their land use impact on mammals, birds, amphibians, reptiles, and plants was quantified. A new approach was developed to calculate the detailed feed demand for animal products. Germany's avoidable food waste (food that was edible before its disposal) leads to 0.3 vertebrate and 1.5 plant species being potentially lost globally. Household-level waste is responsible for 47% of this species loss, while food services show the largest impact per mass, with individual catering being as influential as one-person households. The most influential products are obtained from pigs and cattle. Among vertebrate taxa, mainly amphibians are affected, occurring in the mainly affected country Brazil. The results can be used to formulate policies that target, for example, individual catering or display the impact of animal products and their feed demand.

AB  - Oaks (Quercus spp.) provide an important food source for many wildlife species throughout the fall and winter. Most research evaluating oak masting patterns and the subsequent behavioral responses of wildlife focuses on the annual temporal scale. However, patterns in masting at the seasonal temporal scale may be important for wildlife behavior. We designed a study quantifying seasonal oak masting patterns of 3 oak species (water oak, Q. nigra; laurel oak, Q. laurifolia; and swamp chestnut oak, Q. michauxii) and linking those patterns to visitation and feeding behavior of 3 primary consumers (white-tailed deer, Odocoileus virginianus; gray squirrel, Sciurus carolinensis; and raccoon, Procyon lotor). We used seed traps to monitor the seasonal masting pattern of 205 trees in the fall of 2021 and 2022 and used camera traps concurrently to monitor wildlife behavior associated with a subset of 30 trees. Seasonal masting patterns differed between oak species both within a season and across years, and the timing of mast varied within oak species across years. White-tailed deer tended to visit swamp chestnut oak as the number of acorns increased and consumed their acorns. Gray squirrels and raccoons tended to visit laurel oak and consume water oak acorns with gray squirrels being more likely to consume as the number of acorns increased. Our results indicate that evaluating acorn production at multiple temporal scales may be necessary to fully understand oak masting relationships with wildlife. Furthermore, differences in wildlife behavior based on oak species may have important implications for oak regeneration.

AB  - BACKGROUND Determining factors influencing animal movements at a temporal scale that is similar to that at which management actions are conducted (e.g. weekly) is crucial for identifying efficient methods of wildlife conservation and management. Using global positioning system (GPS) data from 49 wild pigs in the southeast United States, we constructed weekly 50% and 95% utilization distributions to quantify the effects of biotic and abiotic factors on weekly core area and home range size, as well as home range shape. RESULTS We found vegetative composition (i.e. proportion of bottomland hardwoods), season (based on forage availability), meteorological conditions (i.e. temperature and pressure), and sex influenced wild pig weekly home range and core area size, while vegetative composition (i.e. proportion of upland pines) and landscape features (i.e. distance to streams) also were important factors influencing home range shape. At close distances to streams, wild pigs had more elongate home ranges when their home ranges comprised less upland pine habitat; however, farther from streams, there was no change in home range shape across fluctuating proportions of upland pines. CONCLUSION These results demonstrate that fine-scale wild pig home ranges and movements are pliable from week to week and influenced by several habitat, landscape, and meteorological attributes that can easily be quantified from available land use and meteorological databases. These findings are important for designing monitoring studies, identifying high risk zones for disease transmission, planning response to disease emergence events, and allowing more effective and efficient short-term management planning.

AB  - Ecological theory predicts that kelp forests structured by trophic cascades should experience recovery and persistence of their foundation species when herbivores become rare. Yet, climate change may be altering the outcomes of top-down forcing in kelp forests, especially those located in regions that have rapidly warmed in recent decades, such as the Gulf of Maine. Here, using data collected annually from 30+ sites spanning >350 km of coastline, we explored the dynamics of Maine's kelp forests in the similar to 20 years after a fishery-induced elimination of sea urchin herbivores. Although forests (Saccharina latissima and Laminaria digitata) had broadly returned to Maine in the late 20th century, we found that forests in northeast Maine have since experienced slow but significant declines in kelp, and forest persistence in the northeast was juxtaposed by a rapid, widespread collapse in the southwest. Forests collapsed in the southwest apparently because ocean warming has-directly and indirectly-made this area inhospitable to kelp. Indeed, when modeling drivers of change using causal techniques from econometrics, we discovered that unusually high summer seawater temperatures the year prior, unusually high spring seawater temperatures, and high sea urchin densities each negatively impacted kelp abundance. Furthermore, the relative power and absolute impact of these drivers varied geographically. Our findings reveal that ocean warming is redefining the outcomes of top-down forcing in this system, whereby herbivore removal no longer predictably leads to a sustained dominance of foundational kelps but instead has led to a waning dominance (northeast) or the rise of a novel phase state defined by "turf" algae (southwest). Such findings indicate that limiting climate change and managing for low herbivore abundances will be essential for preventing further loss of the vast forests that still exist in northeast Maine. They also more broadly highlight that climate change is "rewriting the rules" of nature, and thus that ecological theory and practice must be revised to account for shifting species and processes.

AB  - Landscape connectivity is a major factor shaping the spread of pathogens in wildlife populations. By managing connectivity, transmission pathways can be broken and disease spread be contained, particularly in the early phases of an outbreak. Having witnessed recent outbreaks of African Swine Fever in free-ranging wild boar (Sus scrofa) in Belgium, Germany and Italy, offices for disease control are on the alert also in other western European countries.This study investigates the potential effect of managing landscape connectivity to contain disease spread among free-ranging wild boar in disparate landscapes. It involves research into (1) the ease with which wildlife corridors can be blocked for wild boar, (2) the connectivity of wild boar habitat and (3) the impact of landscape fragmentation on connectivity management. This is addressed by carrying out GIS analyses and performing graph operations on the wild boar networks in different biogeographical regions of Switzerland.The results of doing research into the three above-mentioned objects show that, regarding the first, most wildlife corridors are hard to block for wild boar, because their features or location make fencing difficult. Regarding the second, the wild boar habitat is connected. Opening wildlife passages that are currently under construction may allow wild boar to disperse to hitherto uncolonized areas. Regarding the third, all wild boar networks could be partially decomposed by blocking the easy to block corridors and closing the passages. Network decomposition would be easiest to achieve in the region where the built infrastructure is most abundant. All over Switzerland, the potential epidemic size could be reduced by 25% when blocking the minimal set of corridors and passages that cut the networks to non-decomposable components.This study suggests that (a) combining connectivity analysis with fragmentation analysis is key to explaining why a specific measure of disease containment is more effective in one landscape than in the other, (b) complementing the permeability model with a species distribution model is essential to identify connected habitat patches for the species of concern and (c) connectivity metrics should consider also the surface area of occupied habitat patches and relative abundance of the species of concern.

AB  - This study investigated the chemical phenotypical variability of Piper lhotzkyanum Kunth (Piperaceae), a shrub found in Brazilian tropical forests, over time (different periods of the day and seasons) and under natural conditions. For this, essential oils (EOs) from the leaves were collected in different seasons and times of the day and analyzed by gas chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry, and gas chromatography coupled with a flame ionization detector. The indices were applied to evaluate the chemical diversity as well as the dynamics of redox of the mixtures. The results showed that the EOs were dominated by non-oxygenated sesquiterpenes, with & beta;-elemene, E-caryophyllene, and & alpha;-zingiberene being the main compounds identified in all collections. Temporal and seasonal analyses revealed important fluctuations in the chemical composition, redox, and chemical diversity indices of the species. A correlation between climatic factors and the variation in redox and chemical diversity was observed, highlighting the chemical phenotypic plasticity P. lhotzkyanum. This study resolves a previously unanswered question by confirming that natural light does not produce interconversion of major compounds. The adaptation capacity of this species to the environmental changes suggests new cultivation strategies to maximize the quality of EO and promote a more sustainable future in partnership with nature.

AB  - Invasive species and their establishment in new areas have significant impacts on the ecological, economic, and social well-being of our planet. Wild pigs (Sus scrofa) are one of the world?s most formidable invasive species, particularly in the United States. They cause significant damage to agriculture and ecosystems, and can transmit diseases to livestock, wildlife, and people. There is an inherent social dimension to the issue of wild pigs due in part to the fact that people hunt them. Hunting contributes to both the control and spread of this species. The objectives of this study were to: 1) determine hunters? overall tolerance for wild pigs; and 2) identify what factors predict hunters? tolerance. Results obtained from a survey of Texas hunters in 2019 indicated that 83% of hunters had a low level of tolerance for wild pigs, with approximately 63% preferring to see the population reduced and 20% preferring to see the population completely removed. Fourteen percent preferred that wild pig numbers remain the same, and 2% preferred to see numbers increase. Results from regression analysis indicated that approximately 53% of the variance in tolerance for wild pigs was explained by motivations and preferences for hunting wild pigs, level of concern for wild pig damage, and overall attitudes toward wild pigs. Results of this research are useful in expanding current knowledge about human tolerance for wildlife, including those species that are non-native and invasive, and in identifying important factors affecting how hunters perceive and interact with wild pigs. Study findings are also helpful in informing the development of effective and socially acceptable management plans for wild pigs, as well as communication efforts aimed at influencing hunters? attitudes and behaviors in the wild pig management context.

AB  - Growth hormone is the major gene playing regulatory role in growth and metabolism of vertebrates. Several reports have identified mutations in GH gene that are associated with animal productivity. The bovine GH has been studied quite thoroughly but very little information regarding Buffalo growth hormone is available in literature. Buffalo is an important source of milk in Asia and there is a need to identify variations in the genes of buffalo GH and its possible effects in milk production. The present research was carried out to explore DNA polymorphism in buffalo growth hormone gene. In this study we amplified a 5' flanking region covering exon 1 from local specie of Bubalus bubalis. As the 5' region of the GH is very important in controlling the expression of the gene and minor changes in this sequence can affect its expression in blood. The PCR amplicon was sequenced and analyzed for homology with the help of BLAST search. Surprisingly, along with various point mutations in this region, we found that a considerable base sequence upstream exon 1 was similar to Bos mutus (yakQH1 chromosome 19) and did not align with reported Bubalus bubalis GH sequence. Only 49% of the sequenced product aligns with Bubalus Bubalis though 90% of the sequence aligns with Bos mutus and Bos indicus GH gene. A 46 bp inverted repeat sequence was also identified upstream exon 1. This report not only raises questions about the purity of the gene but also indicates mutations which may affect animal productivity like milk yield, growth regulation and carcass composition. There is a need to report these mutations so that their effects can be studied further. The complete animal history, means of semen supply or the methods used for its introduction can give clues about these findings.

AB  - Functional morphology investigates the relationships between morphological characters and external factors, such as environmental, physical and ecological features. Here, we evaluate the functional relationships between body shape and trophic ecology of a tropical demersal marine fish community using geometric morphometrics techniques and modelling, hypothesizing that shape variables could partially explain fish trophic level. Fish were collected over the continental shelf of northeast Brazil (4-9 degrees S). Analysed fish were distributed into 14 orders, 34 families and 72 species. Each individual was photographed in lateral view, and 18 landmarks were distributed along the body. A principal component analysis (PCA) applied on morphometric indices revealed that fish body elongation and fin base shape were the main axes of variation explaining the morphology. Low trophic levels (herbivore and omnivore) are characterized by deep bodies and longer dorsal and anal fin bases, while predators present elongated bodies and narrow fin bases. Fin position (dorsal and anal fins) on the fish body is another important factor contributing to (i) body stability at high velocity (top predators) or (ii) manoeuvrability (low trophic levels). Using multiple linear regression, we verified that 46% of trophic level variability could be explained by morphometric variables, with trophic level increasing with body elongation and size. Interestingly, intermediate trophic categories (e.g., low predators) presented morphological divergence for a given trophic level. Our results, which can likely be expanded to other tropical and nontropical systems, show that morphometric approaches can provide important insights into fish functional characteristics, especially in trophic ecology.

AB  - Ocean acidification (OA) and antibiotic pollution pose severe threats to the fitness of keystone species in marine ecosystems. However, the combined effects of OA and antibiotic pollution on the intestinal microbiota of marine organisms are still not well known. In this study, we exposed the herbivorous gastropod Trochus niloticus, a keystone species to maintains the stability of coral reef ecosystems, to acidic seawater (pH 7.6) and/or sulfamethoxazole (SMX, 100 ng/L, 1000 ng/L) for 28 days and determined their impacts on (1) the accumulation of SMX in the intestine of T. niloticus; (2) the characteristics of the intestinal microbiota in T. niloticus; (3) the relative abundances of sulfonamide resistance genes (i.e., sul1 and sul2) and intI1 in the intestinal microbiota of T. niloticus. Our results show that OA exposure leads to dramatic microbiota dysbiosis in the intestine of T. niloticus, including changes in bacterial community diversity and structure, decreased abundances of dominant species, existences of characteristic taxa, and altered functional predictions. In addition, SMX exposure at environmentally relevant concentrations had little effect on the intestinal microbiota of T. niloticus, whether in isolation or in combination with OA. However, after exposure to the higher SMX concentration (1000 ng/L), the accumulation of SMX in the intestine of T. niloticus could induce an increase in the copies of sul2 in the intestinal microbiota. These results suggest that the intestinal health of T. niloticus might be affected by OA and SMX, which might lead to fitness loss of the keystone species in coral reef ecosystems.

AB  - Hybridization is widespread in nature and is a valuable tool in domestic breeding. The DHB (DaHuaBai) pig in South China is the product of such a breeding strategy, resulting in increased body weight compared with other pigs in the surrounding area. We analyzed genomic data from 20 Chinese pig breeds and investigated the genomic architecture after breed formation of DHB. The breed showed inconsistency in genotype and body weight phenotype, in line with selection after hybridization. By quantifying introgression with a haplotype-based approach, we proposed a two-step introgression from large-sized pigs into small-sized pigs to produce DHB, consistent with the human migration events in Chinese history. Combining with gene prioritization and allele frequency analysis, we identify candidate genes that showed selection after introgression and that may affect body weight, such as IGF1R, SRC, and PCM1. Our research provides an example of a hybrid formation of domestic breeds along with human migration patterns.

AB  - Between 1925 and 1930, 11 or 12 non-native mountain goats (Oreamnos americanus) were translocated from Alaska and British Columbia to the foothills of the Olympic Range. By 1970, descendants of these goats had colonized the entire range and concerns about the management of this introduced species developed as damage to alpine soil and vegetation occurred. A series of removals reduced the population from 1175 in 1983 to 389 by 1990, eventually growing to 584 in 2016. We used demographic and genetic data to parameterize a population genetics individual-based simulation model of the Olympic Range mountain goats. We calibrated the model to replicate the population trajectory for Olympic mountain goats from establishment in the 1920s through the 1983 first census. As expected, modeled population dynamics from 1928 to 1983 mimicked parameter initialization from expanding populations. However, simulated heterozygosity did not align with observations, suggesting a process not accounted for within the simulation model, such as a bottleneck or founder effect. Sensitivity analyses showed changes in annual reproductive rate, juvenile mortality, and adult female mortality influencing population trajectories, but variation in male mortality revealed no changes. Evaluating the population dynamics of the model after removals showed that approximately 80% of the total animals removed during the 1980s needed to be female in order for the observed population estimates to occur. This model has the potential to be used more widely with established or introduced mountain goat populations, as well as to provide an approach for studying other introduced species and their population dynamics.

AB  - The aim of this study is to determine the effects of a high-concentrate diet on growth performance, serum biochemical indexes, and rumen microbiota in house-fed yaks. Sixteen male yaks (body weight, 151.73 +/- 14.11 kg; 18 months) were randomly allocated into two dietary treatments: a group with a low level of concentrate (n = 8, LC, concentrate-forage = 40:60) and a group with a high level of concentrate (n = 8, HC, concentrate-forage = 60:40). We found that compared with the LC group, the average daily feed intake (ADFI), the average daily gain (ADG), and the serum albumin (ALB) concentration in the HC group were significantly increased (p < 0.05). The rumen bacterial compositions also differed significantly between the groups, as indicated by principal coordinate analysis (p < 0.05). Firmicutes and Bacteroidota were the main dominant phyla of rumen bacteria in yaks. Compared with the LC group, the relative abundance of Firmicutes in the HC group was significantly increased (p < 0.05) and the relative abundance of Bacteroidota was significantly decreased (p < 0.05). At the genus level, Rikenellaceae_RC9_gut_group, Succiniclasticum, Prevotella, Christensenellaceae_R-7_group, and NK4A214_group had the highest relative abundance. The relative abundance of Christensenellaceae_R-7_group in the HC group was significantly higher than that in the LC group (p < 0.05). The PICRUSt 2 results showed a significant enrichment in glycosaminoglycan degradation, apoptosis, and ECM-receptor interaction in HC relative to LC (p < 0.05). In conclusion, high-concentrate diets can enhance growth performance and alter the compositions and functions of ruminal bacterial communities in yaks.

AB  - Four giant clam species were monitored for population abundance, recruitment, growth and spatial distribution over three decades. Natural, undisturbed populations were mapped at five sites on the Great Barrier Reef from surveys in 1982-1986, 1987-1992, 2007-2009 and 2017. Populations of all species declined at three sites due to low recruitment and death of old clams. At two sites a significant juvenile recruitment cohort of Tridacna gigas and T. derasa followed a mass mortality event which returned the population to the pre-mass mortality abundance. At one site 55.5% of the cohort survived after five years. Population abundance of T. squamosa and Hippopus hippopus increased slightly at the 2017 survey at these two sites. Tridacna gigas and T. derasa live long enough to reproduce successfully in some years, as evidenced by recruitment. Where significant recruitment occurred, high-aggregation reproductive centres may remain functional for many decades. Individual growth rate from the recruitment surveys averaged six cm yr(-1) to five years. Longer-term growth rates averaged nearly two cm yr(-1) with the highest rate being over four cm yr(-1). Climate change will have some deleterious effects on giant clam populations.

AB  - Different stressors, while affecting the cells of target organs, can lead to genome instability and even disintegration, which can matter in the formation of post-stress disorders. We studied the effect of psycho-emotional stressors (immobilization and the house mouse female pheromone 2,5-dimethylpyrazine) on DNA integrity of hippocampal and bone marrow cells in CD-1, CBA and C3H male mice, using the cytogenetic and immunocytochemical methods (alkaline comet assay, ana-telophase test for mitotic disturbances, gamma H2AX focus assay). It was shown that both immobilization and 2,5-dimethylpyrazine cause genome damage in the cells of both organs studied. Cell genome destabilization in various organs is considered as an essential stage of stress response development in an attempt of the organism to adapt to extreme environmental exposures.

AB  - Pastoralist households in Kenya's arid and semi-arid lands (ASALs) rely heavily on livestock trade for livelihoods and income. Between 2021 and 2023, the region experienced its worst drought in four decades, marked by six consecutive failed rainy seasons. This study investigates the factors influencing pastoralists' choice of livestock market channels during this period, focusing on the effects of drought, conflict, and livestock production systems. It also examines how different sources of livestock market information shape trading decisions. Data were collected from 1,053 households using a multistage sampling approach. Analytical methods included Multivariate Probit (MVP) regression and Classification and Regression Tree (CART) analysis. Findings reveal that informal networks, especially neighbours and family, were the most influential sources of market information. In contrast, formal channels such as mobile phone calls and radio had limited impact. Households affected by drought were more likely to sell steers through butcher outlets, reflecting urgent liquidity needs. Conflict significantly reduced participation in local markets, highlighting how insecurity limits access. Across all livestock types, namely steers, heifers, bulls, cows, sheep, and goats, pastoralists engaged in multi-channel marketing strategies shaped by herd size, household demographics, and external shocks. These results underscore the need to strengthen both traditional and digital market information systems that provide timely, localized livestock market intelligence. Supporting livestock marketing cooperatives and Common Interest Groups (CIGs) is also vital to improving coordination and bargaining power. Such interventions are essential for enhancing resilience, market participation, and economic inclusion in Kenya's drought-prone pastoralist areas.

AB  - Reflecting upon the distressing situation of human-wildlife conflict (HWC), this study has identified numerous factors that exacerbate the HWC issue in Bangladesh, including a lack of awareness, a prevalent disregard for the law, inadequate punitive measures, institutional weaknesses, socio-economic challenges, a burgeoning population, a refugee crisis, rampant deforestation, encroachment upon natural habitats, migratory challenges faced by wildlife, and the influence of national and global politics. It is evident that these multifaceted elements significantly contribute to the escalation of HWC. The regions of Chittagong-Hill Tracts (CHT), the Sundarbans, and central-northern Bangladesh are facing a pressing HWC issue that demands our immediate attention. Tragically, over the past two decades, more than 118 elephants have lost their lives, while these creatures claimed 13 human lives in 2017-2018. Furthermore, tigers, an emblem of strength and beauty, have been responsible for the demise of approximately 50 individuals between 2009 and 2010. Astonishingly, the year 2022 has already witnessed a count of 375 HWCs. Therefore, this study delves deeper into the root causes of HWC in Bangladesh and proposes effective preventive measures to safeguard the endangered species, specifically the Asian elephants (Elephas maximus) and Bengal tigers (Panthera tigris tigris), who bear the brunt of these conflicts.

AB  - Ranchers have been conducting traditional management practices such as mono-species grazing and limited burning that focus on stocking rate maximization. This has resulted in negative environmental consequences such as woody plant encroachment, land use change, and species diversity loss. Recently, there has been a growing appreciation for alternative range management that simultaneously promotes biodiversity and agricultural productivity through fire and grazing interactions. The purpose of the study was to investigate the influence of landowner values, attitudes, and norms on their behavioral intention to adopt best management practices (BMPs) that enhance wildlife abundance in the southern Great Plains. The required data was generated through a mail survey following the Tailored Design method. We utilized the structural equation path model to construct two latent variables for norms and attitudes and analyzed the relationship of the latent variables with value orientations and behavioral intentions. The study results indicated that the attitudes had a significant positive relationship with biocentric (beta = 0.15, p-value<0.05) and a negative relationship with anthropocentric (beta = -0.259, p-value<0.05) value orientations, however, the relationship of value orientations was statistically insignificant with norms. Further, the results indicated that both norms (beta = 0.404, p-value<0.05) and attitudes (beta = 0.508, p-value<0.05) had a positive and statistically significant relation with ranchers' intentions to increase wildlife abundance on their land. Study results emphasize the need for innovative communication and non-traditional outreach methods to educate rangeland owners on the importance of patch-burn grazing and other best management practices.

AB  - Simple Summary Captive breeding is important for ex-situ conservation and future reintroduction. This research aims to conduct a population viability analysis (PVA) for a sustainable reintroduction program for bantengs. The monthly development of 23 founder individuals was assessed. The PVA showed that the time required to reach the maximum population in a captive banteng program is dependent on the carrying capacity of the habitat. The reduction of a small banteng founder group by the reintroduction of animals into the wild can negatively affect the population growth of the captive group. This information can be used to maintain the population viability of bantengs and sustain ex-situ conservation and the reintroduction program in Thailand and elsewhere. Captive breeding is important for ex-situ conservation and the future reintroduction of bovids that become extinct in the wild. The age structure, development, and viability of captive-bred bantengs (Bos javanicus) are important to sustain the long-term reintroduction program in Salakphra Wildlife Sanctuary (SWF) and other areas. This research conducted a long-term population viability analysis (PVA) using height, weight, body condition scores (BSC), age structure, and development in captivity for a sustainable reintroduction program of bantengs in Thailand. Monthly development photographs of 23 founder individuals (12 males and 11 females) were assessed by three banteng experts, two researchers, and three members of the general public. The assessments of weight and BCS were not significantly different among the three groups, while height was underestimated by the general public. The PVA showed that the time to reach the maximum population in a captive banteng program is dependent on the carrying capacity of the habitat. The reduction of a small banteng founder group by the reintroduction of animals into the wild can negatively affect the population growth of the captive group. This information can be used to maintain the population viability of bantengs and sustain ex-situ conservation and the reintroduction program in Thailand and elsewhere.

AB  - Globally, ungulate-vehicle collisions (UVCs) are a major human safety concern and may also represent a significant source of mortality for some ungulate populations. However, records of UVC based on counts of roadside carcasses or reports by drivers involved in these incidents are assuredly underestimated because not all ungulates struck die immediately or at the roadside or are reported by drivers or authorities. Here, we provide an observation and analysis of the movements of a GPS-collared bison (Bison bison) that was involved in a UVC on the Alaska Highway and died in a thick boreal forest 29 days later. During that time, she moved 49.7 km from where she was hit. Her daily movement rate (in kilometers per hour) and daily net displacement (in kilometers per day) were significantly greater in the 29-day period before she was struck compared with 29 days afterward. This vivid example illustrates that individuals injured in a UVC can die several weeks later and at a considerable distance from where they were initially struck. Moreover, when they eventually die, it may be where their carcass would not be found or associated with a UVC. Bison are the largest land mammal in North America and perhaps more robust to some lower impact UVC than smaller bodied species. Even so, if not for the GPS collar on this bison, we would have never known the fate of this individual, and the carcass likely never found. Taken together, the movements and final resting place of this bison illuminate how estimates of mortality as a result of UVC can be underestimated when the animal does not die immediately and in a location where it can be found. Given our data, we further urge managers to consider roadside counts of animals killed in UVC as a minimum estimate when considering options for mitigation.

AB  - Community science provides a valuable approach for population monitoring, offering benefits such as public engagement, cost-effectiveness and broad geographic coverage. Seahorses are excellent candidates for community science monitoring because they are iconic and sedentary and because their cryptic nature and patchy distribution hampers formal professional research. We analysed data collected by a non-profit organization for the iSeahorse programme. Data were collected by community members over a 5-year period in two locations in Tampa Bay, Florida, using otter trawls and seines. Their data for the two local seahorse species (Hippocampus erectus and Hippocampus zosterae) were valuable in complementing professional science. Densities found in community monitoring were orders of magnitude lower than those found professionally, at least partly because the areas differed. However, sex ratios were similar in both areas, being predominantly female-biased. Community data on timing of pregnancy confirmed professional findings but also extended the season. Usefully, community science provided the first published torso lengths of H. zosterae anywhere and of H. erectus in Tampa Bay. Beyond the biological, we interviewed the project leaders for their opinions on the programme's impact, challenges and areas for improvement, to give a societal context to the study. It became clear that there should had been more and ongoing communication between the non-profit organization and the iSeahorse programme during the course of the surveys. Overall, our analysis endorses the strong potential of community science for population monitoring and its complementarity with professional science.

AB  - The Pirro Nord quarry (Apricena, Foggia, southern Italy, 41 degrees 48 ' 6 '' N, 15 degrees 23 ' 5 '' E) is a well-known palaeontological and archaeological locality comprising an abundant and diverse Early Pleistocene vertebrate assemblage of mammals, birds, amphibians, and reptiles related to the Late Villafranchian and Early Biharian mammal ages. In this study, we describe the small mammal assemblages (insectivores, rodents, and bats) excavated between 2010 and 2022 to reconstruct the palaeoenvironment surrounding the site using Habitat Weighting and the Bioclimatic model methods. The rodent assemblage comprises mostly Allophaiomys cf. ruffoi, Apodemus sp., and Hystrix refossa, whereas Eliomys cf. intermedius was reported for the first time. Insectivores includes Talpa gr. minor-caeca; Asoriculus sp.; Erinaceus praeglacialis; and Sorex sp. Bats are represented by Rhinolophus ferrumequinum, Rhinolophus gr. euryale-mehelyi, Myotis gr. myotis-blythii, Myotis sp., and Miniopterus schreibersii. Landscape reconstruction attested to the presence of a rich and diverse environment with open areas and forest patches surrounding the Pirro Nord 13 site. The climate was slightly colder than that of current times in the same area, with higher precipitation. The presence of different ecosystems near the sites constituted suitable conditions for the first human dispersion in Europe, as already revealed by evidence from Barranco Le<acute accent>on D, Atapuerca TE7-14, and Fuente Nueva 3 elsewhere on the Iberian Peninsula. The study of small mammal assemblages improves our understanding of the chronological boundaries of the human occupation of Pirro Nord 13, adding important information in the context of the first peopling of the Mediterranean region between 1.6 and 1.3 million years ago.

AB  - Populations of herbivorous insects are considered to be primarily regulated by natural enemies. However, little is known about the ecological role of entomopathogenic fungi. There is very little data on the diversity and prevalence of fungal pathogens in natural insect populations. In this study, the percentage mortality attributable to fungal pathogens for the immature stages of three noctuid moths feeding inside the stems of the herbaceous plant, Typha latifolia, were determined. The average percentage mortality caused by fungal pathogens was around 8%, with the value never exceeding 20% at any of the studied sites. As many as ten species of fungi were identified in the 52 infected larvae/pupae collected, this high diversity is consistent with the results of comparable studies. The prevalence of fungal infections did not correlate with host population density or performance of the host insects. This study contributes to the emerging generalisation that populations of insects commonly harbour diverse assemblages of pathogenic fungi, but with low overall prevalence. A signifi cant contribution of these antagonists to regulating insect populations is unlikely.

AB  - Marine forests are declining worldwide and understanding the ecology of extant forests is crucial for developing practices that best conserve and restore them for the future. In the Mediterranean region, there has been an increasing effort to restore forest forming fucalean seaweeds and to understand the ecological context that supports their persistence. Here, we describe population metrics for a significant extant fucalean forest located in a coastal lagoon on the southern Istrian peninsula (Croatia). In & Scaron;& cacute;uza Lagoon, Gongolaria barbata settles within two main substrate types, on small stones and pebbles amongst seagrass Cymodocea nodosa and on rocky substrate provided by larger, more exposed boulders within the meadow but where seagrass does not grow. Amongst seagrass, G. barbata grew to a greater maximum height, observed during both its growth and dormant phases. On boulders, any disadvantage in height appeared to be offset by higher recruitment where the overall density was similar between the two areas. Opportunistic recruitment of G. barbata during the senescent period for C. nodosa appeared to contribute to their coexistence in this unique location and seagrasses appeared to reduce the prevalence of cauloid damage for G. barbata. These findings highlight the importance of understanding fine-scale ecological interactions that support the persistence of isolated patches of vulnerable marine forests.

AB  - Recently, significant die-back of nonnative common reed, Phragmites australis, has been reported in the Mississippi River Delta (MRD), Louisiana, USA. This dieback has been attributed to an invasive scale insect, Nipponaclerda biwakoensis. We test whether fungi are involved in the recent infestation by this insect and subsequent die-offs of P. australis. Several haplotypes of P. australis occur in the MRD, and the European (M) and Delta (M1) haplotypes appear to experience differing levels of N. biwakoensis infestation. We tested whether these haplotypes differed in their fungal microbiomes in both their leaf and stem tissues, and whether differences in fungal community composition were linked to the level of infestation using a metabarcoding Internal Transcribed Spacer (ITS) amplicon sequencing approach. Our analyses showed differences in fungal community composition and diversity between haplotypes and tissue types, but none of these differences were directly correlated with N. biwakoensis infestation severity. However, we did find that the European haplotype hosted higher putative pathogen loads in stem tissues compared to the Delta haplotype, which may confer resistance to herbivory, though it is possible that differences in infestation between haplotypes are due to morphology.

AB  - Dairy products are an important source of protein and other nutrients in the Mediterranean diet. In these countries, the most common sources of milk for producing dairy products are cow, goat, sheep, and buffalo. Andalusia is traditionally the largest producer of goat milk in Spain. Kefir is a fermented product made from bacteria and yeasts and has health benefits beyond its nutritional properties. There is a lack of knowledge about the molecular mechanisms and metabolites that bring about these benefits. In this work, the combination of analytical techniques (GC-FID, UHPLC-MS-QToF, GC-QqQ-MS, and GC-ToF-MS) resulted in the detection of 105 metabolites in kefir produced with goat milk from two different thermal treatments (raw and pasteurized) fermented at four time points (12, 24, 36, and 48 h, using 0 h as the control). Of these, 27 metabolites differed between kefir produced with raw and pasteurized milk. These changes could possibly be caused by the effect of pasteurization on the microbial population in the starting milk. Some interesting molecules were identified, such as shikimic acid, dehydroabietic acid, GABA, and tyramine, which could be related to antibacterial properties, strengthening of the immune system, and arterial pressure. Moreover, a viability assay of the NIRS technique was performed to evaluate its use in monitoring the fermentation and classification of samples, which resulted in a 90% accuracy in comparison to correctly classified samples according to their fermentation time. This study represents the most comprehensive metabolomic analysis of goat milk kefir so far, revealing the intricate changes in metabolites during fermentation and the impact of milk treatment.

AB  - Resource competition is an important interaction that can structure ecological communities, but is difficult to demonstrate in nature, and rarely demonstrated for large mammals including marsupials. We analysed 10 years of population survey data to investigate resource competition between bare-nosed wombats (Vombatus ursinus) and eastern grey kangaroos (Macropus giganteus) at two sites to assess whether resource competition is occurring. At one site, wombat abundance was reduced by increased mortality from mange disease, whereas at the other site, kangaroo abundance was reduced primarily by culling. We used the modified Lotka-Volterra competition (LVC) models to describe the mechanism of resource competition and fitted those models to the empirical data by maximum likelihood estimation. We found strong negative relationships between the abundance of wombats and kangaroos at each site, and resource competition was also mechanistically supported by the modified LVC models. The estimated competition coefficients indicate that bare-nosed wombats are a slightly superior competitor of eastern grey kangaroos than vice versa, and that intraspecific competition is almost twice as strong as interspecific competition. In addition, this study facilitated the calculation of the transmission rate associated with mange disease at one site (0.011), and the removal rate owing to culling, the introduction of a predator species, and drought at the other site (0.0006). Collectively, this research represents a rare empirical demonstration of resource competition between large mammals and contributes new insight into the ecology of two of Australia's largest grazing marsupials.

Two brown rats and 11 house mice were positive for neutralizing antibodies using a surrogate virus neutralization test, but negative or indeterminate with the Multiplexed Fluorometric ImmunoAssay COVID-Plex, which targets full-length spike and nuclear proteins. Oro-nasopharyngeal swabs and fecal samples tested negative by RT-qPCR, with an indeterminate fecal sample in one house mouse. Continued surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 in wild rodents is warranted.

AB  - Finding pathways to more sustainability and resilience of farming systems requires the avoidance of exceeding critical thresholds and the timely identification of viable alternative system configurations. To serve this purpose, the objective of this paper is to present a participatory, integrated and indicator-based methodology that leads researchers and farming system actors in six steps to a multi-dimensional understanding of sustainability and resilience of farming systems in the future. The methodology includes an assessment of current performance (Step 1), identification of critical thresholds whose exceedance can lead to large and permanent system change (Step 2), impact assessment when critical thresholds are exceeded (Step 3), identification of desired alternative systems and their expected improved performance of sustainability and resilience (Step 4), identification of strategies to realize those alternative systems (Step 5), and an assessment on the compatibility of alternative systems with the developments of exogenous factors as projected in different future scenarios (Step 6). The method is applied in 11 EU farming systems, and the application to extensive sheep production in Huesca, Spain, is presented here, as its problematic situation provides insights for other farming systems. Participants in the participatory workshop indicated that their farming system is very close to a decline or even a collapse. Approaching and exceeding critical thresholds in the social, economic and environmental domain are currently causing a vicious circle that includes low economic returns, low attractiveness of the farming system and abandonment of pasture lands. More sustainable and resilient alternative systems to counteract the current negative system dynamics were proposed by participants: a semi-intensive system primarily aimed at improving production and a high-tech extensive system primarily aimed at providing public goods. Both alternatives place a strong emphasis on the role of technology, but differ in their approach towards grazing, which is reflected in the different strategies that are foreseen to realize those alternatives. Although the high-tech extensive system seems most compatible with a future in which sustainable food production is very important, the semi-intensive system seems a less risky bet as it has on average the best compatibility with multiple future scenarios. Overall, the methodology can be regarded as relatively quick, interactive and interdisciplinary, providing ample information on critical thresholds, current system dynamics and future possibilities. As such, the method enables stakeholders to think and talk about the future of their system, paving the way for improved sustainability and resilience.

AB  - We defined the reference intervals for blood parameters of giant pandas. This is the first study to reveal changes in blood parameters in giant pandas in response to changes in elevation. These data help us to plan reintroduction of captive born giant pandas.
   Physiological indexes like blood parameters have been widely used to monitor the health of free-roaming animals. Attempts to reintroduce one of China's most endangered species, the giant panda (Ailuropoda melanoleuca), have been hampered by a lack of data on its ecology and physiology. We examined three giant pandas' hematological and blood chemistry parameters in a soft release program and 30 captive giant pandas as controls and determined the reference intervals (RIs) for those blood parameters in the captive animals. Elevation, captivity status and the interaction of those factors were statistically significant for hematologic measures. Release pandas had significantly higher hemoglobin and hematocrit values after they moved to high elevation locations. We also found significant difference in the enzyme parameters between high and low elevation pandas such as higher aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, creatinine kinase, amylase and lower lactate dehydrogenase and alkaline phosphatase. Release pandas also had higher nutrition parameter values such as higher albumin, globulin and creatinine. The RI for blood parameters in our study provides a baseline to monitor the health of captive animals and forms the basis for assessing the health of free-roaming giant pandas in future reintroduction efforts.

AB  - Since 2007, an ongoing African swine fever (ASF) pandemic has significantly impacted Eurasia. Extensive field evidence and modeling confirm the central role of wild boar in ASF epidemiology. To effectively control and eradicate the infection, rapid detection of the ASF virus (ASFV) is crucial for prompt intervention in areas of recent viral introduction or ongoing outbreaks. Environmental DNA (eDNA) is a cost-effective and non-invasive technique that has shown promising results in monitoring animal species and their pathogens and has the potential to be used for wildlife disease surveillance. In this study, we designed and evaluated an eDNA sampling method for highly turbid water and soil samples to detect ASFV and wild boar (Sus scrofa) DNA as a control using qPCR while ensuring biosafety measures and evaluating ASF epidemiology. To validate our method, we obtained samples from La Mandria Regional Park (LMRP) in northwestern Italy, an area free of ASFV, and spiked them in a laboratory setting with an ASFV's synthetic DNA template. Our findings highlight the potential of eDNA monitoring as a reliable, rapid, and safe method for early detection of ASFV from soil and turbid water samples.

AB  - Kelp forests have deteriorated globally due to anthropogenic stressors. There is an urgent need to extend baselines, to understand the processes that underlie the persistence and recovery of kelp forests, and to distinguish the normal range of ecosystem variability from more extreme changes. Using a mixed-method, historical ecology approach, we integrate archival data, oral histories, and contemporary ecological data to examine the dynamics of kelp forests over a multi-decadal to multi-century time-period in central California. We focus on sea otters, sunflower seastars, sea urchins, kelp cover, kelp species dynamics, and climate. From 1826 to 2020, kelp was highly variable. There were seven periods of low kelp cover and two periods of exceptionally low kelp cover (1897-1899; 2014-2016) following El Ni & ntilde;o-Southern Oscillations (ENSOs). Exceptionally low kelp cover did not occur when two predators-seastars and sea otters-were both present. In all cases, kelp recovered following times of extremely low cover, with a lag, which was extended by the duration of warm water anomalies (ENSO Recovery Lag). Kelp remained low for approximately 2 years following 80% of ENSOs. The greatest kelp decline (12-fold) was in Santa Cruz (northern Monterey Bay). Herbivore populations (sea urchins) were highly variable over the past century and exhibited short- and long-term changes in abundance. Sunflower seastars were present in low, stable abundances prior to seastar wasting disease (1938-2013, mean density = 0.02/m2) when they declined by 97.5%. Insights from this reconstruction indicate that kelp recovery following extended warm water anomalies exhibits a lag and occurs over multiple years.

AB  - Because of the poor stability and rheological properties of fat-free stirred yogurt fortified with fruit pulp, new functional polysaccharides as a natural emulsifier, which can increase viscosity in the aqueous phase, may be needed. This study aimed to evaluate the effects of Exidia yadongensis polysaccharide (EYP) as emulsifier on the stability, aroma, and antioxidant activities of mango buffalo yogurt at 4 degrees C for 25 days. The yogurt with 15 g/L EYP gave a higher content of 215 g/L total solids, 11.3 g/L exopolysaccharides, 0.10 g/L total polyphenols, 630.5 g/L water-holding capacity, and 11.43 g/kg total free amino acids, and maintained better texture, DPPH scavenging activity of 54.05 % and OH scavenging rates of 67.16 %. Moreover, the EYP exhibited the expected ability to weaken postacidification, syneresis, and growth of microorganism, and greatly promote the textural, rheological properties, suspension stability, microstructure, and aroma profiles of stirred mango-flavored buffalo yogurt (p < 0.05). In addition, the addition of 15 g/L EYP can inhibit protein degradation and improve the stability of secondary structure of the protein complex in mango yogurt during 25 days of storage. Therefore, EYP (15 g/L) could be used as natural positive functional factors and emulsifiers in such fat-free stirred yogurt industry.

AB  - We studied the effects of farming systems and soil nematodes on the rhizosphere microbial profiles in three banana farming systems (conventional, barbecho and organic) compared with non-cultivated controls. Bacterial 16S Amplicon Sequence Variants (ASV) and fungal ITS1-2 OTUs were obtained by NGS from experimental fields in Costa Rica, each with a given farming system. Plant-parasitic nematodes included Meloidogyne, Helicotylenchus, Radopholus, and other species. The banana cultivation and, to a minor extent, the field management type influenced the rhizosphere ASV and OTUs abundances, with a higher diversity found in organic versus conventional crops, with the organic control as the most biodiverse. Diversity indices showed differences for the total number of individuals (lowest in conventional banana) and rare species (highest in organic controls). Fungi differed for the highest species richness in the organic controls. Soil variables affecting microbial abundance included low Fe content and acidic pH. Nematodes were associated with microbial taxa that were specific to each herbivore species or feeding group, with omnivores/predators influencing microbial profiles mostly in the organic crop and controls. The organic management had the lowest impact on the diversity of belowground nematodes and rhizosphere microbiome, highlighting its beneficial potential in sustainable banana production and agroecosystem resilience.

AB  - The ability to locate essential resources is a critical step for wildlife translocated into novel environments. Understanding this process of exploration is highly desirable for management that seeks to resettle wildlife, particularly as translocation projects tend to be expensive and have a high potential for failure. African savannah elephants (Loxodonta africana) are very mobile and rely on large areas especially in arid environments, and are translocated for differing management and conservation objectives. Thus, research into how translocated elephants use the landscape when released may both guide elephant managers and be useful for translocations of other species that adjust their movement to social and ecological conditions. In this study, we investigated the movement of eight GPS tracked calves (translocated in three cohorts) following their soft release into a 107 km(2) fenced wildlife sanctuary in northern Kenya and compared their movement with that of five tracked wild elephants in the sanctuary. We describe their exploration of the sanctuary, discovery of water points, and activity budgets during the first seven, 14, and 20 months after release. We explored how patterns are affected by time since release, ecological conditions, and social factors. We found that calves visited new areas of the sanctuary and water points during greener periods and earlier post-release. Social context was associated with exploration, with later release and association with wild elephants predictive of visits to new areas. Wild elephants tended to use a greater number of sites per 14-day period than the released calves. Activity budgets determined from hidden Markov models (including the states directed walk, encamped, and meandering) suggested that released calves differed from wild elephants. The first two cohorts of calves spent a significantly greater proportion of time in the directed walk state and a significantly lower proportion of time in the encamped state relative to the wild elephants. Our results represent a step forward in describing the movements of elephant orphan calves released to the wild following a period of profound social disruption when they lost their natal family and were rehabilitated with other orphan calves under human care. We discuss the implications of the elephant behavior we observed for improving release procedures and for defining success benchmarks for translocation projects.

AB  - The decline and fragmentation of habitats areas are two main factors that lead to the reduction of biodiversity in landscape ecosystems. As a kind of large carnivores, South China tiger (Panthera tigris amoyensis) is one of the most endangered tiger subspecies and considered to be extinct in the wild. The Chinese government has intended to release a certain number of tigers into two of their historically habitats areas, Hupingshan-Houhe national nature reserves (NNR) in central-south China that provides suitable habitats for P. tigris. Because wild boar (Sus scrofa) is a prey of P. tigris, spatially characterizing the populations of the prey and its habitats is critical for the success of habituating the tigers to the areas. Although there has been effort made to protect the habitats of wild boar, there have been no report that deal with investigation and analysis of the habitat suitability and potential forwild boar, especially in terms of landscape connectivity. Herewe present the novel integration of the habitat suitability index (HSI) and graph-based network to identify the priority areas for wild boar dispersal in and around the NNR. In addition, a novel method to identify the proper connectivity distance to avoid excessive connectivity when the field data are essentially non-existent. Results showed that in summer andwinter, the potential habitat areas were 6848-10,245 and 5984-10,152km(2), respectively. The total area of the priority patches was 1590 km(2), approximately occupying 16% of the suitable habitat area. Our study indicated that the novel integration of the HSI and network analysis led to an effective approach to spatially characterize priority patches to support decision-making for landscape planning. The results shown here also have implications for future efforts for habituating large carnivores into their historical habitat regions. (c) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - In this article, we use a multiproxy approach based on stable isotope analyses (delta 18O and delta 13C), mesowear, and microwear dental analysis to reconstruct the climate, diet, and habitat of Plio-Pleistocene herbivores at the site of Ahl al Oughlam in western Morocco. This study has been conducted on teeth from several taxa (Sivatherium maurusium, Hipparion pomeli, Metridiochoerus phacochoeroides, Gazella sp., Alcelaphini and Anancus osiris), enabling a robust ecological reconstruction. Our isotopic results suggest a predominance of C3 plant consumption for all analyzed species, while dental wear indicates a varied diet, with evidence for both browsing and grazing behavior being present. The combination of proxies indicates a landscape dominated by open C3 grasslands in an arid climate, as supported by the Mean Annual Precipitation (MAP) results. These findings contribute to the ongoing debate on the ecological context that facilitated the Plio-Pleistocene dispersal, occupation, and evolution of mammals and hominins in northern Africa, for which limited information is available.

AB  - A Squeeze and Excitation Network is a deep -learning architectural component designed to enhance networks. The "squeeze" step reduces the spatial dimensions of the input feature maps, and the "excitation" step adaptively recalibrates channel -wise feature responses. This allows the network to focus on more educational features and ignore less useful ones. Garbage classification is a crucial task for sustainable environmental management. It involves categorizing waste into recyclables, organics, and non-recyclables, among other classes. Deep learning models, like the proposed Buffalo Optimizer -based SEN, can play a pivotal role in automating this classification process using computer vision techniques. Garbage Classification: There is still a long way to go until countries worldwide have successfully increased public awareness and implemented measures to prevent the rapid degradation of the natural environment. The annual global generation of e -waste is between 20 and 50 million growing components of municipal solid garbage. The disposal of electronic trash presents significant threats to environmental quality. As a result, pollution monitoring and control are crucial for maintaining a healthy ecosystem. In this research, picture -layered characteristics were extracted using an encoder composed of varying numbers of ResBlocks and the Squeeze -and -Excitation (SE) block, which was built on top of the UNet backbone network. UNet's decoder structure was streamlined, and the number of network model parameters was cut in half. In the meantime, the multiscale feature fusion module was developed to enhance the network's detection accuracy by optimizing its parameters with a bespoke loss function in place of the standard function. The African Buffalo Optimisation Algorithm is also used to fine-tune the hyperparameters.

AB  - Among large-sized mammals, the wild boar Sus scrofa is the main agricultural pest in Mediterranean countries. Despite being a widely studied species, its physiological adaptability requires a high number of research works assessing its ecology in different habitat types. Furthermore, little is known about ecology of the wild boar at the southernmost limits of its distribution range. We studied home range size, habitat selection and activity rhythms of female wild boar in a protected area of Southern Italy, at the limits of its distribution range. Population density was also assessed through drive counts. We monitored GPS collar-tagged, adult wild boar for at least 6 months. Female family groups selected deciduous woodland throughout the year, whereas scrubland and cultivations were selected only during the summer. Locations of wild boar were much closer to the forest edge than expected by chance alone. Throughout the year, female wild boar were mostly active between dusk and dawn with no significant inter-seasonal differences in the activity time; diurnal activity occurred principally in winter and spring. Wild boar were more active in the darkest nights, while their activity decreased in the full moon nights, possibly to limit encounters with the main predator, the grey wolf Canis lupus.

AB  - Males in polygynous systems may be facing a trade-off between the traits that enhance reproductive success and the need to cope with environmental change. To secure mates, males invest into large bodies, lavish ornaments and costly activities, but these investments may be incompatible with future environments. As climatic change intensifies, thermal stressors could be disrupting the energy-intensive pathways that historically have yielded mating opportunity. We evaluated how traits associated with social dominance interacted with environmental conditions to shape mating behaviour and opportunity in moose (Alces alces), a heat-sensitive species in which southern populations live at the edge of their thermal tolerance. We anticipated that males with favourable characteristics (e.g. age, weaponry) would allocate more to reproduction, resulting in increased mating opportunity. We expected that warm temperatures would limit reproductive effort, especially as age and weapon size increased. We quantified mating tactics, effort, and opportunity for male moose ranging in age from 1.5 to 11.5 years. We used hidden Markov models to detect mating tactics, accelerometer data to quantify movement effort, and proximity to females as a proxy for mating opportunity. We modelled these mating dynamics as a function of age, weapon size, and ambient temperature. Warm temperatures exaggerated age-related differences in time and effort allocated to reproductive movement. Heat disproportionately limited reproductive effort in old males, the ages that also had the greatest mating opportunity. Even though warm temperatures altered mating behaviour, they did not reduce mating opportunity. Across temperatures, mating opportunity was highest in prime-age and old males, yet time and effort devoted to reproductive movement decreased with age. Climate change, which is increasing autumn temperatures, may increase variation in reproductive effort across ages and depress the movement of old males, who are typically the primary breeders. The discrepancy between behaviour and opportunity suggests that movement is not a reliable pathway to reproduction and emphasizes the advantages of energy-saving strategies, especially as environments become more taxing for heat-sensitive species. We reveal the limitations of movement effort in polygynous mating strategies and the susceptibility of this critical life history stage to environmental change.

AB  - This study aimed to compare four popular machine learning algorithms to model and predict the body weight through various body measurements of small ruminants. The regression tree, random forests, support vector machine and gradient boosting machine methods have been used to predict the live body weight (target variable) of the animal. The predictors (independent variables) included in the current study were sex of the animal, neck length, diagonal body length, head girth above eyes,shank circumference, belly sprung, and rump height measurements of beetal goats (1 - 7 years in age) of Pakistan. In order to test the performance of candidate methods, various evaluation measures such as the mean absolute error, root mean squared error, mean absolute percentage error, coefficient of determination and the correlation between the actual and predicted body weights were calculated. A 10-fold cross validation was used on the training dataset for tuning the hyperparameters of the models whereas a separate testing dataset was used for evaluation of the predictive performance of machine learning methods. The predictive performance of random forests and gradient boosting methods were found to provide better results than other competing methods in accurately predicting the live body weight of the beetal goats.

AB  - There are rising concerns about the negative environmental impacts of excessive N fertilizers used in agriculture. However, perennial crops require periodic large N doses for optimum growth. Hence, minimizing N application and regulating its long-term availability using N-cycling-mediating bacteria is a viable option that remains unexplored. We explored the comparative potentials of biochar and manure to provide a conducive condition for Bacillus subtilis and Bacillus licheniformis to improve their effects on N-cycling enzyme activity, the distribution of indigenous N-cycling-related bacteria, and long-term N availability for the growth of Nageia nagi after one year of single N dose. Results showed that NH4+-N did not vary across the treatments. While NO3--N showed no variation between the fertilizer+biochar (FB) and fertilizer+manure (FM) treatments, dissolved organic-N (DON) increased in FB. Inoculation+fertilizer+biochar (FBI) induced a potential N-cycling enzyme activity, hence, an increase in NO3--N, DON, and amino acid-N concentrations compared to inoculation+fertilizer+manure (FMI). This was associated with increased plant growth and leaf-N concentration in the inoculated treatments. Higher N-cycling due to Bacillus spp. inoculation increased the diversity of soil bacteria in FMI compared to FBI and other treatments. However, an increase in the relative abundance of some key nitrification-related bacterial taxa in FBI (Betaproteobacteria, Gammaproteobacteria, and Actinobacteria) was associated with higher N-cycling enzyme activity, NO3--N, DON, and amino acid-N concentrations compared to FMI. Due to low persistence, the long-term effect of Bacillus spp. on N release was mainly indirect, through their stimulatory effect on N-cycling enzyme activity and bacterial community. Therefore, periodic inoculation in biochar amended soils could be important in sustaining long-term N availability.

AB  - Gut microorganisms and the products of their metabolism thoroughly affect host brain development, function and behavior. Since alterations of brain plasticity and cognition have been demonstrated upon motor, sensorial and social enrichment of the housing conditions, we hypothesized that gut microbiota and metabolome could be altered by environmental stimuli, providing part of the missing link among environmental signals and brain effects. In this preliminary study, metagenomic and metabolomic analyses of mice housed in different environmental conditions, standard and enriched, identify environment-specific microbial communities and metabolic profiles. We show that mice housed in an enriched environment have distinctive microbiota composition with a reduction in gut bacterial richness and biodiversity and are characterized by a metabolomic fingerprint with the increase of formate and acetate and the decrease of bile salts. We demonstrate that mice treated with a mixture of formate and acetate recapitulate some of the brain plasticity effects modulated by environmental enrichment, such as hippocampal neurogenesis, neurotrophin production, short-term plasticity and cognitive behaviors, that can be further exploited to decipher the mechanisms involved in experience-dependent brain plasticity.
   Mice exposed to environmental enrichment for 5 weeks display distinct microbiota composition and behavioral and metabolic profiles compared to mice exposed to a standard environment. Mice treated with a mixture of short-chain fatty acids that are produced by gut bacteria recapitulate some of the effects of this environmental enrichment.

AB  - Herbivore performance is influenced by plant host quality and chemical defences, both of which are influenced by belowground symbionts of plants and herbivory history. The previous herbivory may suppress or facilitate subsequent herbivore performance through changes in plant chemistry and tissue quality. Likewise, arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AM fungi) can alter both plant quality and plant responses to aboveground herbivory, as mycorrhizal-mediated alterations of the nutritional budget may alter leaf nutritional quality, chemical profiles, and available leaf surface area. Despite evidence that both herbivory history and AM fungi can independently affect herbivore performance, few studies directly test both at the same time. Here, the role of AM fungi and herbivory history on the performance of a pest insect (Spodoptera frugiperda) on a common forb (Solidago altissima) grown with different AM fungal additions (no AM fungi, single species, multispecies) was directly tested. Evidence that the effect of herbivory history on herbivore performance depended on the AM fungal environment of the plant was found. Specifically, the composition of the AM fungal additions altered the directionality of herbivore performance on plants with and without prior herbivory. Without added AM fungi, herbivores demonstrated a classically suppressed growth rate on grazed plants. With a single species AM fungi added, herbivores performed the same on host plants, regardless of herbivory history. With diverse AM fungi added, herbivore growth increased on grazed plants. Mycorrhizal-mediated changes in plant chemical profiles did not explain herbivore performance. These results emphasise the need for direct tests of mycorrhizal diversity on plant-insect interactions.

   center dot The fate of some mammal species in the 2019-20 wildfires was a high-profile emblematic - concern for the community, with such attention catalysing concerted responses by many organisations.
   center dot The impacts of the wildfires were superimposed on a prevalent pattern of decline for many Australian mammals.
   center dot Post- fire recovery of many mammal species will be challenging, given the individual and compounding impacts of other threats and a changing fire regime likely to be characterised by more frequent comparable fires.
   center dot On-ground research following the 2019-20 wildfires has provided some evidence about population-level impacts at some sites.
   Main findings
   The 2019-20 wildfires burnt at least 50% of the distributions of five mammal species and 30-50% of the distributions of a further 18 mammal species.
   center dot Including subspecies, the most extreme fire overlap (95% of range burnt) was for the Kangaroo Island dunnart (Sminthopsis griseoventer aitkeni).
   center dot Post- fire sampling has confirmed marked population losses in burnt areas for a range of mammals, especially where fires were of high severity.
   center dot Population losses due to the 2019-20 wildfires are likely to have been of sufficient magnitude to render five mammal taxa newly eligible for listing as threatened.
   center dot Many government agencies and other groups instituted management interventions in the immediate aftermath of the fires. These efforts are likely to have achieved some local benefits.
   center dot Most of the fire-affected mammal species are unlikely to recover to their pre-fire population size over the next decade; and ongoing decline of many species is likely should comparable fires recur in the future.

AB  - In coastal lagoons, eutrophication and hydrology are interacting factors that produce distortions in biogeochemical nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) cycles. Such distortions affect nutrient relative availability and produce cascade consequences on primary producer's community and ecosystem functioning. In this study, the seasonal functioning of a coastal lagoon was investigated with a multielement approach, via the construction and analysis of network models. Spring and summer networks, both for N and P flows, have been simultaneously compiled for the northern transitional , southern confined area of the hypertrophic Curonian Lagoon (SE Baltic Sea). Ecological Network Analysis was applied to address the combined effect of hydrology and seasonality on biogeochemical processes. Results suggest that the ecosystem is more active and presents higher N and P fluxes in summer compared to spring, regardless of the area. Furthermore, larger internal recycling characterizes the confined compared to the transitional area, regardless of the season. The two areas differed in the fate of available nutrients. The transi- tional area received large riverine inputs that were mainly transferred to the sea without the conversion into primary producers' biomass. The confined area had fewer inputs but proportionally larger conversion into phytoplankton biomass. In summer, particularly in the confined area, primary production was inefficiently consumed by herbivores. Most phytoplanktonic N and P, in the confined area more than in the transitional area, were conveyed to the detritus pathway where P, more than N, was recycled, contributing to the unbalance in N:P stoichiometry and favouring N -fixing cyanobacteria over other phytoplankton groups. The findings of this study provide a comprehensive understanding of N and P circulation patterns in lagoon areas characterized by different hydrology. They also support the importance of a stoichiometric approach to trace relative differences in N and P recycling and abundance, that promote blooms, drive algal communities and whole ecosystem functioning.

AB  - Plant-herbivore-parasitoid systems are poorly studied in the tropics. Enicospilus carmenae Campos and Palacio sp. nov. are described, originating from southern Mexico in the Yucatan Peninsula and establishing a new tri-trophic interaction. This species is a koinobiont larval endoparasitoid of the American silkworm moth caterpillar Zanola verago (Cramer) (Lepidoptera: Apatelodidae) feeding on the shrub Piper neesianum C.DC. (Piperaceae) in a semi-evergreen forest. The host plant P. neesianum had no herbivore records to date, and a single collection event yielded the rearing of a new species of Enicospilus (Ichneumonidae, Ophioninae). Morphological, molecular (COI), biological, ecological, and geographical data are integrated to delineate the new species.

AB  - The conservation literature provides an important resource for conservation practice and reflects key areas of current research interest, but not necessarily those of highest priority, in the field of conservation science. In one of the most comprehensive studies of its kind, this paper evaluates 4388 articles from three leading conservation journals with different impact factors (Biological Conservation, Conservation Letters, and Oryx) for the period 2010-2019. The analysis shows that previously identified trends still hold true in many instances, including a continuing taxonomic bias towards vertebrates and particularly in favour of mammals. Geographical biases also persist, favouring Europe and North America with respect to where research is undertaken, who writes about it, and how it is funded, although publication of research conducted in Africa is increasing. It is difficult to evaluate changes in author gender outside the decade studied as this topic has not been widely considered in previous studies, but parity in authorship has not yet been achieved in any of the journals examined. To overcome the biases identified, researchers, editors, and funding organisations collectively still need to do more to redirect conservation efforts where they are most urgently needed and encourage more women and more researchers from lower income countries to participate in research by helping to remove the barriers that currently limit them.

AB  - Extensive sheep farming systems provide numerous ecosystem services, most of which consumers are not aware of. Consumers' subjective quality perception relates to intrinsic and extrinsic quality attributes. Extrinsic quality attributes, like animal welfare, conservation of biodiversity, and regional and sustainable lamb meat production, meet the expectations of meat consumers. Communication of quality attributes can support consumers' willingness to buy and pay a premium price, as well as producers' economic viability. Previous studies focused on consumers' perception of intrinsic quality attributes, while it is our objective to analyse the target group-specific communication of extrinsic quality attributes of extensive sheep farming. An online survey with 387 valid respondents included lamb meat consumers in Berlin-Brandenburg and revealed their consumption patterns. The sample is representative of Berlin-Brandenburg in net household income, population division and gender, while academics and respondents over 50 years were overrepresented. The survey addressed demographics, meat consumption and purchasing behaviour, preferences for different lamb meat products, purchasing motives and barriers, perception of communication messages and personal initiative for the purchase of regional lamb. Via Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Cluster Analysis, we identified two key target groups for regionally produced lamb meat: "Foodies" and "Cooking enthusiasts". Guided by Alphabet theory with its specific focus on Knowledge, Information seeking behaviour and purchasing Habit, we derive recommendations for target-group-specific communication of regionally produced lamb meat. "Foodies" showed a high potential for direct marketing and personal storytelling of sheep farmers. "Cooking enthusiasts" are best addressed through print and online marketing with a focus on cooking and personal health.

AB  - A study was conducted in Thuma area in central Malawi to quantify contemporary land cover and to explore the degree of land use change in the Thuma forest reserve area of Malawi by analysing and comparing satellite-derived land cover maps from 1997, 2007 and 2017. The study was carried out using Remote Sensing and Geographic Information System (GIS), focusing on analysis of Landsat 5 ETM and Landsat 8 ORI/TIRS satellite images. The classification was conducted for the following distinct classes; closed forest, open forest, shrubland, savanna grassland, agriculture fields, and water. The analysis revealed that closed forest diminished from 19% in 1997 to 10% in 2007 to 6% in 2017. Open forest reduced from 30% to 21% from 1997 to 2007 but increased to 22% in 2017. Agriculture area almost doubled from 37% in 1997 to 64% in 2017. The actual area from 1997 to 2017, shows that closed forest has reduced from 7,000 ha to 3,000 ha while open forest from 12,900 ha to 7800 ha. Savanna grassland has doubled from 5,900 ha to 13,000 ha. However, future studies should use modern satellites such as Sentinel and Landsat 9 for improved quantification of changes. The findings show that even the protected forest reserve (previously dominated by closed forest) is not fully protected from deforestation by local communities. Government and other stakeholders should devise measures to meet the needs of the surrounding communities and the ecological/biophysical needs of the reserves. Based on this study, issues of re-demarcation of the forest reserve and the accessed area should also be explored. This study serves as a reference for the management of Thuma Forest Reserve as a refuge for natural tree species, rivers that harbour endemic fish species (Opsaridium microlepis and Opsaridium microcephalis) and the sustainable management of endangered elephants in the reserve.

AB  - Practical tools to quantify range-wide dietary choices of the polar bear have not been well developed, thus impeding the monitoring of this species in a changing climate. Here we describe our steps toward non-invasive polar bear diet determination with the optimization of 454 pyrosequencing of a 136 base pair ( bp) mitochondrial cytochrome b (cytb) fragment amplified from the extracts of captive and wild polar bear faeces. We first determine the efficacy, reliability, and accuracy of our method using five faecal samples from a captive polar bear fed a known diet at the Canadian Polar Bear Habitat in Cochrane, Ontario, Canada; 19 samples from three polar bears at the Metro Toronto Zoo, Toronto, Ontario, Canada; and seven samples from seven wild (unfed) polar bears from a holding facility in Churchill, Manitoba, Canada. We report 91% overall success in amplifying a 136 bp cytb amplicon from the faeces of polar bears. Our DNA analyses accurately recovered the vertebrate diet profiles of captive bears fed known diets. We then characterized multiyear vertebrate prey diet choices from free-ranging polar bears from the sea ice of the M'Clintock Channel polar bear management unit, Nunavut, Canada (n = 117 from an unknown number of bears). These data point to a diet unsurprisingly dominated by ringed seal (Pusa hispida) while including evidence of bearded seal (Erignathus barbatus), harbour seal (Phoca vitulina), muskox (Ovibos moschatus ssp.), Arctic fox (Vulpes lagopus), wolf (Canis lupus), Herring Gull (Larus argentatus), and Willow Ptarmigan (Lagopus lagopus). We found low levels of contamination (< 3% of sequences when present) and suggest specific process improvements to reduce contamination in range-wide studies. Together, these findings indicate that next-generation sequencing-based diet assessments show great promise in monitoring free-ranging polar bears in this time of climate change.

AB  - Invertebrate herbivory is suggested to modulate community shifts caused by climate warming in grasslands. However, experimental evidence is lacking, especially in high elevation areas. We examined the interactive effect of experimental warming and the grassland caterpillar Gynaephora alpherakjj, a typical invertebrate herbivorous insect with sedge preference, on the structure of plant community in a sedge-dominated alpine meadow in the Tibetan Plateau. We manipulated both herbivore and temperature in a full factorial field experiment using passive warming chambers over one plant-growing season. Results show that simulated warming significantly increased the aboveground plant biomass (APB) of forbs and total APB, while the presence of caterpillars significantly decreased sedge APB and total APB. The increase in consumption of sedges by caterpillars under warmed conditions can largely be ascribed to the increase in feeding time of caterpillars. Importantly, the presence of caterpillars significantly decreased the APB ratio of sedges to forbs in the warmed but not in the unwarmed chambers. These results suggest that with a warming climate, invertebrate herbivory could accelerate community shifts from sedge dominance to forb dominance in only one plant-growing season in the Tibetan alpine meadow. This shift would reduce the biomass of high-quality forage and further threaten animal husbandry in this area. Considering the harm of G. alpherakjj to grasslands, its population should be controlled more strictly under the global warming scenario.

AB  - Rangelands are the dominant land use across a broad swath of central North America where they span a wide gradient, from <350 to >900 mm, in mean annual precipitation. Substantial efforts have examined temporal and spatial variation in aboveground net primary production (ANPP) to precipitation (PPT) across this gradient. In contrast, net secondary productivity (NSP, e.g., primary consumer production) has not been evaluated analogously. However, livestock production, which is a form of NSP or primary consumer production supported by primary production, is the dominant non-cultivated land use and an integral economic driver in these regions. Here, we used long-term (mean length = 19 years) ANPP and NSP data from six research sites across the Central Great Plains with a history of a conservative stocking to determine resource (i.e., PPT)-productivity relationships, NSP sensitivities to dry-year precipitation, and regional trophic efficiencies (e.g., NSP:ANPP ratio). PPT-ANPP relationships were linear for both temporal (site-based) and spatial (among site) gradients. The spatial PPT-NSP model revealed that PPT mediated a saturating relationship for NSP as sites became more mesic, a finding that contrasts with many plant-based PPT-ANPP relationships. A saturating response to high growing-season precipitation suggests biogeochemical rather than vegetation growth constraints may govern NSP (i.e., large herbivore production). Differential sensitivity in NSP to dry years demonstrated that the primary consumer production response heightened as sites became more xeric. Although sensitivity generally decreased with increasing precipitation as predicted from known PPT-ANPP relationships, evidence suggests that the dominant species' identity and traits influenced secondary production efficiency. Non-native northern mixed-grass prairie was outperformed by native Central Great Plains rangeland in sensitivity to dry years and efficiency in converting ANPP to NSP. A more comprehensive understanding of the mechanisms leading to differences in producer and consumer responses will require multisite experiments to assess biotic and abiotic determinants of multi-trophic level efficiency and sensitivity.

AB  - Extensive sheep pasturing in alpine regions has a long tradition and fulfils numerous sociological, economic and ecological functions. The effects of sheep grazing on the floristic composition and vice versa depend on various factors. Knowledge of potential interrelations is crucial to developing adequate management systems to maintain pasture productivity and its unique biodiversity. The aim of the present study was to discuss the potential interrelations between movement and selective grazing behaviour of free-ranging unherded sheep and the botanical composition of high-altitude mountain pastures in northern Italy. General movement patterns were determined by using GPS tracking. The floristic composition of areas roamed by the sheep was analysed by collecting physical data during the summer of 2022. The energy content of ingested herbage biomass was determined based on faecal samples. Ranging between 2296 and 3015 m above sea level (a.s.l.), the average altitude used by the sheep was 2654 m a.s.l. Correlation analyses showed that the sheep used significantly higher altitudes with increasing temperature and sunshine duration and with decreasing air humidity and rainfall. A clear selective grazing behaviour was revealed, namely a preference for species with better nutritional attributes. Poa alpina was the most preferred species, while areas dominated by Nardus stricta were avoided. Furthermore, the sheep showed an uphill migration over the season, possibly caused by the delayed start of grassland growth at higher altitudes. Analyses of faecal samples revealed sufficient energy contents, presumably as a result of the targeted selection of nutritious plant species. Future studies should evaluate the feeding value of herbage on offer in order to validate the current results. The study highlights the opportunity of animal tracking in remote areas and provides indications for selective grazing of sheep under conditions of free choice.

AB  - Drought stress adversely affects the quantity and quality of canola. A 2-year experimental study was conducted to examine the role of exogenous cytokinin, epibrassinolide, and their interaction in alleviating drought stress damage on drought-sensitive (Okapi) and drought-tolerant (GKH) canola cultivars. The experiment was conducted using a split-plot factorial arrangement within a randomized complete block design. Then, the agronomic and physiological traits were evaluated with four foliar treatments (distilled water, cytokinin, epibrassinolide, and cytokinin + epibrassinolide) at two levels of field capacity and water withholding at the flowering stage. Drought stress decreased plant biomass by 50% and declined grain yield and oil yield by 33% and 30%, respectively. In GHK and Okapi cultivars, this results in membrane lipid peroxidation and relative water content reduction, as well as a reduction in chlorophyll content during flowering. As compared to field capacity treatment, foliar application of epibrassinolide increased grain yield and oil yield by 93% to 128% in drought-stressed plants. In addition, foliar application of cytokinin and epibrassinolide significantly increased the activity of peroxidase and catalase enzymes and chlorophyll levels in both canola cultivars under drought stress, resulting in improved membrane stability, relative water content, and photosynthesis rates. After epibrassinolide foliar application, MDA and cell electrolyte leakage significantly and negative were correlated with dry weight, oil yield, and grain yield. It was found that EBL foliar application resulted in reduced membrane damage, improved yield, and increased antioxidant capacity, therefore alleviating drought stress, especially in the GKH cultivar.

AB  - BackgroundsGuangxi Fangcheng Golden Camellias national nature reserve, situated in Fangcheng City, Guangxi Province, China, is a coastal region renowned for its exceptional natural environment. Over time, the residents of this area have acquired extensive knowledge regarding medicinal plants, owing to their close association with the abundant flora. Our study aims to document the medicinal plants used by the local community near the Guangxi Fangcheng Golden Camellias national nature reserve. We seek to investigate the unique regional properties, cultural significance, and potential connections between medicinal plants used in surrounding villages and those sold in markets.MethodsDuring 2019-2021, 96 informants, including 36 key informants, were interviewed in the study area. The snowball sampling method was used to select respondents from medicinal markets and villages. Local therapists were defaulted as key informants. A panel discussion was held on the protection and threat of medicinal plants and traditional knowledge. In this study, two quantitative indicators, relative frequency citation (RFC) and informant consensus factor (ICF), were used to analyze the traditional medicinal plants in the study area.ResultsAccording to the investigation, a total of 396 species of medicinal plants belonging to 295 genera and 116 families were recorded. From the perspective of Lifeform, herbs accounted for 38.9%, followed by shrubs. Most of the medicinal parts are whole plant (120 species, 25.59%), branches and leaves (116 species, 24.73%), and roots (101 species, 21.54%). Medicinal bath is the most commonly used therapeutic method. Among the 13 therapeutic targets recorded, rheumatic drugs accounted for the highest proportion, followed by muscular system diseases and skin-related diseases, which are closely related to local climate and livelihood. ICF shows that the use of local medicinal plants and related knowledge is very diverse, so local people have more options for treating diseases. Melicope pteleifolia, Clerodendrum cyrtophyllum, Lygodium flexuosum, Elephantopus scaber, Artemisia argyi, Plantago asiatica, Centella asiatica, Grangea maderaspatana, and Liquidambar formosana have high RFC, which are closely connected to local people's daily lives and are potentially vital to them. The wild vegetation, mostly around the nature reserve, is the primary source of medicinal materials sold in the urban medicinal market. Urban areas have fewer varieties of medicinal plants compared to villages near protected areas. However, there is consistency in their usage and application.ConclusionThe medicinal plants used in the villages near the Golden Camellia Nature Reserve are diverse, and the relevant traditional knowledge is relatively well preserved. The collection of medicinal materials by local people is sustainable. This study suggests that the local government should also protect relevant traditional knowledge in the decision-making process.

AB  - Large seeds interact with a wide range of animals (e.g. predators) and are dispersed via certain small animals' foraging behaviours, such as caching. Some of the most iconic species of large-seeded plants have long fascinated ecologists studying biotic interactions, such as oaks and their relatives in the Fagaceae family. The Fagaceae acorns are dispersed through synzoochory, a specific dispersal mode in which animal partners act as both seed dispersers and granivores. Although granivory (i.e. seed herbivory) can profoundly impact the survival of plant offspring, partial damage on seed reserves is a prevalent phenomenon that does not always result in seed mortality. However, previous single-species studies have resulted in mixed evidence across treatments and traits, leaving the impact of partial granivory on plant regeneration unclear. Using artificial granivory experiments on 1185 seeds of 20 Fagaceae species, here we quantify how partial loss of seed reserve affects seed germination, seedling growth and biomass allocation across a damage gradient from 0% to 96% biomass loss. We show that, although partial granivory reduces seedling growth (e.g. total biomass and number of leaves), it does not significantly affect seed germination or the overall biomass allocation of seedlings (e.g. leaf mass fraction and root:shoot biomass ratio). Seedlings from seeds more preyed upon have higher specific leaf area, indicating that they tend to grow larger but less protected leaves against herbivores, perhaps to compete for light. Synthesis. As seeds dispersed through scatter-hoarding granivores have evolved relatively large sizes, like Fagaceae acorns, our findings demonstrate that this type of seeds may tolerate partial granivory in exchange for high dispersal efficiency. This study opens new perspectives to our understanding of seed size diversity and evolution. We conclude that seed size per se is a defensive trait, that large seeds counteract potential losses of seed reserve to escape full predation and allow germination.

AB  - Biomass allocation is a key mechanism for understanding the response of alpine meadow plants to environmental changes. However, the two major theories of plant biomass partitioning, that is, optimal and equidistant allocation, are highly controversial. This study aimed to test these hypotheses by using the biomass allocation pattern of Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau alpine meadows under different herbivore assemblages and enclosures and to identify the key physicochemical factors driving changes in biomass allocation. The results showed that fencing and grazing lead to the allocation of more biomass to roots and shoots, respectively. Additionally, our results support the optimal allocation hypothesis, which is mainly regulated by changes in soil physicochemical properties. Specifically, the trade-off between aboveground- and belowground biomass negatively correlated with the soil bulk density, soil moisture, available nitrogen, and available phosphorus but positively correlated with available potassium. In terms of biomass trade-offs, co-grazing yaks and Tibetan sheep at a 1:6 ratio with moderate grazing intensity may be a reasonable method to use and protect alpine meadows on the QinghaiTibetan Plateau.

AB  - Invasive organisms can alter host-parasite relationships in a given ecosystem by spreading exotic parasites and/or becoming a new reservoir for native ones. Since these problems affect management programs of the invasive host organisms, it is necessary to monitor them individually. The Pallas's squirrel Callosciurus erythraeus is an invasive arboreal mammal introduced into Japan that threatens to exacerbate ecological and public health problems by spreading native and exotic parasites. However, only limited surveys have been available especially for ectoparasites, using the traditional combing method in which the possibility of oversight is inherent. Here, we evaluated the ectoparasite occurrences in Kanto region of Japan, using the whole-shaving method as an alternative approach. As a result of examining 52 hosts from two invaded districts (Yokohama and Yokosuka), chigger mites (Leptotrombidium spp.) and fleas (Ceratophyllus anisus and Ceratophyllus indages indages) were newly recovered in addition to the previously reported tick (Haemaphysalis flava) and exotic lice (Enderleinellus kumadai and Neophaematoponis callosciuri). The parasite burdens were higher in Yokosuka and in male host individuals, affecting infracommunity richness and composition. Our findings on the variety of native and exotic ectoparasites, at higher abundances in some cases than previously known, may suggest that both the spillover and spillback risks need to be adjusted upwards.

AB  - This experiment was carried out to evaluate the effect of dietary supplementation of three different tropical seaweed species on rumen fermentation, methane emission, antioxidant status, immunity and milk production in lactating Murrah buffaloes. Twenty-four lactating Murrah buffaloes were divided into four groups of six each in an experiment based on randomized block design (RBD) and were fed to meet their nutrient requirements (ICAR 2013). Animals in control (CON) group were fed basal diet without any supplemental seaweed, however, Kappaphycus alvarezii (KA), Gracilaria salicornia (GS) and Turbinaria conoides (TC) were supplemented at 1% of the dietary dry matter in KA, GS and TC groups, respectively. Intake and apparent digestibility of nutrients, plasma concentrations of selected blood metabolites, and thyroid hormones were similar among the groups. Supplementation of KA and GS, but not TC increased (P<0.001) the proportion of propionate in rumen fluid with a concurrent decrease (P<0.001) in acetate: propionate. The enteric methane emission was lower (P<0.05) in KA, GS groups and the maximum values were observed in groups CON and TC. Total antioxidant capacity (TAC) and immune response (cell-mediated and humoral) were higher (P<0.001), and MDA was lower (P<0.001) in seaweed-fed groups as compared to CON; the higher response was observed in group KA, followed by TC and GS. Plasma concentration of cortisol was lower (P<0.001) in group KA as compared to other groups. Milk yield and the 6% fat-corrected milk (FCM) yield (kg day(-1)) were higher (P=0.009) in KA, followed GS, corresponding values in group TC were not significantly different than those of group CON. Thus, supplementation of the tropical red seaweed improved antioxidant status, cellular and humoral immunity, and milk yield; the greater response was obtained when KA was used as feed supplement. It is concluded that supplementation of K. alvarezii at 1% of dietary DM of lactating Murrah buffaloes would improve antioxidant status, immunity and milk yield with reduction in enteric methane emission.

AB  - Coastal ecosystems of the Mediterranean Sea are among the richest in non-indigenous species, mostly due to the establishment of species coming from the Red Sea through the Suez Canal. Two herbivorous rabbitfishes, Siganus rivulatus and Siganus luridus, are already invasive in the south-eastern part of the Mediterranean Sea where they cause ecological damage by overgrazing algae.The early detection and the counting of these non-indigenous species in the rest of the Mediterranean Sea is thus a major challenge for scientists and ecosystem managers. However, analysing images from divers or remote cameras is a demanding task.Here, a dataset of 31,285 images of Siganus spp. and of six common native fishes to the Mediterranean Sea was built from 40 underwater videos recorded at three reef habitats. A deep learning algorithm was then trained to identify Siganus spp. on images containing the eight Mediterranean species. Finally, the algorithm and a post-processing filtering were tested with an independent dataset of 2024 images.The model had a recall of 0.92 for the Siganus genus (i.e., two Siganus species combined). After a confidence-based post-processing, the recall increased to 0.98 with only 4 out of 272 images of Siganus spp. being misclassified. Accuracy reached a score of 0.61 meaning that experts would have to discard false positives. Images of five native species not present in the training dataset yielded similar false positive rates than species present in the training dataset. Overall, the automatic processing of images by the model and then the checking of putative Siganus images by experts required up to five times less effort than a full processing by experts.The algorithm can help to efficiently detect these two invasive fishes in underwater images to evaluate progress towards conservation objectives and accelerate citizen-based monitoring of coastal ecosystems.

KW  - MANAGEMENT
AB  - Globally, African savanna elephants have been assessed as 'endangered'. Consequently, additional threats and losses due to human-elephant conflict (HEC) could further exacerbate the species' decline. In stark contrast, South Africa's elephant populations are mostly confined within fenced-in reserves that impede natural processes such as migration. As ecosystem engineers, elephant population growth herein should be limited. Within South Africa, elephant management has evolved as differing wildlife philosophies from utilitarian conservation ('nature for man') to biocentric preservation ('nature for nature') and a combination thereof, have been practiced. Traditionally, both HEC and population control have been largely synonymous with lethal control, i.e. culling. However, with the increase of public or expert input to Policy, lethal control is not favoured by the public. As an alternative, immunocontraception of female African savanna elephants through non-invasive, native porcine zona pellucida (pZP) vaccinations has been employed successfully and is currently adopted in 43 elephant reserves across South Africa. Current legislation now recommends culling as the last population management resort. Newly promulgated legislation calls for wellbeing and welfare to be carefully measured in all biodiversity management decisions taken to minimise threats to biodiversity. As a keystone species, elephant is a direct driver of biodiversity change. Accordingly, and in light of these developments, all population management options, including immunocontraception, must be fully considered in South Africa's largest national park, the Kruger.

AB  - Microbial inoculation plays a significant role in promoting the efficiency of biowaste conversion. This study investigates the function of Streptomyces-Bacillus Inoculants (SBI) on carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) conversion, and microbial dynamics, during cow manure (10% and 20% addition) and corn straw co-composting. Compared to inoculant-free controls, inoculant application accelerated the compost's thermophilic stage (8 vs 15 days), and significantly increased compost total N contents (+47%) and N-reductase activities (nitrate reductase: +60%; nitrite reductase: +219%). Both bacterial and fungal community succession were significantly affected by DOC, urease, and NH4+-N, while the fungal community was also significantly affected by cellulase. The contribution rate of Cupriavidus to the physicochemical factors of compost was as high as 83.40%, but by contrast there were no significantly different contributions (similar to 60%) among the top 20 fungal genera. Application of SBI induced significant correlations between bacteria, compost C/N ratio, and catalase enzymes, indicative of compost maturation. We recommend SBI as a promising bio-composting additive to accelerate C and N turnover and high-quality biowaste maturation. SBI boosts organic cycling by transforming biowastes into bio-fertilizers efficiently. This highlights the potential for SBI application to improve plant growth and soil quality in multiple contexts.

AB  - Intestinal bacteria, synchronized with diet and feeding time, exhibit circadian rhythms and anticipate host gut function; however the effect of dietary probiotics on gut bacterial diurnal rhythms remains obscure. In this study, bacteria were sequenced at 6 Zeitgeber times (ZT) from a pig model of ileal T-shaped fistula to test ileal bacterial composition and circadian rhythms after Lactobacillus delbrueckii administration. The results showed that dietary L. delbrueckii enhanced ileal bacterial alpha-diversity at Zeitgeber time (ZT) 16, evidenced by an increased Simpson index compared with control pigs. At the phylum level, Firmicutes was identified as the largest phyla represented in pigs, but dietary L. delbrueckii only increased the abundance of Tenericutes at ZT16. At the genus level, 11/100 genera (i.e., Lactobacillus, Enterococcus, Leptotrichia, Pediococcus, Bifidobacte, Cellulosilyticum, Desulfomicrobium, Sharpea, Eubacterium, Propionivibrio, and Aerococcus) were markedly differentiated in L. delbrueckii-fed pigs and the effect was rhythmicity-dependent. Meanwhile, dietary L. delbrueckii affected six pathways of bacterial functions, such as membrane transport, metabolism of cofactors and vitamins, cell motility, the endocrine system, signaling molecules and interaction, and the nervous system. Cosinor analysis was conducted to test bacterial circadian rhythm in pigs, while no significant circadian rhythm in bacterial alpha-diversity and phyla composition was observed. Lactobacillus, Terrisporobacter, and Weissella exhibited significant rhythmic fluctuation in the control pigs, which was disturbed by probiotic exposure. In addition, dietary L. delbrueckii affected circadian rhythms in ileal Romboutsia, Erysipelatoclostridium, Cellulosilyticum, and Eubacterium abundances. Dietary L. delbrueckii affected both ileal bacterial composition and circadian rhythms, which might further regulate gut function and host metabolism in pigs.

AB  - This study evaluated the effect of sperm concentration of boar semen doses, for intrauterine artificial insemination (IUAI), on semen quality and established concentration limits for their production. Twenty ejaculates from four crossbred mature PIC (R) boars were collected to produce 50 mL semen doses in a split sample, reaching the following sperm concentrations: similar to 20, 30, 60, and 100 x 10(6) cells/mL. Doses were produced using Androstar((R)) Plus, stored at 17 degrees C, and evaluated until 120 h of storage. There was a linear decrease in sperm motility as the sperm concentration increased (p linear < .01). The concentration which no longer affected the total and progressive motility was 59 and 55 x 10(6) cells/mL, respectively (corresponding to 71% and 62%, respectively). The pH linearly decreased as the sperm concentration increased (p < .01); yet, at 72 and 120 h, the parameter dramatically reduced in boar semen doses with 60 and 100 x 10(6) cells/mL. The percentage of cells with intact plasma and acrosomal membranes or with high mitochondrial membrane potential was not influenced by the sperm concentration (p =.15). In conclusion, sperm motility was negatively affected in highly (60 and 100 x 10(6) cells/mL) concentrated doses. To achieve suitable sperm motility, boar semen doses may not surpass the sperm concentration of 55 x 10(6) cells/mL. The effect of low-concentrated boar semen doses on sperm quality still needs to be better evaluated, mainly considering the influence of extender type and thermo-resistance conditions.

AB  - Pollution is an integral part of global environmental change, yet the combined and interactive effects of pollution and climate on terrestrial ecosystems remain inadequately understood. This study aims to explore whether pollution alters the impacts of ambient air temperature on the population dynamics of herbivorous insects. Between 1995 and 2005, we studied populations of two closely related moths, Eriocrania semipurpurella and E. sangii , at eight sites located 1 to 64 km from a large copper-nickel smelter in Monchegorsk, Russia. We found that pollution and temperature influence the performance of Eriocrania larvae mining in the leaves of mountain birch, Betula pubescens var. pumila , through multiple pathways. This is evident from the unconsistent changes observed in larval and frass weight, mine area, and leaf size. We found increases in both leaf quality and larval weight with decreasing pollution levels at both spatial and temporal scales and attributed these to the impact of sulphur dioxide, rather than trace elements (nickel and copper). The quality of birch leaves increased with spring (May) temperatures, enabling Eriocrania larvae to achieve greater weight while consuming less biomass. During the larval growth period (early June to early July), Eriocrania larvae increased their consumption with rising temperatures, presumably to compensate for increased metabolic expenses. Contrary to our expectations, the per capita rate of population change did not correlate with larval weight and did not vary along the pollution gradient. Nevertheless, we detected interactive effects of pollution and climate on the rate of population change. This rate decreased with rising winter temperatures in slightly polluted and unpolluted sites but remained unchanged in heavily polluted sites. We conclude that pollution disrupts mechanisms regulating the natural population dynamics of Eriocrania moths.

AB  - Phenotype of plant offspring may be affected by particularly maternal environmental conditions, which is named as transgenerational plasticity. Transgenerational plasticity enhances the fitness of offspring under the maternal environmental conditions. Transgenerational plasticity may promote the successful invasion of alien plants, particularly those with clonal growth. However, few studies have compared transgenerational plasticity between alien invasive clonal plants and their congeneric native ones. A pot experiment with the invasive herb Wedelia trilobata and its congeneric native species Wedelia chinensis was conducted to investigate effects of light conditions (low vs. high light treatment) experienced by mother ramets on morphological and photosynthetic properties of offspring ramets subjected to the low light treatment. Compared with those of offspring ramets from mother ramets subjected to the high light treatment, leaf area, potential maximum net photosynthetic rate (P-max) and biomass accumulation of offspring ramets from mother ramets subjected to the low light treatment were significantly greater in W. trilobata than W. chinensis. Opposite pattern was observed in number of offspring ramets. We conclude that effects of transgenerational plasticity on growth performance could be species-specific between invasive plant and its congeneric native one. Positive effect of transgenerational plasticity on number of offspring ramets was not transformed into growth advantages of native species W. chinensis during its later establishment. However, favorable effects of transgenerational plasticity on capturing light resource could enhance competitive ability and promote successful invasion of W. trilobata.

AB  - Quantifying variation in individual resource acquisition and allocation to costly life-history functions is critical to understand the evolution of life-histories. Individuals should adaptively respond to changes in resource requirements throughout their lifetime through flexibility in resource acquisition behaviours. Empirical investigation of behavioural adjustments in wild settings are scarce and rarely consider more than one behaviour. Resource acquisition, however, involves several behaviours and should be considered in a multivariate framework. We measured four resources acquisition behaviours -bite rate, rumination rate, chews per bolus and bolus processing time in bighorn sheep, Ovis canadensis. We then tested whether individuals adjust these behaviours as expected based on individual differences in resource allocation to lactation and annual mass gain. Using a multivariate mixed effects model, we also evaluated the prediction that bite rate and rumination behaviours are repeatable and show strong covariation among individuals. Both bite rate and rumination effort increased with allocation to lactation. Allocation to mass gain, however, was positively correlated with rumination effort but not with bite rate. Rumination behaviours also showed significant variation with sex and mass, suggesting potential morphological and/or physiological constraints. Although all four behaviours were significantly repeatable, contrary to our predictions, bite rate was not significantly correlated with rumination behaviours among individuals. This study highlights strong correlations between expected resource allocation to costly life-history functions and multiple resource acquisition behaviours. There was, however, no evidence that variance in multiple resource acquisition behaviours originates from a single axis of variation among individuals.(c) 2021 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB  - In the context of the current energy crisis, pig sludge may be a more accessible fertilizer resource for different categories of farmers and agro-ecosystems, in order to support soil fertility and agricultural production. The present study presents results regarding the influence of pig sludge on soil quality and the spatial and temporal variability of a pasture agro-ecosystem, in the area of Ciacova locality, Timis County, Romania. The pig sludge was fermented for a period of 6 months in fermentation tanks and was applied at a rate of 80 m(3) ha(-1) y(-1) between 2013 and 2019, on two pasture plots (P808, P816). In the study period (2013-2019), the agrochemical indices studied presented the values: pH = 5.90 +/- 0.09 (P816-6-13) and pH = 6.90 +/- 0.06 (P808-7-18); P = 10.20 +/- 2.26 ppm (P808-4-13) and P = 69.10 +/- 3.04 ppm (P808-5-19); K = 176.00 +/- 7.44 ppm (P816-4-13) and K = 429.00 +/- 7.33 ppm (P816-3-19); NI = 2.45% +/- 0.08% (P816-6-13) and NI = 3.87% +/- 0.06% (P816-6-19). The variability of the land, i.e., the pasture category, evaluated based on the NDVI index (seven NDVI classes were generated, C1 to C7) decreased under the influence of pig sludge, the values of the variation coefficients being CVNDVI = 17.5098 in 2019 compared to CVNDVI = 41.5402 in 2013 for P808 and CVNDVI = 32.0685 in 2019, compared to CVNDVI = 52.2031 in 2013 for P816. It was found that the land area decreased (2019 compared to 2013) from classes C1 to C4 NDVI (low NDVI values, NDVI < 0.5) and the area increased within classes C6 and C7 NDVI (high NDVI values, NDVI > 0.5).

AB  - Background: Although drought and defoliation increase the risk of death of the seedlings in tropical dry forests, few studies have evaluated the impact of this combined factors on the response of species. Questions: What is the seedling water management strategy and how does it affect their growth? How does the combination of drought and defoliation impact the growth of the species? Studied species: Guazuma ulmifolia Lam and Pithecellobium dulce (Roxb.) Benth. Study sites and dates: The study was carried out in Autlan, Jalisco, Mexico, between October 2021 and February 2022. Methods: In a greenhouse, the seedlings were submitted to four combined water availability and defoliation treatments. The stomatal conductance and leaf water potential were recorded, and the relative growth rate, final biomass, and biomass allocation were calculated. Results: G. ulmifolia showed to be an anisohydric species, registered higher growth, and was the most affected by drought, while P. dulce was more isohydric, registered lower growth and defoliation was the main stressor. The synergy between Drought x Defoliation negatively impacted the two species' relative growth rate. Conclusions: Regardless of the water management strategy, in the early phases of development, the impact of drought and defoliation was magnified when stressors interacted. Therefore, Drought x Defoliation can limit the regeneration of species within forests, promoting the loss of biodiversity and detriment to the functioning of ecosystems.

AB  - Photosynthetic carbon plays a pivotal role in soil organic carbon (SOC) sequestration in agricultural soils. However, how organic amendments regulate photosynthetic carbon accumulation through multitrophic microbes at the aggregate scale, especially the core microbiota, remains unclear. Here, we conducted a(13)CO(2)-labeled rhizo-box experiment on a saline-sodic soil with five treatments: no fertilizer (Ctrl), chemical fertilizer, pig manure (PM), milk vetch straw (MV), and vermicompost. The C-13-SOC in the MV and PM treatments was 2.4 and 1.4 times greater than that in the Ctrl, respectively. Compared with the Ctrl, organic amendments significantly increased C-13-macroaggregate-associated OC (C-13-Macro-OC) by 122.4-615.8 % and C-13-mineral-associated OC (C-13-MAOC) by 123.6-564.5 % in macroaggregates (> 0.25 mm). The C-13-Macro-OC was significantly positively correlated with biodiversity, the relative abundances of bacteria (mainly Acidobacteriota and Firmicutes) and fungi (mainly Ascomycota and Mucoromycota) in the keystone microbial cluster, network complexity, and the proportion of negative cross-trophic associations. Structural equation modeling revealed that the root trait-induced core microbiota, following organic amendments, affected photosynthetic carbon accumulation via C-13-MAOC in macroaggregates. In summary, our findings highlight the positive effects of milk vetch straw on SOC accumulation and provide a theoretical basis for the targeted regulation of SOC accumulation in saline-sodic soils through organic amendments.

AB  - Successful anti-poaching policies and effective conservation of Asian elephants Elephas maximus require input and support from all stakeholders, including the public. But although Myanmar has one of the largest remaining populations of wild Asian elephants, there has been little research on public attitudes there towards elephants and poaching. We developed a questionnaire to assess attitudes of people in rural and urban areas towards elephants and conservation, and their perceptions of and experience with elephant poaching. We conducted 178 interviews across two regions in Myanmar. Although both rural and urban participants supported elephant conservation, people from urban areas expressed more favourable attitudes towards elephants than their rural counterparts. Similarly, conservation priorities differed between rural and urban communities, with rural communities less likely to believe that peaceful human-elephant coexistence was possible and preferring conservation initiatives that prioritize human activities over elephant conservation. Both groups were familiar with elephant poaching in Myanmar, but rural communities appeared to be better informed regarding the challenges faced by conservation agencies, and were more negatively affected by poaching. Our findings highlight potential areas for intervention by government and conservation agencies to reduce criminal activity and to protect both Myanmar's citizens and its elephants.

AB  - One fundamental question in biology is how animals control their proper body size. Hippo signaling pathway has emerged as an evolutionarily conserved network to regulate organ size from Drosophila to mammals. Interestingly, our previous study has also implied the roles of hippo signaling in Chinese tongue sole (Cynoglossus semilaevis), a flatfish exhibiting female-biased sexual size dimorphism (SSD). Specifically, two yes-associated protein 1 (yap1) homologs, key effectors within hippo signaling, exhibited the opposite expression pattern in the female and male gonads of C. semilaevis. Whether and how these two yap1 genes participate in female-biased SSD is unknown. In the present study, phylogenetic tree analysis firstly designated these two yap1 genes as yap1 and yap1b, with no taz gene available in C. semilaevis. Subsequent quantitative PCR analysis demonstrated that yap1 exhibited the highest expression levels within the male gonad at three-month-old, while the predominant expression of yap1b was detected in the female gonad at two-year-old. The co-localization of yap1 and yap1b was observed in the cytoplasm of oocyte and sperm. Cebp alpha, a negative regulator for dmrt1, exhibited positive and negative regulation on the yap1 and yap1b, respectively. Myog, a crucial transcription factor for myogenesis, specifically binded and activated yap1b promoter, not yap1. Furthermore, DAP-seq revealed the regulatory networks of yap1 and yap1b in C. semilaevis. Importantly, many growth and reproduction-related pathways, including the JAK-STAT signaling pathway, prolactin signaling pathway, axonal regeneration, and steroid hormone synthesis, were included in the common peaks of yap1 and yap1b. Moreover, the application of verteporfin reagents into testis and ovary cells resulted in a decrease in yap1 and yap1b levels. Consequently, the expression of growth hormone receptor (ghr), growth hormone actin alpha (smtla), estrogen receptor (esr2b), and 17 beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 7 (hsd17b7), were also affected. In addition, the administration of verteporfin on C. semilaevis caused a significant reduction in growth rate. These findings provided insights into the role of the hippo signaling pathway in regulating SSD of C. semilaevis.

AB  - The aim of the study was to determine the sex structure and reproduction rate of roe deer Capreolus capreolus and red deer Cervus elaphus in six forest districts in north-western Poland: Choszczno, Dobrzany, Karwin, Mi & eogon;dzych & oacute;d, Barlinek and K & lstrok;odawa. The forest districts represent three different types of landscape: Field - an agricultural landscape in the north, consisting of a mosaic of large agricultural areas and small forest complexes; ConFor - a compact forest complex in the south, dominated by poor pine sites; and DecFor - consisting of dense, fertile forests in the central part of the study area. The study used a cumulative method of direct observation conducted in the field over a period of 20 days. The direct observations of the animals were car- ried out from July 23 to August 11 with the participation of employees of the State Forests, local hunters and volunteers. About 60 observers per day were present in the field area, 80 in the ConFor and 70 in the DecFor. The observations took place at different times of the day, with participants recording the individuals encountered and determining their sex and age. Only juveniles born in the current year (2-3 months old during the study) and adults were recorded, yearlings were excluded. A total of 8,817 animals were recorded during the observations, including 6,014 roe deer and 2,803 red deer. The highest number of individuals was observed in the Field landscape (5,734), where open terrain facilitated observation, while significantly fewer animals were recorded in ConFor (1,429) and DecFor (1,654). No significant differences in sex structure and reproductive rate were observed between the three environmental types. The sex ratio averaged 1d: 1 ; however, in some cases the number of females exceeded the number of males. The reproductive rate was about 0.6 young per female. The sex structure of the local popula- tions varied from area to area - in the Field landscape, for example, the ratio of females to males was 1.34 for roe deer and 1.02 for red deer. The reproduction rate for roe deer ranged from 0.35 young per female in DecFor to 0.51 in Field. For red deer, the reproduction rate ranged from 0.54 in Field to 0.60 in ConFor, showing significant statistical differences. One of the effects of aggregating observations was to stabilize the results for sex structure and reproductive rate as the number of animals observed increased. In the Field landscape, results stabilized at +/- 5% after only a few days of observation, whereas this took longer in ConFor and DecFor due to the more difficult observation conditions in the forest. The method of aggregating results from direct observations can be useful as a research tool and for population management but requires further theoretical and practical research.

AB  - Haploidoceros mediterraneus is one of the recently described cervid taxa endemic to the Iberian Peninsula (three sites) and southern France (two sites). Compared to the other endemic cervids from Iberia that have emerged, as well, during the mid-Middle Pleistocene, its chronological and geographical range are more expanded, indicative of a relative adaptative success. However, very little is known about H. mediterraneus ecology. From site contexts and faunal associations, its habitat during the Middle and Late Pleistocene corresponded to open forest under a mildly-humid temperate Mediterranean or semi-continental climate. First, its diet was reconstructed using dental meso- and microwear and second, its relationships with other cervids over time was analysed using Multiple Component Analysis (MCA). Diet reconstruction indicates that it was mostly a browse-dominated mixed-feeder during the Middle Pleistocene. Such a relatively flexible diet has allowed it to coexist, often with some cervid taxa (Cervus and Capreolus) and exceptionally with others (Praedama/Megaloceros and Dama sp.) by resource partitioning. During the Late Pleistocene, H. mediterraneus shifted toward a more browse-specialized diet. At this period, co-occurrence analyses show that the presence of H. mediterraneus seems to exclude that of C. capreolus and D. dama. The evolution of H. mediterraneus dietary habits from the Middle to the Late Pleistocene may have led to direct competition with other browsing-specialist cervids, which may be one of the causes of its extinction.

AB  - When searching for food, great tits (Parus major) can use herbivore-induced plant volatiles (HIPVs) as an indicator of arthropod presence. Their ability to detect HIPVs was shown to be learned, and not innate, yet the flexibility and generalization of learning remain unclear. We studied if, and if so how, naive and trained great tits (Parus major) discriminate between herbivore-induced and noninduced saplings of Scotch elm (Ulmus glabra) and cattley guava (Psidium cattleyanum). We chemically analyzed the used plants and showed that their HIPVs differed significantly and overlapped only in a few compounds. Birds trained to discriminate between herbivore-induced and noninduced saplings preferred the herbivore-induced saplings of the plant species they were trained to. Naive birds did not show any preferences. Our results indicate that the attraction of great tits to herbivore-induced plants is not innate, rather it is a skill that can be acquired through learning, one tree species at a time. We demonstrate that the ability to learn to associate HIPVs with food reward is flexible, expressed to both tested plant species, even if the plant species has not coevolved with the bird species (i.e., guava). Our results imply that the birds are not capable of generalizing HIPVs among tree species but suggest that they either learn to detect individual compounds or associate whole bouquets with food rewards.

AB  - Coral reefs, some of the most important marine ecosystems, are mainly structured by interactions between corals and benthic algae. The outcome of these interactions varies depending on the types of corals and algae involved. However, human activities, associated mainly with eutrophication and overfishing of herbivorous organisms, strongly impact the outcome of algae-coral interactions by promoting progressive replacement of corals by algae. The present study aimed to firstly establish the first inventory of algae-coral interactions at the species level on the Bora Bora reefs, and then experimentally determine the role of herbivorous species (sea urchins and Trochus shells) in the regulation of these complex algae-coral interactions. Firstly, visual surveys showed that the outcome of algae-coral interactions varied significantly according to the length of the algae-coral interaction border, and among algae-coral couples. For example, unhealthy coral colonies with large interaction borders were associated with a higher percentage of negative interactions. Then, using experimental enclosures for 70 days, we showed that the sea urchin Tripneustes gratilla controlled the proliferation of algae and thus allowed a better growth of Acropora corals. Overall, the present study suggests that conservation programs should rely on grazer densities as a Nature-Based Solution to attenuate global shifts from coral- to algal-dominance.

AB  - Simple Summary This study aims to analyse variations in the morphology of the calcaneum among sheep and goats based upon two-dimensional geometric morphometrics (GM). According to our results, clear interspecific differences in the morphology of this bone were extracted. The use of GM methods has enabled us to assess small but significant amounts of geometric variation that are difficult to measure using traditional morphometric techniques, providing a new and useful perspective to the existing literature. The distinction between bones of sheep and bones of goats is a difficult issue in zooarchaeology. Several studies undertaken in the past to facilitate this task have relied upon both qualitative criteria and osteometry. Geometric morphometrics has proved to be a powerful tool to evaluate morphological differences in a rigorous and detailed manner. This study aims to analyse variations in the morphology of the calcaneum among sheep and goats based upon two-dimensional geometric morphometrics (GM). Twenty landmarks were selected on the surfaces of 79 calcanea (47 sheep and 32 goats) to calculate the principal components of shape variations among these specimens. Clear interspecific differences in the morphology of this bone were extracted. Most are located on the calcaneal tuber and neck, the sustentacular tali region, the articular surfaces of both the malleolus and the cubonavicular. Furthermore, the use of GM methods has enabled us to assess small but significant amounts of geometric variation that are difficult to measure using traditional morphometric techniques. They provide a new and useful perspective to what is already known in the published literature. Our results shed new light upon the possibility of the existence of qualitative features that may help to distinguish caprine breeds.

AB  - The Shortnose Guitarfish, Zapteryx brevirostris, is endemic to the Southwest Atlantic and its geographic range is commonly reported from Southeastern Brazil to Northern Argentina. However, range limits are imprecise or inconsistent in some cases. These inconsistencies were addressed in this study based on 1,363 specimens collected since 1865. These records were obtained from scientific collections, a systematic review of literature, and an on-board observation database. According to the data collected in this study, the known northernmost distributional limit of the species lies at the mouth of the Doce River, Northern Espirito Santo State, in Southeastern Brazil (19 degrees S). As for the other extreme of its range, the known southernmost distribution limit refers to the Falkland Islands (Malvinas) (53 degrees S). This represents more than 2,000 km of coastline geographic range extension - in comparison to the previous known southernmost range limit for this species. The geographical range of Z. brevirostris seems to follow biogeographic patterns operating at an ecosystem level in which biotic (especially in the north) and abiotic factors (especially in the south) play a role in imposing limits to its distribution range.

AB  - A total of 3,639 deer-vehicle collisions (DVCs) were reported on Missouri roadways in 2020, resulting in 348 injuries and 5 deaths. Of these accidents, 490 (13.5%) occurred along 1,200 miles of interstates. Although fewer in number, interstate crashes are more serious than others, often causing bodily injury and property damage. This descriptive study investigated DVCs on Missouri interstates using aerial photographs and street-side images on Google Maps to assess adjacent land use characteristics and determine the presence of corridors, if any, at each location. Of the DVC sites, 449 (91.6%) were near a natural corridor (n = 212, 47.2%), an artificial corridor (n = 139, 31.0%), or a combination of both (n = 98, 21.8%). Some examples of natural corridors included vegetation, water, and dry creeks. Artificial corridors consisted of secondary roads, fence rows, public utilities, and overpasses. The average distance from the DVC to the nearest corridor was 107.0 m. Analysis of variance revealed a significant difference between the types of corridors (p < 0.05), yet Duncan's multiple range test showed only one homogeneous subset. Most interstates bisected natural corridors, but over a third (38.8%) of them had trees on one side or the other, not both. The influence of half and artificial corridors is an important finding in this study, one that has not been reported in the literature. Results can be useful for transportation officials to warn motorists when the risk of DVCs is greatest on Missouri interstates.

AB  - The southern white rhinoceros (Ceratotherium simum simum) faces an uncertain future in the wild due to increased poaching pressure and habitat fragmentation, thus the management of reproductively successful populations is of critical importance. Successful reproductive outcomes in rhinoceros may be mediated by diet and gut microbial diversity; therefore, understanding gut microbial dynamics within and between captive and wild populations may help improve conservation efforts. Accordingly, gut microbiome preservation methods are needed that are practical for in situ field sampling of wild populations. We evaluated the efficacy of 3 different preservation methods over 2 timepoints for stabilizing microbial communities in feces from southern white rhinoceros (n = 10) at the North Carolina Zoo in Asheboro, North Carolina, USA, during July-September 2020 and January-March 2021. Samples were immediately frozen at -80 degrees C, stored in PERFORMAbiome (TM)center dot GUT (PB) tubes or stored in 95% ethanol at ambient temperatures (to simulate field conditions), and processed after 14 or 230 days post-collection. We quantitatively compared alpha and beta diversity across microbial communities and identified taxa that were enriched in each treatment group. Samples preserved in 95% ethanol consistently harbored lower Shannon diversity index (SHDI) and Simpson's diversity (SDI) values compared to Frozen and PB samples. This trend was apparent in both Ethanol day-14 samples (SHDI 4.94; SDI 0.98) versus Frozen day-14 (SHDI 5.19; W = 518, P < 0.001; SDI 0.99; W = 476, P < 0.001) and PB day-14 (SHDI 5.15; W = 430, P < 0.01; SDI 0.99; W = 1075, P = 1) samples, and in Ethanol day-230 samples (SHDI 4.48; SDI 0.97) versus Frozen day-230 (SHDI 5.18; W = 0, P < 0.05; SDI 0.99; W = 0, P = 0.032) and PB day-230 (SHDI 5.23; W = 0, P < 0.05; SDI 0.99; W = 0, P = 0.032) samples. Ethanol day 230 samples differed (P < 0.05) from all other treatments in both alpha and beta diversity indices. Notably, frozen and PB preservation methods maintained compositionally similar microbial communities across both time points. Our results indicate that PB tubes stored at ambient temperatures perform similarly to freezing at -80 degrees C, highlighting their utility for microbiome fieldwork applications. Identifying optimal and versatile microbiome preservation techniques will enable future studies of the gut microbiome in reproductively-successful wild populations, an effort central to conservation efforts in the southern white rhinoceros and other threatened species.

AB  - Merck's rhino (Stephanorhinus kirchbergensis (Jager 1839)), one of the extinct members of the Pleistocene megafauna, is scarce in Russia's geological record. According to the previous research paradigm, that large rhinoceros inhabited forest environments during interglacials, consumed mostly branch- and leaf-containing food, and went extinct across most of its range during the Middle Pleistocene, still persisting in southern Si-beria until the Late Pleistocene. No direct evidence of this species associated with Late Pleistocene deposits and based on 14C dating has hitherto been obtained in Russia. Our studies on the mandible of Merck's rhino from the South of western Siberia confirm that the species was present in the Altai region until the second half of the Late Pleistocene (MIS3), but much later than previously thought, until about 40000 years before present. Tooth enamel microwear shows that this rhino ate branches and leaves of various trees and shrubs. Merck's rhino from the Chondon River (North of the Indigirka-Kolyma Lowlands) inhabited open larch forests and grassland landscapes. Considering the habitats, this species had a chance to survive there at least until the beginning of the Late Pleistocene (MIS5e), that is, their time lasted longer than previously thought. A phylogenetic analysis of complete mitochondrial genomes of extinct and extant rhinoceroses confirms the taxonomic morphological identification of the Altai and Chondon rhinos.

AB  - This work presents an open source, dislocation density based crystal plasticity modeling framework,..CP. A Kocks-type thermally activated flow is used for accounting for the temperature and strain rate effects on the crystallographic shearing rate. Slip system-level mobile and immobile dislocation densities, as well slip system-level backstress, are used as internal state variables for representing the substructure evolution during plastic deformation. A fully implicit numerical integration scheme is presented for the time integration of the finite deformation plasticity model. The framework is implemented and integrated with the open source finite element solver, Multiphysics Object-Oriented Simulation Environment (MOOSE). Example applications of the model are demonstrated for predicting the anisotropic mechanical response of single and polycrystalline hcp magnesium, strain rate effects and cyclic deformation of polycrystalline fcc OFHC copper, and temperature and strain rate effects on the deformation of polycrystalline bcc tantalum. Simulations of realistic Voronoi-tessellated microstructures as well as Electron Back Scatter Diffraction (EBSD) microstructures are demonstrated to highlight the model's ability to predict large deformation and misorientation development during plastic deformation.

AB  - Micro- and nanoplastics (MNP) can be found virtually everywhere around us in the biosphere and food chain, therefore humans are continuously exposed to MNP, mainly via inhalation and ingestion. Here, we have applied physiologically relevant human-based advanced in vitro models representing the lung (MucilAir (TM)) and gut (InTESTine (TM) and Intestinal Explant Barrier Chip (IEBC)) to study membrane passage of various MNP and their potency to induce cytotoxic effects, barrier disturbances or pro-inflammatory cell activation. Selected MNP of various materials (polystyrene, polyethylene, nylon, car tire, and marine MNP collected from the ocean), shapes (spheres, fragments and fibers), sizes (0.05-100 mu m), some of which were fluorescently labelled for tracking, were included. Without affecting cell viability, nylon fibers and (cleaned) HDPE (high density polyethylene) disrupted the MucilAir (TM) epithelial barrier. Luminal exposure to polystyrene particles (1 and 10 mu m) and pristine HDPE fragments significantly decreased human colon tissue functionality. Furthermore, all polystyrene particles (0.05, 1 and 10 mu m) affected tissue viability in porcine jejunum, ileum and colon tissue after 5 h exposure, and this was further confirmed in the IEBC after 24 h of exposure to 10 mu m polystyrene particles and nylon fibers. Exposure to nylon fibers and its supernatant led to pro-inflammatory cell activation, as shown by increased IL-6 release in MucilAir (TM) and in human colon tissue after 96 or 24 h, respectively. Regarding transepithelial penetration of the MNP, permeability of 0.05 mu m polystyrene spheres in the MucilAir (TM) lung cell model reached 3.6 +/- 1.2% after 24 h. With 3.37 +/- 0.46% after 5 h under static conditions and 5.5 +/- 1.3% after 24 h under microfluidic conditions MNP permeability across intestinal tissue was highest for the largest (10 mu m) polystyrene spheres. Confocal microscopy confirmed the translocation of MNP across the lung and intestinal epithelial barrier. In conclusion, we present a study revealing the passage of MNP over the epithelium of advanced in vitro models for the lung and intestine barrier. Furthermore, pro-inflammatory cell activation and disrupted barrier integrity were observed after exposure to several of the tested MNP. Future research is needed to further identify the effects of shape, size and material on these processes and subsequently the health effects of humans.

AB  - The rapid expansion of organic rice cultivation areas have been accompanied by increased application of organic fertilizers. The high prevalence of soil antibiotic resistance caused by organic fertilizer application poses a severe threat to the agricultural and soil ecosystems. To date, research efforts and understanding of the effects and mechanism of action of the various organic fertilizers on antibiotic resistance in paddy soils remain poorly investigated. Tetracycline resistance genes (TRGs, including tetB, tetC, tetL, tetZ, tetM, tetO, tetT, and tetX), class 1 integron-integrase gene (intI1) and bacterial communities were characterized using quantitative-PCR and Illumina MiSeq sequencing, in paddy soils exposed to inorganic fertilizer (NPK), animal-derived organic fertilizer (AOF, composted swine and/or chicken manure), plant-derived organic fertilizer (POF, rapeseed cake and/or astragalus) and commercial organic fertilizer (COF, composted of animal manure mix with crop residues) applications. Compared with NPK, AOF applications significantly increased the relative abundance of TRGs, which was predominantly expressed in the increase of the relative abundance of tetC, tetM, tetO, tetT, and tetX, while POF and COF had no significant effect on the relative abundance of TRGs. Principal coordinate analysis revealed that AOF and POF significantly altered bacterial communities in paddy soils relative to NPK, while COF had no significant change of bacterial communities. Variation partitioning analysis indicated that soil physicochemical properties were the decisive factors for the changes of TRGs in organic paddy fields. Furthermore, redundancy analysis and the Mantel test showed that TRG profiles in AOF applied paddy soils were strongly influenced by electrical conductivity (EC). Total nitrogen (TN) and organic matter (OM) affected the distribution of TRGs in COF and POF applied paddy soils through a different mechanism. This study provides insights into the impacts of different types of organic fertilizer on the profiles of TRGs in paddy soils.

AB  - This study aimed to contribute to the knowledge about the reproductive physiology of wild lowland tapirs (Tapirus terrestris) by describing the serum testosterone concentrations, testicular biometry, and testicular tone of individuals living in the Pantanal and Cerrado biomes of Brazil, and to check for reproductive seasonality for the species, and to investigate correlations among these reproductive parameters and individual age and weight. Meteorological data (air temperature, wind speed, relative humidity, and global radiation) of the study sites were characterized through automated stations of the National Institute of Meteorology (INMET). From 2015-2020, field data were collected from 22 and 11 wild male lowland tapirs from the Pantanal and Cerrado biomes, respectively. After capture and chemical restraint, the age and weight of the animals were estimated. Blood samples were collected to determine serum testosterone concentrations using radioimmunoassay. Testicular biometry measurements included width, length, height, and volume, while testicular tone was assigned using scores from 3 (firm) to 1 (soft). Animal age, weight, and testosterone concentrations did not differ between the two biomes (P > 0.05). Positive correlations were found between age and weight (rho = 0.86; P < 0.001), and serum testosterone levels with both estimated age (rho = 0.45; P = 0.0047) and weight (rho = 0.51; P = 0.0011). Testicular volume was positively correlated with age (rho = 0.75; P < 0.0001), weight (rho = 0.65; P = 0.0011), and serum testosterone levels (rho = 0.42; P = 0.0081). In addition, testicular tone in adult subjects (>48 months) was significantly higher than in younger subjects (P < 0.05). Testicular consistency was positively correlated with weight (rho = 0.36; P = 0.0241) and serum testosterone levels (rho = 0.38; P = 0.0174). Seasonal effect on tapir reproduction was not identified, but testicular tone was influenced by wind speed (rho = 0.37; P = 0.0211) and air humidity (rho = 0.37; P = 0.0262). This study is the first scientific description of reproductive parameters of male lowland tapirs.

AB  - In Bangladesh, buffalo dairy farming is gaining traction for its cost-effectiveness and the nutritional benefits of buffalo milk. This study aims to examine how environmental factors like age, number of past calvings, season of calving, intervals between calvings, and dry periods influence milk yield and lactation patterns. Through monitoring 384 buffaloes from seven populations across different ecological zones, significant impacts of various factors on milk production and reproduction were observed. Findings indicate that such environmental considerations are crucial for enhancing buffalo dairy farming, suggesting that a focus on these aspects could substantially benefit genetic improvement programs. Household buffalo dairy farming is gaining popularity nowadays in Bangladesh because of the outstanding food value of buffalo milk as well as the lower production cost of buffalo compared to cattle. An initiative has recently been taken for the genetic improvement of indigenous dairy buffaloes. The present study was carried out to determine the influence of some environmental factors like age, parity, season of calving, calving interval, dry period on the lactation yield, and lactation curve of indigenous dairy buffaloes of Bangladesh. A total of 384 indigenous dairy buffaloes from the 3rd and 4th parity of seven herds under two different agroecological zones covering four seasons were selected and ear tagged for individual buffalo milk recording. A milk yield of 300 days (MY300d) was calculated following the International Committee for Animal Recording (ICAR) and the data were evaluated using the generalized linear model (GLM). In production traits, the mean of calculated lactation period (CLP), calculated lactation yield (CLY), and milk yield of 300 days (MY300d) of the overall population were 267.28 days, 749.36 kg, and 766.92 kg, respectively, whereas calving interval (CI) and dry period (DP) as reproductive traits were 453.06 days and 185.78 days, respectively. The season of calving, age of buffalo cows, population or herd, agroecological zone, calving interval, and dry period had significant effects on production traits (p < 0.05 to p < 0.001). The season of calving, level of milk production of 300 days, population, and agroecological zone significantly affected the reproduction traits (p < 0.01 to p < 0.001). Parity was found to be non-significant for both types of traits. The average peak yield of test day (TD) milk production was highest at TD4 (4.47 kg, 98th day of lactation). The average MY300d of milk production was the highest in the Lalpur buffalo population (1076.13 kg) and the lowest in the buffalo population of Bhola (592.44 kg). The correlations between milk production traits (CLP, CLY, and MY-300d) and reproduction traits (CI and DP) were highly significant (p < 0.01 to p < 0.001). Positive and high correlation was found within milk traits and reproduction traits, but correlation was negative between milk traits and reproduction traits. Therefore, these non-genetic factors should be considered in the future for any genetic improvement program for indigenous dairy buffaloes in Bangladesh.

AB  - It has been recommended that wildlife management should be tailored to either wildlife value orientations (WVOs) or social identities (SIs) because both can influence stakeholders' attitudes. However, a comparison of associations of WVOs and SIs with attitudes of stakeholders is lacking in the literature. We examined WVOs and attitudes toward red deer management among 834 individuals, encompassing foresters, hunting tenants, and conservationists (presumed to have strong SIs), as well as citizens, councilors, and forest owners (presumed to have weak SIs). Foresters' and hunting tenants' attitudes did not differ, despite the presence of different WVOs among each group, whereas conservationists' attitudes partly and citizens,' councilors' and forest owners' attitudes were strongly associated with different WVOs. Those with strong SIs should be addressed in terms of self-concepts and group processes. We recommend qualitative research on the SIs of stakeholders and quantitative research on the linkages of SIs and other social-psychological concepts.

AB  - Repeatable macroevolutionary patterns provide hope for rules in biology, especially when we can decipher the underlying mechanisms. Here we synthesize natural history, genetic adaptations, and toxin sequestration in herbivorous insects that specialize on plants with cardiac glycoside defenses. Work on the monarch butterfly provided a model for evolution of the "sequestering specialist syndrome," where specific amino acid substitutions in the insect's Na+/K+-ATPase are associated with (1) high toxin resistance (target site insensitivity [TSI]), (2) sequestration of toxins, and (3) aposematic coloration. We evaluate convergence for these traits within and between Lepidoptera, Coleoptera, Diptera, Hemiptera, Hymenoptera, and Orthoptera, encompassing hundreds of toxin-adapted species. Using new and existing data on similar to 28 origins of specialization, we show that the monarch model evolved independently in five taxonomic orders (but not Diptera). An additional syndrome occurs in five orders (all but Hymenoptera): aposematic sequesterers with modest to medium TSI. Indeed, all sequestering species were aposematic, and all but one had at least modest TSI. Additionally, several species were aposematic nonsequesterers (potential Batesian mimics), and this combination evolved in species with a range of TSI levels. Finally, we identified some biases among these strategies within taxonomic orders. Biodiversity in this microcosm of life evolved repeatedly with a high degree of similarity across six taxonomic orders, yet we identified alternative trait combinations as well as lineage-specific outcomes.

AB  - Triploid fish (3n = 150) exhibit enhanced disease resistance compared to their parents-red crucian carp (female, 2n = 100) and allotetraploid (male, 4n = 200). To elucidate the innate immunity of triploid hybrid, a comparative transcriptomic analysis was carried out to elucidate the molecular events during spring viraemia of carp virus (SVCV) infection in caudal fin cell from the red crucian carp, triploid hybrid and allotetraploid, denoted as G2n, G3n, and G4n, respectively. KEGG enrichment analysis indicated that SVCV may alter the host cell's metabolic profiles post-infection, and the ECM-mediated adhesion plaque signaling pathway may facilitate the virus's recognition and infection processes. Distinct signaling regulation mechanisms in response to SVCV infection were observed across different ploidy levels. In G2n, immune-related pathways such as the TNF signaling pathway and Toll-like receptor signaling pathway were activated. The downregulation of immune related gene, such as MHC I, may indicate viral strategies to evade detection by the immune system through inhibited antigen presentation in diploid fish. Apoptosis-related processes including the Apoptosis, Phagosome, Rap1 signaling pathway, and Hippo signaling pathway were significantly enriched in G4n, indicating SVCV hijack the host autophagy and apoptosis to improve their replication and spreading. The outcomes of the comparative analysis demonstrate that, in G3n, robust protective barriers against SVCV invasion were established through the downregulation of MMP9, mTOR, p53, and NCAM, alongside the upregulation of MHC I, CLDN, and CAV 1-mediated interactions. This coordinated multi-gene response might be a key factor contributing to the enhanced resistance of triploid fish. The findings underscore the distinct signal regulation of different ploidy cyprinid fish in response to SVCV infection, providing valuable reference data for the prevention and treatment of SVCV.

AB  - Context Recent advancements in firearm technology have enabled hunters to take increasingly longer shots at animals (i.e. >= 300 m). The performance of copper bullets at these distances remains largely anecdotal, despite growing use to reduce lead exposure in scavengers and game meat.Aims We evaluated whether copper bullets perform effectively during long-range hunting and identified possible factors influencing bullet performance and animal recovery.Methods At MPG Ranch in western Montana, USA, we collected field data from hunters required to use lead-free ammunition. We recorded shot distance, shot placement, copper bullet selection, estimated impact energy, and recovery status of elk (Cervus canadensis). We also measured bullet expansion and weight retention for recovered bullets.Key results The average shot distance for recovered elk (n = 111) was 305 m, whereas that for unrecovered elk (n = 13) averaged 391 m (t = 3.37, P = 0.002). Proportional odds logistic regression showed that the number of shots impacting elk was predicted by flight distance and whether the bullet was designed to fragment; however, flight distance was not predicted by impact energy or bullet design. Recovered bullets retained 97.2% of their mass (n = 7), and their expansion ratios, calculated as the expanded frontal area divided by the original, ranged from 3.1 to 4.1.Conclusions Copper bullets can be effective at long range when used by skilled shooters, with recovery rates being similar to or exceeding those reported in prior studies where ammunition type was likely a mix of lead and lead-free projectiles.Implications Our findings support the suitability of copper bullets for long-range hunting and suggest that hunter skill and shot distance, rather than bullet material alone, are key factors in animal recovery.

AB  - Corals throughout the Caribbean have experienced major declines since the 1970s. In response, many agencies have focused their conservation and restoration efforts on outplanting nursery-grown coral fragments onto degraded reefs. Predation on newly outplanted corals can be an important but often unmonitored factor contributing to the declining health and survival of these fragments. In this study, we outplanted 360 boulder coral fragments (Montastraea cavernosa, Orbicella faveolata, Pseudodiploria clivosa), sourced from both ex situ and in situ nurseries, at three locations in the Florida Keys. Each location included one inshore and one offshore site. Ten fragments of each species and source were outplanted at each site (60 corals per site). Transplants were monitored for finfish predation, live tissue area, and survival at 1, 2, 6, and 12 wks post-outplanting. We found the highest finfish predation for all species during the 1 wk monitoring period. Predation during this first week varied by location and reef type, with two locations showing higher predation on offshore sites and one location experiencing increased predation on the inshore site. We also found that coral fragments produced in the ex situ nursery experienced higher initial predation compared to fragments produced in the in situ nursery. However, overall coral survival at 12 wks post-outplanting was 96%, suggesting there was no effect of initial predation on survival. Our results indicate that coral restoration efforts may be affected by intense, initial predation on newly-outplanted boulder coral colonies, but this initial predation may not lead to an increase in mortality.

AB  - Water scarcity is a significant global problem. Considerable water resources are consumed in the production of livestock and poultry products, thus posing a huge challenge to global freshwater resources. Sheep meat has the second highest water footprint among livestock meat products. Furthermore, as the demand for sheep meat increases on a year by year basis, water consumption continues to rise as a result. In order to make better informed decisions around water management, it is necessary to estimate the water footprint of animal husbandry. This study offers a comprehensive overview of the water footprint of sheep in Northern China. It analyzes the water footprint of feed production and virtual water using CROPWAT, based on the water footprint of sheep and goats in Shanxi under different production systems and feed components. The water footprint was calculated to be 6.03 m(3)/kg for sheep and 5.05 m(3)/kg for goats, respectively. Therefore, the water footprint of three farming modes, including grazing mixed and industrial in the Shanxi region was slightly higher than what other experts have evaluated for China. These data provide crucial information that can help reduce water resource consumption in animal husbandry and contribute to the development of sustainable strategies.

AB  - Ant-plant mutualism is widespread and highly diverse in the Neotropics. Several species of arboreal ants can utilize plants as nesting site by colonizing domatia or preformed cavities in tree trunks, branches, and stems that have been perforated by wood-boring insects. Arboreal cavity-dwelling ants are a common occurrence, and its effects are well documented, the most studied of which is protection against phytophagous insects. Despite the diversity of cavities in which ants can nest, there are only four published records of colonies inside fruits still attached to trees. Here, we report the occurrence of ant colonies inside mature fruits of Stryphnodendron adstringens, which to our knowledge comprises the first formal record of fruit nests at the Brazilian Cerrado, a Neotropical savanna. We encountered five fruits colonized by Camponotus sp. and one by Nesomyrmex spininodis. Most fruits housed both adult workers and immature ants, except for one fruit that was occupied solely by workers and was attached to the same tree as another that contained larvae. That, and the fact that we did not find any queen, suggest these are polydomous nests. We discuss the possible implications of this association and the knowledge gaps regarding this scarcely studied interaction.

AB  - The Burdwood Bank (BB) is a subantarctic area, where two of the three Marine Protected Areas (MPA) of the Argentinean Exclusive Economic Zone are located: Namuncura I, and Namuncura II. The area is characterized by a high biodiversity of benthic invertebrates and teleost fishes; however, the available information on oviparous chondrichthyans is scarce. The aim of this study is to explore the potential reproductive use that oviparous chondrichthyans could make of the area based on the presence of egg-laying grounds. Additionally, we aim to provide an updated checklist of the species that inhabit the BB. Samples of specimens and egg capsules collected in four research cruises carried out between 2016 and 2018 were analyzed. Six skate species were found in both MPAs: Amblyraja doellojuradoi, Bathyraja albomaculata, B. brachyurops, B. macloviana,B. scaphiops, and Psammobatis rudis; whereas B. cousseauae, and B. magellanica were found exclusively in Namuncura I, and B. multispinis in Namuncura II. Here we report, for the first time, the presence of egg-laying grounds for five chondrichthyan species in the BB area: A. doellojuradoi, B. brachyurops, B. macloviana, B. scaphiops, and P. rudis. The results obtained highlighted the importance of the region for the conservation of oviparous chondrichthyans found in the southern Patagonian shelf.

AB  - The recovery of large carnivores in Europe raises issues related to sharing landscape with humans. Beyond technical solutions, it is widely recognized that social factors also contribute to shaping coexistence. In this context, scholars increasingly stress the need to adopt place-based approaches by analysing how humans and wildlife interact and co-adapt in specific landscapes. In the burgeoning field of 'more-than-human' geography, both humans and non-humans are considered as co-constitutive of places. According to this tradition, animals should not simply be seen as objects under human control but approached as powerful actors in multi-species landscapes. By tracking how brown bear recovery in the French Pyrenees has shaped different places of encounters with pastoralists (i.e. farmers and shepherds in extensive sheep farming in mountain pastures during summer), this paper discusses what coexistence means when viewed through the lens of more-than-human geography. We use an in-depth, retrospective and multi-sources approach to describe the inter-relationships of bears and pastoralists on three mountain pastures since the return of bears at the end of the 1990s. Semi structured interviews, participant observation, administrative and institutional data about bear depredation and genetics, as well as pastoral practices form the basis of an integrated narrative analysis. Our study reveals how the return of a large carnivore has produced three different, singular, context-specific coexistence 'patches'. Each of these three pastures represent a distinct landscape dynamically shaped over time by bears, pastoralists and the rest of biotic and abiotic environment. Specifically, we demonstrate how various factors-the individual behaviour of bears, their movement and reproduction capacity, the number of depredations, the pastoralists' histories, their collective organization, the choices they made, the pastures' features, the available resources and surrounding vegetation-cumulatively intertwine in complex, place-specific entanglements. Policy implications. Our results suggest that coexistence should not be conceptualized as global, top down and standardized. Instead it is shaped by patches in which humans and non-humans interact in specific ways. Therefore, fostering coexistence means acknowledging the full diversity of situations in which people and wildlife write their own place-based, more-than-human histories.Read the free Plain Language Summary for this article on the Journal blog.
   Le retour des grands carnivores en Europe soulè ve des questions lié es au partage des paysages avec les humains. Au-delà des solutions techniques, il est. largement reconnu que les facteurs sociaux contribuent é galement à faç onner la coexistence. Dans ce contexte, les chercheurs insistent de plus en plus sur la né cessité d'adopter des approches locales en analysant comment les humains et la faune interagissent et s'adaptent mutuellement dans des paysages spé cifiques. Dans le domaine é mergent de la gé ographie << plus-qu'humaine >>, les humains et les non-humains sont considé ré s comme co-constitutifs des espaces. Selon cette approche, les animaux ne devraient pas ê tre simplement vus comme des objets sous contrô le des humains, mais plutô t considé ré s comme des acteurs moteurs dans des paysages multi-spé cifiques. En suivant comment le retour de l'Ours brun dans les Pyré né es franç aises a faç onné diffé rents lieux de rencontre avec les transhumants (c'est-à-dire les é leveurs et bergers pratiquant l'é levage extensif de brebis en pâ turages de montagne en é té), cet article examine ce que signifie la coexistence à travers le prisme de la gé ographie plus-qu'humaine. Nous utilisons une approche approfondie, ré trospective et multi-sources pour dé crire les interrelations entre les ours et les transhumants sur trois pâ turages de montagne, appelé s estives, depuis le retour des ours à la fin des anné es 1990. Des entretiens semi-directifs, des temps d'observation participante, des donné es administratives et institutionnelles sur les pré dations et identifications gé né tiques des ours, ainsi que les pratiques pastorales, constituent la base d'une analyse narrative inté gré e.

Chacune de ces trois estives repré sente un paysage distinct, faç onné dynamiquement au fil du temps par les ours, les transhumants et le reste de l'environnement biotique et abiotique. Plus pré cisé ment, nous dé montrons comment divers facteurs - le comportement individuel des ours, leurs mouvements et leur capacité de reproduction, le nombre de pré dations, l'histoire des transhumants, leur organization collective, les choix qu'ils ont faits, les caracté ristiques des estives, les ressources disponibles et la vé gé tation environnante - s'entrelacent cumulativement dans des enchevê trements complexes et spé cifiques à chaque espace.

AB  - The relative roles of different microevolutionary forces, like natural selection and demographic processes, in affecting genetic variation are of great scientific interest. In this study, we investigated recent divergence of the sibling bat species Rhinolophus episcopus and R. siamensis, which share a partially sympatric distribution and have different phenotypic characteristics among populations. We combined neutral [microsatellite (SSR)] and adaptive [major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II-DRB locus] markers to investigate the evolution of adaptive markers and disentangle the relative effects of neutral and adaptive microevolutionary forces on this MHC gene region. Our results revealed a stronger level of genetic differentiation in SSRs than in MHC genes of both species, which indicates effects of balancing selection on the geographical variation of MHC genes. However, we detected significant correlations in genetic differentiation between MHC and SSRs in R. episcopus, indicating that demographic processes have influenced the level of MHC genetic diversity in this species. In addition, significant moderate genetic differentiation was detected in sympatric populations and no alleles were shared between the two species. Therefore, we speculate that these sibling species have been subject to independent adaptive evolutionary processes.

AB  - Although their ecology has been well studied across their range, spotted hyaena (Crocuta crocuta) diets, espe-cially within Namibia, are understudied when compared to other large African carnivores in southern Africa. Large carnivores outside of protected areas often faces persecution by farmers as they are often perceived as being livestock killers and spotted hyaenas on arid farmlands in Namibia does not escape this prejudice. Here we investigated the scat composition of spotted hyaenas outside of protected areas on farmlands in south-western parts of Namibia. A total of 53 scat samples were collected from which 203 hair samples were used for identi-fication purposes. Our results indicate that 69.46% of hairs in scat were of wildlife species whilst 30.54% of hairs were from domesticated species. The asymptote reached also suggested that 53 scat samples were sufficient to describe the spotted hyaeans's diet in this particular area. We suspect that an outbreak of rabies in the study area as well as anthropogenic food sources could have influenced prey consumption. As the majority of prey consumed were of wildlife species (such as kudu Tragelaphus strepsiceros and Hartmann's Mountain zebra Equus zebra hartmannae) it is suggested that should the natural prey base be maintained livestock predation could be mitigated. We recommend that future researchers investigate the diet composition of the only other apex predator in this study area, leopards (Panther pardus) which could describe the prey selection and dietary overlap between these two large carnivores.

AB  - Microplastics (MPs) are frequently detected in the gastrointestinal tracts of aquatic organisms worldwide. We studied the contamination with plastic in an aquatic environment and in the gastrointestinal tracts of fish in two Amazonian rivers waters, Rio Negro and Rio Solim & otilde;es. The research was conducted in November/December 2023 during the low water season in a year of drastically decreased water level. We evaluated the abundance, shape, type, size as well as polymer type of the MPs and compared the contamination between fish species and feeding types. The amounts of MPs in the water were 0.25 +/- 0.05 and 0.78 +/- 0.19 pcs/L in the Prato canal and Vila do Janauac & aacute;, respectively. In total, 128 fish individuals belonging to different feeding types (piscivorous, planktivorous, herbivorous, invertivorous, detritivorous, omnivorous) were analysed in this study, with 84.0% and 87.4% of fish containing MPs caught from the Prato canal and Vila do Janauac & aacute;, respectively. We found no statistical relationship between the length/weight of the fish and the amount of MPs or the sizes of the plastic parts. MPs with dimensions of 0.04-5.0 mm were found in the digestive tracts of fish. There was an average of 3.3 +/- 2.9 and 2.8 +/- 2.1 plastic particles per fish in the study sites of the Prato canal and Vila do Janauac & aacute;, respectively. There was a statistical difference in the size of the MPs between the river sites that was correspondingly reflected in fish. In the digestive tracts of Solim & otilde;es fish, plastics were on average larger than in the Rio Negro study site. At the Vila do Janauac & aacute; study site, predatory fish had the most MPs in their digestive system, while in the Prato canal, plankton-eating fish had the most MPs. Regarding the shape of MPs ingested by fishes, most were filaments, followed by fragments. The majority of the fibres were determined to be polyamide (nylon), polyethylene terephthalate and polypropylene. Our results indicate that even the remote aquatic environments may be impacted with intensive MP infestation. At the same time, with higher rainfall and higher water levels, a higher concentration of MPs is expected and this, in turn, can lead to greater contamination of fish with MPs. It has been observed that when water has a higher plastic content, more MPs end up in fish, especially in visual foragers.

AB  - Carbon is the crucial source of energy during aerobic composting. There are few studies that explore carbon preservation by inoculation with microbial agents during goat manure composting. Hence, this study inoculated three proportions of microbial agents to investigate the preservation of carbon during goat manure composting. The microbial inoculums were composed of Bacillus subtilis, Bacillus licheniformis, Trichoderma viride, Aspergillus niger, and yeast, and the proportions were B1 treatment (1:1:1:1:2), B2 treatment (2:2:1:1:2), and B3 treatment (3:3:1:1:2). The results showed that the contents of total organic carbon were enriched by 12.21%, 4.87%, and 1.90% in B1 treatment, B2 treatment, and B3 treatment, respectively. The total organic carbon contents of B1 treatment, B2 treatment, and B3 treatment were 402.00 +/- 2.65, 366.33 +/- 1.53, and 378.33 +/- 2.08 g/kg, respectively. B1 treatment significantly increased the content of total organic carbon compared with the other two treatments (p < 0.05). Moreover, the ratio of 1:1:1:1:2 significantly reduced the moisture content, pH value, EC value, hemicellulose, and lignin contents (p < 0.05), and significantly increased the GI value and the content of humic acid carbon (p < 0.05). Consequently, the preservation of carbon might be a result not only of the enrichment of the humic acid carbon and the decomposition of hemicellulose and lignin, but also the increased OTU amount and Lactobacillus abundance. This result provided a ratio of microbial agents to preserve the carbon during goat manure aerobic composting.

AB  - Simple Summary This paper reported genetic parameters of four Senegalese sheep breeds, in relation to inbreeding, diversity and genetic proximity. The results provide informations on genetic conservation and adaptability of the breeds in the Senegalese context. In Senegal, sheep breeds have adapted to their environment and play a key socio-economic role. This study aimed to explore the genetic diversity and structure of four Senegalese sheep breeds (Peul-peul, Djallonke, Touabire, and Ladoum) and their relationships with global sheep breeds. To that end, forty-seven sheep were genotyped using the OvineSNP50 BeadChip, and these genotypic data were analysed with those of 73 sheep breeds representative of worldwide ovine diversity (2729 animals). The average observed heterozygosity (Ho) ranged from 0.293 in Djallonke sheep to 0.339 in Touabire sheep. The estimated Fis values were low, ranging from 0.019 for Ladoum to 0.034 for Peul-peul sheep. The estimated Fst values were low (0.003-0.044) among the trypanosusceptible breeds (Peul-peul, Touabire, and Ladoum) but high between the previous breeds and the trypanotolerant Djallonke breed (0.075-0.116), indicating better genetic conservation of the Djallonke sheep. A principal component analysis revealed clustering of the Senegalese sheep breeds according to their geographic distribution. However, owing to genetic improvement practices, the introgression of Touabire sheep blood seems to have reshaped the genetic landscape of the trypanosusceptible sheep breeds in Senegal. The Senegalese sheep breeds showed lower genetic diversity than their presumed ancestral sheep breeds of the Middle East. They also presented some relatedness with Caribbean sheep breeds, which reveals their contribution to the global genetic diversity and to the development of Caribbean sheep breeds.

AB  - More than 18% of the cases of invasive mammals worldwide correspond to South America, including small rodents and large species such as deer and hippos. Among exotic mammals in Colombia, we can mention pigs (Sus scrofa), which are well established, mainly in the Orinoquia region of the country, and more recently, hippos (Hippopotamus amphibius) with a growing area of occurrence in the middle and lower basin of the Magdalena River in the inter-Andean zone. In May 2022, a spotted exotic deer was documented in the area based on direct and indirect observations (photographs and videos) of living individuals and a partial skeleton. The spotted pattern of the photographed adults (absent in native or other exotic deer) and the juvenile individuals and the shape of the antlers show that they are chitals (Axis axis), a species native to Asia. Compared with the white-tailed deer Odocoileus, the largest native deer species in Colombia, the Axis skeleton was one-third bigger, which corroborated the identification. According to local inhabitants' communications, the number of Axis has increased, and groups of up to 18 individuals have been recorded. This is the first time that exotic deer have been documented in Colombia. Their presence may impact natural regeneration and competitively displace other native herbivores, which calls for the mitigation and control of the population since its establishment and dispersal can be cryptic.

AB  - Two economic activities have been integrated in southern Brazil: olive cultivation and sheep farming. The favorable edaphoclimatic conditions in the southern region for cultivating olive trees and cultural preferences for the consumption of sheep meat make this integration a valuable strategy. Considering that every activity causes environmental impact and the exploitation of natural resources, new systems that promote sustainable development and the efficient use of these resources become necessary. This paper presents the first study of the carbon footprint of the life cycle of integrating of sheep and olive farming, with the objective to build an inventory based on primary data collected on olive and sheep farms in Brazil, determine the carbon footprint of the conventional and integrated system and estimate the potential for mitigating GHG emissions. The evaluation was performed using the life cycle assessment (LCA) methodology. The study focuses on the detailed analysis of the processes and activities that are responsible for GHG emissions, including enteric methane emissions, methane emissions from manure management, emissions from nitrogen fertilizer use and limestone application and energy consumption. For this, two major scenarios were considered, the first centered around on the traditional olive cultivation and sheep farming systems individually, and the second involved their synergistic integration. The findings indicate that the conventional system is associated with a global warming impact of 6.8 kg CO 2 eq per liter olive oil and kg live weight. In contrast, the integrated system demonstrates a significant mitigation potential of 27.7%, resulting in a reduced global warming impact of 4.92 kg CO 2 eq. This advantage is a consequence of the synergy between the systems, as they now occupy the same area, which allows the sharing of agricultural activities and agrochemical inputs, in addition to optimizing nutrient recycling and complementing each other. Additionally, the results of a sensitivity analysis showed that enteric methane from sheep and the application of limestone to the soil are the most influential parameters on the carbon footprint, indicating that they are key parameters for the development of GHG mitigation strategies, some of which were discussed in the article.

AB  - Herbivores select host plants depending on plant quality and the presence of predators and competitors. Competing herbivores change host plant quantity through consumption, but they can also change plant quality through induction of plant defences, and this affects the performance of herbivores that arrive later on the plant. Some herbivores, such as the spider mite Tetranychus evansi, do not induce, but suppress plant defences, and later-arriving herbivores can profit from this suppression. It has been suggested that the dense web produced by this spider mite serves to prevent other herbivores to settle on the plant and benefit from the suppressed defences. Here, we confirmed this by studying the preference and performance of the whitefly Bemisia tabaci, a generalist herbivorous pest. To disentangle the effects through changes in plant defences from the effects of spider-mite web, we included treatments with a strain of the closely-related web-producing spider mite T. urticae, which induces plant defences. Whiteflies did perform worse on plants with defences induced by T. urticae, but, in contrast to other herbivores, did not perform better on plants with defences suppressed by T. evansi. Moreover, the web of both spider mites reduced the juvenile survival of whiteflies, and whiteflies avoided plants that were covered with web. Hence, whitefly performance was not only affected by plant quality and induced plant defences, but also through the web produced by spider mites, which thus serves to protect against potential competitors, especially when these could profit from the suppression of plant defences by the mites.

AB  - This study aimed to assess the association between fertility and the number of fetuses of free-ranging concentrate-supplemented white-tailed deer ((Odocoileus virginianus, texanus, Mearns 1898) from northern Mexico (27 degrees N) with body measurements and serum metabolites indicative of nutritional status. We studied 119 female deer (31 yearlings and 88 adults) captured in January 2021 using a net gun fired from a helicopter. Ultrasound scanning showed 100 and 97.8 % pregnancy rate and 1.52 +/- 0.51 and 1.50 +/- 0.59 fetuses/pregnant doe for yearlings and adult does, respectively, with no difference (p > 0.05) between age classes Thoracic circumference (cm) was higher (85.9 +/- 4.9 vs. 84.1 +/- 4.2; p = 0.039) for does carrying twins vs. singles. None of the serum metabolites indicative of nutritional status affected the fetal number of pregnant does. It was concluded that free-ranging white-tailed deer receiving concentrate supplementation in winter on a semi-arid rangeland has a high reproductive potential. Also, these results indicate that variation in maternal age within this population was not a significant driver of reproductive metrics of white-tailed deer. The plane of nutrition used in the present study was reflected in adequate serum metabolites indicative of nutritional status. Also, thoracic circumference may have prognostic value as a physical marker of multiple fetuses in female white-tailed deer.

AB  - Phytopathogens modify chemical communication between host plants and herbivorous vectors of those pathogens. These chemical cues often attract vectors to sources of inoculum and facilitate the further spread of the pathogens. Recent investigations have demonstrated that secondary consumers also respond to the same pathogen-induced cues that affect the behavior of vectors. Therefore, efforts to manipulate the behavior of natural enemies to improve biological control may yield unpredictable outcomes since coincident volatiles are induced by herbivory and pathogen attacks. We suggest that case-specific analyses of the costs and benefits of these multitrophic interactions are required to translate biological findings into integrated pest management practices.

AB  - Greenfall leaves caused by hailstorms may represent a resource pulse of nutrients. We determined the contribution of greenfall versus senescent leaves to total litterfall production, carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus input to the system, and leaf decomposition rate. Litterfall was collected monthly for three years in two cloud forests (F1, F2) and a restoration planting area (R) in Veracruz, Mexico. Two fortuitous hailstorms occurred in the second year. Leaf decomposition rate was determined in all three sites but did not differ across them. Total annual litterfall, excluding greenfall, was 10.0, 10.1, and 7.7 Mg ha(-1) y(-1) for F1, F2, and R, respectively. Senescent leaves represented 65% of the litterfall, while greenfall leaves increased the annual leaf biomass component of the litterfall by 12%. Concentrations of carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus were 2.3, 5.7, and 18.1% higher, respectively, in greenfall than in senescent leaves. Greenfall increased the annual input of C, N, and P by 12, 13, and 14%, respectively. Despite their short duration (approximately 70 minutes), the hailstorm events generated a substantial contribution of greenfall leaves and a source of extra C, N, and P, since these leaves decompose and are incorporated into the cloud forest system.

AB  - The use of animal-borne devices (= biologgers) has revolutionized the study of marine megafauna, yet there remains a paucity of data concerning the behavioral and physiological impacts of biologger attachment and retention. Here, we used animal-borne cameras to characterize the behavior and dive duration of juvenile green turtles (Chelonia mydas) in The Bahamas for up to 210 min after biologger deployment (n = 58). For a "control," we used unoccupied aerial vehicles (UAVs) to collect comparable data from nonhandled green turtles (n = 25) in the same habitats. Animal-borne footage revealed that immediately after release turtles spent 70%-80% of their time swimming with a mean dive duration of 45.3 +/- 34.3 s (SD). Over time, the percentage of time spent swimming decreased alongside an increase in dive duration until reaching a plateau around 90 min. However, the "control" UAV data for time spent swimming and dive durations were more comparable to the behaviors observed immediately after biologger deployment than during the plateau. We observed no significant differences in dive durations based on body size, and differences in behaviors based on body size were also minimal. We conclude that the effects of handling stress and biologger attachment on the behavior and dive duration of juvenile green turtles are evident up to 90 min postdeployment. After that, it is possible that either: (1) the effects of biologger deployment and retention are negligible, but UAVs may produce biased data that overestimates the proportion of time turtles typically spend swimming or (2) longer durations (> 210 min) are necessary for turtle behaviors to return to nonhandled levels and UAVs accurately represent the proportion of time turtles typically spend swimming. Answering this question, alongside further research into the physiological and behavioral implications of handling stress and biologger attachment, is essential to improve ethical biologging guidelines for sea turtles.

Studies on diet selection by bare-nosed wombats (Vombatus ursinus) are limited and are either observational or based on microhistological studies. The current study determined the diet of wombats through DNA metabarcoding across five study sites in New South Wales over a one-year period. Metabarcoding was chosen as it is non-invasive, less time consuming and more specific than traditional techniques. The list of 209 plant species identified as eaten by wombats in this study is much higher than previously reported, with grasses being the most common plant group identified in all samples. Most dietary items identified were introduced plant species. Seasonal differences in plants eaten occurred at four of the five study sites and may reflect dietary abundance and floristic composition at different times of year. Further studies are required to determine if the dietary items differ markedly across the entire range of wombats, and if nutrition influences dietary preferences.

AB  - Elevated carbon dioxide (eCO(2)) and rising temperatures will have far-reaching effects on global plant-insect interactions, yet their implications for future biological control programs are not fully understood. Studies have shown that elevated CO2 will affect insect feeding guilds differently and these responses can be predicted with some confidence. Water hyacinth, Pontederia crassipes Mart. (Pontederiaceae), is a native and representative species of the Del Plata wetlands (Argentina) that invades outside of its native environment. It is considered one of the world's worst aquatic weeds and a target for biological control. In this study, water hyacinth plants were grown under two CO2 concentrations - current (400 p.p.m.) or elevated (800 p.p.m.) -, with and without two biocontrol agents representing different feeding guilds, the leaf-chewing Cornops aquaticum Bruner (Orthoptera: Acrididae) and the phloem-feeding Megamelus scutellaris Berg (Hemiptera: Delphacidae). Under eCO(2) concentration, photosynthetic rate, total dry weight, and relative growth rate of P. crassipes acclimated to eCO(2) conditions and plants showed very little CO2 fertilization response in eutrophic water. Insect herbivory varied depending on feeding guilds at eCO(2); however, P. crassipes growth responses increased when exposed to insect herbivory. Chewing herbivory by C. aquaticum was consistent across CO2 conditions, whereas the feeding by M. scutellaris increased substantially at eCO(2). These results indicate that successful biological control of P. crassipes under conditions of elevated CO2 might rely on phloem-feeding insects, with chewers playing a lesser role.

AB  - Olfaction is directly involved in the insect capacity to exploit new habitats by guiding foraging behaviors. We searched in the literature whether some traits of olfactory systems and behaviors are associated with invasiveness and the impact of anthropogenic activities thereof. Human activities dramatically modify habitats and alter insect odorscapes. Air pollution, for instance, decreases lifetime and active range of semiochemicals. Plasticity and behavioral adaptability of invasive species are decisive by allowing host shifts and adaptative responses to new habitats. Changes in biophysical environments also impact on the use of semiochemicals in biocontrol. Although no evidence for a unique ensemble of olfactory traits associated with invasiveness was found, a growing number of case studies reveal characteristics with riskpredicting value, opening the paths to better invasion-control strategies.

AB  - Simple Summary In this study, we used a new mixture to generate probiotics and significantly reduced the relative abundance of Paraprevotella and Phascolarctobacterium, and the group fed with this mixture had higher relative abundance of Prevotella, Faecaliberium, and Gemmiger. These had a big impact on the metabolic pathways. The aim of our study was to use 16S rRNA gene sequencing and untargeted metabolomics to assess how the additive of special probiotics' mixture influenced the swine microbiome and to confirm whether such a proceeding can reduce the risk of some health disturbances' appearance. Complex probiotics are made from various single probiotics mixed in scientific formula. The long-term intake of different probiotics is beneficial to maintain the intestinal microecological balance, inhibiting harmful pathogenic flora and facilitating organism health. Based on the limited research on intestinal flora and related metabolites after the long-term intake of the probiotic complex, in this study, 16S rRNA gene sequencing and untargeted metabolomics were used to further investigate the effects of the probiotic complex on the intestinal flora and metabolome of pigs. The results demonstrated that the content of flora in the intestinal tract or metabolites of pigs varied greatly and was related to cellular metabolic pathways after the long-term feeding of complex probiotics. This study provides a valuable theoretical basis for farmers to raise pigs scientifically and healthily.

AB  - Phenological shifts in response to changing climatic conditions is a key acclimation process for the persistence of perennial plants in temperate and boreal climates. The optimal time to leaf-out is the result of an evolutionary process determined by the trade-off between minimizing the risk of freezing damages and herbivory pressure while maximizing resource uptake to increase competitiveness against the other plants. We quantified the penalty exerted by frost damage at the time of leaf emergence on plant development (reduction in leaf area, canopy duration and growth) over the potential gains without frost (increased biomass and non-structural carbohydrate reserves), depending on when leaf-out occurs. To this purpose, we exposed 960 saplings of four temperate deciduous tree species with contrasting cold hardiness to two frost intensities shortly after leaf emergence, which was artificially induced at four occasions to reflect the whole range of natural leaf-out dates. One year above-ground biomass (AGB) increments following the frost revealed a clear ranking among the species depending on their strategy to cope with damaging frosts. Prunus avium (-41% of AGB-increment compared to control saplings) resprouted from the stem base, Quercus robur (-62%) rapidly produced new leaves from dormant reserve buds, Fagus sylvatica (-98%) showed highest chlorophyll content in autumn and delayed senescence together with Carpinus betulus (-105%), which overcompensated NSC reserves after the growing season but showed highest mortality (up to 32%). In all species, NSC reserves recovered rapidly to control levels at the expense of growth. The timing of leaf-out (advanced and delayed artificially) significantly affected the performance and recovery (regreening and growth) of both frozen and non-frozen saplings, with the lowest performance found at the most delayed leaf-out date. We propose that the potential to recover from frost damages is an important component of a tree's performance, particularly at the juvenile stage. The ability to recover may become even more decisive in the future with the predicted increase of false springs in many extratropical regions.

AB  - Biochar could promote humification in composting, nevertheless, its mechanism has not been fully explored from the perspective of the overall bacterial community and its metabolism. This study investigated the effects of bamboo charcoal (BC) and wheat straw biochar (WSB) on the humic acid (HA) and fulvic acid (FA) contents during pig manure composting. The results showed that BC enhanced humification more than WSB, and significantly increased the HA content and HA/FA ratio. The bacterial community structure under BC differed from those under the other treatments, and BC increased the abundance of bacteria associated with the transformation of organic matter compared with the other treatments. Furthermore, biochar enhanced the metabolism of carbohydrates and amino acids in the thermophilic and cooling phases, especially BC. Through Mantel tests and network analysis, we found that HA was mainly related to carbon source metabolism and the bacterial community, and BC might change the interaction patterns among carbohydrates, amino acid metabolism, Bacillales, Clostridiales, and Lactobacillales with HA and FA to improve the humification process during composting. These results are important for understanding the mechanisms associated with the effects of biochar on humification during composting.

AB  - Hipposideros pomona is a typical cave-dwelling bat (IUCN endangered), and its roost selection mechanism has not been studied. From January 2018 to December 2020, 135 potential roosts were investigated in mainland China. To understand the impact of cave microclimate, structure, surround-ing and human disturbance on roost selection of H. pomona, 16 variables related to microclimate and roost characteristics were measured. The differences in environmental conditions in the roost of this species in different seasons were studied. The roost preferences of H. pomona were evaluated using independent-samples t-tests and chi-squared tests. The major environmental factors affecting the selection of roosts were determined by principal components analysis (PCA). The results were as follows: (1) H. pomona preferred free-hanging with a cluster spatial arrangement in small rooms deep in the caves. (2) H. pomona and other species of bats all tended to live in natural caves. However, compared to other bats, H. pomona preferred to roost in caves with relatively lower cave ceilings, more entrances, and farther from residential areas. Roosts of H. pomona were warmer and wetter with significantly lower levels of disturbance than those without H. pomona. (3) H. pomona preferred to hibernate in natural caves with little human disturbance and higher temperature and relative humid-ity. (4) Compared with nonbreeding roosts, breeding roosts of H. pomona had more areas covered by water and had a higher temperature and relative humidity. (5) The PCA analysis showed that micro -climate factors, structure factors, and geographical factors were significant environmental factors for H. pomona roost selection.

AB  - Global climate change will probably exacerbate crop losses from insect pests, reducing agricultural production, and threatening food security. To predict where crop losses will occur, scientists have mainly used correlative models of species' distributions, but such models are unreliable when extrapolated to future environments. To minimize extrapolation, we developed mechanistic and hybrid models that explicitly capture range-limiting processes, and we explored how incorporating mechanisms altered the projected impacts of climate change for an agricultural pest, the South American locust (Schistocerca cancellata). Because locusts are generalist herbivores surrounded by food, their population growth may be limited by thermal effects on digestion more than food availability. To incorporate this mechanism into a distribution model, we measured the thermal effects on the consumption and defecation of field-captured locusts and used these data to model energy gain in current and future climates. We then created hybrid models by using outputs of the mechanistic model as predictor variables in correlative models, estimating the potential distribution of gregarious outbreaking locusts based on multiple predictor sets, modeling algorithms, and climate scenarios. Based on the mechanistic model, locusts can assimilate relatively high amounts of energy throughout temperate and tropical South America; however, correlative and hybrid modeling revealed that most tropical areas are unsuitable for locusts. When estimating current distributions, the top-ranked model was always the one fit with mechanistic predictors (i.e., the hybrid model). When projected to future climates, top-ranked hybrid models projected range expansions that were 23%-30% points smaller than those projected by correlative models. Therefore, a combination of the correlative and mechanistic approaches bracketed the potential outcomes of climate change and enhanced confidence where model projections agreed. Because all models projected a poleward range expansion under climate change, agriculturists should consider enhanced monitoring and the management of locusts near the southern margin of the range.

AB  - The aim of this study was to investigate the molecular mechanisms by which hypoxia affects the biological behavior of yak PASMCs, the changes in the histological structure of yak and cattle lungs, and the relationships and regulatory roles that exist regarding the differences in the distribution and expression of PDK1 and its hypoxia-associated factors screened for their role in the adaptation of yak lungs to the plateau hypoxic environment. The results showed that, at the level of transcriptome sequencing, the molecular regulatory mechanisms of the HIF-1 signaling pathway, glucose metabolism pathway, and related factors (HK2/PGK1/ENO1/ENO3/ALDOC/ALDOA) may be closely related to the adaptation of yaks to the hypoxic environment of the plateau; at the tissue level, the presence of filled alveoli and semi-filled alveoli, thicker alveolar septa and basement membranes, a large number of erythrocytes, capillary distribution, and collagen fibers accounted for all levels of fine bronchioles in the lungs of yaks as compared to cattle. A higher percentage of goblet cells was found in the fine bronchioles of yaks, and PDK1, HIF-1 alpha, and VEGF were predominantly distributed and expressed in the monolayers of ciliated columnar epithelium in the branches of the terminal fine bronchioles of yak and cattle lungs, with a small amount of it distributed in the alveolar septa; at the molecular level, the differences in PDK1 mRNA relative expression in the lungs of adult yaks and cattle were not significant (p > 0.05), the differences in HIF-1 alpha and VEGF mRNA relative expression were significant (p < 0.05), and the expression of PDK1 and HIF-1 alpha proteins in adult yaks was stronger than that in adult cattle. PDK1 and HIF-1 alpha proteins were more strongly expressed in adult yaks than in adult cattle, and the difference was highly significant (p < 0.01); the relative expression of VEGF proteins was not significantly different between adult yaks and cattle (p > 0.05). The possible regulatory relationship between the above results and the adaptation of yak lungs to the plateau hypoxic environment paves the way for the regulatory mechanisms of PDK1, HIF-1 alpha, and VEGF, and provides basic information for studying the mechanism of hypoxic adaptation of yaks in the plateau. At the same time, it provides a reference for human hypoxia adaptation and a target for the prevention and treatment of plateau diseases in humans and plateau animals.

AB  - The generality of scaling relationships between multiple shoot traits, known as Corner's rules, has been considered to reflect the biomechanical limits to trees and tree organs among the species of different leaf sizes. Variation in fruit size within species would also be expected to affect shoot structure by changing the mechanical and hydraulic stresses caused by the mass and water requirement of fruits. We investigated the differences in shoot structure and their relationship with fruit size in Camellia japonica from 12 sites in a wide geographic range in Japan. This species is known to produce larger fruits with thicker pericarps in more southern populations because warmer climates induce more intensive arms race between the fruit size and the rostrum length of its obligate seed predator. We found that, in association with the change in fruit size, the diameter and mass of 1-year-old stems were negatively associated with latitude, but the total mass and area of 1-year-old leaves did not change with latitude. Consequently, the length of 1-year-old stems and the total mass and area of 1-year-old leaves at a given stem diameter were positively associated with latitude in the allometric relationships. In contrast, the allometric relationships between stem diameter and total mass of the 1-year-old shoot complex (the leaves, stems and fruits that were supported by a 1-year-old stem) did not differ across the trees of different latitudes. Thus, natural selection on fruit size is considered to influence the other traits of Corner's rules in C. japonica, but all of the traits of Corner's rules do not necessarily change in a similar manner across latitudinal gradients.

AB  - The study of assembly patterns and dynamics of organisms has long remained a foundational theme in ecology. Further, the relationship between assemblages and different habitats can provide important insight into ecological processes and guide management and conservation efforts (e.g., restoration, protected areas). We conducted underwater visual surveys of reef-fish assemblages at 14 sites in the eastern Gulf of Mexico, including 8 that were paired artificial and natural reefs. By using a paired design, we controlled biotic (e.g., larval supply), abiotic (e.g., depth), and socio variables (e.g., fishing access) to isolate the effect(s) of reef type. Trained scientific SCUBA divers with extensive experience with reef fishes from the broader tropical western Atlantic region conducted 10-min stationary surveys on the paired reefs each season (i.e., calendar quarters) for 10 years from spring 2013 to spring 2023. We also surveyed six additional artificial reefs from winter 2020 to spring 2023 that lacked natural reef pairs. During each survey, the divers identified and estimated the total lengths of all taxa observed within an imaginary cylinder around them. The imaginary cylinders had a radius of up to 7.5 m (depending on horizontal visibility) and extended from the seafloor to the highest visible water above the diver. During the study period, we conducted a total of 1349 surveys and counted 544,736 fish that represented 171 taxa (most at the species level). Analyses of these data have revealed habitat-specific heterogeneity of the fish assemblages at both taxonomic and functional trait levels, the importance of herbivory in structuring the benthos, and socio-ecological interactions in the system, among other findings. These data may be useful for other researchers interested in patterns and dynamics of populations and communities, functional traits, food web structure, and taxa-habitat relationships and for parameterizing statistical, joint distribution, metacommunity, and ecosystem models. In addition, because many of the observed taxa are of management concern, they may be useful for researchers interested in fisheries science. The data are free to use and are not copyright restricted. We ask users to cite this data paper.

AB  - Negative air ion (NAI) has been widely recognized to be regulated by plant photosynthesis. However, their quantified relationship had seldom been validated. In this study, plant photosynthesis-related traits (including leaf area-specific photosynthesis An, transpiration rates El, stomatal conductance gs, photosynthetic electron transport rate ETR) and leaf area-specific NAI (NAIc) were measured to qualify their relations with ten different species in a thermostat. Sap flow measurement was conducted on 15 individuals of Camellia japonica L. in an open-top chamber (OTC) to inverse sap flow based-stomatal conductance (GSf), as a proxy of whole individual photosynthesis. We also conducted gas exchange measurements on these individuals and compared them with their GSf. Three micro-meteorological parameters, including air temperature (Ta), relative humidity (RH) and radiation (Ra) and NAI were synchronously monitored with sap flow measurement. Significant differences were observed in NAIc among the 10 species, and was highly determined by their An, El and gs. However, since RH in the thermostat was stable at 70%, we could concluded that the NAIc difference among species was determined by the gs-related photosynthesis, rather than the El- related transpiration. In the OTC experiment, before the C. japonica individuals were moved in, Ta, RH and Ra accounted for 89% of the total NAI variation. However, after the C. japonica were moved in, the contribution of the three parameters decreased to 40%, and the new model only provided 46% of NAI variation. Since gs and An of C. japonica individuals were well explained by the GSf (R2 = 0.94 and 0.91 respectively), which proved GSf a good proxy of gs and An. GSf during the daytime was then considered in the model, and 76.88% of NAI variances were accounted. Even though some limitations such as the disturbance of air quantity index (AQI) still exist in our study, we provided a more efficient way to inverse the NAI dynamics in the region of vegetation.

AB  - Human-wildlife conflict (HWC) is a critical challenge to human development and well-being and threatens biodiversity conservation. Ideally, HWC mitigation should benefit both wildlife and communities and limit the costs associated with living alongside wildlife. However, place- and context-dependent realizations of conflict are often overlooked in HWC mitigation. Social and systemic dimensions of human-wildlife relationships often receive limited consideration in HWC as a concept and in mitigation strategies implemented globally. In recognizing our collective symmetries as a diverse group of researchers, we pose the idea of constellations of coexistence, based on Atallah et al.'s "constellation of co-resistance." Building on literature and our interdisciplinary and cross-sectoral experiences of working with diverse species inhabiting different sociocultural, sociopolitical, and socioeconomic landscapes, we considered evidence of cultural nuances (e.g., sociocultural dimensions of human-elephant and human-lion interactions in East Africa and India) in HWC mitigation and argue that failing to incorporate them in mainstream practices poses a myriad of ethical and practical consequences. Locally situated but globally relevant, participation of local and Indigenous communities in HWC mitigation activities produces better conservation outcomes. Centering communities in the ideation, implementation, and evaluation of HWC mitigation promotes more equitable and sustainable management strategies for long-term human-wildlife coexistence.

AB  - Lynx populations in Estonia and Latvia have recently become a conservation concern due to both natural and anthropogenic causes. Harsh winters with a thick snow cover more than a decade ago led to a rapid decrease in roe deer numbers, followed by a severe lynx population decline and slow recovery. In the near future, a high fence currently under construction at the borders with Russia and Belarus will most likely halt the transboundary gene flow. Therefore, to avoid the erosion of genetic diversity, it is vital to make every effort to maintain the gene flow, especially between Estonia and Latvia. The aim of this study was to evaluate the transboundary population structure and extent of gene flow between populations of Estonia and Latvia, and find areas where the gene flow can be most vulnerable. Microsatellite loci were genotyped for 561 individuals (290 from Estonia and 271 from Latvia) collected in 2006-2015. Population clustering and spatial analyses indicate that lynxes in western Latvia are partially isolated, having limited gene flow with other areas. Individuals in western Latvia are also characterized by a significantly lower level of heterozygosity and higher inbreeding. This can be attributed to the reduced availability of high-quality lynx habitats between western and central Latvia, acting as a partial migration barrier. Spatial autocorrelation analysis revealed females exhibiting stronger philopatry compared to males. Migration barriers such as the low-quality habitats and border fences are the major conservation concerns to be considered when developing future action plans for lynx, but also for other mammal populations.

AB  - There is increasing evidence that climate warming will have both direct and indirect effects on species. Whereas the direct effects of climate warming represent the proximate physiological consequences of changing abiotic conditions, the indirect effects of climate change reflect changes mediated by at least one other interacting species. The relative importance of these two kinds of effects has been unclear, limiting our ability to generalize the response of different species to climate change. Here, we used a series of experiments to disentangle some of the key direct and indirect effects of warming on the growth of monarch butterfly caterpillars (Danaus plexippus) and showy milkweed plants (Asclepias speciosa) during a window of rapid growth for both species. The effects of warming differed between direct, indirect, and combined effect experiments. Warming from 26 degrees C to 30 degrees C directly increased the growth of both monarch larvae and milkweeds, with monarch and milkweed growth rates showing similar sensitivity to warming. However, in a subsequent experiment, we did not observe significantly increased growth when comparing caterpillars and plants reared at 27 degrees C and 31 degrees C, suggesting that small differences can change the direct effects of warming. When caterpillars that were maintained at laboratory temperatures were fed leaves from host plants that were exposed to warmer temperatures, warming had a negative indirect effect on larval growth rates likely mediated by decreases in milkweed leaf quality. In experiments combining direct and indirect effects, we observed a net positive effect of warming on larval growth rates. Warming had no combined effects on milkweed growth, potentially due to opposing positive direct and negative indirect effects on growth mediated via increased monarch herbivory. These results show how variability among the direct, indirect, and combined effects of even relatively simple, short-term climatic perturbations can present challenges for predicting the broader effects of climatic warming in multispecies communities.

AB  - The mangrove crab Ucides cordatus (Linnaeus, 1763) is a burrowing crab with an important role in mangrove nutrient cycling. The species holds major socioeconomic importance, generating yield for traditional and low-income populations. Despite its ecological and economic importance, there are few experiments in Brazil applying stable isotope tools to trophic crab classification, and even fewer considering females in the reproductive period. Females have different energy demands than males; studies examining C and N can reveal details regarding the differences. Hence, the present study is the first analysis of the delta C-13, delta N-15, and the C/N ratio in ovigerous females of two populations from Southeastern Brazil (Caceribu River - Guanabara Bay and Gargau mangrove - Paraiba do Sul River secondary estuary). The Caceribu mangrove is larger and is located in one of the most impacted bays in the world. In the Paraiba do Sul River region, the mangrove swamp is about ten times smaller, has a substantially lower population in the surrounding area, and is more influenced by agricultural activities. The delta C-13 analysis confirmed mangrove leaves as their main food source. The significant delta C-13 variation between the Guanabara and Paraiba do Sul estuary populations can be related to differences in food availability and nutritional value. However, the delta N-15 values can be related to the ingestion of other food items during the breeding season as well as the influence of anthropogenic mangrove degradation. At both study sites, the delta 15N values were higher than those observed in other mangrove crab populations and other herbivorous species. Significant (p < 0.05) isotopic differences were found among populations, suggesting variations in biogeochemical cycles that may be related to different environmental conditions between the sites.

AB  - Agricultural lands have been increasingly reported to be contaminated by metals and metalloids, leading to exposure to these toxins for humans and wildlife. Previous studies on metal/metalloid contamination have re-ported biomagnification of total elemental Hg (THg) and, less consistently, of Cd, in both aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems. Whether other metals or metalloids can biomagnify in food webs, especially those that produce food for humans, is uncertain. We aimed to compare metal/metalloid contamination and their biomagnification patterns between rice paddy and sugarcane agroecosystems. We collected samples at an inactive Pb-Zn mine site, and two reference sites in southwestern Guangxi, southern China. Samples were widely distributed across the food web, including soil, rice grain and leaves, sugarcane leaves, crickets, grasshoppers, spiders, and frogs. We found that Cr, Cd, Pb, THg, and Zn were the metals associated with mining activities, while As and Cu were higher at the reference sites. In soil, and in the majority of species for which there were significant differences between agroecosystems, concentrations of Cd, Cr, Cu, Pb, THg, and Zn were higher in rice, suggesting that the rice paddy ecosystem is particularly sensitive to metal contamination. When quantitatively rating the patterns of biomagnification using post-hoc multiple comparisons among species' bioaccumulation factors (BAFs), rice paddies had stronger patterns of biomagnification (3 strong relationships [e.g., all insectivores had higher or as high BAFs compared to all other species], 7 medium relationships [e.g., one of the insectivores had the highest BAFs, but another had an intermediary value, similar to an herbivore], 6 weak [e.g., one insectivore had the highest BAFs, but the other was as low as a primary producer], and 3 no relationships [e.g., no significant differences among species in BAFs]) than sugarcane ecosystems (1 strong, 2 medium, 8 weak, and 9 no re-lationships; Repeated measures t-test, P-value = 0.0023) across 6 metals (Cr, Cd, Cu, Hg, Pb, Zn). The strongest biomagnification was evident for THg and Zn, whereas an intermediary level of biomagnification was found for Cd, Cr, Cu, and Pb; biodilution was observed for As and Mn. Therefore, focusing on metal/metalloid appor-tionment to better understand the sources of the metals at our study sites would be of utility to lower the exposure of wildlife and people. Most importantly, the local authorities should check metal concentrations in any farming product from the mining area and even the close reference site to safeguard human health.

AB  - For grazing herbivores, dung density in feeding areas is an important determinant of exposure risk to fecal-orally transmitted parasites. When host species share the same parasite species, a nonrandom distribution of their cumulative dung density and/or nonrandom ranging and feeding behavior may skew exposure risk and the relative selection pressure parasites impose on each host. The arid-adapted Grevy's zebra (Equus grevyi) can range more widely than the water-dependent plains zebra (Equus quagga), with which it shares the same species of gastrointestinal nematodes. We studied how the spatial distribution of zebra dung relates to ranging and feeding behavior to assess parasite exposure risk in Grevy's and plains zebras at a site inhabited by both zebra species. We found that zebra dung density declined with distance from water, Grevy's zebra home ranges (excluding those of territorial males) were farther from water than those of plains zebras, and plains zebra grazing areas had higher dung density than random points while Grevy's zebra grazing areas did not, suggesting a greater exposure risk in plains zebras associated with their water dependence. Fecal egg counts increased with home range proximity to water for both species, but the response was stronger in plains zebras, indicating that this host species may be particularly vulnerable to the elevated exposure risk close to water. We further ran experiments on microclimatic effects on dung infectivity and showed that fewer nematode eggs embryonated in dung in the sun than in the shade. However, only 5% of the zebra dung on the landscape was in shade, indicating that the microclimatic effects of shade on the density of infective larvae is not a major influence on exposure risk dynamics. Ranging constraints based on water requirements appear to be key mediators of nematode parasite exposure in free-ranging equids.

AB  - Herbivore distribution throughout Africa is strongly linked to mean annual precipitation. We use that relationship to predict functional group composition of herbivore communities during the last glacial maximum (ca. 21 ka) on the now submerged Palaeo-Agulhas Plain (PAP), South Africa. We used metabolic large herbivore biomass (MLHB) from 39 South African protected areas, in five functional groups (characterized by behavior and physiology). We examined how modern factors influenced MLHB and considered the effects of biome, annual rainfall, percentage winter rainfall, and protected area size. Overall, biome was the most important factor influencing the relationship between MLHB and rainfall. In general, MLHB increased with rainfall, but not for the grassland biome. Outside grasslands, most functional groups' metabolic biomass increased with increasing rainfall, irrespective of biome, except for medium-sized social mixed feeder species in savanna and thicket. Protected area size was influential for medium-sized social mixed feeders and large browsers and rainfall influenced medium-sized social mixed feeders, offering some perspectives on spatial constraints on past large herbivore biomass densities. These results improve our understanding of the likely herbivore community composition and relative biomass structure on the PAP, an essential driver of how early humans utilized large mammals as a food resource.

AB  - Oil palm managers are one of the key stakeholders who could help strengthen efforts to protect elephants in the landscape. We used a Theory of Change (ToC) approach to hypothesize potential barriers and benefits to managers adopting best practise. We conducted two workshopss with more than 60 participants to better understand managers' perceptions of Human Elephant Conflict (HEC) and their willingness to adopt better wildlife management practices. The workshops confirmed that some of the outcomes we perceived in the original ToC, including security issues, false accusations, negative perceptions by the international community and crop damage, were affecting their willingness to promote coexistence in their plantation. However, we also uncovered other potential barriers and opportunities to promote coexistence, including international and national standards that do not provide enough technical and practical guidance for all levels, expensive monitoring costs, and inconsistent collaboration among industry players and between government and non-government agencies. Our initial findings suggest that new attitudes and perceptions have not been explored before and may be critical for manager engagement and adoption of best practices for HEC, as well as the identification of new audiences that would need to be engaged to be successful in achieving elephant conservation goals.

AB  - According to the harsh environment hypothesis, natural selection should favour cognitive mechanisms to overcome environmental challenges. Tests of this hypothesis to date have largely focused on asocial learning and memory, thus failing to account for the spread of information via social means. Tests in specialized food-hoarding birds have shown strong support for the effects of environmental harshness on both asocial and social learning. Whether the hypothesis applies to non-specialist foraging species remains largely unexplored. We evaluated the relative importance of social learning across a known harshness gradient by testing generalist great tits, Parus major, from high (harsh)- and low (mild)-elevation populations in two social learning tasks. We showed that individuals use social learning to find food in both colour-associative and spatial foraging tasks and that individuals differed consistently in their use of social learning. However, we did not detect a difference in the use or speed of implementing socially observed information across the elevational gradient. Our results do not support predictions of the harsh environment hypothesis suggesting that context-dependent costs and benefits as well as plasticity in the use of social information may play an important role in the use of social learning across environments. Finally, this study adds to the accumulating evidence that the harsh environment hypothesis appears to have more pronounced effects on specialists compared to generalist species.

AB  - The objectives of the present work were as follows: (i) the detection of cathelicidin biomolecules in the milk of individual goats during the early stages of mastitis and their potential use for the diagnosis of mastitis at its early stage and (ii) the evaluation of the presence of cathelicidin proteins in the bulk-tank milk from goat and sheep farms. In an experimental study, after inoculation of Staphylococcus simulans into a mammary gland of goats, bacteriological and cytological examinations of milk samples, as well as proteomics examinations [two-dimensional gel electrophoresis analysis (2-DE) and matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometer (MALDI-TOF MS) analysis] were performed sequentially, from 4 to 48 h post-challenge. Cathelicidin-1 and cathelicidin-2 were detected consistently in milk samples obtained throughout the study, and spot optical densities obtained from PDQuest v.8.0 were recorded. Associations were calculated between the presence of mastitis in a mammary gland at a given timepoint and the detection of cathelicidin proteins in the respective milk sample. All inoculated mammary glands developed mastitis, confirmed by the consistent bacterial isolation from milk samples and the increased somatic cell content therein. Spot optical density of cathelicidin proteins was higher than in samples from contralateral mammary glands. There was a significant association between the presence of mastitis in a mammary gland and the detection of cathelicidin biomolecules in the respective milk sample; the overall accuracy was 81.8% (95% confidence interval: 70.4-90.2%). In a field investigation, the presence of cathelicidin proteins was evaluated in the bulk-tank milk of 32 dairy goat and 57 dairy sheep farms. In this part of the work, no cathelicidin proteins were detected in any bulk-tank milk sample of goat, 0.0% (95% confidence interval: 0.0-10.7%), or sheep, 0.0% (95% confidence interval: 0.0-6.3%), farms.

AB  - The content of bioavailable forms of phosphorus (P) and potassium (K) in soil is essential for the proper functioning of agroecosystems. This study aimed to determine the effects of pig slurry (PS) and NPK mineral fertilizers on soil phosphorus (P) and potassium (K) fractions, the relationship between these fractions and basic soil agrochemical properties, and crop yield. The research material was collected from a long-term experiment established in 1955 in Prague-Ruzyn & ecaron;, Czechia. The effect of two constant factors was analyzed: manure application (control, PS) and different doses of NPK fertilizers (N0P0K0, N1P1K1, N3P2K2, and N4P2K2). A significant effect of fertilization on basic soil properties was demonstrated, including total soil carbon and nitrogen. PS and NPK fertilization also significantly affected the content of water-soluble and moderate labile fractions of P and K. These fractions were positively correlated with plant-available P and K (Mehlich 3). The best fertilization option, which resulted in the greatest increase in yield, was the use of PS and mineral fertilizers at the N3P2K2 level. Increasing the nitrogen dose to the level of N4 resulted in a decrease in the content of bioavailable forms of P and K in topsoil despite the application of PS.

AB  - Outbreaks and spread of infectious diseases are often associated with seasonality and environmental changes, including global warming. Free-living stages of soil-transmitted helminths are highly susceptible to climatic drivers; however, how multiple climatic variables affect helminth species, and the long-term consequences of these interactions, is poorly understood. We used experiments on nine trichostrongylid species of herbivores to develop a temperature- and humidity-dependent model of infection hazard, which was then implemented at the European scale under climate change scenarios. Intestinal and stomach helminths exhibited contrasting climatic responses, with the former group strongly affected by temperature while the latter primarily impacted by humidity. Among the demographic traits, larval survival heavily modulated the infection hazard. According to the specific climatic responses of the two groups, climate change is expected to generate differences in the seasonal and spatial shifts of the infection hazard and group co-circulation. In the future, an intensification of these trends could create new opportunities for species range expansion and co-occurrence at European central-northern latitudes.

AB  - Cocomposting coal gangue and sludge eliminates the challenge of utilizing coal gangue. However, there is limited understanding about the feasibility of cocomposting sludge and coal gangue, as well as the composting indicators, functional microorganisms, and safety risks involved. Therefore, this study evaluated the feasibility of enhancing carbon composting in coal gangue by incorporating sludge along with sawdust as a conditioner. Three laboratory-scale reactors were designed and labeled as T1 (20 % coal gangue, 60 % sludge, and 20 % sawdust), T2 (40 % coal gangue, 40 % sludge, and 20 % sawdust), and T3 (60 % coal gangue, 20 % sludge, and 20 % sawdust). Seed germination and plant growth assessments were conducted to ensure compost stability and assess phytotoxicity to cabbage ( Brassica rapa chinensis L. ) in terms of growth and biomass. The results indicated that the temperature, pH, EC and ammonia nitrogen of all three reactor conditions met the requirements for product decomposition. Composting was successfully achieved when the sludge proportion was 20 % (T3). However, when the sludge proportion was markedly high (T1), the harmlessness of the compost was reduced. The germination indices of T1, T2, and T3 reached 95 %, 122 %, and 119 % at maturity, respectively. This confirmed that the harmless cycle, which involved promoting condensation and aromatization, enhancing decay, and reducing composting time, was shorter in T2 and T3 than in T1. Coal gangue can also serve as a beneficial habitat for microorganisms, promoting an increase in their population and activity. Potting experiments in sandy soil revealed that the mechanism of action of compost products in soil included not only the enhancement of soil nutrients but also the improvement of soil texture. The results of this study suggest that using coal gangue as a raw material for composting is an efficient and environmentally friendly approach for producing organic fertilizers.

AB  - Loss of crop yield due to non-native invasive pests is a global phenomenon with profound population, biodi-versity, ecosystem, and economic impacts. The polyphagous and migratory fall armyworm (FAW) Spodoptera frugiperda (Lepidoptera, Noctuidae) has become a major invasive pest around the globe in the past decade, posing a great threat to global food security. Early warning and timely detection of this pest and its associated agri-cultural risks are essential for preventing, intervening, controlling, and mitigating invasion threats, which could reduce crop losses and economic damage. However, one key challenge is how to effectively and accurately monitor pest invasion as soon as possible prior to their establishment. Here, we aimed to determine the effec-tiveness of four different methods for identifying the presence of FAW, namely DNA metabarcoding, field survey, light trap, and sex pheromone trap. We collected fecal samples of six bat species in the FAW colonization area, including Rhinolophus pearsonii, Rhinolophus rex, Ia io, Myotis altarium, Myotis pilosus, and Myotis chinensis. We then utilized bat fecal samples to monitor FAW through DNA metabarcoding during its early establishment stages and compared this approach to three traditional surveillance methods. The results revealed interspecific dif-ferences in the occurrence frequency of FAW in different bat species. Furthermore, bat fecal DNA metabarcoding successfully monitored the occurrence of this pest nearly one month in advance compared with traditional ap-proaches, which coincides with the adult migration time of larval counterparts found in the field based on effective accumulated temperature calculations. Our results showed that DNA metabarcoding dietary analysis of generalist insectivorous bats can be an effective, noninvasive, and economically viable tool for invasion pests monitoring to inform management decisions.

AB  - Contemporary restoration and management of sagebrush-dominated (Artemisia spp.) ecosystems across the intermountain west of the United States increasingly involves the removal of expanding conifer, particularly juniper (Juniperus spp.) and pinyon pine (Pinus edulis, P. monophylla). The impetus behind much of this management has been the demonstrated population benefits of sagebrush restoration via conifer removal to greater sage-grouse (Centrocercus urophasianus), a species of conservation concern. One of the challenges with scaling up from a focal-species approach to a community-level perspective, however, is balancing the habitat requirements of different species, some of which may overlap with sage-grouse and others which may have competing habitat needs. Here, we use a systematic conservation planning approach to compute spatial optimizations that prioritize areas for conifer removal across the sage-grouse range while incorporating woodland and sagebrush songbirds into decision making. Three of the songbirds considered here, Brewer's sparrow (Spizella breweri), green-tailed towhee (Pipilo chlorurus), and sage thrasher (Poocetes gramineus), are sagebrush-obligates, while another is a woodland-obligate, the pinyon jay (Gymnorhinus cyanocephalus). We find that the inclusion of sagebrush-obligates expands the model-selected area of consideration for conifer management, likely because habitat overlap between sagebrushobligates is imperfect. The inclusion of pinyon jay, a woodland-obligate, resulted in substantial shifts in the distribution of model-selected priority areas for conifer removal, particularly away from pinyon jay strongholds in Nevada and east-central California. Finally, we compared the conifer optimizations created here with estimates of ongoing conifer removal efforts across the intermountain west and find that a small proportion (13-18%) of management efforts had occurred on areas predicted as being important for pinyon jay, suggesting that much of the ongoing work is already successfully avoiding critical pinyon jay habitat areas.

AB  - Simple Summary In Lithuania, African swine fever (ASF) notifications in domestic pigs and wild boar have been increasing since the entry of ASF from 2014 to 2018. The disease caused serious economic losses and affected commercial and non-commercial pig holdings. We conducted a prospective matched case-control study to investigate the potential risk factors associated with ASF outbreaks in pig farms in Lithuania in 2019. The study revealed that the risk of ASF occurrence in a pig farm was significantly lower if the farm had been inspected by veterinary inspectors, while the risk increased if certain activities, possibly related to the indirect transmission of ASF to a pig farm, were practiced on a farm, e.g., mushroom picking, sharing equipment, etc. Veterinary inspection seemed to increase the level of biosecurity and ASF awareness on a farm, which may have helped to prevent disease introduction. These findings can be used to improve the control and prevention of ASF in domestic pigs in countries affected by ASF. While numerous risk factors of African swine fever (ASF) transmission to domestic pigs have been described, ASF virus introduction has often not been traced back to one single defined cause. The large number of ASF outbreaks that occurred in domestic pigs in Lithuania from 2014 through to 2018 raised the question regarding whether outbreak-specific risk factors and transmission routes could be identified. Therefore, a prospective matched case-control study was designed. Data from 18 outbreaks that occurred in Lithuanian in 2019 and 36 control farms were analyzed. Conditional multivariable logistic regression showed that two or more visits by veterinary inspection of a farm had a significant preventive effect on the occurrence of ASF on a farm (Odds ratio (OR) 14.21, confidence interval (CI) 1.09-185.60 for farms not inspected vs. farms inspected twice or more a year), while certain practices (e.g., mushroom picking, sharing equipment, etc.), which might facilitate the indirect introduction of ASF from fields and forests into piggeries, significantly increased the odds of an outbreak (OR 5.18, CI 1.10-24.44). The results of the study highlight the importance of veterinary inspections for increasing the biosecurity level on pig farms and the awareness of ASF. The knowledge on potential protective and risk factors may help to improve the prevention and control of ASF outbreaks in domestic pig farms in Lithuania and other affected countries.

Since ancient times, it has been a popular Mediterranean ornamental plant in horticulture and served as model for the decoration of column capitals in architecture.& nbsp;Aim of the study: In the present review, we aimed to give an overview about ethnopharmacology, phytochemistry, chemical ecology, and invasion biology of A. mollis. Thus, the importance of plantation cultivation in the presence of ecologically problematic species and environmental protection were emphasized.& nbsp;Materials and methods: We conducted an extensive literature search via screening PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science, in order to compile the data about A. mollis and its role on invasion biology and thereby attracting attention to the prominence of the horticultural and agricultural cultivation of plant species with a special focus on A. mollis as a model.& nbsp;Results and conclusion: Phytochemical analyses revealed secondary metabolites from the classes of flavonoids, phenols, phenylpropanoids, anthraquinones arylnaphthalene lignans, phytosterols and others. Extracts of A. mollis and isolated phytochemicals not only exert assorted activities including antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective in murine and human experimental models, but also act against plant parasites (bacteria, insects, mollusks, fungi), protecting the plant from microbial attack and herbivorous predators. A. mollis has been used in traditional medicine to treat dermatological ailments, gastrointestinal diseases, ulcers and even tumors. Nevertheless, the robustness and rapid growth of A. mollis as well as the global horticultural trade facilitated its invasion into fragile ecosystems of Australia, New Zealand, and several other spots around the globe in Northern Europe (Great Britain), Asia (China, India), South Africa, and South America (Argentina). The release of A. mollis from gardens into the wild represents a considerable danger as invasive species are threatening biodiversity and leading to the extinction of domestic plants in the long run. Likewise, the likelihood of other medicinal plants in terms of invasion biology are needed to be fully recognized and discussed.

AB  - Surgeonfishes (Acanthuridae) are an important group of herbivores that are abundant on reefs globally. Acanthurids consume macroalgae that can compete with corals for space, turf algae that can proliferate on degraded reefs, and detritus that may smother adult corals or inhibit settlement. For these reasons, they are of particular interest at present to resource managers seeking to restore and conserve reefs that are facing a myriad of stressors. To contribute to our understanding of the diet breadth and potential vulnerability of these important fishes, we employed metabarcoding to identify and compare the algal diets of two common Hawaiian surgeonfishes, the convict tang or manini (Acanthurustriostegus) and the brown surgeonfish or ma'i'i'i (A. nigrofuscus). These species serve important biological and cultural roles in Hawaiian coral reef ecosystems, and manini, in particular, constitute an essential component of traditional Hawaiian diets. Although diet richness was not significantly different between the species, with 64 unique taxa identified from the gut contents of 89 A. triostegus and 57 taxa from 73 A. nigrofuscus, A. nigrofuscus exhibited greater diet diversity as measured by the Simpson's Diversity Index. A. nigrofuscus had a greater relative read abundance of brown algae, cyanobacteria, and material from the epilithic algal matrix. A. triostegus had a taxonomically more specialized diet, consuming primarily red algae. A. triostegus showed greater variability between sites in diet composition than A. nigrofuscus, and when grouped at the site, shore, or species level, A. triostegus tended to have greater diet overlap among individuals. Conversely, A. nigrofuscus exhibited greater variation in diet among individuals, with less diet variability between sites. Grazing surgeonfishes such as these are critical components of existing and future herbivore management plans, making their diet breadth and consequent vulnerability to habitat loss or disturbance of great interest to resource managers.

AB  - Herbivorous zooplankton potentially encounter temporal dietary heterogeneity in sterol, an essential group of lipids, over short or long time scales. There are a few studies showing that dietary sterol fluctuation will impact the short-term growth and reproduction of zooplankton, but life histories in response to dietary sterol fluctuation have not been studied. In this study, both short-term physical performances and life tables of the brackish rotifer Brachionus plicatilis were compared at a series of constant dietary cholesterol levels and under a diurnal switching-quality regime (SQ) between low-cholesterol (LQ) and high-cholesterol (HQ) diets. The ingestion rate, short-term reproduction rate and lifetime fecundity were correlated significantly with dietary cholesterol concentration in the Michaelis-Menten function pattern. The short-term reproduction rate and lifetime fecundity were higher in the SQ treatment than in the nonlinear averaging prediction. Generally, rotifers under the SQ condition exhibited life history traits comparable to those groups under the medium and high cholesterol conditions, as did the cholesterol accumulation in mother rotifers. The maternal allocation of cholesterol per offspring, nevertheless, varied among different food regimes, and the SQ offspring had a higher sterol content than the HQ offspring. It is suggested that diurnal switching dietary cholesterol quality will not decrease the physiological performance of rotifers, unlike predictions based on the nonlinear averaging hypothesis, and the population can maintain their development under diurnal fluctuating dietary sterol conditions. Furthermore, the variable per offspring sterol investment may bear adaptive significance for rotifers under the fluctuating food environments.

AB  - Mangrove habitats such as those at Salt River, Jamaica are considered to be nurseries for juvenile fishes as they provide shelter from waves. These habitats are highly productive, leading to increased food availability, and the complex mangrove terrain allows juvenile fishes to evade larger predators. The role of small and juvenile piscivores has been widely overlooked, and one hypothesis suggests that their presence in an ecosystem exerts considerable predation pressure on the new recruits. The diets of five piscivores that inhabit Salt River and the adjacent shores ( Caranx hippos, Gobiomorus dormitor, Sphyraena barracuda, Tylosurus crocodilus, and Lutjanus apodus) were examined. The working hypothesis for this study was that the piscivores that inhabit Salt River do not prey on the more abundant secondary consumers in this ecosystem, but rather compete with them for similar resources. The stomach analyses revealed that three of the five piscivores fed on fishes in varying amounts. Tylosurus crocodilus had a high feeding index of anchovies, amphipods, and fish remains. Lutjanus apodus had a high feeding index of fish remains, decapods, amphipods, anchovies, and crustacean remains. For Sphyraena barracuda, the highest feeding index was fish remains. Caranx hippos fed on oligochaetes and polychaetes, and Gobiomorus dormitor fed predominantly on amphipods.

AB  - In areas where farmland borders protected areas, wildlife may be attracted to crops and cause substantial financial damage for farmers. Elephants, in particular, can destroy a year's harvest in a single night, and can also cause damage to buildings and other farm structures. Few studies have examined whether damage caused by wild elephants increases social inequalities in farmer communities. We interviewed settlement leaders and subsistence rice farmers living in the buffer zone of Bardiya National Park, Nepal, to examine (1) the variation and spatial distribution of wealth within the farmer community, (2) the severity and spatio-temporal distribution of damage inflicted by Asian elephants Elephas maximus, and (3) the willingness to insure against such damage. We investigated whether particular societal strata are disproportionally affected by negative interactions with elephants. We found that farmers near the boundary between agricultural and wilderness areas were significantly poorer and had smaller landholdings than those further into the cultivated lands. Concomitantly, damage to crops and houses was more frequent nearer the wilderness-agriculture boundary than further away from it. Hence, in the buffer zone of Bardiya National Park, farmers near the wilderness-cultivation boundary, with small landholdings, had a relatively higher cost of elephant damage, yet were less willing to pay for an insurance scheme. We infer that in areas where both social inequality and damage caused by wildlife are spatially structured, conservation success may cause economic hardship for the local community, particularly for the poorer class. We discuss causes of the current lack of communal mitigation measures against the damage caused by elephants in the Park, and potential solutions.

AB  - As the wolf Canis lupus populations continue to recover across Europe, livestock depredation becomes increasingly challenging for their effective conservation. We aim to (1) analyze the spatiotemporal variation in wolf attacks on livestock in relation to the landscape structure, livestock species, and the phase of wolf expansion in Poland and (2) discuss the implications for conservation and management in an expanding, protected wolf population. From 2008 to 2018, farmers reported 5499 attacks on livestock with 13,164 killed individuals, and the number of attacks increased 2.7-fold at the country scale. Sheep were among the most frequently killed livestock, and surplus killing (>2 killed individuals) was relatively common in captive deer and sheep depredation. The attacks were patchily distributed; 59% of all kills occurred in municipalities constituting 1% of the country surface. The probability and number of attacks were positively influenced by forest and pasture cover, and by the occurrence of depredation in previous years. Spatial variation and long-term dynamics in livestock depredation by wolves can be attributed to different husbandry practices and phases of wolf recovery in three regions of the country. Our results indicate that accelerating increase in depredation rates during the initial phases of wolf recovery is likely to be followed by stabilization or decrease in attacks. A detailed spatiotemporal analysis of wolf-livestock conflict can help in management decisions in areas with ongoing wolf population recovery.

AB  - The decomposition of carrion is crucial to the functioning and nutrient cycling of ecosystems, and many species use this high-quality resource. However, the availability and reliability of carrion differs across environments. Modified landscapes, such as farms and roads, often produce a high density of carcasses, with disproportionate benefits for generalist mesoscavengers that can tolerate, or are attracted to, human presence. In this study, we placed carcasses strategically across two large islands in southern Australia and used camera traps to investigate how different scavengers locate and use carrion in forested, farmland and roadside habitats. Forest ravens, an avian generalist, were the dominant scavengers across all three habitat types but were three times more likely to discover carcasses deployed in modified landscapes. Raptors were twice as likely to discover and use carcasses in farmland habitats, indicating enhanced scavenging opportunities in these areas. The discovery rate and use of carcasses by feral cats did not differ between habitat types. In this setting, differences in carrion use between diurnal and nocturnal scavengers are potentially due to the absence of top mammalian carnivores (Tasmanian devils and quolls). Diurnal scavengers, such as forest ravens and raptors, followed expected habitat preferences, albeit with greater access to carrion due to increased persistence. However, feral cats demonstrated no preference for carcasses across habitats, likely due to the reduced landscape of fear. Overall, our study underscores the important role of native mammalian carnivores in structuring scavenger communities and further validates the value of trophic rewilding to restore key ecological functions.

AB  - Asiatic black bears ( Ursus thibetanus) rarely prey on living adult deer. We report video documentation, obtained May 2024, of a bear subduing and killing a sika deer ( Cervus nippon) that was captured in a leg-hold snare trap, then staying in the area for repeated feeding visits. Leg-hold snare traps for deer capture are widely used in Japan for population control of high deer densities. The predation by bears on deer with restricted movements in this study shows that deer trapping by humans may be providing bears with a new form of deer as a food resource. If bears perceive such a deer as a regular food resource, it may have some effect on bears' ecology (e.g., feeding habits, behavior). In addition, through foraging on captive deer, bears could endanger trappers and the general population. Our record highlights the necessity of evaluating trap management practices to mitigate risks to humans and wildlife.

AB  - The landscape of fear framework posits that prey animals trade off between resource gain and safety when selecting habitat. Strategies for balancing this tradeoff vary among individuals, however, with personality acting as a potentially important factor driving differences. Animals are faced with real predation risk, perceived predation risk, and competition when selecting habitat in landscapes of fear, but few studies have simultaneously measured the effects of these three factors on habitat use, and none have done so while accounting for individual variability. Here, we contribute to the landscape of fear framework by assessing personality-driven tradeoffs in second-order (home range level) and third-order (within home range level) habitat use. We conducted a large-scale field study testing the personality of free-ranging deer mice Peromyscus maniculatus, white-footed mice Peromyscus leucopus, and southern red-backed voles Myodes gapperi in Maine (USA). We mapped individual space use and determined small mammal population numbers using capture-mark-recapture data, measured microhabitat features, and monitored terrestrial and avian predators to quantify competition, perceived risk (i.e. habitat cover), and real risk across individual areas of use (second-order) as well as across used trap sites (third-order). We included 133 deer mice, 69 white-footed mice, and 316 voles to assess relationships between habitat and personality and found evidence of personality-habitat relationships at both orders. Specifically, boldness, activity, and stress coping ability covary with predator presence; boldness, activity, and aggressiveness covary with competition levels; and activity and boldness covary with levels of microhabitat cover. Overall, we found relationships between personality and levels of competition, perceived risk, and real risk within habitats used by small mammals, providing empirical evidence of intraspecific variation in the landscape of fear. These findings highlight the role of personality in mediating habitat use at multiple scales, offering a potential mechanism driving personality-mediated survival rates.

AB  - When the shoot apical meristem of plants is damaged or removed, fecundity and/or plant growth may suffer (under-compensation), remain unaffected (compensation) or increase (overcompensation). The latter signifies a potential 'cost' of apical dominance. Using natural populations of 19 herbaceous angiosperm species with a conspicuously vertical, apically dominant growth form, we removed (clipped) the shoot apical meristem for replicate plants early in the growing season to test for a potential cost of apical dominance. Clipped and unclipped (control) plants had their near neighbours removed, and were harvested after flowering production had finished but before seed dispersal. Dry mass was measured separately for aboveground body size (shoots), leaves, seeds and fruits; and number of leaves, fruits and seeds per plant were counted. We predicted that: (i) our study species (because of their strong apically dominant growth form) would respond to shoot apical meristem removal with greater branching intensity, and thus overcompensation in terms of fecundity and/or biomass; and (ii) overcompensation is particularly enabled for species that produce smaller but more leaves, and hence with a larger bud bank of axillary meristems available for deployment in branching and/or fruit production. Widely variable compensatory capacities were recorded, and with no significant between-species relationship with leaf size or leafing intensity-thus indicating no generalized potential cost of apical dominance. Overall, the results point to species-specific treatment effects on meristem allocation patterns, and suggest importance for effects involving local variation in resource availability, and between-species variation in phenology, life history traits and susceptibility to herbivory.

AB  - Mangroves are an extreme biotope where ants are often described as the most abundant and influential group of insects. Yet very few studies have examined how ants survive the often extreme flooding of this biotope. This review summaries knowledge of the distribution and biology of mangrove ants, giving a particular insight into their adaptations, behavioral and physiological, and describes how some ant species survive during the extreme conditions with high temperatures, tidal flooding, very low oxygen and high carbon dioxide concentrations. Mangrove ants can be divided into three categories: 1) ants nesting in the aerial parts of the mangrove, 2) ants nesting in cavities inside trees or logs that are flooded periodically. 3) ants nesting in the mud within the tidal zone. The diversity of ants is lowest in categories 2 and 3, potentially because of the extreme environments they experience when submerged under water. Colonies of these ants can suffer extremely high temperatures, low oxygen and high CO2 concentrations, with the responses of ants to these conditions differing between species. Workers of Polyrhachis sokolova, for example, survive in pockets of air with elevated CO2 (up to 11%) when their mud nests become submerged and can swim across the waters surface if necessary. Soldiers of the twig nesting Colobopsis anderseni block nest entrances to prevent water influx, can survive normally lethally high nest temperatures and are the first ant known social insect to engage in anaerobic respiration when oxygen becomes limiting. Studies of the extreme habits of mangrove nesting ants provides insight into the adaptive capacity of ants.

AB  - The striking diversity among herbivorous Scarabaeoidea is still poorly understood. Therefore, we compare in these work linear measurements of body features of Neotropical and Old World linages of Sericini chafers to uncover patterns possibly linked to foraging behavior (day or night activity) or to the success of their diversification in terms of diversity. If diversity in Sericini chafers would be linked to morphological disparity, we would expect in the much less diverse Neotropical lineage a very clear drop of morphological disparity. Comparing the two major sister clades, Old World and Neotropical Sericini, in terms of their disparity and diversity, the here elaborated distance data do not support the hypothesis that morphological disparity could be a driver for the diversity of Sericini in the Old World. The influence of the metacoxal length on morphological disparity appears to represent a possible key for a better understanding of the evolution of Sericini in the Neotropical region (including their lower diversity) and answers the question of why they are so much less diverse than their sister lineage in the Old World. The increasing length of the metacoxal plate appears to be a result of the presence of a secondary metacoxal joint in Old World Sericini, which has a crucial impact on hind leg mobility and digging behavior. General body shape and single morphological characters appear under similar general evolutionary pressure: high morphometric disparity between nocturnal and diurnal Neotropical species was also corroborated by disparity estimated from discrete morphological characters.

AB  - It has been proposed that light-limited lakes are characterized by the constraint of the autotrophic pelagic flux (the green pathway) and by the dominance of the detritus-based heterotrophic flux (the brown pathway). However, studies explicitly testing this assumption are scarce in natural food webs. Here, we estimated energy flux in a dystrophic light-limited shallow lagoon to investigate the importance of green vs. brown energy pathways to fuel the freshwater fish food web. Over the course of 1 year, we estimated the energy flux intake for five fish trophic guilds (detritivores, top carnivores, meso-carnivores, herbivores, and omnivores) monthly. We found a high concentration of energy flux in the detritivore compartment, accounting for > 93% of the total energy flux through the food web. A single detritivore species (Cyphocharax voga) dominated the fish community in terms of biomass stock and number of individuals. There was a substantial increase in the detritivore energy flux during warm months. These results illustrate a remarkable dominance of brown pathways, which support the fish trophic energy flux in this kind of system. The flux magnitude was related to temperature, highlighting the synergy between warming and brown pathways.

AB  - Objective Hemoglobin is the iron-containing protein in the red blood cells of many animals. The primary function of hemoglobin is to transport oxygen from lung to tissues. It is composed of two identical alpha-globin subunits and two identical beta-globin subunits. . Hemoglobin has unique magnetic properties. The paramagnetism of deoxyhemoglobin, and the diamagnetism of oxyhemoglobin and carboxyhaemoglobin have been reported previously. Studies have also shown that external magnetic field affected blood flow rate, but whether magnetic field may affect the oxygenation rate of hemoglobin remains unknown. Here in this study, we are aiming to address this question with recombinant hemoglobin. Human hemoglobin and yak hemoglobin were selected as the research objects, and a recombinant protein expression and purification system was established to explore the magnetic field effects on the oxygenation rate of hemoglobin, as well as the differences in the oxygenation rate between human hemoglobin and yak hemoglobin under external magnetic field. Methods The recombinant expression and purification system of human and yak hemoglobin was established. The recombinant hemoglobin expression was further optimized and appropriated inducing temperature and IPTG concentration were screened. Recombinant human hemoglobin and yak hemoglobin were purified to homogeneity by affinity chromatography and further by size-exclusion chromatography. SDS-PAGE was used to validate the purification, and UV-Vis spectrum and EPR were used to characterize the biochemical properties of recombinant hemoglobin. Deoxyhemoglobin of human and yak were placed under 0.3 T external magnetic field to test the magnetic field effects on oxygenation rate, and geomagnetic field condition was used as a sham control. The UV-Vis spectrum data were measured every 10 min, and the concentration and proportion of oxygenated hemoglobin, deoxyhemoglobin and methemoglobin were calculated to analyze the effects of magnetic field on the oxygenation rate of hemoglobin. The magnetic properties of human oxygenated hemoglobin and human deoxygenated hemoglobin have been measured by SQUID, a superconducting quantum interference magnetic measurement system. Three biological replications were performed for each experiment. The possible mechanism of the effect of magnetic field on the oxygenation rate of hemoglobin has been investigated and discussed. Results Human and yak hemoglobin were successfully expressed and purified by E. coli prokaryotic expression system. The optimal expression temperature was 30degree celsius, degree celsius , and the most suitable IPTG concentration was 1 mmol/L. EPR results suggested that trace amount of methemoglobin existed both in the purified human hemoglobin and yak hemoglobin proteins. The oxygenation rate of yak hemoglobin appeared to be faster than that of human hemoglobin, and the additional magnetic field treatment significantly increased the oxygenation rate of both human and yak hemoglobin, and yak hemoglobin was more sensitive to magnetic field than human hemoglobin. The paramagnetism of deoxyhemoglobin was verified by SQUID measurement. However, the diamagnetism of oxygenated hemoglobin remains uncertain, probably due to the presence of trace amount of methemoglobin in the sample of oxygenated hemoglobin, which was consistent with EPR results. Conclusion In this study, human and yak hemoglobin were successfully expressed and purified. The purified hemoglobin proteins have similar function and conformational states as native protein.
   External static magnetic field facilitates hemoglobin oxygenation, and yak hemoglobin seems more sensitive to magnetic field compared with human hemoglobin. These findings provide theoretical basis for the potential applications of applying magnetic field to improve hypoxia symptoms in clinical practice in the future.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to identify proteins associated with differences in the freezing tolerance of sheep sperm and to analyze their functions. Qualified fresh semen from four breeds of rams, the Australian White, white-head Dorper, Black-head Dorper, and Hu sheep breeds, were selected for cryopreservation. The sperm freezing tolerance was investigated by evaluation of the overall vitality, progressive vitality, and rapidly advance vitality of the sperm. A differential model of sperm freezing tolerance was constructed for sheep breeds showing significant differences. Differentially expressed proteins associated with sperm freezing tolerance were identified using iTRAQ and the protein functions were analyzed. It was found that sperm freezing tolerance was best in Hu sheep and worst in white-head Dorper sheep. These two breeds were used for the construction of a model based on differences in freezing tolerance and the identification of sperm proteins expressed differentially before freezing and after thawing. A total of 128 differentially expressed proteins (88 up-regulated and 40 down-regulated) were identified before freezing and after thawing in Hu sheep sperm (fresh/frozen Hu sheep sperm referred to as HL vs. HF), while 219 differentially expressed proteins (106 up-regulated and 113 down-regulated) were identified in white-head Dorper sheep (fresh/frozen white-head Dorper sheep sperm referred to as WL vs. WF). A comparison of these differentially expressed proteins showed that 57 proteins overlapped between the two breeds while 71 were only expressed in Hu sheep and 162 were only expressed in white-head Dorper sheep. Functional annotation and enrichment analyses of differentially expressed proteins down-regulated in Hu sheep involved in phosphorylation of phosphatidylinositol phosphate kinases, regulation of GTPase activity and glycolysis/gluconeogenesis signaling pathway. Up-regulated proteins of Hu sheep participated in oxidoreductase activity and oxidative phosphorylation process of sperm freezing. Furthermore, down-regulated in white-head Dorper sheep involved in the metabolic regulation of carbohydrate and nuclear sugar metabolism. Up-regulated proteins of white-head Dorper sheep involved in the ferroptosis and oxidative phosphorylation pathways. Collectively, These proteins were found to participate mainly in oxidative phosphorylation as well as phosphorylation and metabolic processes in the mitochondria to affect the freezing tolerance of sheep sperm.

AB  - In theoretical ecology, the quantity of resource consumed by a consumer per unit of time, defined as functional response, is of paramount importance. To better understand species interactions over time it is necessary to analyze whether consumer's functional response depends on resource density alone (which is the reference assumption) or on both resource and consumer densities. There are few field studies that, by varying the resource and consumer densities, provide solid empirical evidence to indicate the most suitable model of functional response in complex systems, such as coral reefs. We performed a field experiment with an herbivorous surgeonfish and their resource, a red seaweed, in a near-pristine reef ecosystem. We measured algal consumption while varying densities of consumers and resources. We fit nine alternative functional response models, which either included or excluded consumer-dependence. The model selection and the parameter estimation indicated that the functional response of the herbivorous surgeonfish depended on the ratio of seaweed to herbivorous fish densities. These results imply that, within a given density, surgeonfish can share resources but individual's consumption rate decrease with higher fish densities. These results also suggest that mutual intraspecific interference exists at herbivorous fish densities generally observed in the field and it should be considered in predicting consumption rates by herbivorous reef fishes. Finally, this study indicates that models incorporating consumer-dependence must be considered for understanding herbivorous fish and algae population dynamics when placed in the context of the most biodiverse ecological communities, such as reef ecosystems.

AB  - Aims Intraspecific variation in plant traits has important consequences for individual fitness and herbivore foraging. For plants, trait variability across spatial dimensions is well documented. However, temporal dimensions of trait variability are less well known, and may be influenced by seasonal differences in growing degree days (GDD), temperature and precipitation. Here, we aim to quantify intraspecific temporal variation in traits and the underlying drivers for four commonly occurring boreal plant species.
   Methods We sampled the elemental and stoichiometric traits (%C, %N, %P, C:N, C:P, N:P) of four common browse species' foliage across 2 years. Using a two-step approach, we first fitted generalized linear models (GzLM, n = 24) to the species' elemental and stoichiometric traits, and tested if they varied across years. When we observed evidence for temporal variability, we fitted a second set of GzLMs (n = 8) with temperature, productivity and moisture as explanatory variables.
   Important Findings We found no evidence of temporal variation for most of the elemental and stoichiometric traits of our four boreal plants, with two exceptions. Year was an important predictor for percent carbon across all four species (R-2 = 0.47-0.67) and for multiple elemental and stoichiometric traits in balsam fir (5/8, R-2 = 0.29-0.67). Thus, variation in percent carbon was related to interannual differences, more so than nitrogen and phosphorus, which are limiting nutrients in the boreal forest. These results also indicate that year may explain more variation in conifers' stoichiometry than for deciduous plants due to life history differences. GDD was the most frequently occurring variable in the second round of models (8/8 times, R-2 = 0.21-0.41), suggesting that temperature is an important driver of temporal variation in these traits.

AB  - Natural history studies documenting spatial and temporal variation of species assemblages and their interactions are critical for understanding biodiversity and community ecology. We characterized caterpillar-parasitoid assemblages on shrubs in the genus Piper across remnants of semi-evergreen forest in the Yucatan Peninsula during the rainy and rainy-dry seasons. We collected caterpillars feeding on Piper leaves and reared them to adults or parasitoids to: (i) describe tritrophic interactions between Piper, caterpillars, and parasitoids, (ii) compare empirical metanetworks among sites and seasons, and (iii) investigate patterns in species and interaction turnover across spatial and temporal scales to understand the contribution of species composition and interaction rewiring to overall interaction turnover. We found six Piper species supporting 79 species of caterpillars, which in turn hosted 20 species of parasitoids. In total, there were 116 realized trophic interactions. Species and interactions exhibited substantial turnover at temporal and spatial scales. Total interaction turnover was more pronounced across seasons in all sites (>93%), than it was between sites (<91%). We also found that interaction rewiring contributed more to overall interaction turnover than species turnover. The spatial and temporal variation in metanetworks documented here contribute to understanding fine-scale temporal and spatial turnover in tropical species and interactions and raise important questions about the lability of consumer specialization and the short-term effects of interaction rewiring on the stability of biotic communities. Our results highlight the importance of tropical food web studies that are based on natural history using consistent field methods to document bi- and tripartite interactions.

AB  - Different theories have been proposed to explain the phenotypic changes observed in island lineages, but it remains unclear if predictable evolutionary trajectories can be identified within island communities. Using a 3D functional space approach, we tested whether insular endemic species tend to evolve towards apparent holes in niche space (expecting niche filling) or tend to become generalists, that is, moving towards the centre of the functional space (expecting niche expansion). We tested these two hypotheses in 378 insular endemic species from 24 islands of 8 archipelagos, including 177 prehistoric anthropogenically extinct species. Analyses were conducted with and without accounting for species size difference. We found that 57% of island endemic species evolved towards more unoccupied regions of the global morphospace (i.e. more distinct body sizes compared to the ones of their ancestors), suggesting a tendency for niche filling. When adjusted traits for body size, we found that half of the endemic species (50%) showed more distinct trait values than their ancestors. Results also revealed that certain dietary niches (terrestrial herbivores and nectarivores) evolved distinct body sizes more frequently. Differences noted between islands and archipelagos suggest that biogeographic factors may influence evolutionary trajectory and interactions between these two hypotheses. Our study confirms that extinct species occupied specific niches that have been left vacant, suggesting that these evolutionary 'oddities' could be more sensitive to extinction. Overall, it calls for a global assessment of the avian functional diversity lost from recent extinctions.Read the free Plain Language Summary for this article on the Journal blog.

   Q fever is one of the important diseases transmissible from animals to humans. The source of infection can be numerous species of animals including mammals, birds, reptiles, amphibians as well as ticks. The role of wildlife in its epidemiology is poorly understood. Therefore, we examined 523 sera samples obtained from European bison for the presence of specific antibodies to assess whether infection occurs in this species and whether European bison may be an important source of infection in the natural environment as suggested by historical reports. The antibodies were found only in one free-living bull, while two other samples were doubtful. The results suggest the transmission of infection to the European bison was rather accidental and its role as an important source of infection nowadays is unlikely.
   Q fever is an important zoonosis caused by the intracellular Gram-negative bacteria Coxiella burnetii. The source of infection are numerous species of mammals, birds, reptiles and amphibians, as well as ticks. The disease is widespread throughout Europe, but the role of wildlife in its epidemiology is poorly understood. The European bison (Bison bonasus) population has been growing European-wide quite dynamically over the last few years. The aim of this study was to determine whether C. burnetii infection occurs in European bison and whether it can be considered an important bacterial reservoir in the natural environment. Five hundred and twenty three samples of European bison sera originating from 14 (out of the 26 existing) Polish populations were examined for the presence of specific antibodies using an ID Screen Q Fever Indirect Multi-species ELISA test. Only one (0.19%) serum sample was positive in ELISA, and two other samples were doubtful. The only seropositive animal found in this study was a free-living bull. It suggests possible transmission from domestic cattle by sharing pastures. The transmission of C. burnetii into the European bison was rather accidental in the country and its role as an important wild reservoir is unlikely. Since no tests are available for wildlife ruminants there is a need for the adaptation of the available tests.

AB  - Yak is a special free-ranging cattle breed in the plateau areas of Qinghai and Tibet. Pasture withering in cold-season pastures results in energy deficiency in yaks, which undermines the rumen epithelial barrier. However, the leading factor causing rumen epithelial injury remains unknown. Glutamine (Gln), a conditionally essential amino acid, is insufficient under pathological conditions. Glucose (GLU) is an important energy source. Thus, we explored the effects of Gln or GLU deprivation on the barrier function of yak rumen epithelial cells and investigated the underlying mechanisms, as well as the differences in rumen epithelial barrier function between Gln deprivation (Gln-D) and GLU deprivation (GLU-D). In previous work, we constructed the yak rumen epithelial cells (YRECs) line by transferring the human telomerase reverse transcriptase gene (hTERT) and simian virus 40 large T antigen (SV40T) into primary YRECs. The YRECs were exposed to normal, Gln-D, GLU-D, and serum replacement (SR) media for 6, 12, and 24 h. Our data displayed that cell viability and tight junction protein expression in the SR group were not significantly changed compared to the normal group. Whereas, compared with the SR group, Gln-D treated for more than 12 h reduced cell viability and proliferation, and GLU-D treated for more than 12 h damaged the cell morphology and reduced cell viability and proliferation. The cell proliferation and cell viability were decreased more in GLU-D than in Gln-D. In addition, Gln-D treated for more than 12 h disrupted YREC cellular partially tight junctions by inducing oxidative stress and inflammation, and GLU-D treated for more than 12 h disrupted YREC cellular tight junctions by inducing apoptosis, oxidative stress, and inflammation. Compared with Gln-D, GLU-D more significantly induced cell injury and reduced tight junction protein levels. Our results provided evidence that GLU-D induced damage through the p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (p38 MAPK)/c-junN-terminal kinase (JNK) signaling pathway, which was more serious than Gln-D treated for more than 12 h.

AB  - Despite containing the largest extent of unfragmented landscape in the Asian elephant (Elephas maximus) range, Myanmar has high levels of human-elephant conflict. The Bago Yoma mountain region of central Myanmar has previously been identified as an elephant conflict hotspot, characterized by high levels of crop-raiding and illegal killing of elephants for the ivory and skin trades. We used non-invasive fecal sampling to evaluate the population structure and demography of wild and captive elephants in the Bago Yoma using microsatellite loci and mitochondrial DNA in combination with crop-raiding status, age, and sex. We were able to collect 252 samples from wild elephants -119 directly following conflict events- and 25 from captive elephants from which we identified 127 unique wild and 21 captive individuals. The population was biased toward subadults, which could be an important contributor to the high rates of conflict, as these individuals may lack the experience to avoid dangerous behaviors. Conflict elephants were primarily male, although both sexes and all ages engaged in crop-raiding, including females with juveniles. We found that elephants that commit solo raids were all male, while larger raiding parties often included both related and unrelated individuals of both sexes. Repeat offenders were common. These wild elephants contained high levels of genetic diversity, differentiated from local captive populations, and valuable for the species' conservation. Overall, the elephants of Bago Yoma, Myanmar have been heavily affected by conflict, and managers could utilize the knowledge presented to aid in the preservation of this population.

AB  - Infectious disease transmission from domestic sheep threatens the persistence of bighorn sheep (Ovis canadensis) populations throughout western North America. Quantifying spatial separation between the 2 species is an essential component in assessing the risk of disease transmission. We present a spatial analysis to evaluate infectious disease risks for endangered Sierra Nevada bighorn sheep (O. c. sierrae; hereafter Sierra bighorn sheep). Our approach accounted for spatial separation between the species as well as the configuration of resources that influences Sierra bighorn sheep movement. We assessed the potential for contact by predicting where Sierra bighorn sheep were likely to be located and travel. We combined a resource selection probability function with a cost distance analysis to quantify the risk of grazing domestic sheep in proximity to Sierra bighorn sheep core home range from a habitat perspective. We compared our approach to a standard buffer approach and determined that our cost distance model better quantified how risk varied among grazing parcels. Sierra bighorn sheep selected and traveled within habitat that included escape terrain. Our model, which included a log normal transformation, characterized the high relative cost (i.e., reduced likelihood) to traveling beyond selected habitat and predicted that such movement is less likely. As a result, our habitat-based risk threshold was 48% smaller in area than the standard buffer area that included landscape that bighorn did not use. Our method establishes a risk threshold that can be used by land managers to optimize public and private grazing regimes and minimize the risk of disease transmission.

AB  - In the last three decades, we assisted in a shift in the dairy product preferences in developed countries, with an increase in goat-derived products consumption. As already seen in the bovine sector, the diffusion of goat milk consumption has led to an abandonment of the local breeds in favor of the more productive cosmopolitan breeds, with an intense reduction in the livestock biodiversity. However, in several studies, it has been shown that local breeds present unique features such as a robust behavior towards the local climate and a high quality of their dairy products. This study aims to assess the differences between the basic lactation variables (milk yield, fat %, protein %, lactose % and somatic cell count) in the Alpine goat and the local breed Verzasca goat from a Bayesian point of observation. Results indicate that the Nera di Verzasca goat has overall lactation characteristics similar toa cosmopolite breed such as the Alpine goat, except for the milk daily yield reduced with respect to Alpine goats (1.68 +/- 0.84 and 2.14 +/- 1.03, respectively). Moreover, the Verzasca goat showed a tendency to maintain a lower level of somatic cell count along with lactation (798 +/- 1734 and 1216 +/- 2828, respectively). These findings help to increase the knowledge about the Italian local goat breeds and are important in the optic of biodiversity conservation.

AB  - Climate-driven geographic range shifts have been associated with transitions between dietary specialism and generalism at range margins. The mechanisms underpinning these often transient niche breadth modifications are poorly known, but utilization of novel resources likely depends on phenological synchrony between the consumer and resource. We use a climate-driven range and host shift by the butterfly Aricia agestis to test how climate-driven changes in host phenology and condition affect phenological synchrony, and consider implications for host use. Our data suggest that the perennial plant that was the primary host before range expansion is a more reliable resource than the annual Geraniaceae upon which the butterfly has become specialized in newly colonized parts of its range. In particular, climate-driven phenological variation in the novel host Geranium dissectum generates a narrow and variable 'window of opportunity' for larval productivity in summer. Therefore, although climatic change may allow species to shift hosts and colonise novel environments, specialization on phenologically limited hosts may not persist at ecological margins as climate change continues. We highlight the potential role for phenological (a)synchrony in determining lability of consumer-resource associations at range margins and the importance of considering causes of synchrony in biotic interactions when predicting range shifts. This article is part of the theme issue 'Species' ranges in the face of changing environments (Part II)'.

AB  - Antlers are unique structures because they grow rapidly and are cast annually, representing an important energetic and mineral cost for deer. Variables related to the timing of antler growth, such as date of antler casting and length of growth period, therefore, should be affected by somatic resources and availability of food. We examined the effects of body and antler weight, age, and climatic variables, on antler casting date and the period of time antlers were grown as well as possible random effects of individual, year, cohort, and pedigree, based on 244 antlers in a population of 109 males of Iberian red deer (Cervus elaphus) over a 17-year study from 1999 to 2016. Body weight affected casting date, with heavier males casting antlers earlier than lighter males. Antlers also grew faster and were cast earlier among older males than young males. Antler weight influenced casting date and the duration of the growth period: males with heavier antlers cast them earlier and grow them faster than males with light antlers. Nevertheless, age and antler weight interacted; as such, older males grew their antlers slower and delay casting date because they produce heavier antlers, in contrast to younger males, where those with the heaviest antlers grow them faster and cast first. The date of the end of antler growth also influenced casting date, so that antlers that took the longest to develop were cast later than those that finished growing early. We conclude that older and heavier males cast their antlers earlier and grow them faster than younger and lighter males, likely to correlate the subsequent antler growth with the spring peak in plant nutrients, but that this early development is limited physiologically by the size of the antlers.

AB  - Human activities, including the movement of harvested cervids, pose significant risks for spreading chronic wasting disease (CWD) to new locations. This study used hierarchical agglomerative clustering to compare Minnesota, USA hunters' carcass disposal habits and likelihood of CWD testing as a function of individual differences in risk perceptions and hunting area. We utilized a survey of Minnesota hunters conducted during Spring 2020 that included a random sample of individuals that hunt statewide and in a local disease management zone (N = 5,000, response rate = 33%). We did not detect a significant difference in disposal behaviors as a function of CWD risk perceptions, but rather because of increased accessibility of low-risk disposal methods. Conversely, we found perceived likelihood of conducting CWD testing was positively associated with perceptions of risk. These findings have implications for vector tracing for future CWD outbreaks and highlight the benefit of understanding constituent habits and regulation compliance in disease management.

AB  - Rangelands of Tunisia show a great indigenous species diversity with considerable potential as forage for livestock. However, information on their fodder yield and quality is scanty and restricted to few species. The objective of the study was to evaluate the nutritive values of selected key perennial species based on their biomass yield, chemical composition, in vitro organic matter digestibility (IVOMD), and mineral composition. The species evaluated included four grass species (Stipa lagascae Roem. and Schult., Stipa tenacissima L., Stipagrostis plumosa (L.) Munro ex T. Anderson, and Stipagrostis pungens (Desf.) de Winter.) and eight shrub species (Anthyllis henoniana Coss. ex Batt., Argyrolobium uniflorum (Deene.) Jaub. and Spach., Echiochilon fruticosum Desf., Gymnocarpos decander Forssk., Helianthemum kahiricum Delile., Helianthemum lippii (L.) Dum. Cours., Plantago albicans L. and Rhanterium suaveolens Desf.). Results showed that shrub species contained higher concentrations of the crude protein (CP), acid detergent lignin (ADL), but lower neutral detergent fiber (aNDFom) and acid detergent fiber (ADFom) concentrations than grasses. The greatest concentration of CP was 135 g/kg DM for R. suaveolens. The greatest aNDFom concentration was found within the grasses with maximum of 744.5 g/kg DM in S. plumosa. The shrub species E. fruticosum, A. uniflorum, P. albicans, G. decander, R. suaveolens, and A. henoniana had the highest IVOMD with over 500 g/kg DM and have the potential to supply energy to livestock. Overall, the moderate to high protein, low fiber, and high in vitro digestibility measured for shrubs, suggest they have high nutritional values and can be used to enhance local livestock production.</p>

   Genetic characterization is one of the tools to assess the genetic diversity of livestock breeds towards the goals of conservation and sustainable use. This research aimed to assess the genetic diversity, population, genetic relationship, and structure of the Malaysian indigenous Katjang goat breed, which has been reported to be at risk of extinction by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO). Through assessment from microsatellite DNA markers, this breed was found to have low genetic diversity and showed evidence of high inbreeding. This breed might also have undergone population bottlenecks in the past. Through combined data analysis with other breeds and populations, available through data from published research, the Katjang goat population was found to have interconnection and form the centre of the network; it was also found to be the centroid of the multidimensional scaling plot. The findings of this research help in the understanding of the current genetic diversity of this breed and the need for its conservation.
   The Katjang goat is the only indigenous domestic goat breed in Malaysia. Following a national baseline survey from 2001 to 2002, this breed was reported to the FAO as being at risk of extinction. In this study, 36 microsatellite markers were screened, and 25 polymorphic markers were used to analyze the genetic structure of the Katjang goat breed in Peninsular Malaysia. A sample set of data derived from another 10 populations from three published research studies was used as an outgroup for an inter-population genetic study. The analysis showed that the mean value of the observed heterozygosity was 0.29 +/- 0.14, and the expected heterozygosity was 0.72 +/- 0.14, which indicated low genetic diversity. The inbreeding coefficient, F-IS, was high, at 0.46. Significant (p < 0.01) deviations from the Hardy Weinberg equilibrium were noted for all loci. The bottleneck analysis using the Wilcoxon Rank test under the two-phase model of mutation was significant (p < 0.01) for heterozygosity excess, which suggested that the Katjang breed had undergone significant population reduction in the past. Through combined analysis of data from publicly available research, almost the entire population of Katjang goats represent the centroid and are grouped together on a multidimensional scaling plot, except for the Terengganu population. Network analysis revealed that the goat population from Pahang formed the centrality of the network.

AB  - Prey adjust their antipredator behavioral tactics to minimize the risk of an encounter with predators. Spatiotemporal responses of prey to predators have been reported, but the nature of antipredator response is not ubiquitous and it is the object of increasing interest, especially considering the recent recovery of large carnivores in Europe, and the potential for behavioral antipredator responses to elicit consequences at the ecosystem level. We have tested multiple antipredator responses by fallow deer Dama dama to wolf Canis lupus in a Mediterranean protected area recently recolonized by this apex predator. Through intensive camera trapping, we tested for temporal and spatial association between predator and prey, and we have also studied deer vigilance in forest habitats where focal observations are usually impossible. Wolf detection rates were spatially associated with those of fallow deer. Accordingly, no evidence was found for fallow deer avoiding sites with higher predator detection rates. Temporal activity patterns were significantly different between the 2 species, with the wolf being mainly nocturnal whereas fallow deer was active especially during daylight. A comparison with a preliminary study strongly suggests an increase in the diurnal activity of fallow deer along with the stabilization of wolf presence in the area. Both the rate and the duration of vigilance of female fallow deer increased with the local frequency of wolf activity. We suggest an antipredator response based on temporal-rather than spatial-avoidance, as well as increased vigilance.

AB  - Two consecutive feeding trials were conducted to evaluate the effects of Bacillus subtilis LCBS1 supplementation and substituting fish meal (FM) with fermented soybean meal (FSM) in terms of growth performance, feed digestibility, intestinal morphology, and microbial composition of bullfrogs. In trial 1, bullfrogs received either a soybean meal (SM)-based basal diet (control check, CK group) or probiotic diet (basal diet was supplemented with 1 x 107 CFU/g of B. subtilis LCBS1, BS group). Each diet was fed to three replicates of bullfrogs (29.61 +/- 0.07 g) for 58 days. Evaluation of B. subtilis LCBS1 FSM as a FM replacer in bullfrog diet was conducted in trial 2. A diet containing 20% FM formed the basal diet, and 60% and 100% of the FM was replaced with SM or FSM (FM, SM60, FSM60, SM100, and FSM100 diets). Each diet was fed to three replicates of bullfrogs (23.3 +/- 0.3 g) for 63 days. As a result, in trial 1, BS treatments significantly increased weight gain (WG) and whole-body protein deposition. Significant improvements in villus height (VH), muscularis thickness (MT), and digestibilities of dry matter (DM), crude protein (CP) and phosphorus (P) were observed in the BS group compared with the control group. Probiotic supplementation resulted in elevated IL-4 and IL-10 expression and decreased TNF-alpha and IL-17 expression. A remarkable decrease in serum D-lactate concentration and diamine oxidase activity was detected in the BS group. Proteobacteria, Fusobacteria, and Firmicutes were the three most abundant bacterial phyla in each group, while Enterobacter and Bacillus were the most abundant genera in the CK and BS groups, respectively. In trial 2, compared with bullfrogs that received the SM diets, bullfrogs fed either the FM or FSM diets showed greater WG, feed efficiency, hind leg index, whole-body CP content, and digestibilities of DM, CP, calcium, P, and phytate P, and increased VH, villus thickness, and MT. Serum urea nitrogen and ammonia concentrations were significantly higher in the SM group than the FM or FSM group. Overall, dietary B. subtilis LCBS1 supplementation improved growth and digestion in bullfrogs and attenuated the intestinal structural damage and microflora dysbacteriosis caused by SM-based diets. Substituting 60-100% of FM with SM impaired the growth performance, digestion ability, and jejunal morphology of bullfrogs, while replacing equivalent FM with FSM effectively ameliorated these traits.

AB  - Sympatric species that are ecologically similar must either segregate through habitat disassociation or engage in biotic interactions with one another. Mule (Odocoileus hemionus) and white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) are similar ungulate species that are distributed across North America in both areas of sympatry and allopatry. Over many decades, white-tailed deer have been expanding their range into areas historically used allopatrically by mule deer, potentially leading to increased interactions between the species. However, the degree to which the two species segregate spatio-temporally or engage in agonistic interactions is yet unclear. Therefore, to compare their realized habitat niches in an area of sympatry, we determined presence and absence of both deer species at 312 camera traps during the summers of 2018-2019 across a range of elevations and habitats in the Colville National Forest (CNF) in northeastern Washington. We compared characteristics of habitats used by the two species using single-species occupancy models and found that topography was the strongest predictor of differing habitat use. Mule deer were more likely to occupy steep slopes and higher elevations and white-tailed deer more likely to occupy shallower slopes and lower elevations. Using conditional, two-species occupancy modeling, we found that after accounting for differences in habitat selection between the species, mule and white-tailed deer occurred independently of one another in the CNF during summer. We found no evidence for temporal segregation, with similar to 90% overlap in daily activity patterns and similar elapsed time between subsequent intra- and interspecies detections at the 21% of camera sites where both species were detected. Niche segregation along topographic gradients in our study system likely reduces the potential for current interspecies interactions, positive or negative, to occur in this system. However, we did not find any evidence of ongoing spatio-temporal avoidance, even in areas of the landscape where both species were detected (e.g., sharing habitat). Therefore, although our observational study cannot rule out that contemporaneous habitat segregation is evidence of past competitive interactions between the species, our research does not strongly support the contention that agonistic interactions are currently occurring between mule and white-tailed deer.

AB  - Lake ecosystems on the Tibetan Plateau (TP) are highly susceptible to external input owing to their fragile environment. However, less study has been done to focus the direct influences of anthropogenic activities on the lake sediments by human activities. In this study, we performed the first large-scale investigation to use the fecal stanol proxies in lake surface sediments to assess the impact of human and herbivorous feces on TP lakes. The 75 investigated lakes were divided into three types (I, II, and III) according to cluster analysis of the fecal stanol ratios R1 ' and R2 '. Fecal stanols in type I lake surface sediments originate from a mixture of herbivorous and human feces; fecal stanols in type II lake surface sediments primarily originate from herbivorous feces with minimal human feces. In contrast, fecal stanols in type III lake surface sediments are mainly derived from herbivorous feces (coprostanol concentration > 100 ng/g), a mixed source of herbivorous feces and cholesterol reduction (coprostanol concentration of 10-100 ng/g), and in situ reduction of cholesterol (coprostanol concentration < 10 ng/g). Among the TP lakes investigated, 9 % had significant fecal contamination, 48 % had moderate or slight fecal contamination, and 43 % were uncontaminated. Domestic animal feces were the main source of fecal stanols in the surface sediments of moderately and slightly contaminated lakes in the central TP. There were 9 % of investigated lakes with significant fecal contamination from human and herbivorous feces; in contrast, 52 % of investigated lakes did not definitely show the presence of human fecal matter. This study has important implications for fecal contamination assessment in lake ecosystems and provides a reference for early herbivorous change and paleo-human activity research.

AB  - The wild camel (Camelus ferus) is a critically endangered species found in extremely arid environments of Central Asia. The wild camel population and its distribution areas have decreased significantly since the middle of the 19th century. The species is now restricted to four isolated habitats in China and Mongolia, and more than 20 years have passed since the most recent surveys of its status and distribution. In an effort to get more current information, we conducted ground surveys, coupled with ad-libitum interviews of local residents, in the geographic range of wild camels in China from 2011 to 2013. We aim to present the most up to date status and distribution of wild camels and provide effective management and conservation strategies. We identified three subpopulations (Taklimakan Desert, Kumtagh Desert, border area of China and Mongolia). The wild camel population in the Kumtagh Desert was found to be stable and relatively dense, likely due to large areas of protected habitat. Camel presence in the Taklimakan Desert was further south than previously reported, indicating an expansion or range shift in distribution that may have been driven by high levels of anthropogenic disturbance. No signs of camels were found in the border area, likely due to a substantial border fence that impedes animal movement. Protected areas appear to work at improving camel populations and will be imperative for their persistence across their currently known range. Continued monitoring is needed to deduce camel movement, and connectivity between China and Mongolia improved. We also recommend surveys in the very near future to determine how populations may have changed since the surveys presented herein were undertaken.

AB  - Although wild boar invasion is a common human-wildlife conflict worldwide, it is difficult to solve. Understanding the characteristics of wild boar invasion into farmland, accurately predicting the areas where wild boar invasions will occur, and implementing effective prevention and control measures are key to effectively alleviating conflicts between humans and wild boars. From 2021 to 2023, we conducted field surveys and experimentally determined the effectiveness of prevention and control measures in the Huanan and Tonghe Counties in order to explore the landscape and farmland factors affecting wild boar invasion, as well as to evaluate the effectiveness of different combinations of prevention and control measures. The results indicate that the mean patch area, patch area coefficient of variation, and forest type edge density show positive linear correlations with the invaded area, which is positively associated with the presence of ditches and negatively correlated with the existence of electronic fences. Meanwhile, there are non-linear relationships between invasion and the edge density of farmland type, the proportion of forests, the Shannon uniformity index, the proportion of residential areas, the distance from the village, the distance from the forest, and the population density. In particular, the risk of wild boar invasion is higher in the border area between forest and farmland. The loss rate of farmland under the different control measures (compound) was significantly lower than that in the electronic fence group (single) (p < 0.05). Based on these findings, we put forward the following suggestions for the prevention and control of wild boar: (1) widen and deepen the narrow landscape elements around farmland; (2) focus on the border area between forest and farmland; and (3) use compound prevention and control measures. This study provides a comprehensive foundation for future wild boar prevention and control research, and it contributes to the formulation of effective wild boar prevention and control policies worldwide.

AB  - Over the last 40 years the gray wolf (Canis lupus) re-colonized its historical range in Italy increasing human-predator interactions. However, temporal and spatial trends in wolf mortality, including direct and indirect persecution, were never summarized. This study aims to fill this gap by focusing on the situation of Tuscany and Emilia-Romagna regions, hosting a significant proportion of the Italian wolf population, by: (i) identifying the prevalent causes of wolf mortality, (ii) summarizing their temporal and spatial patterns and (iii) applying spatially-explicit Generalized Linear Models to predict wolf persecution. Between October 2005 and February 2021, 212 wolf carcasses were collected and subjected to necropsy, being involved in collisions with vehicles (n = 104), poisoned (n = 45), wounded with gunshot (n = 24) or blunt objects (n = 4) and being hanged (n = 2). The proportion of illegally killed wolves did not increase through time. Most persecution events occurred between October and February. None of our candidate models outperformed a null model and covariates such as the density of sheep farms, number of predations on livestock, or human density were never associated to the probability of having illegally killed wolves, at the municipal scale. Our findings show that conventional correlates of wolf persecution, combined with a supposedly high proportion of non-retrieved carcasses, fail to predict illegal wolf killings in areas where the species have become ubiquitous. The widespread spatial distribution of illegal killings indicates that persecution probably arises from multiple kinds of conflicts with humans, beyond those with husbandry. Wolf conservation in Italy should thus address cryptic wolf killings with multi-disciplinary approaches, such as shared national protocols, socio ecological studies, the support of experts' experience and effective sampling schemes for the detection of carcasses.

AB  - Intercropping faba bean with vegetables provides a possibility to promote pest control and better nutrient cycling in sustainable agriculture. Faba bean produces extrafloral nectar which supports parasitoid wasps that play a role in the biological control of pest insects. However, adult lepidopteran pests also benefit from nectar, increasing their lifespan and the number of offspring they produce. Here, a laboratory-based study was conducted to assess the role of faba bean on the components of a Brassica-based host-parasitoid system. We measured how access to faba bean affected the longevity and fecundity of the brassica pest Plutella xylostella and its parasitoid Cotesia vestalis. It was also studied if odors of flowering faba bean disrupt host finding by C. vestalis in Y-tube bioassays and volatile organic compounds were analyzed to explain the olfaction-based choices made by the parasitoids. The longevity of C. vestalis was 6.6 times longer and the number of pupae produced almost 10 times greater when they had access to faba bean. Meanwhile, the longevity of P. xylostella was 3.6 times longer and it laid 4.6 times more eggs when provided access to faba bean. In Y-tube bioassays, C. vestalis females also oriented toward host-related odors of the damaged cabbage more than intact cabbage when odors of faba bean were mixed with both of them. In conclusion, faba bean provided sustenance to both pest insects and their natural enemies that prolonged their lifespans and their reproductive capacity.

AB  - Plant interactions with abiotic and biotic environments are mediated by diverse metabolites, which are crucial for stress response and defense. These metabolites can not only support diversity by shaping species niche differences but also display heritable and plastic intraspecific variation, which few studies have quantified in terms of their relative contributions. To address this shortcoming, we used untargeted metabolomics to annotate and quantify foliar metabolites and restriction-site associated DNA (RAD) sequencing to assess genetic distances among 300 individuals of 10 locally abundant species from a diverse tropical community in Southwest China. We quantified the relative contributions of relatedness and the abiotic and biotic environment to intraspecific metabolite variation, considering different biosynthetic pathways. Intraspecific variation contributed most to community-level metabolite diversity, followed by species-level variation. Biotic factors had the largest effect on total and secondary metabolites, while abiotic factors strongly influenced primary metabolites, particularly carbohydrates. The relative importance of these factors varied widely across different biosynthetic pathways and different species. Our findings highlight that intraspecific variation is an essential component of community-level metabolite diversity. Furthermore, species rely on distinct classes of metabolites to adapt to environmental pressures, with genetic, abiotic, and biotic factors playing pathway-specific roles in driving intraspecific variation.

AB  - The agile wallaby (Notamacropus agilis) is one of the most abundant marsupial species in northern Queensland and a competent host for the zoonotic Ross River virus. Despite their increased proximity and interactions with humans, little is known about the viruses carried by these animals, and whether any are of conservation or zoonotic importance. Metagenomics and molecular techniques were used in a complementary manner to identify and characterize novel viruses in the fecal samples of free-ranging agile wallabies. We detected a variety of novel marsupial-related viral species including agile wallaby atadenovirus 1, agile wallaby chaphamaparvovirus 1-2, agile wallaby polyomavirus 1-2, agile wallaby associated picobirnavirus 1-9, and a known macropod gammaherpesvirus 3. Phylogenetic analyses indicate that most of these novel viruses would have co-evolved with their hosts (agile wallabies). Additionally, non-marsupial viruses that infect bacteria (phages), plants, insects, and other eukaryotes were identified. This study highlighted the utility of non-invasive sampling as well as the integration of broad-based molecular assays (consensus PCR and next generation sequencing) for monitoring the emergence of potential pathogenic viruses in wildlife species. Furthermore, the novel marsupial viruses identified in this study will enrich the diversity of knowledge about marsupial viruses, and may be useful for developing diagnostics and vaccines.

AB  - Predator-prey interactions are ubiquitous and powerful forces that structure ecological communities.(1-3) Habitat complexity has been shown to be particularly important in regulating the strength of predator-prey interactions.(4-6) While it is well established that changes in habitat structure can alter the efficacy of predatory and anti-predatory behaviors,(7-9) little is known about the consequences of engineering activity by prey species who modify the external environment to reduce their own predation risk. Using field surveys and manipulative experiments, we evaluated how habitat modification by Brandt's voles (Lasiopodomys brandtii) influences predation risk from a principal avian predator (shrike; Lanius spp.) in a steppe grassland, located in Inner Mongolia, China. We found that voles actively modify habitat structure by cutting down a large, unpalatable bunchgrass species (Achnatherum splendens) in the presence of shrikes, a behavior that disappeared when these avian predators were excluded experimentally. The damage activities of these voless dramatically decreased the volume of unpalatable grasses, which in turn reduced visitations by shrikes and thus mortality rates. Our study shows that herbivorous prey that act as ecosystem engineers can directly reduce their own predation risk by modifying habitat structure. Given the ubiquity of predation risks faced by consumers, and the likely ability of many consumers to alter the habitat structure in which they live, the interplay between predation risk and ecosystem engineering may be an important but unappreciated mechanism at play in natural communities.

AB  - Manure application and mineralization are important for soil fertility and crop productivity. This study aimed to estimate the mineralization of soil organic carbon (SOC) and nitrogen (N) following different types of manure applications in two soil textures, and to assess the response of soil microbial biomass and extracellular enzymes to SOC and N mineralization. This study involved a 100-day incubation period with the following treatments: i) no fertilization control (CK), ii) farm manure (FM), iii) poultry manure (PM), iv) sheep manure (SM), and v) compost manure (CM). Sheep manure amendment showed significantly higher SOC content and N mineralization potential in both soil textures, resulting in enhanced soil fertility and conservation of indigenous carbon. In comparison with CK, soil microbial biomass and extracellular enzyme activities were also higher in both soil textures but depicted greater microbial activities in clay loam soil than in sandy loam soil. Soil microbial biomass carbon and N, and extracellular enzymes (beta-glucosidase, chitinase, and leucine aminopeptidase) were positively correlated with SOC and N mineralization. SOC and N mineralization patterns, soil microbial biomass, and enzymes activities varied among the treatments as SM > PM > FM > CM > CK. Clay loam soil exhibited significantly higher levels of microbial activity and SOC and N mineralization than sandy loam soil, indicating a higher carbon pool and nutrient availability. These findings suggest that the mineralization patterns of different manures can be used to optimize nutrient availability in soils according to different textures.

AB  - Elephant habitats were mainly found in the dense forest regions which is the tropical evergreen forest in Sonitpur District, Assam. The total area of Sonitpur District is approximately 5204 km2. Satellite imagery from 1990, 2009, and 2017 was investigated. The current research aims to investigate the huge amount of deforestation that occurred from 1990 to 2017 in the Sonitpur district using a temporal satellite imagery system. The visual data interpretation and change matrix analysis using three-period imagery indicated significant corridor loss and deforestation between 1990 and 2017. The study indicates that a massive number of land-use changes would be occurring within the next few years. So, to protect elephants and forests, agricultural land should be converted into natural forests and anthropogenic activities should be stopped in the corridors and buffer areas. Local communities and governments should take various steps to do so and Government should take legal steps against elephant killing. This research focuses on the conservation problems associated with the corridor's decrease over time. The findings also indicated the advanced capabilities of GIS and remote sensing for monitoring and analyzing corridor status.

AB  - The possibility of applying a non-invasive method of stress assessment in the Wild boar (Sus scrofa L., 1758) based on the overall concentrations of immunoreactive substances bound by antibodies to cortisol (C-IRS) in animal feces was investigated using the ELISA test system "Cortisol" ("Khema", Russia). A physiological validation of the method showed that the measurements taken from the animal feces reflected the hormone-producing function and secretory activity of the adrenal cortex. Two samples of feces from wild boars living in semi-free conditions in the Republic of Karelia (LLC "Hunting Farm Chyornye Kamni", Sortavala District) with high (n = 14) and low (n = 11) levels of stress factor exposure were compared. Fecal samples were collected at feeding sites in two enclosures for semi-free animal keeping. At the time of the study, repairs were being conducted in the first enclosure, and traces of predators (wolves) were found. Additionally, the long-term average density of wild boars in the first enclosure was significantly higher than in the second (14.1 and 1.57 individuals/km(2), respectively). Wild boars from the first enclosure showed higher concentrations of C-IRS in their feces compared to those from the second, indicating a higher level of stress among the wild boars in the first enclosure. Potential causes of anxiety for the animals may include high population density, the presence of predators, and anthropogenic influences (repair work, vehicle traffic). The results of the study demonstrated that analyzing the C-IRS concentrations in the feces of wild boars is suitable as a non-invasive method for animal stress assessment and can be used in monitoring studies of wild boar populations.

AB  - Background and Aims Anthropogenic disturbances are causing a co-occurring increase in biotic (ungulate herbivory) and abiotic (drought) stressors, threatening plant reproduction in oak-dominated ecosystems. However, could herbivory compensate for the adverse impact of drought by reducing evapotranspiration? Thus, we investigated the isolated and joint effects of herbivory and drought on oak seedlings of two contrasting Mediterranean species that differ in leaf habit and drought resistance.Methods California oak seedlings from the evergreen, and more drought-resistant, Quercus agrifolia and the deciduous Q. lobata (n = 387) were assigned to a fully crossed factorial design with herbivory and drought as stress factors. Seedlings were assigned in a glasshouse to three to four clipping levels simulating herbivory and three to four watering levels, depending on the species. We measured survival, growth and leaf attributes (chlorophyll, secondary metabolites, leaf area and weight) once a month (May-September) and harvested above- and below-ground biomass at the end of the growing season.Key Results For both oak species, simulated herbivory enhanced seedling survival during severe drought or delayed its adverse effects, probably due to reduced transpiration resulting from herbivory-induced leaf area reduction and compensatory root growth. Seedlings from the deciduous, and less drought-resistant species benefited from herbivory at lower levels of water stress, suggesting different response across species. We also found complex interactions between herbivory and drought on their impact on leaf attributes. In contrast to chlorophyll content which was not affected by herbivory, anthocyanins increased with herbivory - although water stress reduced differences in anthocyanins due to herbivory.Conclusions Herbivory seems to allow Mediterranean oak seedlings to withstand summer drought, potentially alleviating a key bottleneck in the oak recruitment process. Our study highlights the need to consider ontogenetic stages and species-specific traits in understanding complex relationships between herbivory and drought stressors for the persistence and restoration of multi-species oak savannas.

AB  - Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) enhance nutrient provision in exchange for carbon. However, a shift from nutrient to carbon limitation, induced by repeated or intense defoliation, can represent a trade-off between plant regrowth and the maintenance of mycorrhiza. The combined effects of AMF, phosphorus and defoliation on growth of Agropyron elongatum (C-3 grass, low mycorrhizal responsiveness) and Brachiaria brizantha (C-4 grass, high mycorrhizal responsiveness) were explored. Each species was subjected to a manipulative experiment with AMF inoculation (non-inoculated, inoculated), soluble P supply (low, high) and defoliation (non-defoliated, 60% defoliated). In A. elongatum, at low P supply, mycorrhizal plants showed increased growth rates following defoliation without substantial changes in AMF colonization. At high P supply instead, we found a clear trade-off between regrowth and the maintenance of mycorrhiza evidenced by growth depression (biomass and tillers) and lower AMF activity (reduction of arbuscules). In contrast, in B. brizantha, defoliation effects on plant regrowth were independent from AMF at any P supply (no trade-off). This indicates that cost-benefit relationship in defoliated plants is highly context-dependent and may vary with mycorrhizal responsiveness of species. This variation of responses can play a decisive role on plant recovery in pastures and natural grasslands subjected to herbivory. (C) 2021 Elsevier Ltd and British Mycological Society.

AB  - Pelibuey sheep exhibit reproductive activity through the year, but warm weather lowers their fertility and demonstrates physiological limitations of environmental heat stress. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with heat stress tolerance in sheep have been reported previously. The objective was to validate the association of seven thermo-tolerance SNP markers with reproductive and physiological traits in Pelibuey ewes raised in a semiarid region. Pelibuey ewes were assigned to a cool (January 1st.- March 31st.; n = 101) or warm (April 1st.- August 31st.; n = 104) experimental group. All ewes were exposed to fertile rams and assessed for pregnancy diagnosis 90 days later; lambing day was reported at birth. These data served to calculate the reproductive traits of services per conception, prolificacy, days to estrus, days to conception, conception rate and lambing rate. Rectal temperature, rump/leg skin temperature and respiratory rate were measured and reported as physiological traits. Blood samples were collected and processed to extract DNA, which was genotyped using the TaqMan allelic discrimination method and qPCR. A mixed effects statistical model was used to validate associations between SNP genotypes and phenotypic traits. The SNPs rs421873172, rs417581105 and rs407804467 were confirmed as markers associated with reproductive and physiological traits (P < 0.05), and these SNPs were in the genes PAM, STAT1 and FBXO11, respectively. Interestingly, these SNP markers resulted as predictors for the evaluated traits but only in ewes from the warm group, which indicated their association with heat-stress tolerance. An additive SNP effect was confirmed with the highest contribution (P < 0.01) of the SNP rs417581105 for the evaluated traits. Reproductive performance improved (P < 0.05) and physiological parameters decreased in ewes carrying favorable SNP genotypes. In conclusion, three thermo-tolerance SNP markers were associated with improved reproductive and physiological traits in a prospective population of heat-stressed ewes raised in a semiarid environment.

AB  - Brown bears Ursus arctos consume a wide range of organisms, including ungulates and plants, but Pacific salmon Oncorhynchus spp. are especially important to their diet where their ranges overlap. Although some brown bears minimize antagonistic encounters with other brown bears or infanticide by avoiding streams where salmon spawn, studies generally assume that brown bears with ready access to salmon feed heavily on them. To test this assumption, and the hypothesis that male brown bears would feed more heavily on salmon than females (owing to their sexual size dimorphism), we collected hair samples from brown bears by using barbed wire placed on six small tributaries of Lake Aleknagik, Alaska, USA, where adult Sockeye Salmon Oncorhynchus nerka are readily accessible and frequently consumed by brown bears. Analysis of DNA distinguished among the different brown bears leaving the hair samples, some of which were sampled multiple times within and among years. We assessed the contribution of salmon to the diet of individual brown bears by using carbon and nitrogen stable isotope signatures. The 77 samples analyzed from 31 different bears over 4 y showed isotopic ratios consistent with reliance on salmon, but the wide range of isotopic signatures included values suggesting variable, and in one case considerable, use of terrestrial resources. Stable isotope signatures did not differ between male and female brown bears, nor did they differ between two sides of the lake, despite marked differences in Sockeye Salmon density. We collected the hair samples when salmon were present, so there was some uncertainty regarding whether they reflected feeding during the current or previous season. Notwithstanding this caveat, the results are consistent with the hypothesis that salmon were sufficiently available to provide food for the brown bears and that the considerable isotopic variation among brown bears with access to salmon reflected their age, status, and behavior.

AB  - Global changes, particularly rising temperatures, threaten food security in smallholder mountain communities by impacting the suitability of cultivation areas for many crops. Land-use intensification, associated with agrochemical use and tillage, threatens soil health and overall agroecosystem resilience. In the Andean region, farmers often cultivate crops at multiple elevations. Warming climates have led to a shift in cultivation upslope, but this is not feasible in many areas. Traditional soil fertility management practices together with a focus on traditional (orphan) crops offers promise to cope with rapid climate warming in the region. To understand the impacts of warming and changing nutrient management, we established two side-by-side experiments using the traditional Andean crops Oxalis tuberosa (Oca) and Lupinus mutabilis (Tarwi) at three elevations, each with two fertility treatments (organic and synthetic). Soil and climate data (i.e., temperature and precipitation) were collected throughout the growing season, and crop performance was evaluated through impacts on yield and other growth metrics (e.g., biomass, pest incidence). We used two-way ANOVA to assess the influence of site (elevation) and management type (organic vs. synthetic) on crop performance. Results indicated that warmer climates (i.e., lowest elevation) negatively impact the production and performance of O. tuberosa, but that organic fertilization (sheep manure) can help maintain crop yield and biomass production in warmer conditions relatively to synthetic nutrient inputs. In contrast, L. mutabilis showed accelerated growth in warmer conditions, but grain yield and biomass production were not significantly affected by site and showed no interaction with nutrient management. Our findings highlight that climate warming represents a serious threat to small-scale crop production in the Peruvian Andes and could cause severe declines in the production of locally important crops. Additionally, the continued reliance on traditional crops with organic inputs, instead of synthetic fertilizers, may help support agricultural productivity and resilience under climate change.

AB  - Distant hybridization is an important breeding method in aquaculture. However, hybrid escape is frequent in aquaculture and may have a negative impact on indigenous species. In addition to reducing the fertility of hy-brids, inhibiting their wild viability can also play a role in avoiding the ecological risk of escaped hybrids. Postzygotic ecological isolation refers to the phenomenon of reduced adaptation of hybrids in the parent envi-ronment (wild), such as the incompatibility between their phenotypes and their behavior or food resources, which suggests that differences in parental feeding habits may also weaken the adaptability of the hybrids in the wild. In this study, we compared external and skeletal traits related to feeding habits in carnivorous Percocypris pingi (PP), herbivorous Schizothorax wangchiachii (SW), their F1 hybrids (PS), and omnivorous S. davidi (SD). Then, we selected fish, shrimp, chironomid larvae, and periphytic algae as food resources corresponding to different ecological niches and carried out a short-term single-food feeding experiment (sufficient food) under monoculture and a 60-day mixed-food feeding experiment (limited food) under polyculture. We found that PS and SD had similar traits, which were intermediate between those of PP and SW. In the single-food experiment, PS and SD had no significant difference in the foraging level of the four food resources, and they showed little foraging for fish and algae. However, SD showed stronger competitive ability than PS under polyculture (feeding chironomid larvae). In the 60-day ecological simulation experiment, PS could barely forage for fish and shrimp, and its ecological niche was close to that of SW. PS did not gain weight during the experiment, which indirectly reflected its low adaptability in the wild. In summary, the concept of postzygotic ecological isolation was introduced into aquaculture for the first time in this study. Moreover, this study also suggests that reducing the ecological risk caused by the escape of transgenic and genome edited varieties can not only by reducing their fertility, but also by reducing their ecological adaptability, which may lead to their elimination at the larval stage in the wild. This provides new insights for the genetic containment of genetically improved varieties.

AB  - Transhumant pastoralism is a livelihood for many smallholders in the world. In Mexico, transhumant pastoralism has been practiced for 500 years and is classified as a system of transhumant goat pastoralism (TGP). The focus of the study was to identify and characterize the main goat herders of transhumance in the Mixteca-Baja of Mexico. The investigation was carried out in two phases: The first included exploring the districts to locate, contact, and live with the people involved, 13 peasants named Patrones ranging from 40 to 76 years of age. The second phase investigated the transhumant routes and the zootechnical activities of the herds. They live in five locations with an inventory of 12 thousand goats known as Pastorenas. The TGP is a primary economic activity for all the people, and La Matanza is the main economic activity consisting of the slaughter and marketing of goats. The study revealed that the activities depend on the type of economic unit. Transhumant Pastorena goats garner the highest prices paid by merchants ranging from 47-70.4 USD per goat. In conclusion, the TGP is an interesting production system, and livestock activity has an essential ecological niche combining income generation and conservation of the environment.

AB  - White rhinoceros are a sentinel species for important ecosystems in southern Africa. Their conservation requires active management of their population, which, in turn, requires immobilization of individuals with an ultra-potent opioid such as etorphine. Unfortunately, when immobilized with etorphine, they develop severe hypoxaemia that may contribute to morbidity and mortality. We hypothesized that (i) etorphine causes sympathetic upregulation that is responsible for physiological complications that produce hypoxaemia and (ii) butorphanol, a partial mu opioid agonist, mitigates sympathetic upregulation, thereby improving arterial oxygen content (CaO2) and delivery (DO2). Six subadult male white rhinoceros were administered two treatments in random order: etorphine-saline (ES) and etorphine-butorphanol (EB). After intramuscular etorphine (similar to 2.6 mu g kg(-1)), rhinoceros became recumbent (time 0 min [t0]) and were instrumented. Baseline data were collected at t30, butorphanol (0.026 mg/kg) or 0.9% saline was administered intravenously at t37, and data were collected again at t40 and t50. At baseline, plasma noradrenaline concentration was >40 ng ml(-1), approximately twice that of non-immobilized rhinoceros (t test, P < 0.05); cardiac output (Qt, by thermodilution) and metabolic rate (VO2, by spirometry/indirect calorimetry) were greater than predicted allometrically (t test, P < 0.05), and pulmonary hypertension was present. After butorphanol, noradrenaline concentration remained greater than in non-immobilized rhinoceros; in EB, CaO2 was greater, while Qt, DO2, VO2, and pulmonary pressures were less than in ES (linear mixed effect model, all P < 0.05). Increased noradrenaline concentration with increased Qt and hypermetabolism supports etorphine-induced sympathetic upregulation. Butorphanol partly attenuated these effects, increasing CaO2 but reducing Qt and, thus, DO2. Since plasma noradrenaline concentration remained increased after butorphanol administration while Qt, DO2, and VO2 decreased, a pathway independent of plasma noradrenaline concentration might contribute to the cardiopulmonary and hypermetabolic effects of etorphine. Developing treatments to combat this sympathomimesis could reduce capture-related morbidity in white rhinoceros.
   Lay Summary White rhinoceros are a sentinel species for ecosystems in southern Africa. Their conservation is dependent on occasionalimmobilization with the ultra-potent opioid etorphine. Unfortunately, etorphine produces sympathetic nervous system upregulation and severe physiological perturbations that may cause morbidity and mortality. Attenuating its effects contributesto white rhinoceros conservation.

AB  - In calanoid copepods, intensive culture is preferred, but currently, densities do not exceed a few adults per milliliter. Several explanations exist, but none have allowed increasing the density of adults. This study proposes a new explanation for the problem of adult density in intensive culture, using the copepod Parvocalanus crassirostris as a model. First: eggs (2 h old) were supplied to adults kept at 20 adults mL(-1) in 1 L containers with and without microalgae; constant aeration was supplied to determine egg survival to damage caused by the adults. Different samples were taken up to 175 min. Second: A high-density spawning test (5-80 adults mL(-1)) was performed, using shallow depth (2.5 cm) and supersaturation level of oxygen for rapid egg separation and sufficient oxygen for adults, respectively. The SEP (egg female(-1) day(-1)) and REP (egg mL(-1) day(-1)) were determined. Third: two systems of continuous egg harvesting, filtration and sedimentation, were evaluated under a high density of adults culture (10 adults mL(-1)). The adults of P. crassirostris quickly damaged the eggs, but the presence of food reduces the damage caused. Adults presented high SEP up to 10 adults mL(-1); however, REP increased significantly to more than 170 eggs mL(-1) day(-1) using densities of 20 and 30 adults mL(-1) <.05). A continuous harvesting system by filtration generated deformation of the eggs and a lower SEP and REP compared to the passive harvesting system by sedimentation (p <.01). The present study showed that even P. crassirostris, considered herbivore copepod, can damage its eggs. The fragility of newly spawned eggs (without hardened chorion) can generate difficulties when increasing adult density in culture. This new explanation contributes to the generation of new egg harvesting strategies in calanoid copepods of aquaculture importance.

AB  - The contribution of two basal energy sources - detrital organic matter and primary producers - as part of aquatic food webs varies typically along river continua. A host of barriers to river flow increase the water residence time and sediment and nutrient retention in reservoirs worldwide, and potentially alter the balance between detritus-based and algae-based energy pathways in the downstream food webs. We explored this issue on the Selune River (Normandy, France), a small coastal stream that drains an agricultural catchment with high sediment runoff. Seasonal measurements of the following parameters were compared upstream and downstream of the reservoirs of two large dams (16 m and 36 m high): sediment fluxes, nutrient and chlorophyll a concentrations, algal communities in the epilithic biofilm (taxonomic composition, biomass and growth), and benthic invertebrate communities (abundance and trophic guild structure). As anticipated, annual sediment fluxes were much lower downstream of the reservoirs, where significant decreases in water turbidity, phosphate and silicate concentrations were recorded. A higher chlorophyll a concentration in water and a higher contribution of pelagic algae taxa to the photosynthetic biofilm suggested drifting and deposition of reservoir-borne phytoplankton downriver. Photosynthetic biofilm growth was higher downstream of the reservoirs in spring and fall, and so was the abundance of herbivores in the invertebrate community, notably scrapers and algae eaters. Energy pathways within riverine food webs were traced using stable isotope analyses of carbon (C) and nitrogen in the tissues of aquatic consumers (invertebrates and fish). Mixing models revealed a discontinuity in the origin of the C entering the food webs along the river continuum, confirming a greater contribution of algal C to aquatic consumers downstream of the reservoirs. These results illustrate mechanisms whereby large reservoirs can modulate C flow in food webs along a small coastal river with high sediment loads, and make it possible to anticipate the effects of dam removal on the future river ecosystem.

   Ungulates are characterized by their ability to modify or maintain habitats through their impact on plant species composition and the structure of vegetation. Assessing the diet composition of ungulates is therefore important to understand their role in the ecosystem integrity and to develop monitoring and population management plans. The diet composition of free-ranging ungulates has most often been assessed by time-consuming and cost-intensive approaches such as the direct observation of animals, chemical analysis, molecular approaches or microhistological analysis of fecal samples. Near infrared reflectance spectroscopy analysis would be a quick, economic and non-destructive alternative to assess diet composition using fecal samples. In this work, we evaluated the use of this spectroscopy method to assess the diet composition of the Pyrenean chamois (Rupicapra pyrenaica pyrenaica), a medium-size subalpine ungulate with a broad dietary niche. Our results support the reliability of the fecal spectroscopy analysis to monitor diet composition of free-ranging ungulates.
   The diet composition of ungulates is important to understand not only their impact on vegetation, but also to understand the consequences of natural and human-driven environmental changes on the foraging behavior of these mammals. In this work, we evaluated the use of near infrared reflectance spectroscopy analysis (NIRS), a quick, economic and non-destructive method, to assess the diet composition of the Pyrenean chamois Rupicapra pyrenaica pyrenaica. Fecal samples (n = 192) were collected from two chamois populations in the French and Spanish Pyrenees. Diet composition was initially assessed by fecal cuticle microhistological analysis (CMA) and categorized into four functional groups, namely: woody, herbaceous, graminoid and Fabaceae plants. Regressions of modified partial least squares and several combinations of scattering correction and derivative treatments were tested. The results showed that models based on the second derivative processing obtained the higher determination coefficient for woody, herbaceous and graminoid plants (R-CAL(2), coefficient of determination in calibration, ranged from 0.86 to 0.91). The Fabaceae group, however, was predicted with lower accuracy (R-CAL(2) = 0.71). Even though an agreement between NIRS and CMA methods was confirmed by a Bland-Altman analysis, confidence limits of agreement differed by up to 25%. Our results support the viability of fecal NIRS analysis to study spatial and temporal variations of the Pyrenean chamois' diets in summer and winter when differences in the consumption of woody and annual plants are the greatest. This new use for the NIRS technique would be useful to assess the consequences of global change on the feeding behavior of this mountain ungulate and also in other ungulate counterparts.

AB  - Simple Summary This study investigates the prevalence of gastrointestinal parasites in small ruminant farms (159 sheep and 39 goats) in southern Spain, a key area for the country's livestock production. This research reveals that Eimeria spp. Is the most common parasitic infection, followed by Strongyles. Other parasites, like Moniezia spp., Trichuris spp., and D. dendriticum, are less prevalent but more common in sheep. This study also includes a survey on farmers' management practices, highlighting that regular monitoring through coprological analyses is not common; veterinarians are seldom involved in deworming plans, and anthelmintic treatment is typically applied twice a year in sheep and once in goats. This report suggests that implementing certain management measures could potentially mitigate parasite infections. This constitutes the first report on the epidemiological status of gastrointestinal parasites in small ruminants in southern Spain.Abstract The primary population of small ruminants in Spain is concentrated in the southern region, a critical area for the country's livestock production. Indirect economic losses can occur when this livestock is affected by gastrointestinal parasites. This study aimed to determine the prevalence of these parasites in small ruminant herds (159 sheep and 39 goats) through coprological analyses and conducted a survey on farmers' management practices related to gastrointestinal parasite control. The survey results revealed some important aspects: monitoring through coprological analyses is not a common practice; veterinarians are not typically involved in deworming plans; anthelmintic treatment in adults is often applied twice a year in sheep and once a year in goats; and finally, drug rotation was higher in sheep farms. Coprological analyses showed Eimeria spp. as the most common parasitic infection, followed by Strongyles infection. Other parasites like Moniezia spp., Trichuris spp., and D. dendriticum were less important, although their prevalence was higher in sheep than goats. This constitutes the first report on the epidemiological status of gastrointestinal parasites in small ruminants in southern Spain. Based on the survey findings, the introduction of certain management measures on farms could potentially mitigate parasite infections.

AB  - African swine fever (ASF), a viral haemorrhagic fever of suids, has recently transformed from an exotic disease to a panzootic threat to domestic and wild suids worldwide. By 2023, ASF had reached large parts of Europe and Asia, parts of the Americas, and with the Democratic Republic of Timor-Leste the doorstep of Australia. The disease is caused by a large and very complex DNA virus of the genus Asfivirus in the familyAsfarviridae that replicates primarily in monocytes and macrophages. So far, susceptibility to ASF virus (ASFV) has only been shown for members of the Suidae family. With regard to members of the Tayassuidae family, only collared peccaries Dicotyles tajacu have been investigated and showed no obvious susceptibility. In the present study, the susceptibility of peccaries was further investigated using blood-derived monocytic cells from a collared peccary, a Chacoan peccary Catagonus wagneri and a white-lipped peccary Tayassu pecari from European zoos. Viral replication was monitored using indirect immunofluorescence staining and hemadsorption tests. Unlike cells from Suidae including domestic pigs Sus scrofa domesticus, wild boar S. scrofa, bearded pig S. barbatus, Visayan warty pig S. cebifrons, Sulawesi babirusa Babyrousa celebensis, red river hog Potamochoerus porcus and warthog Phacochoerus africanus, Tayassuidae macrophages did not support ASFV replication and thus susceptibility is highly unlikely. There is no evidence that peccaries could play any role in ASF epidemiology.

AB  - Over the 10 years immediately after the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear accident, we measured the changes in the muscle Cs-137 concentration (Bq/kg) of wild Japanese monkeys living in Fukushima City, which is located approximately 70 km from the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant. The muscle(137)Csconcentration, which was observed at a maximum of 13,500 Bq/kg immediately after the accident, had decreased to several hundred Bq/kg 10 years later. The muscle Cs-137 concentration was significantly related to the soil contamination levels (10,000-30,000, 30,000-60,000, 60,000-100,000, and 100,000-300,000 Bq/m(2)), sex, age class (immature, mature), body weight (> 5000 g, 5000-10,000 g, < 10,000 g), and seasons (the cold period from December to April, the warm period from May to November).The value of muscle Cs-137 concentration and the aggregated transfer factor (T-ag: calculated by dividing muscle Cs-137 concentration [Bq/kg] by soil Cs-137 deposition density at the capture site [Bq/m(2)]) apparently decreased with time for several years. However, post hoc pairwise comparisons showed no difference from 2017 to 2020, and the accumulation of Cs-137 in muscle may continue for some time.

AB  - There are increasing concerns about the declining population trends of small mammalian carnivores around the world. Their conservation and management are often challenging due to limited knowledge about their ecology and natural history. To address one of these deficiencies for western spotted skunks (Spilogale gracilis), we investigated their diet in the Oregon Cascades of the Pacific Northwest during 2017-2019. We collected 130 spotted skunk scats opportunistically and with detection dog teams and identified prey items using DNA metabarcoding and mechanical sorting. Western spotted skunk diet consisted of invertebrates, such as wasps, millipedes, and gastropods; vertebrates, such as small mammals, amphibians, and birds; and plants, such as Gaultheria, Rubus, and Vaccinium. Diet also consisted of items, such as black-tailed deer, that were likely scavenged. Comparison in diet by season revealed that spotted skunks consumed more insects during the dry season (June-August), particularly wasps (75% of scats in the dry season), and marginally more mammals during the wet season (September-May). We observed a similar diet in areas with no record of human disturbance and areas with a history of logging at most spatial scales, but scats collected in areas with older forest within a skunk's home range (1-km buffer) were more likely to contain insects. Western spotted skunks provide food web linkages between aquatic, terrestrial, and arboreal systems and serve functional roles of seed dispersal and scavenging. Due to their diverse diet and prey switching, western spotted skunks may dampen the effects of irruptions of prey, such as wasps, during dry springs and summers. By studying the natural history of western spotted skunks in the Pacific Northwest forests, while they are still abundant, we provide key information necessary to achieve the conservation goal of keeping this common species common.

AB  - We explored the influence of dietary experiences on ensuing ingestive responses to novel feeds and flavors by lambs. Twenty lambs housed in individual pens were assigned to two groups (10 lambs/group). In four different periods, all animals were offered four different nutritive novel feeds (oats, wheat bran, corn, beep pulp), followed by intra-ruminal infusions of lithium chloride-LiCl (150 mg/kg BW), a toxicant that causes food aversions (Group NE; negative experiences with novel foods), or just or water (Group PE; Control). After exposure, all lambs were tested for their acceptance of single novel feeds (sorghum grain, rice bran, Calf manna (R) pellets and soybean meal) presented separately and simultaneously in 5-way preference tests with alfalfa (a familiar feed) at familiar and unfamiliar locations. Lambs were also tested for their acceptance and preference for novel flavors (onion, oregano, cinnamon, garlic) added to alfalfa at the unfamiliar location. During exposure, the PE group ate more of the novel feeds than the NE group (P < 0.05). During testing at both familiar and unfamiliar locations, PE lambs ate more (P < 0.05) of the novel feeds than NE lambs, displaying greater preferences for novel feeds and a greater Shannon's diversity index (P < 0.05). No differences between groups regarding ingestive behavior were observed when lambs were offered novel flavors at the unfamiliar location (P > 0.05), likely due to generalization of familiar cues in flavored alfalfa. Thus, prior negative experiences with novel foods increased neophobia and constrained dietary diversity during exposure to novel feeds, an outcome that could impact the composition and structure of plant communities, as well as the nutrition and welfare of grazing animals. Finally, nutritious and safe cues from familiar feeds may be important at attenuating the influence of such negative experiences in novel feeding environments.

AB  - Bacterial community succession in pig manure anaerobic digestion and its correlation with antibiotic residues under combinations of digestion time, temperature, moisture, acidity, and alkalinity are unknown. In this study, bacterial communities and antibiotic residues in compost were analyzed under combinations of these influencing factors (digestion time, temperature, moisture, and acidity and alkalinity). The results showed a decrease in antibiotic residues in the digestion, including tetracycline, oxytetracycline, chlortetracycline, norfloxacin, ciprofloxacin, penicillin, cephalosporin, sulfamethoxypyrimidine, sulfamethazine, tylosin, and erythromycin. These combined conditions resulted in changes in the structure and composition of the dominant and rare bacterial communities. However, there were bacterial populations (containing 13 genera) that presented a stable composition. Antibiotic residue levels were significantly associated with the genus numbers of dominant bacterial communities (containing 29 genera), but not with rare and stable bacterial communities. Antibiotic residue levels were significantly negatively correlated with the abundance of microbial genes encoding carbohydrate-active enzymes, negatively correlated with the abundance of genes involved in main metabolic pathways, and positively correlated with the abundance of genes associated with resistance to environments. Our findings suggest insight into correlations between bacterial community structure and metabolism and antibiotic residues in pig manure anaerobic digestion under effects of key influencing factors.

AB  - Calcium concentrations ([Ca]) in some boreal lakes on the Canadian Shield have been declining over the previous couple of decades. With [Ca] in many lakes below 2 mg Ca/L, there are concerns about possible ecological effects of sustained Ca limitation on zooplankton assemblages. Here we examine whether short- and long-term effects of Ca stress on a keystone herbivore, Daphnia pulicaria, change with the presence of an invertebrate predator, Chaoborus flavicans. We did so by testing whether effects of low Ca on Daphnia pulicaria differ in the presence and absence of kairomones derived from C. flavicans. We compared mass-specific growth rates, body %Ca content, life-history traits, and survival of Daphnia exposed to a range of [Ca] with or without Chaoborus kairomones. We found a mix of individual and interactive effects of kairomones and low Ca supply on Daphnia responses. With longer and chronic exposure to both stressors, the effects of low Ca were intensified by the presence of kairomones, particularly for several reproductive measures (interbrood duration, mean brood size, and number of broods). Given the ubiquity of Chaoborus in softwater boreal lakes, our results show the need to consider their presence when assessing possible effects of low [Ca] on zooplankton assemblages.

AB  - It remains unclear how long-term and different intensities of grazing affect the soil infiltration process, total nitrogen (TN), organic carbon (SOC), and grain size of desert steppes of Inner Mongolia, China. We quantified the effects of consecutive years of grazing from 2004 to 2018 on the soil particle size distribution (PSD, using the American soil classification system), mean soil infiltration rate (r), and cumulative infiltration volume (VC), in addition to the contents of SOC and TN, and their ratio (C/N). We defined grazing intensity at four levels, as non-grazed enclosure (NG, 0-), light (LG, 0.15-), moderate (MG, 0.30-), and heavy grazing (HG, 0.45 sheep per month per hectare steppe). The annual grazing period lasted from May to November. We established twelve adjacent experimental plots containing three replications for each grazing intensity. In July 2018, we collected 600 soil samples (0-40 cm soil depth: 4 depths with a 10-cm interval) in the plots (50 per plot) in a sigmoid configu-ration, to determine the PSD, SOC, TN, and C/N. Grazing evidently changed the PSD in diameter ranges of 20-150 (fine particles) and 200-500 mu m (coarse particles). Grazing significantly decreased the uniformity and distribution range of PSD but increased its dispersion, and these changes were most pronounced in the topsoil (0-10 cm depth). LG promoted r and VC, whose augmentation was evident within the initial 10 min of the infiltration process. The Kostiakov infiltration model was better at dynamically and quantitatively fitting the changing process of r than either the Horton or Philip model. Compared with NG, LG and MG significantly increased both SOC and TN (p < 0.01) whereas these were significantly decreased under HG (p < 0.01). Across differing grazing intensities, topsoil SOC contents can be well predicted by the range and heterogeneity of PSD, as well as the fraction of fine soil particles. These results are helpful for better understanding how continuous grazing impacts soil characteristics and for specifically enacting reasonable grazing scenarios to mitigate desertification on vulnerable desert steppes.

AB  - Mycoplasma ovipneumoniae is a primary causative agent responsible for initiating polymicrobial pneumonia in bighorn sheep (Ovis canadensis). Infections of bighorn sheep populations are typically characterized by initial all-age epizootics followed by long-term periods of repressed juvenile (lamb) survival. Populations of bighorn sheep in New Mexico, USA, were thought to be free of this pathogen prior to 2017 but recent infection of multiple herds raised concerns regarding impacts on population size and juvenile:female ratios. Using aerial survey, survival, and disease sampling data in an exploratory framework, we (1) characterize age-related differences in M. ovipneumoniae prevalence and seroprevalence, (2) quantify differences in lamb:ewe ratios pre- and post-M. ovipneumoniae detection, and (3) investigate differences in survival between previously exposed and na & iuml;ve individuals. From 2007 to 2022, we sampled 466 bighorn sheep across 19 populations in New Mexico for M. ovipneumoniae exposure. While the timing of initial herd infections varied across populations, one population sustained active infections for over 15 years. We found reduced juvenile:female ratios post M. ovipneumoniae exposure for both desert (O. c. mexicana) and Rocky Mountain (O. c. canadensis) bighorn sheep populations. Post-exposure ratio declines ranged from 20% to 69%. Evaluation of population size and environmental condition effects on juvenile:female ratios indicated varying impacts for each subspecies. Notably, population size was negatively related to Rocky Mountain juvenile:female ratios only after populations were exposed to M. ovipneumoniae. Additionally, climatic conditions in the previous lambing season and pre-parturition time frame were associated with juvenile:female ratios for Rocky Mountain populations, while juvenile:female ratios of desert bighorn appeared to only be affected by pre-parturition climatic conditions. Kaplan-Meier survival estimation of previously exposed, but putatively recovered, individuals (n = 31) and na & iuml;ve individuals (n = 70) revealed lower (75%; 95% CI: 62%-93%) but not statistically significant (p = 0.2) 1-year survival rates for individuals that were seropositive but not actively infected, when compared to seronegative individuals (88%; 95% CI: 81%-97%). These results collectively suggest that following M. ovipneumoniae introduction, bighorn sheep populations in New Mexico could be limited by lamb survival.

AB  - Aim Phylogeographic studies on savanna ungulates have extensively evaluated genetic patterns mostly related to Pleistocene climatic oscillations. We address this subject through a comprehensive assessment across the pan-African range of the roan antelope, assessing whether climatic oscillations or natural physical barriers play a predominant role in the evolutionary history of the species. We also address the spatial concordance of the genetic structure with the currently recognized subspecies. Location Sub-Saharan Africa. Taxon Roan antelope (Hippotragus equinus). Methods We genotyped 43 microsatellite loci and sequenced whole-mitochondrial genomes for 131 individuals across the species' entire African range. We performed spatial analyses of genetic diversity for contemporary and historical samples and calculated overall patterns of genetic differentiation and structure for both marker types. We also estimated the timing of divergence events and demographic trends, correlating these with the species' biotic attributes as well as abiotic features shaping African savanna habitats. Results Our analyses uncovered highly structured clusters and contact zones across the distribution of the roan antelope, including five nuclear groups and four mitochondrial lineages. The north-west group had the highest level of intra-group diversity as well as inter-group divergence and represents the oldest vicariant event. The central and southern groups had the lowest intra-group diversity with low divergence values separating them, suggesting a more recent ancestry for these groups. All population groups showed signals of demographic stability over time showed signals of demographic stability over a demographic decline during the Holocene. Main conclusions The roan antelope exhibits significant population structure across its African range. This structure is largely associated with natural physical barriers, whereas contact zones could more easily be explained by climatic events. Based on estimates of genetic diversity, we propose a West African ancestry for this species with subsequent eastward and southern range expansions, as well as the persistence of stable population numbers within refugia. A general trend of population size decreases likely reflects Holocene extreme climatic events and increased human pressure.

AB  - The tea agroforestry system has great economic potential by supporting livelihood and food security while advancing ecological services by sequestering a large amount of carbon. Despite a large area under tea cultivation in India, little has been studied on the spatial distribution of aboveground biomass (AGB) of the tea agroforestry systems. Hence, the present study aims to map the spatial distribution of AGB of tea agroforestry systems in Barak valley, Assam, northeast India, by integrating Sentinel-2 satellite imagery and field inventory data using a random forest (RF) algorithm. The study reveals 330.69 km(2) area under tea cultivation in Barak valley which is 4.78% of the total geographical area of the region. The predicted AGB of tea agroforestry systems ranged from 30 to 124 Mg ha(-1) with a mean AGB of 75 Mg ha(-1). It was observed that RF could effectively predict the AGB (R-2 = 0.86, RMSE = 7.50 Mg ha(-1), and %RMSE = 9.94%) with a set of five optimized spectral variables, viz., Normalized Difference Vegetation Index, Green Normalized Difference Vegetation Index, Normalized Difference Infrared Index, Normalized Difference Water Index and Atmospherically Resistant Vegetation Index derived from Sentinel-2 satellite data. The study provided a cost-effective approach, with freely available satellite data, algorithm, and software for effectively mapping the spatial distribution of AGB of tea agroforestry system. The approach adopted in the present study can be followed to map and monitor the carbon stock of agroforestry systems for better management.

AB  - The monodactyl horses of the genus Equus originated in North America during the Pliocene, and from the beginning of the Pleistocene, they have been an essential part of the large ungulate communities of Europe, North America and Africa. Understanding how body size of Equus species evolved and varied in relation to changes in environments and diet thus forms an important part of understanding the dynamics of ungulate body size variation in relation to Pleistocene paleoenvironmental changes. Here we test previously published body mass estimation equations for the family Equidae by investigating how accurately different skeletal and dental measurements estimate the mean body mass (and body mass range) reported for extant Grevy's zebra (Equus grevyi) and Burchell's zebra (Equus quagga). Based on these tests and information on how frequently skeletal elements occur in the fossil record, we construct a hierarchy of best practices for the selection of body mass estimation equations in Equus. As a case study, we explore body size variation in Pleistocene European Equus paleopopulations in relation to diet and vegetation structure in their paleoenvironments. We show a relationship between diet and body size in Equus: very large-sized species tend to have more browse-dominated diets than small and medium-sized species, and paleovegetation proxies indicate on average more open and grass-rich paleoenvironments for small-sized, grazing species of Equus. When more than one species of Equus co-occur sympatrically, the larger species tend to be less abundant and have more browse-dominated diets than the smaller species. We suggest that body size variation in Pleistocene Equus was driven by a combined effect of resource quality and availability, partitioning of habitats and resources between species, and the effect of environmental openness and group size on the body size of individuals.

AB  - Incidental capture of non-target species by fisheries, also referred to as bycatch, is a major concern for the management of marine megafauna species. In Norway, it has been estimated that 555 harbor seals (Phoca vitulina) get entangled and drown in gillnets every year. The majority of these bycatch events occur in large-mesh gillnet fisheries targeting cod (Gadus morhua) and monkfish (Lophius piscatorius). Young-of the-year individuals represent the largest proportion of bycaught harbor seals. To increase our understanding of harbor seal bycatch events along the Norwegian coast, times and areas of potential bycatch risk were identified. Seasonal variation in the at-sea distribution of harbor seals was simulated based on movement from their molting site to predicted at-sea locations. Relative age-specific bycatch abundances were used to weigh the different seasons (times of the year) based on harbor seal age. The overlap in the distribution of harbor seals and the documented distribution of fishing effort was then used to estimate the relative bycatch risks between harbor seals and fisheries in defined Statistical Sea Locations (SSLs) in each of the four seasons. The method used here provides a general framework for understanding temporal and spatial interaction between harbor seals and coastal gillnet fisheries. The times and areas of high interaction risk that were identified can be used in management practices to increase our understanding of bycatch events, and to ultimately reduce unwanted bycatch of harbor seals in coastal fisheries along the Norwegian coast.

AB  - Simple Summary Lipoptena fortisetosa is a hematophagous ectoparasite of game animals feeding accidentally on companion animals and humans. Since the presence of numerous pathogenic microorganisms has been described in this species, monitoring its geographic distribution is of great epidemiological importance. To the best of our knowledge, we present two new haplotypes of Bartonella sp. isolated from L. fortisetosa in south-eastern Poland and confirm the presence of this invasive species in Lublin Voivodeship since 2013. Insects of the genus Lipoptena are parasitic arthropods with a broad host range. Due to the type of parasitism (hematophagy), their potential role as vectors of pathogens, i.e., Bartonella sp., Anaplasma phagocytophilum, Rickettsia spp., and Borrelia burgdorferi is considered. As the range of their occurrence has been changing dynamically in recent years and infestations of humans have increasingly been reported, these organisms are now the subject of numerous studies. Our research aimed to present the molecular characteristics of Bartonella sp. detected in Lipoptena fortisetosa parasitizing wild cervids in south-eastern Poland. Adults of Lipoptena spp. were collected from carcasses of roe deer and red deer between spring and autumn in 2013. The PCR method was used to detect Bartonella sp. in the insects. We report two new haplotypes of the rpoB gene of Bartonella sp. isolated from L. fortisetosa feeding on wild cervids in south-eastern Poland and the presence of this invasive ectoparasitic species in the studied area since 2013. Phylogenetic analyses of newly obtained Bartonella sp. haplotypes confirmed their unique position on the constructed tree and network topology. The rpoB gene sequences found belonging to lineage B support the view that this phylogenetic lineage represents a novel Bartonella species.

AB  - Dietary copper and zinc additives facilitate the growth and development of animals, but heavy metal in feces threatens the ecological environment, and balance is the key to solving the problem. In this study, a trial of 2000 pigs (early nursery, 9?15 kg; late nursery, 15?25 kg; grower: 25?60 kg) was conducted to analyze the effects of different diets (gradient dosage of copper and zinc additives) on growth performance, antioxidant performance, immune function, and fecal heavy metal excretion of piglets and growing pigs. Although no significant differences were observed in average daily gain (ADG) and average daily feed intake (ADFI) between treatments during the entire nursery-grower period, the addition of appropriate high doses of copper and zinc to the diet had a beneficial effect on the antioxidant status and immune function of weaned piglets. Especially at early nursery, compared with the low-copper group (5 mg/kg Cu), the high-copper group (120 mg/kg Cu) could significantly increase the peroxidase (POD), glutathione peroxidase (GSH-PX), total antioxidant capacity (T-AOC), catalase (CAT) and copper/zinc superoxide dismutase (Cu/Zn-SOD), cortisol in the serum. Moreover, the addition of zinc and copper in the diet not only increased the concentration of corresponding trace elements in the serum, but also affected the concentration of other trace elements in the serum. The reduction of copper and zinc content in the diet contributed to reducing the copper and zinc content in feces. In conclusion, we have formulated the mutual benefit dosages of copper and zinc (9?15 kg: 5 mg/kg Cu and 50 mg/kg Zn; 15?25 kg: 4 mg/kg Cu and 50 mg/kg Zn; 25?60 kg: 4 mg/kg Cu and 10 mg/kg Zn) for weaning piglets and growing pigs, which would help ensure the healthy growth of animals and reduce environmental heavy metal residues. Capsule: This study developed a mutually beneficial dose of copper and zinc in pig diets, which promotes animal growth and protects the environment.

AB  - Livestock rearing is increasing in savannas, so the ability of trees to regrow after consumption represents one of the critical aspects of savanna structure and functioning. Here, we identified specific traits-which may explain the mechanisms behind defoliation tolerance-in saplings of two encroacher tree species (Vachellia caven and Vachellia aroma). We carried out common garden and field experiments where manual defoliation treatments simulated the cattle grazing regime employed in the study region. At the end of the experiments, we recorded growth variables and, in the common garden experiment, root reserves concentration. In the common garden, defoliation decreased height and basal diameter growth but did not affect the aerial relative growth rate. Also, defoliation increased the number of branches per plant and decreased root relative growth rate. Starch con-centration was higher or similar in defoliated plants than controls, depending on the species. In the field, defoliation decreased both species' height and basal diameter growth. We found that tree saplings tolerated defoliation, and the mechanisms behind tolerance would be linked mainly to the axillary bud activation and not to storage reserve mobilization. Over time, these plant architectural changes might complicate cattle movement and management in these systems. From a long-term perspective, livestock rearing might retard juvenile recruitment into reproductive-size classes (e.g., adults) by reducing overall tree growth rates.

AB  - Sequestration, that is, the accumulation of plant toxins into body tissues for defense, was predicted to incur physiological costs and may require resistance traits different from those of non-sequestering insects. Alternatively, sequestering species could experience a cost in the absence of toxins due to selection on physiological homeostasis under permanent exposure of sequestered toxins in body tissues. Milkweed bugs (Heteroptera: Lygaeinae) sequester high amounts of plant-derived cardenolides. Although being potent inhibitors of the ubiquitous animal enzyme Na+/K+-ATPase, milkweed bugs can tolerate cardenolides by means of resistant Na+/K+-ATPases. Both adaptations, resistance and sequestration, are ancestral traits of the Lygaeinae. Using four milkweed bug species (Heteroptera: Lygaeidae: Lygaeinae) and the related European firebug (Heteroptera: Pyrrhocoridae: Pyrrhocoris apterus) showing different combinations of the traits "cardenolide resistance" and "cardenolide sequestration," we tested how the two traits affect larval growth upon exposure to dietary cardenolides in an artificial diet system. While cardenolides impaired the growth of P. apterus nymphs neither possessing a resistant Na+/K+-ATPase nor sequestering cardenolides, growth was not affected in the non-sequestering milkweed bug Arocatus longiceps, which possesses a resistant Na+/K+-ATPase. Remarkably, cardenolides increased growth in the sequestering dietary specialists Caenocoris nerii and Oncopeltus fasciatus but not in the sequestering dietary generalist Spilostethus pandurus, which all possess a resistant Na+/K+-ATPase. We furthermore assessed the effect of dietary cardenolides on additional life history parameters, including developmental speed, longevity of adults, and reproductive success in O. fasciatus. Unexpectedly, nymphs under cardenolide exposure developed substantially faster and lived longer as adults. However, fecundity of adults was reduced when maintained on cardenolide-containing diet for their entire lifetime but not when adults were transferred to non-toxic sunflower seeds. We speculate that the resistant Na+/K+-ATPase of milkweed bugs is selected for working optimally in a "toxic environment," that is, when sequestered cardenolides are stored in the body.

AB  - Reduced tillage methods such as strip tillage are often combined with cover crop mixtures to provide agronomic benefits which can support crop and soil health. However, reduced tillage and cover crop species/arrangements effects on arthropods is less understood and results of previous studies have varied. In this study, we examined how agriculturally relevant pest and beneficial arthropod species were impacted by tillage and cover crop methods in USDA-certified organic Cucurbita (L.) (Cucurbitales: Cucurbitaceae). Aphididae were the most observed foliar pests and abundance was highest in full tillage treatment plots while foliar herbivores overall, excluding Aphididae, were more abundant in strip tillage treatment plots regardless of cover crop arrangement. Formicidae was also observed more on foliage, flowers, and in pitfall traps in full tillage, similarly to Aphididae. Parasitica were the most observed foliar natural enemies with increased abundance in strip tillage treatments. Activity densities of several epigeal natural enemies were also higher in strip tillage compared to full tillage. No significant effects of tillage and cover crop treatments were observed on flower visitation rates of Eucera pruinosa (Say) (Hymenoptera: Apidae), an important pollinator of Cucurbita, while the highest visitation rates of Apis mellifera (L.) (Hymenoptera: Apidae) and Bombus spp. (Latreille) (Hymenoptera: Apidae) were in strip tillage treatments. These results suggest that reduced tillage methods can support greater abundances of natural enemies and possibly pollinators. This may lead to enhanced biological control and pollination, but impacts may vary for different arthropod species and crops.

AB  - Urban green infrastructure (UGI), a key component of nature-based solutions (NbSs), plays a vital role in enhancing urban resilience. Nonetheless, the absence of a thorough resilience evaluation for UGI has hindered the efficacy of its design and implementation. This article proposes an innovative urban environmental resilience index (ERI) framework designed to evaluate the lifecycle performance of UGI. First, a coupled environmental resilience evaluation system is proposed that encompasses indicators for the adaptation to acute disturbances and the mitigation of chronic pressures. Second, the inventive formulas for calculating the environmental resilience index are presented, which establish the weighting of indicators through Delphi-analytic hierarchy process (AHP) analysis, and the Storm Water Management Model (SWMM), GaBi, and i-Tree models are employed for the quantitative assessment. Third, four representative UGI scenarios in urban built-up areas have been selected for comparative analysis and in-depth discussion by calculating the resilience index. This research presents UGI solutions as adaptive measures for "Black Swan" events and "Gray Rhino" phenomena, offering significant case studies and methodological frameworks which will inform future endeavours in green and sustainable urban development.

AB  - Evaluating nutritional condition provides insights of nutritional influences on wildlife populations. We sampled three measures of condition - body fat, body mass, and loin thickness- of adult female caribou (Rangifer tarandus (Linnaeus, 1758)) in boreal settings in the Northwest Territories (NT), Canada, in December and March, 2016-2018, and in mountain and boreal settings in British Columbia (BC), Canada, in December and February, 2014-2015. We evaluated the effect of calf-rearing on condition in December, compared influences of summer-autumn versus winter on condition over winter, and developed an annual profile of nutritional condition with estimates from caribou dying in summer. Mean December body fat was 8.4% in females with calves and 11.4% in females without calves, demonstrating the influence of lactation on condition. Over winter, nutritional condition did not decline in northeastern BC and it declined slightly in NT: body fat by 0.55 percentage points, mass by 2.8 kg, and loin thickness did not change. Body fat peaked in December, changed little over winter, but declined to a minimum by early summer, temporally coinciding with elevated rates of adult female mortality. Consistent with those of other ungulate studies worldwide, our findings suggest a need to focus on nutritional limitations operating in late spring through early autumn.

AB  - The Southern Ocean, its ecosystem, and inhabitants are vulnerable to climate-mediated shifts in habitat conditions. These changes can affect marine predators in the long term through changes in the distribution, density, and quality of prey. To understand how these changes affect vital rates requires longitudinal studies integrating demography and environmental states. We analyzed 22 years of capture-mark-recapture data to quantify the influence of broad-scale climate on the survival of male southern elephant seals from Macquarie Island, Tasmania, Australia. Weaning mass was incorporated as a quadratic predictor of survival to account for the known influence of maternal investment. First-year survival was greatest for weaners weighing 160 kg. Subsequent developmental stages were grouped into juvenile, subordinate, and breeding adult states to reflect the known life history of individuals. We found increased juvenile and subordinate survival with positive values of the previous years' Southern Annular Mode. This is likely due to the northward shift of westerly winds increasing productivity and prey availability in the Sub-Antarctic region. In contrast to females of this population, the Southern Oscillation Index did not affect male survival. In this highly polygynous mating system, sex-dependent differences in foraging behavior may be causing the small number of successful breeding adult males to be less susceptible to external influences after reaching the minimum age and body size required to be socially competitive for mating. These extremely large bulls will breed with multiple females and thus make a disproportionate contribution to the gene pool of the next generation. Considering the susceptibility of males to climate influences is therefore highly relevant to assessing the future adaptive capability of the species.

AB  - This study is part of a project (Sheep Al.L. Chain, RDP Veneto Region) aiming to improve the competitiveness of local sheep breed farms through valorization of their links with mountain agroecosystems. We considered two local sheep breeds of the eastern Italian Alps, "Alpagota" and "Lamon", which have a population of 400 and 3000 heads, respectively, and are used to produce lambs for typical products. A total of 35 farms (17 for Alpagota, with a total of 1652 heads; 18 for Lamon, with a total of 337 heads) were surveyed to collect data on farm organization, flock structure and management (farm questionnaire), land use management (GIS approach), and value chain organization (participatory processes). The link between the two local sheep breeds and mountain agroecosystems is very strong: land use is characterized by a large number of small patches of grasslands in marginal areas. Moving from the results of this study, a set of strategies aiming at improving the competitiveness of these systems have been proposed. Communication to the consumers and to the relevant stakeholders of the added value of local sheep breeds in marginal mountain agroecosystems can contribute to favor the resilience of small ruminant farms and the conservation of Alpine sheep breeds.

AB  - Simple Summary Small ruminant lentiviruses (SRLVs) are a group of highly diverse viruses responsible for global infections in goats and sheep. The purpose of this study was to genetically characterize SRLVs circulating in Romania. A total of 122 samples from pulmonary and lung lymph nodes of slaughtered sheep were examined. The obtained gag-pol and gag sequences from Romanian SRLV strains were compared with available GenBank strains, and the results showed that the Romanian sequences were associated with strains A2 and A3 based on gag-pol sequences and with subtypes A3 and A17 based on gag sequences. In addition, the Romanian sequences showed some specific mutations in epitope 3, which may reflect their evolution. This study describes for the first time SRLV sequences detected in Romanian sheep, providing basic information on the subtypes circulating in Romania.Abstract Small ruminant lentiviruses (SRLVs) are a group of retroviruses that cause multisystem chronic diseases in goats and sheep and lead to production losses in these animals, negatively affecting animal health and welfare. Although molecular characterization of SRLV field isolates has been performed in many countries, there is currently no information on SRLV genotypes circulating in sheep and goats in Romania. Therefore, the main objective of this study was to conduct a molecular and phylogenetic analysis of SRLVs from Romania and determine the degree of genetic relatedness of the obtained sequences to other known SRLV reference strains. A total of 81 sheep lung tissue samples and 41 sheep lung lymph node samples were tested using nested real-time PCR, and samples positive for real-time PCR were used to amplify an 800 bp gag-pol fragment and an overlapping 625 bp fragment of the gag gene. Pairwise DNA distance and phylogenetic analysis showed that the Romanian SRLV strains were closely related to the A2 and A3 strains based on gag-pol sequences and to the A3 and A17 subtypes based on gag sequences. No recombination events were found. Our results revealed that the Romanian sequences have similar epitope patterns to other existing subtypes, although E/K and R/K mutations in epitope 3 were found only in the Romanian sequences, which may have potential value in serological diagnosis. This study is the first report on the genetic characterization of SRLV strains circulating in Romania and provides new information on SRLV heterogeneity. Further detailed studies should be conducted to better understand the divergence of SRLV Romanian strains.

AB  - The Lesser Sunda Seascape (LSS) is a critical habitat for various megafauna, including the spinetail devil ray (Mobula mobular). For decades, bycatch from drift gillnet fisheries has increased in the LSS, posing a greater threat to their populations. Migratory species require population-based management to effectively address their conservation needs and ensure their long-term survival. Fifty-five samples were collected from three locations within the LSS, i.e., East Flores (19), West Manggarai (15), and East Java (21). This study aims to understand the population genetic structure of M. mobular within the three different locations around the LSS using eight microsatellite markers and mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) NADH-dehydrogenase subunit 5. The analysis of molecular variances result indicated the significant result between the three locations based on microsatellite data (0.0876, p < 0.05 for eight loci and 0.1360, p < 0.05 for four loci) and mtDNA (0.04820, p < 0.05). The pairwise genetic differentiation index (Fst) revealed that East Flores versus West Manggarai has a nonsignificant value (p > 0.05). Meanwhile, East Flores or West Manggarai versus East Java showed a significant Fst value (p < 0.05). In conclusion, microsatellite and mtDNA results revealed that in the LSS, spinetail devil rays are divided into two distinct subpopulations: the Savu Sea (East Flores and West Manggarai) subpopulation and the East Java subpopulation. Even though there are two potential subpopulations in the LSS, co-management of this species should be prioritized in the LSS due to the indication of shared haplotypes between those locations.

AB  - Simple Summary In the present study, we aimed to explore the potential local regulatory role of the cocaine- and amphetamine-regulated transcript (CART) signaling pathway in granulosa cell (GC) apoptosis, which is a key mechanism promoting follicular atresia in several animal species, including buffalo. Our results showed how CART activity adversely influences buffalo GC viability by affecting estradiol production and enhancing apoptosis. The regulatory mechanism by which CART can affect GC apoptosis entails the modulation of the AKT/GSK3 beta/beta-catenin pathway, a key intracellular signaling pathway essential for cell viability. In conclusion, this study provides valuable insights into the intricate mechanisms governing ovarian follicle development and granulosa cell function. These findings have implications for reproductive biology not only for buffalo but also for different species.Abstract Atresia is a process in ovarian follicles that is regulated by hormone-induced apoptosis. During atresia, granulosa cell (GC) apoptosis is a key mechanism orchestrated through diverse signaling pathways. Cocaine- and amphetamine-regulated transcript (CART) signaling within ovarian GCs has been demonstrated to play a key role in the regulation of follicular atresia in cattle, pigs, and sheep. The present work aimed to investigate the potential local regulatory role of CART in GC apoptosis-induced follicular atresia in buffalo, focusing on the modulation of the AKT/GSK3 beta/beta-catenin signaling pathways, which are the intracellular signaling pathways involved in cell viability. Our findings revealed increased expression of CARTPT and BAX and decreased levels of AKT, beta-catenin, and CYP19A1 genes in atretic follicles compared to healthy follicles. Subsequently, CART treatment in the presence of FSH inhibited the FSH-induced increase in GC viability by reducing estradiol production and increasing apoptosis. This change was accompanied by an increase in the gene expression levels of both CARTPT and BAX. At the protein level, treatment with CART in the presence of FSH negatively affected the activity of AKT, beta-catenin, and LEF1, while the activity of GSK3 beta was enhanced. In conclusion, our study shows how CART negatively influences buffalo GC viability, underlying the modulation of the AKT/GSK3 beta/beta-catenin pathway and promoting apoptosis-a key factor in follicular atresia.

AB  - Identifying the isotopic signatures of vertical mobility and alpine meadows exploitation in the teeth of domesticated animals can be a key to understanding the subsistence strategies used by pastoral communities through history. Indeed, the oxygen (818O) and carbon (813C) isotopic composition of sequentially sampled tooth enamel, used alone or in combination have been commonly employed to investigate altitudinal mobility and alpine exploitation. However, conflicting interpretations of the outcomes of these analyses exist, due in part to the paucity of modern reference datasets. In this study, we propose a new reference set, composed of GPS monitored sheep, goats and horses from the Mongolian Altai, to investigate the influence of vertical mobility and mean grazing altitude, on the C and O isotopic compositions of sequentially sampled tooth enamel and on the C isotopic composition of horse tail hair. We found that 813C values were negatively correlated with the mean grazing altitude and time of residency of alpine meadows. Although no correlation was found between the average 818O values of tooth enamel and mean grazing altitude, vertically mobile livestock had a higher intra-tooth range in 818O values than vertically immobile livestock, possibly reflecting the ingestion of isotopically more diverse sources of water. Moreover, the coefficient of the correlation between 813C and 818O values of tooth enamel was although weakly - negatively correlated with the standard deviation of the animal mean grazing altitude (i.e. reflecting the frequency of altitudinal mobility). These results confirm that 813C and 818O analyses of tooth enamel and tail hair can be used to infer animal mobility and land use in modern and ancient times.

AB  - Understanding abiotic and biotic factors affecting the survival of seedlings of threatened species such as Afzelia africana is fundamental for restoration and sustainable management purposes. This study used seedling individual-level morphological data and plot-level data to assess the effect of abiotic (season, elevation, soil type and terrain slope) and biotic (seedling initial density, basal diameter, height and number of leaves, insect and fungal infection, insect herbivory, mammal herbivory, vegetation type, adult conspecific density and diameter, and heterospecific density and diameter) factors on the survival probability (at individual level) and survival rate (at plot level) of seedlings of A. africana in the Pendjari Biosphere Reserve. Generalized Linear Mixed Models (GLMMs) were used for data analyses. At individual level, we found that the survival probability of A. africana seedlings increased with initial height, but decreased from wet to dry season. At plot level, the survival rate of A. africana seedlings also decreased from the wet season (0.72 +/- 0.05) to the dry season (0.18 +/- 0.04) and was inversely proportional to seedling basal diameter (P = 0.024) and density of conspecific adults (P = 0.016). There were also positive effects of seedling initial height (P = 0.026) and mean diameter of conspecific adults (P = 0.037) on survival rate. Among abiotic factors, only terrain slope showed significant and negative effect (P = 0.028) on the survival rate, suggesting higher survival rate on flat terrain. Our findings suggest that sustainably managing seedlings of A. africana would require accounting for conspecific neighboring effect, terrain slope and season-specific actions. Practical aspects of these factors were further discussed.

AB  - Global warming particularly impacts terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems in the Arctic. To constrain the sensitivity of Arctic lakes and make meaningful predictions about future change under global warming, we need to examine their response to previous warm phases. Lake sediments from Greenland's deglaciated area offer valuable archives to investigate past climate variability and associated lake changes.
   Here, we applied hyperspectral imaging and lipid biomarker thermometry to a Holocene-length sediment record from Lake 578 in the Eastern Settlement of the Norse (61.08(degrees) N, 45.62(degrees) W; similar to 155 m a.s.l) to investigate local temperature, productivity, and anoxia histories. We calibrated branched glycerol dialkyl glycerol tetraethers (brGDGTs) with summer mean water temperatures (SMWT) using a previously published site-specific calibration and analyzed pigment fluxes based on hyperspectral imaging. Notably, the anoxia reconstructions were corroborated with two independent proxies (GDGT-0/Crenarchaeol and bacterio pheophytins). We investigated the lake's environmental history and identified periods of significant change by employing generalized additive models (GAMs).
   Our results reveal significant transitions in Lake 578 driven both by natural climate shifts and anthropogenic impacts. During the early Holocene, low SMWT and productivity coupled with high anoxia suggest strong seasonality and prolonged inverted thermal stratification, possibly enhanced by extended ice cover. The midHolocene showed higher SMWT and productivity along with low anoxia, indicating a dimictic lake system. The early Holocene temperature rise lagged that of to the Northern Hemisphere, but closely followed the Atlantic-Fennoscandian stack. The Holocene Thermal Maximum (7.5-4.5 cal ka BP) aligns with other regional reconstructions. After 3 cal ka BP, we observed a Neoglacial cooling characterized by increased anoxia and reduced temperatures due to enhanced stratification. At around 1.0 cal ka BP, Lake 578 saw a surge in productivity and anoxia, which we attribute to land use and lake damming by the Norse. Despite a post-Norse decline in productivity and disappearance of anoxia, the lake never reverted to its pre-Norse state, with modern sheep farming further intensifying productivity in recent decades. While early Holocene anoxia resulted from natural cold temperature stratification, anoxia during the Norse period was anthropogenically induced.
   This research underscores the value of integrating lipid biomarkers with hyperspectral imaging for detailed reconstructions of changes within Arctic lakes. It provides crucial insights for anticipating the ecologic and climatic resilience of Arctic lakes to ongoing global warming and anthropogenic influence.

AB  - Simple Summary In the European bison, Trueperella pyogenes is associated with different suppurative infections of mainly the urogenital tract or with abscesses in various tissues. Our research showed that in the studied population of European bison in Poland, the prevalence of T. pyogenes infections is relatively high. The significant genetic diversity of isolated strains was observed. However, in a few cases, the same RAPD profile was obtained for strains isolated from individuals living in the same area. Our study indicated that different virulence factors are related to the pathogenicity of this bacterium. The results obtained in this study provide valuable data about the prevalence, pathogenicity and genetic diversity of T. pyogenes in the European bison. Thus, it improves the knowledge on treatment for the European bison's health and proves the importance of continuous monitoring for the protection of these wild ruminants. Trueperella pyogenes is a Gram-positive bacterium causing purulent infections in many animal species, including the European bison. However, the data about the virulence and genetic relationships of T. pyogenes strains isolated from these wild ruminants are strongly limited. The aim of this study was to investigate the prevalence of T. pyogenes infections in the European bison, and to evaluate the genetic diversity of isolates from these animals. In the time span of 10 years, 328 European bison from 16 different locations were examined. The standard bacteriological methods were used for T. pyogenes isolation and identification from clinical specimens obtained from urogenital tract infections and abscesses of different locations. The presence of genes encoding known virulence factors was investigated by PCR, and the genetic diversity of T. pyogenes strains was examined with the RAPD-PCR method. The prevalence of T. pyogenes infections was 14.6%, and the pathogen was isolated from both female (47.9% of isolates) and male (52.1% of isolates) European bison. It should be highlighted that a considerable number of strains were isolated from the prepuce and penis infections. Therefore, the role of T. pyogenes in the pathogenesis of balanoposthitis should be seriously perceived. A total of 39 T. pyogenes strains were subjected to genetic characterization. All studied strains carried the plo gene, while the nanH (25.6%), nanP (23.1%), cbpA (7.7%), fimA (97.4%), fimC (69.2%), fimE (92.3%) and fimG (15.4%) genes were present with a variable frequency among the tested strains. The virulence genotype plo/fimA/fimC/fimE was dominant. RAPD-PCR typing showed a high level of genetic diversity among European bison T. pyogenes strains, and a total of 31 different RAPD profiles were distinguished. In a few cases, the same RAPD profile was found in strains obtained from animals living in the same area. This study provided the first data about the prevalence and genetic relationships of T. pyogenes in the Polish population of European bison. However, further epidemiological investigations are needed to understand the routes of transmission and dissemination of the pathogen in these wild animals.

AB  - Insulin -like peptides (ILPs) have been reported to exert significant and diverse regulatory effects through the insulin signaling pathway in invertebrates. However, there is a large research gap in the functional analysis of ILP genes in crustaceans. In this study, we combined RNA interference (RNAi) technology with transcriptome sequencing to investigate the regulatory effects of the ILP1 gene in the Pacific white shrimp Litopenaeus vannamei . After two weeks of continuous RNAi of LvILP1 , the shrimp in the dsLvILP1 group exhibited reduced body length gain, weight gain, molting rate, and hemolymph glucose concentration compared to the control dsEGFP group, indicating that knockdown of LvILP1 slowed shrimp growth, molting, and metabolism. Comparative transcriptome analysis of three tissues revealed that knockdown of LvILP1 inhibited muscle growth and development by modulating the mTOR and MAPK signaling pathways, and prevented the renewal of epidermal tissue through the Hippo signaling pathway. Meanwhile, it also suppressed certain growth signals in the hepatopancreas, such as juvenile hormone (JH) synthesis and 20-hydroxyecdysteroid (20E) signal activation. Additionally, it promoted the conversion pathway of some sugars into amino acid metabolism instead of energy metabolism after glycolysis in the hepatopancreas. Interestingly, knockdown of LvILP1 also affected carbohydrate metabolism by regulating the intracellular and extracellular transport of glucose and trehalose, as well as regulating the expression levels of key metabolic genes in three shrimp tissues. This disruption led to a decrease in blood glucose levels and suppressed energy production, ultimately providing less energy for shrimp growth and molting. This study provides valuable insights into the underlying genetic mechanism through which ILP1 regulates glucose metabolism and growth in shrimp. It enhances our understanding of the structure and function of the insulin pathway in crustaceans and serves as an important reference for the identification of candidate genes in molecular genetic breeding of shrimp.

AB  - Simple Summary The management of carnivore populations in protected areas includes disease management and census taking. The presence of prey species and environmental variables influence the detection of wild carnivore species. The aim of this study was to identify the important predictors of wild carnivore detection within two South African wildlife reserves using motion-detection camera traps. The study further investigated the difference between traditional census call-up surveys and camera traps within nearby locations. Buffalo, impala, and warthog were associated with lion and spotted hyena detections. Detections of lions and spotted hyenas and also leopards and spotted hyena were correlated, suggesting competition between these wild carnivore species. Competition among wild carnivore species has importance for implementing appropriate management procedures, including infectious disease prevention. South African protected areas account for 8% of the total landmass according to World Bank indicators. Effective conservation of biodiversity in protected areas requires the development of specific reserve management objectives addressing species and disease management. The primary objective of the current study was to identify predictors of carnivore detection in an effort to inform carnivore species management plans on Andover and Manyeleti nature reserves in South Africa. A limited number of camera traps were placed randomly using a grid system. Species detection data were analysed using mixed-effects logistic regression and Spearman's correlation coefficients. Deterministic inverse distance weighted distribution maps were used to describe the spatial distribution of carnivore species. Camera traps identified similar species as traditional call-up surveys during the study and would be useful as an adjunct census method. Carnivore detection was associated with several variables, including the presence of specific prey species. The measured intra-and interspecies interactions suggested the risk of disease transmission among species, and vaccination for prevalent diseases should be considered to manage this risk.

AB  - Objectives: The objectives of this study were to (i) determine the prevalence of Haemonchus contortus infections in dairy sheep and goats in continental and insular Greece, based on an abattoir survey, and (ii) to evaluate potential host-related risk factors including the age and sex, as well as the altitude, the management system, the co-existence of goats and sheep, the season, and the anthelmintic treatment, on the occurrence of haemonchosis. Methods: In total, 1004 abomasa of small ruminants were examined to evaluate the prevalence of Haemonchus spp. Moreover, a structured questionnaire was used to obtain relevant information regarding animal and farm characteristics. Haemonchus-like helminths were collected from the abomasa and used for the molecular species identification; a fragment of 321 base pairs of the internal transcribed spacer 2 sequence of nuclear DNA was amplified. Results: The prevalence of mono-species H. contortus infection of small ruminants was 37.2%. For sheep, a multivariable analysis revealed the anthelmintic treatment (treatment with pro/benzimidazoles), the age (lambs under 2 months old), and the management system (intensive management system) as significant factors for preventing H. contortus infection. Likewise, the management system (intensive management system), the anthelmintic treatment (treatment with macrocyclic lactones and their combination with pro/benzimidazoles), the altitude of the farms (farms located over 300 m above sea level), and the season (spring and summer) were significant risk factors in preventing H. contortus infection in goats. Conclusion: These findings emphasize the urgent need for targeted management practices and region-specific veterinary protocols to effectively reduce parasitic burdens.

AB  - The integration of fruit-based agroforestry systems with pulses, supported by nutrient management, presents a sustainable approach for developing nations, enhancing productivity along with soil and human health. This study evaluated the impact of planting conditions and nutrient management on the growth, yield, and soil attributes of Vigna mungo (mash) under a wild pomegranate-based agroforestry system. A factorial experiment using RBD with twelve integrated nutrient treatments (T1: RDF (recommended dose of fertilizer), T2: FYM (100% N equivalent basis), T3: Vermicompost (100% N equivalent basis), T4: Goat manure (100% N equivalent basis), T5: Jeevamrut @ 500 l/ha, T6: 50% RDF + 50% FYM, T7: 50% RDF + 50% VC, T8: 50% RDF + 50% GM, T9: 50% RDF + 50% Jeevamrut, T10: 50% RDF + 25% FYM + 25% VC, T11: 50% RDF + 25% GM + 25% Jeevamrut and T12: Control) were tested under both wild pomegranate canopy and open conditions, each replicated thrice. The results indicated that Vigna mungo exhibited better growth and yield parameters in open conditions compared to the wild pomegranate canopy with the T6 treatment. Post-harvest soil analysis revealed improvements in physical and chemical properties under the agroforestry system with T2. Economically, the agroforestry system with wild pomegranate + Vigna mungo yielded the highest net returns (US$ 1094.09 ha-1) and benefit-cost ratio (2.72) compared to monocropping. This study accentuates the potential of integrating fruit trees with pulse crops under appropriate nutrient management to achieve sustainable practices, improved farmer incomes and improve soil and human health.

AB  - For species that inhabit environments where resource availability may be unpredictable, balance of resource allocation to life-history traits can have heightened consequences for survival, reproduction, and ultimately, fitness. Acquisition and allocation of energy to maintenance, capital gain and reproduction should be in tune with the landscape an animal inhabits-environmental severity, food availability and population size all influence the resources animals have and dictate the ways they should be allocated. In seasonal environments, animals that experience periods of extreme resource limitation (e.g. harsh winters) may favour allocation of resources to body reserves to secure their survival at the cost of reproduction (i.e. risk averse). In contrast, the same accumulation of body reserves may not be necessary to survive in relatively benign landscapes where instead, allocation to reproduction is favoured (i.e. risk prone). According to the theory of risk-sensitive allocation of resources, when animals are exposed to unprecedented or life-threatening conditions, they may shift resource allocation to favour building capital over allocation in reproduction to preempt against encountering another life-threatening event in the future. Using data from a long-term project on a highly site-faithful and long-lived species, mule deer (Odocoileus hemionus), we evaluated how a life-threatening winter and the associated changes in resource availability resulting from a population reduction influenced how animals acquired and allocated energy to survival (i.e. fat accumulation). Per capita precipitation, and the associated reduction in population abundance after the severe winter, had a positive influence of accrual of fat over summer. After the extreme physiological stress of a hard winter, deer starting spring with low body reserves accumulated 2.8 percentage points more fat over summer compared with before the experience of a bad winter and had an increased probability of recruiting fewer offspring. Fat stores can interact with environment, life history and behaviour to influence survival during periods of resource scarcity. For a long-lived herbivore, we documented shifts in risk tolerance associated with fat accrual in preparation for winter, supporting the notion that risk-sensitive allocation of resources may be plastic-an essential adaptation for animals to cope with rapidly changing landscapes.

AB  - Progression of a spruce budworm outbreak over seven years is associated with increased soil nutrient fluxes and availability and improved foliage quality in surviving host trees. This could create a bottom-up feedback that sustains an insect outbreak.
   Top-down effects, like predation, are drivers of insect outbreaks, but bottom-up effects, like host nutritional quality, also influence outbreaks and could in turn be altered by insect-caused defoliation. We evaluated the prediction that herbivory leads to a positive feedback on outbreak severity as nutrient concentration in plant tissues increases through improved soil nutrient availability from frass and litter deposition. Over seven years of a spruce budworm outbreak, we quantified litter nutrient fluxes, soil nitrogen availability, and host tree foliar nutrient status along a forest susceptibility gradient. As the outbreak progressed, both soil nutrient fluxes and availability increased which, in turn, improved foliage quality in surviving host trees. This is consistent with boosted insect fitness and increased population density and defoliation as outbreaks grow. Our results suggest that a positive bottom-up feedback to forest ecosystems from defoliation may result in conditions favorable to self-amplifying population dynamics in insect herbivores that can contribute to driving broad-scale outbreaks.

AB  - Social living provides benefits to group members, but these benefits come at a cost. In fissionefusion societies, individuals or small groups leave and join different groups as ecological constraints on group size fluctuate. Little research has been conducted on how human disturbance influences fission efusion groups after accounting for ecological conditions. As a large, wide-ranging species with large resource needs facing increasing human disturbance (e.g. poaching and habitat loss), African forest elephants, Loxodonta cyclotis, provide unique insight into how environmental, social and anthropogenic factors influence group size. We reconstructed forest elephant social groups using noninvasive genetic samples extracted from elephant dung collected while tracking GPS-collared forest elephants. Through a novel application of hierarchical markerecapture models, we estimated group size and the anthropogenic, demographic and environmental factors associated with fluctuations in group size. We found that high fruit availability was associated with a decrease in group size and that human disturbance (measured as an index of the global human footprint) was associated with an increase in group size, but to a lesser degree. Understanding social group dynamics is important for ensuring effective population management of forest elephants, both for tracking when large groups might be at risk from poaching and preventing the negative health associations of suboptimal group sizes such as increased stress and decreased reproduction. Additionally, our integration of genotyping, satellite remote sensing and statistical methods can inform the study of forest elephants and other cryptic species into the future.

AB  - Soil water repellency (SWR) is a physical phenomenon whereby water cannot penetrate or has difficulty penetrating the soil surface. There are many factors involved in its occurrence, but the main factors controlling its emergence in loess remain unclear. In this work, we have studied numerous physicochemical and biological factors functioning in different dominant vegetations (Pinus tabulaeformis Carr., Robinia pseudoacacia L., and Hippophae rhamnoides L.) in a loess hilly region by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) and high-throughput sequencing techniques. We observed that more than 75% of the soils under Robinia and Hippophae are categorized as slightly or strongly water repellent, while nearly 50% of the soils under Pinus are categorized as severely to extremely water repellent. The relative concentrations of total free lipids in the soil in the same water-repellency class were Pinus > Robinia > Hippophae, where fatty acids, alkanols, and sterols were positively correlated with SWR, whereas alkanes were not. For the abundance and diversity index of bacterial and fungal communities, the three species ranked in the following order: Robinia approximate to Hippophae > Pinus. Thus, solvent-extractable polar waxes were indicated to be better preserved in water-repellent soils under Pinus due to lower microbial diversity than Robinia and Hippophae. Here, we demonstrate polar waxes to be the principal factor controlling SWR. Moreover, the dominant phyla of fungi varied greatly than those of bacteria under three vegetation types. Correlation analysis showed that the abundance of Actinobacteria in dominant bacteria increased with SWR. Nonmetric multidimensional scaling suggested the fungal community in different water-repellent soils under Pinus to vary more than those under Robinia and Hippophae. The indicator species mainly belonged to Actinobacteria in bacteria and Basidiomycota in fungi at the phylum level; this finding was further supported by the linear discriminant analysis (LDA) effect size (LEfSe). Additionally, GC-MS identified a small amount of ergosterol, a specific biomarker of fungi under Pinus. These pieces of evidence collectively reveal that severe to extreme SWR occurs under Pinus and appears to be the most influenced by fungi and actinomycetes when the topsoil is close to air drying. However, there is a need for further testing on different plant species or land use.

AB  - The interaction between endogenous dynamics and exogenous environmental variation is central to population dynamics. Although investigations into the effects of changing mean climate are widespread, changing patterns of variation in environmental forcing also affect dynamics in complex ways. Using wavelet and time series analyses, we identify a regime shift in the dynamics of a moth species in California from shorter to longer period oscillations over a 34-year census, and contemporaneous changes in regional precipitation dynamics. Simulations support the hypothesis that shifting precipitation dynamics drove changes in moth dynamics, possibly due to stochastic resonance with delayed density-dependence. The observed shift in climate dynamics and the interaction with endogenous dynamics mean that predicting future population dynamics will require information on both climatic shifts and their interaction with endogenous density-dependence, a combination that is rarely available. Consequently, models based on historical data may be unable to predict future population dynamics.

AB  - Toxocara vitulorum (Nematoda: Ascaridida) is a common parasite of cattle and buffaloes in tropical and subtropical regions and the causative agent of toxocarosis in calves. In Europe, sporadic infections have been reported in cattle, but also in bovines held at zoological gardens. Here, we report T. vitulorum infections in a herd of American bison (Bison bison) kept at the Vienna Zoo, Austria, which occurred in 2023 and 2024. After the first case in a seven-week-old calf in July 2023, another case in a five-week-old calf was diagnosed in May 2024, both of them detected by coproscopy and fecal discharge of adult worms after anthelminthic treatment. The calves originated from two different mothers imported to the zoo in 2014 from the Czech Republic and 2012 from Germany respectively. Both calves showed diarrhea and fecal soiling of the anal region prior to fecal analysis. Two intramuscular administrations of ivermectin (0.2 mg/kg bodyweight, two-week interval) caused the passing of up to 39 cm long gravid female worms, resulted in the cessation of egg shedding and improved fecal consistency. Morphological and molecular identification confirmed infections with T. vitulorum. Additionally, another calf, born in May 2024 from the mother of the calf that was T. vitulorum-positive in 2023, showed periods of diarrhea. Due to difficulties in taking individual samples, no definitive diagnosis of T. vitulorum infection could be made, however, the animal was also treated and clinically improved afterwards. Besides T. vitulorum, Eimeria spp. were detected in all samples and Giardia duodenalis genotype E in two samples in 2024. This case series highlights the possibility of unnoticed parasite introductions into zoological gardens via animals infected with resting parasite stages, and demonstrates the importance of regular individual parasitological analysis in bovine zoo animals during the first weeks after birth.

AB  - Currently, 14 of the 50 species of Lysmata are known to possess a long accessory branch with more than two articles. Historically, Lysmata intermedia and Lysmata moorei were the only two 'long-branch' species inhabiting the southwestern Atlantic. Here we describe, based on morphological, molecular and colour pattern data, a new species of Lysmata possessing a long accessory branch from Pernambuco, northeastern Brazil. Our maximum-likelihood analysis recovered Lysmata elisa sp. n. as a sister species to Lysmata jundalini. Both species are closely related to Lysmata holthuisi and L. intermedia. The four aforementioned species comprise the L. intermedia species complex. The new species may be morphologically distinguished from the other closely related species by different sets of characters, which include details of the dorsolateral antennular flagellum, armature of ischium of the second pair of pereiopods, intraorbital process shape and relative proportions of pereiopods. Our results reinforce the importance of refining biodiversity data through the application of integrative taxonomic approaches to expand the knowledge of local and global biodiversity. The biodiversity of Lysmata deserves special attention, as they are intensively exploited in the aquarium trade.

AB  - IntroductionPlant chemical defenses can influence the distribution, community composition, and abundance of soil biota. Urbanization plays a key role in shaping soil biotic communities either directly through changes in soil properties or indirectly via changes in plant characteristics such as defense traits. The effects of urbanization and plant defenses on the abundance and structure of aboveground plant-associated communities have been studied, yet their effects on belowground root-associated communities are poorly understood. MethodsHere we sampled white clover (Trifolium repens L.) leaves and roots along urban-rural gradients in the cities of Antwerp and Ghent, Belgium. We measured production of hydrogen cyanide (HCN) in leaves, a known defense trait against herbivores, and abundances of different feeding guilds of nematodes associated with the roots. ResultsWe found that HCN production decreased with increasing levels of urbanization in both cities. Urbanization was significantly correlated with shifts in root-associated nematode community structure in Antwerp but not in Ghent. Responses of nematode feeding guilds and trophic groups to urbanization were highly dependent on the clovers' HCN production, especially in Ghent. Changes in nematode channel ratio in Antwerp indicated that urban root-associated nematode communities of white clover were more strongly dominated by fungivorous nematodes. DiscussionOur results demonstrate that urbanization is driving changes in a plant phenotypic trait and in the community structure of root-associated nematodes, as well as that both changes interact. Plant defense mechanisms could thus help elucidate the effects of urbanization on root-associated biota communities. As strong differences existed between the two studied cities, the particular properties of cities should be taken into account to better understand the direction and strength of phenotypic trait changes driven by urbanization.

AB  - Tree hollows are important structural habitat features for secondary cavity-nesting birds, however, there has been limited research on how fire severity and frequency affect hollow abundance. Following a mega-fire on Kangaroo Island during the 2019-2020 Australian bushfire season, we conducted an opportunistic post-fire assessment of the fate of 144 monitored hollows in Eucalyptus cladocalyx and Eucalyptus leucoxylon trees used by endangered glossy black-cockatoos (Calyptorhynchus lathami halmaturinus) and yellow-tailed black-cockatoos (Zanda funerea). We investigated the relationship between burn severity, inter-fire interval, tree species and landscape position on the likelihood of tree hollow loss. We also compared the occupancy of nest boxes by both cockatoo species in fire-affected catchments pre-fire (2015-2017; 59 nest boxes) and post-fire (2020-2022; 52 nest boxes). Surveys revealed that 64.4% of monitored tree hollows within the burnt area were destroyed, as were the trees that contained them. Most monitored tree hollows (76.9%) were in areas that had not experienced fire in >50 years prior to the 2019-2020 fires. Tree hollow loss in 2020 was 29 times greater than the mean annual loss of 1.6% recorded in the 22 years prior. Burn severity, inter-fire interval, landscape matrix and tree species were poor predictors of hollow loss. However, increasing distance from forest edge slightly increased the probability of hollow loss. Post-fire, the proportion of nest boxes used for nesting by glossy black-cockatoos per annum increased to 0.70 +/- 0.09, compared to 0.50 +/- 0.03 pre-fire. However, the proportion of nest boxes used for nesting by yellow-tailed black-cockatoos per annum remained similar (post-fire 0.32 +/- 0.12; pre-fire 0.28 +/- 0.05). The mega-fires on Kangaroo Island in 2019-2020 resulted in tree hollow loss on a much larger scale than recorded in the 22 years prior, and subsequently, nest boxes have become an important resource for the endangered glossy black-cockatoo.

AB  - High-throughput sequencing and metabarcoding techniques provide a unique opportunity to study predator-prey relationships. However, in animal dietary preference studies, how to properly correct tissue bias within the sequence read count and the role of interactions between co-occurring species in metabarcoding mixtures remain largely unknown. In this study, we propose two categories of tissue bias correction indices: sequence read count number per unit tissue (SCN) and its ratio form (SCN ratio). By constructing plant mock communities with different numbers of co-occurring species in metabarcoding mixtures and conducting feeding trails on captive sika deer (Cervus nippon), we demonstrate the features of the SCN and SCN ratio, evaluate their correction effects and assess the role of species interactions during tissue bias correction. Tissue differences between species are defined as the differential ability to generate sequence counts. Our study suggests that pure tissue differences among species without a species interaction is not an optimal correction index for many biomes with limited tissue differences among species. Species interactions in mixtures may amplify tissue differences, which is beneficial for tissue bias correction. However, caution must be taken because varied species interactions among communities may increase the risk of worse correction. Correction effects based on the SCN and SCN ratio are comparable, but the SCN is less influenced by control species than the SCN ratio. Based on our study, several suggestions are provided for future animal diet studies or other high-throughput sequencing studies containing tissue bias.

AB  - Context is the milieu in which everything occurs. Many research studies consider context, or even explicitly manipulate it; yet it remains challenging to characterize. We know that a context surrounds and influences tasks; however, the boundaries of its influence are difficult to define. In behavioral science, context is often operationalized by the physical environment in which the experiment takes place, and the boundaries of the context are assumed to begin at the entrance to that of the room or apparatus. Experiences during transportation to the testing space have been shown to impact rodent behavior and memory, but transportation's relationship with novelty and physical environment is not fully understood. The current study explored how familiar vs. novel cues, both within a physical environment and preceding it, impact the perception of a context. We manipulated context on three levels: physical testing environment, object cues within that environment, and transportation cues preceding entrance to the testing environment. We found that novel transportation cues can change rats' perception of both familiar and novel contexts. The effects of transportation on perceived context may be affected by the length of the retention interval, testing environment, and behavioral range. These data suggest that context is a broad concept that includes cues across time and is sensitive to small differences in experience.

AB  - Mammals rely on the metabolic functions of their gut microbiota to meet their energetic needs and digest potentially toxic components in their diet. The gut microbiome plastically responds to shifts in host diet and may buffer variation in energy and nutrient availability. However, it is unclear how seasonal differences in the gut microbiome influence microbial metabolism and nutrients available to hosts. In this study, we examine seasonal variation in the gut metabolome of black howler monkeys (Alouatta pigra) to determine whether those variations are associated with differences in gut microbiome composition and nutrient intake, and if plasticity in the gut microbiome buffers shortfalls in energy or nutrient intake. We integrated data on the metabolome of 81 faecal samples from 16 individuals collected across three distinct seasons with gut microbiome, nutrient intake and plant metabolite consumption data from the same period. Faecal metabolite profiles differed significantly between seasons and were strongly associated with changes in plant metabolite consumption. However, microbial community composition and faecal metabolite composition were not strongly associated. Additionally, the connectivity and stability of faecal metabolome networks varied seasonally, with network connectivity being highest during the dry, fruit-dominated season when black howler monkey diets were calorically and nutritionally constrained. Network stability was highest during the dry, leaf-dominated season when most nutrients were being consumed at intermediate rates. Our results suggest that the gut microbiome buffers seasonal variation in dietary intake, and that the buffering effect is most limited when host diet becomes calorically or nutritionally restricted.

AB  - Recognizing and identifying tea plant (Camellia sinensis) cultivar plays a significant role in tea planting and germplasm resource management, particularly for oolong tea. There is a wide range of high-quality oolong tea with diverse varieties of tea plants that are suitable for oolong tea production. The conventional method for identifying and confirming tea cultivars involves visual assessment. Machine learning and computer vision-based automatic classification methods offer efficient and non-invasive alternatives for rapid categorization. Despite advancements in technology, the identification and classification of tea cultivars still pose a complex challenge. This paper utilized machine learning approaches for classifying 18 oolong tea cultivars based on 27 multispectral characteristics. Then the SVM classification model was executed using three optimization algorithms, namely genetic algorithm (GA), particle swarm optimization (PSO), and grey wolf optimizer (GWO). The results revealed that the SVM model optimized by GWO achieved the best performance, with an average discrimination rate of 99.91%, 93.30% and 92.63% for the training set, test set and validation set, respectively. In addition, based on the multispectral information (h, s, r, b, L, Asm, Var, Hom, Dis, & sigma;, S, G, RVI, DVI, VOG), the germination period of oolong tea cultivars can be completely evaluated by Fisher discriminant analysis. The study indicated that the practical protection of tea plants through automated and precise classification of oolong tea cultivars and germination periods is feasible by utilizing multispectral imaging system.

AB  - ContextCamera traps are widely used in ecological studies, including analyses of habitat use. However, the relationships between animal spatial behavior and landscape features obtained with camera traps have seldom been compared to those obtained with more established methods.ObjectivesWe evaluated the use of camera trap data to predict habitat use in red deer Cervus elaphus by comparing them to GPS telemetry data, used as a benchmark.MethodsWithin a 100 km2 study area in the Stelvio National Park (Italy), we collected red deer presence data from 50 camera traps from 2019 to 2023. In addition, 23 deer (15 females and 8 males) were equipped with global positioning system collars. For both types of data, we modeled presence/absence as a function of environmental variables using a generalized linear mixed modeling approach. Model estimates were compared in terms of directionality of the effects and of predicted habitat suitability.ResultsWe found a higher concordance of effect directionality and predicted suitability for females than for males, possibly due to limited sample size in the latter. Discrepancies were found in specific habitat relationships and may be due to inherent differences between telemetry-based and camera trap-based data.ConclusionsOur results suggest that camera trap data can capture coarse-scale patterns of habitat use, whereas telemetry data are more suitable for finer-scale analyses. The choice of which method to use depends on the research objectives.

AB  - Assessing conservation status and pursuing applicable management priorities for marine megafauna across multiple scales pose significant challenges. Because marine turtles exemplify these challenges, the IUCN Marine Turtle Specialist Group (MTSG) developed the 'conservation priorities portfolio' (CPP) framework in 2011 to evaluate population risk and threats for regional management units (RMUs). Here, the MTSG has updated the 2011 CPP framework through an inclusive assessment process. Expert elicitation results involving 145 individuals from 50 countries suggests that marine turtle conservation status appears to be improving, but significant challenges remain. Since the previous assessment, long-term abundance trends increased on average, and threat impact scores improved for nearly twice as many RMUs (53%) as worsened (28%) (>= 10% threshold for changes in numeric scores). While expert-assessed threat impacts have generally decreased, fisheries bycatch remains the highest scored threat across regions and species. Risk-threat staus improved for most (54%) RMUs. Over 40% of RMUs were scored as low risk-low threats, of which 8 were green turtles Chelonia mydas RMUs. Less than 20% of RMUs were scored as high risk-high threats, of which 4 were leatherback turtles Dermochelys coriacea. Most high risk-high threats RMUs were in the Pacific Ocean, while most low risk-low threats RMUs were in the Atlantic Ocean. Eleven RMUs were evaluated as having critical data needs. Our results-also provided through an interactive data dashboard-underscore the importance of context-specific planning to effectively target limited conservation resources. Future assessments should further prioritize inclusion of under-represented topics, researchers, and regions to better address multi-faceted conservation challenges.

AB  - Geopolymer concrete is an environment-friendly concrete that uses waste by-products from industries such as ground granulated blast furnace slag (GBFS) and fly ash as a substitution for cement in concrete. The African Buffalo Optimization (ABO) algorithm is utilized to select the proper mix. From the results of ABO, the paste and mortar type coating is prepared; the prepared mortar and paste type coating's compressive strength and setting time are measured. According to the outcomes, the alkali-activated material coatings based on fly ash and natural pozzolan (volcanic ash) with 1% and 5% acrylic emulsion P-2 and X-2 were selected and the M-2 mix is selected for paste-type coating. After the measurements, the concrete surface is coated with prepared mix coatings. The properties of geopolymer concrete with coatings such as compressive strength, adhesion strength, drying shrinkage, shear bond strength, chloride permeability, and capillary absorption of water were determined. From the results, the selected mix based on ABO gives higher strength and the durability was also high. It provides better strength, reduced shrinkage, water absorption, and chloride ion penetration than other techniques based on various polymeric additive coatings.

AB  - Site fidelity-the tendency to reuse familiar spaces-is expected to improve fitness. Familiarity with the local environment is particularly crucial when resource demands or predation risk are high. Consequently, site fidelity often peaks during reproduction when energetic costs are high and offspring are vulnerable. For many species, the environment they experience is not solely a function of geography but also of the social environment. Social fidelity, the selection for familiar social environments, could constitute an independent or parallel strategy to spatial fidelity when considering behaviour at the spatial-social interface. Using global positioning system locations from caribou across Newfoundland, we tested whether females selected calving sites based on proximity to familiar conspecifics, in addition to geographical (spatial) fidelity. These strategies were synergistic, not alternative, and correlated across the population but more variable within individuals. We also tested whether either form of fidelity affected reproductive success. We failed to detect an effect of spatial or social fidelity on reproductive success in this population. Nevertheless, given the association between social and spatial fidelity and the demonstrated fitness consequences of site fidelity in other systems, familiar conspecifics and the potential benefits these social partners provide may be an underappreciated component driving site fidelity. This article is part of the theme issue 'The spatial-social interface: a theoretical and empirical integration'.

AB  - We describe a flexible class of stochastic models that aim to capture key features of realistic patterns of animal movements observed in radio-tracking and global positioning system telemetry studies. In the model, movements are represented as a diffusion-based process evolving differently in heterogeneous regions. In this article, we extend the process of inference for heterogeneous movement models to the case in which boundaries of habitat regions are unknown and need to be estimated. Data augmentation is used in reconstructing the partition of the heterogeneous environment. The augmentation helps to diminish the impact of uncertainty about when and where the animal crosses habitat boundaries, and allows the extraction of additional information from the given observations. The approach to inference is Bayesian, using Markov chain Monte Carlo methods, allowing us to estimate both the parameters of the diffusion processes and the unknown boundaries. The suggested methodology is illustrated on simulated data and applied to real movement data from a radio-tracking experiment on ibex. Some model checking and model choice issues are also discussed.

AB  - Though a previous study in Sudan confirmed the existence of a living hybrid of an oceanic manta ray (Mobula birostris) and a reef manta ray (M. alfredi), courtship behaviors between the two closely related species have never been documented. Here we report the first observation of courtship behaviors between two male M. birostris and a female M. alfredi at a manta ray cleaning station on a shallow coral reef seamount in Misool, Raja Ampat, Indonesia. The observed courtship event lasted for approximately 45 min and involved one male oceanic manta actively chasing the mature reef manta female around the cleaning station and repeatedly bumping her on the left wing tip with his right cephalic lobe, while the second male continuously flanked the female to seemingly prevent her retreat from the cleaning station and potential evasion of the pursuing male. Notably, the female exhibited a rapid coloration change, likely indicative of courtship-related stress, transitioning from the striking pale hue she exhibited throughout the courtship activity to a normal chevron pattern once the males departed.

AB  - Recent advances in DNA sequencing and genotyping technologies are rapidly building our capacity to address ecological, evolutionary, and conservation questions for wildlife. However, wildlife genetic research increasingly relies on samples containing low quantities and quality of DNA, such as non-invasive, archival, and environmental DNA. These samples present unique methodological challenges; for samples collected in the wild, it is important to understand the impact of environmental exposure time or sample 'age' on DNA quality and downstream genetic analyses. Here, we aged koala (Phascolarctos cinereus) scats under natural conditions and quantified DNA degradation. We assessed the effect of age on genetic data quality by measuring the proportion of missing single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) data using DArTCap, a targeted genotyping methodology hypothesised to tolerate degraded DNA. Contrary to other studies, we found koala scat age was not a significant predictor of genotyping quality (i.e., rate of missing SNP calls) in the first 10 days of environmental exposure. We yielded high quality data from 10-day-old scats, but also low-quality data from fresh scats. This study is the first to investigate the effect of scat age on genotyping success using a targeted approach, and DArTCap specifically. These findings support the use of targeted genotyping (such as DArTCap) from scats and provide insights for future research using DNA from non-invasive samples. Targeted genotyping may extend the timeframe, from which accurate data can be obtained from non-invasive samples, increasing potential sample sizes and enhancing our ability to address important questions in population ecology, conservation genetics, and population management.

AB  - The effects of a composite polyphenolic-rich extract (CPRE) on ruminal fermentation, nutrient utilisation, growth performance, excretion of nitrogen and phosphorus and methane emission were studied in growing buffaloes. Four herbal dry extracts prepared from Acacia arabica (babul; bark), Acacia catechu (cutch; bark), Punica granatum (pomegranate; peel) and Eugenia jambolana (Indian blackberry; seeds) were mixed in an equal proportion (1:1:1:1) to prepare the CPRE that contained mainly phenolic compounds (146 g/kg), flavonoids (41.7 g/kg) and saponins (40.5 g/kg). First, in vitro tests were performed for ruminal fermentation and feed degradability using ruminal fluid as inocula and CPRE at 0 to 40 g/kg substrate to decide an optimal dose of CPRE for an in vivo study on buffaloes. In the animal study, 20 buffaloes were randomly assigned to two groups (n = 10)-a control diet and a CPRE diet (control diet added with extra 20 g/kg of CPRE). The in vitro tests suggested that addition of CPRE at 20 g/kg substrate increased degradability of substrate, short-chain fatty acid concentration and propionate proportion, and reduced methane production, acetate proportion, acetate:propionate ratio and ammonia concentration in fermentation media, which were also noted in the rumen of buffaloes. Feeding CRPE to buffaloes did not affect feed intake, but increased daily body weight gain, dry matter and crude protein digestibility and nitrogen and phosphorus retention in the body. Total bacteria, methanogens and protozoal numbers were similar between two groups, but Fibrobacter succinogenes increased in the rumen of buffaloes fed CPRE. Concentrations of total, essential, non-essential and glucogenic amino acids were greater in the plasma of CPRE-fed buffaloes. Cell-mediated immune response improved in the CPRE-fed buffaloes compared with the control group. Estimated methane production and excretion of nitrogen and phosphorus per unit of body weight gain decreased in the CPRE group. The comprehensive results of this study clearly suggested that the composite polyphenol-rich feed additive at 20 g/kg diet improved growth performance, ruminal fermentation, immunity and plasma amino acids profile, whereas it reduced indicators of environmental impacts of buffalo production.

AB  - Our goal was to investigate heparin-induced capacitation of frozen-thawed yak sperm and to assess the effects of caffeine or ouabain supplementation with heparin on sperm capacitation. Sperm were incubated with varying heparin concentrations, namely 0, 12.5, 25, 50 and 100 mu g/ml, for 0, 15, 30 and 60 min. In every treatment, sperm capacitation was assessed using microscopic examination of the sperm acrosomal status and western blot analysis of the levels of tyrosine phosphorylation (Tyr-P). Based on our results, the optimal condition for frozen-thawed yak sperm capacitation was a 30-min exposure to 50-mu g/ml heparin. Next, we incubated frozen-thawed yak sperm with 50-mu g/ml heparin, along with varying concentrations of caffeine supplementation, namely 0, 2.5, 5 and 10 mM for 30 min. Interestingly, caffeine significantly increased yak sperm acrosome reaction (AR) and Tyr-P (p < .05). The optimal caffeine concentration was 5 mM, followed by 2.5 and 10 mM, with the lowest AR and Tyr-P found in sperm cells that did not receive any caffeine. To examine the effects of ouabain on sperm capacitation, we next incubated frozen-thawed yak sperm with 50-mu g/ml heparin, along with varying concentrations of ouabain, namely 0, 25, 50 and 100 mu M for 30 min. We demonstrated that ouabain supplementation did not alter yak sperm AR or Tyr-P in sperm cells, relative to the control (p > .05). In summary, our findings suggested that caffeine acts synergistically with heparin to increase yak sperm capacitation, but ouabain does not synergize with heparin to promote yak sperm capacitation.

AB  - Changes in Southern Ocean thermohaline conditions could drive changes in phytoplankton community composition propagating into upper-trophic levels, from the abundance and composition of mid-trophic level communities to foraging behaviour of top marine predators. Studies exploring the ecological consequences of such processes are largely limited by our in-situ observation capacity. The simultaneous deployment of a miniature sonar tag, combining active acoustics and movement sensors, with oceanographic tags on 4 adult female southern elephant seals from the Kerguelen Islands provided in-situ measurements of thermohaline conditions, mid-trophic level abundance and seal-foraging behaviour. In addition, chlorophyll-a concentration and relative abundance of different phytoplankton size classes were assessed from satellite ocean colour data. This study reveals that east of the Kerguelen Islands, the subsurface scatterer abundance (related to mid-trophic level organisms) assessed by the sonar tag was partly positively linked to surface satellite-derived microphytoplankton biomass, especially in colder waters and frontal zones. Female elephant seals were found to dive shallower with higher subsurface scatterer abundance, which indicated a better prey accessibility, and were found to catch more prey when foraging in shallow and/or frontal zones. This study highlights the usefulness of the sonar tag, deployed on deep-diving elephant seals, to link thermohaline conditions and phytoplankton community composition in mid-trophic levels. Our result suggests that in addition to phytoplankton biomass, mid-trophic level abundance and distribution might be key factors in influencing top-marine predator foraging performances.

AB  - Identification of the key biotic and abiotic drivers within food webs is important for understanding species abundance changes in ecosystems, particularly across ecotones where there may be strong variation in interaction strengths. Using structural equation models (SEMs) and four decades of integrated data from the San Francisco Estuary, we investigated the relative effects of top-down, bottom-up, and environmental drivers on multiple trophic levels of the pelagic food web along an estuarine salinity gradient and at both annual and monthly temporal resolutions. We found that interactions varied across the estuarine gradient and that the detectability of different interactions depended on timescale. For example, for zooplankton and estuarine fishes, bottom-up effects appeared to be stronger in the freshwater upstream regions, while top-down effects were stronger in the brackish downstream regions. Some relationships (e.g., bottom-up effects of phytoplankton on zooplankton) were seen primarily at annual timescales, whereas others (e.g., temperature effects) were only observed at monthly timescales. We also found that the net effect of environmental drivers was similar to or greater than bottom-up and top-down effects for all food web components. These findings can help identify which trophic levels or environmental factors could be targeted by management actions to have the greatest impact on estuarine forage fishes and the spatial and temporal scale at which responses might be observed. More broadly, this study highlights how environmental gradients can structure community interactions and how long-term data sets can be leveraged to generate insights across multiple scales.

AB  - Maintaining a restrained animal's safety is imperative when live-trapping wildlife for research or management purposes. Trap monitor systems, which allow remote checking of traps, can reduce the amount of time animals are restrained and lower the risk of negative health effects. Although a number of trap monitor systems have been developed, no prior study has evaluated the use of commercially-available, cellular network-linked cameras (hereafter, cellular cameras) for remote trap monitoring. We used cellular cameras to monitor Columbian black-tailed deer (Odocoileus hemionus columbianus) capture efforts in southern Oregon, USA, to determine whether they acted as an effective trap monitor system. Using cellular cameras, we monitored 40 live-traps in 12 locations for 523 camera-days in 2020. We estimated a >7 hr reduction in response time to captured deer when monitoring live-traps via cellular cameras as compared to daily, visual trap checks. Additionally, we noted occasional camera failures caused by drained batteries, inconsistent cellular signal, and photo-processing issues and provide recommendations for avoiding or remediating these problems. Data gathered from cellular cameras also helped inform other animal welfare considerations and guide refinement of trapping efforts. We provide discussion of the benefits and limitations of cellular cameras as a trap monitor system. Overall, we suggest that cellular cameras are a promising tool for monitoring live-trapping efforts and improving trapping programs but require a robust failsafe mechanism be in place to guarantee animal safety.

AB  - Soil phototrophic microorganisms (algae, cyanobacteria) play a very important role in functioning of anthropogenic systems. They take an active part in soil self-purification by directly absorbing biogenic elements, as well as by stimu-lating the activity of mineralizing microorganisms at the expense of disengaged oxygen. The research was carried out at a plough field with sod-podzol soil situated near a large pig-breeding farm. Neutralization took place due to natural microbiological processes during the time of disgorging the liquid fraction in the lagoons. Long-term application of ma-nure runoff from pig-breeding farms into plough soil had an impact on species diversity of phototrophic microorganisms, which was considered in the research. Groups of species tolerant to the impact formed in the soil in course of long-term application of liquid manure fraction. The influence of long-term runoff of manure from pig breeding farms on specious diversity of soil phototrophic microorganisms was assessed. In plough soils affected by liquid manure runoff a group of species tolerant to this impact has formed. Their basis is represented by green algae: Klebsormidium flaccidum, K. nitens, Chlorococcum infusionum, Chlorella vulgaris, as well as by the heterocyst-free cyanobacteria Phormidium autumnale and the diatom alga Hantzschia amphioxys. On the surface of plough soil these species make microscopically marked films, i. e. soil "blooming" takes place. General species diversity of microphototrophs in soil of the experimental site is lower than that of the control site. Jaccard coefficient of the experimental and control sites of the field is 47.8%. Nitrogen-fixing cyanobacteria are not represented in the microphototrophic community; it indicates that the natural microcoenosis is damaged in the plough soils and nitrogen content is high.

AB  - Dental microwear texture analysis (DMTA) is widely used for diet inferences in extant and extinct vertebrates. Often, a reference tooth position is analysed in extant specimens, while isolated teeth are lumped together in fossil datasets. It is therefore important to test whether dentalmicrowear texture (DMT) is tooth position specific and, if so, what causes the differences in wear. Here, we present results from controlled feeding experiments with 72 guinea pigs, which received either fresh or dried natural plant diets of different phytolith content (lucerne, grass, bamboo) or pelleted diets with and without mineral abrasives (frequently encountered by herbivorous mammals in natural habitats). We tested for gradients in dentalmicrowear texture along the upper cheek tooth row. Regardless of abrasive content, guinea pigs on pelleted diets displayed an increase in surface roughness along the tooth row, indicating that posterior tooth positions experience more wear compared with anterior teeth. Guinea pigs feedings on plants of low phytolith content and low abrasiveness (fresh and dry lucerne, fresh grass) showed almost no DMT differences between tooth positions, while individuals feeding on more abrasive plants (dry grass, fresh and dry bamboo) showed a gradient of decreasing surface roughness along the tooth row. We suggest that plant feeding involves continuous intake and comminution by grinding, resulting in posterior tooth positions mainly processing food already partly comminuted and moistened. Pelleted diets require crushing, which exerts higher loads, especially on posterior tooth positions, where bite forces are highest. These differences in chewing behaviour result in opposing wear gradients for plant versus pelleted diets.

AB  - Knowledge of the controls affecting the release of contaminants from waste rock dumps is critical for developing strategies to mitigate downstream impacts on water quality. In this study, a three-dimensional model of a large coal waste rock dump constructed in the Elk Valley, British Columbia, Canada was developed to capture the impact of construction history (1981-2012) and solute transport on nitrate (NO3-) release over a 100-year timeframe. The model consisted of 21, one-dimensional finite element models that represented the temporal evolution of the dump. Nitrate, derived from undetonated blast products, was assumed to be present at the time of waste rock placement and was simulated as a conservative species. The simulated pattern of NO3- release to the surface water receptor occurred approximately 8 years before its measured arrival. This time lag is attributed to displacement of the water within a basal alluvial aquifer by dump effluent. The simulated patterns of historic releases corrected for the 8-year time lag, compare favourably with monitoring data and suggest the dominant hydrogeological and geochemical mechanisms are captured in the model. The model indicated the flushing of NO3- from the dump should be complete by about 2042 with a peak effluent concentration of NO3- in 2008. The addition of reclamation covers to the model resulted in an immediate decrease in the annual NO3- loading rate but extended the time frame for NO3- release from the dump relative to the no cover case. The model also showed that the timing of cover placement had little impact on NO3- release relative to the no cover case due to long duration of waste rock placement (similar to 30 years) over a relatively large footprint.

AB  - The Svalbard region faces drastic environmental changes, including sea-ice loss and "Atlantification" of Arctic waters, caused primarily by climate warming. These changes result in shifts in the sea-ice-associated (sympagic) community structure, with consequences for the sympagic food web and carbon cycling. To evaluate the role of sympagic biota as a source, sink, and transmitter of carbon, we sampled pack ice and under-ice water (0-2 m) north of Svalbard in spring 2015 by sea-ice coring and under-ice trawling. We estimated biomass and primary production of ice algae and under-ice phytoplankton as well as biomass, carbon demand, and secondary production of sea-ice meiofauna (>10 mm) and under-ice fauna (>300 mm). Sea-ice meiofauna biomass (0.1-2.8 mg C m(-2)) was dominated by harpacticoid copepods (92%), nauplii (4%), and Ciliophora (3%). Under-ice fauna biomass (3.2-62.7 mg C m(-2)) was dominated by Calanus copepods (54%). Appendicularia contributed 23% through their high abundance at one station. Herbivorous sympagic fauna dominated the carbon demand across the study area, estimated at 2 mg C m(-2) day(-1) for ice algae and 4 mg C m(-2) day(-1) for phytoplankton. This demand was covered by the mean primary production of ice algae (11 mg C m(-2) day(-1)) and phytoplankton (30 mg C m(-2) day(-1)). Hence, potentially 35 mg C m(-2) day(-1) of algal material could sink from the sympagic realm to deeper layers. The demand of carnivorous under-ice fauna (0.3 mg C m(-2) day(-1)) was barely covered by sympagic secondary production (0.3 mg C m(-2) day(-1)). Our study emphasizes the importance of under-ice fauna for the carbon flux from sea ice to pelagic and benthic habitats and provides a baseline for future comparisons in the context of climate change.

On islands where rats were never introduced, seabirds transfer nutrients from pelagic to terrestrial and nearshore marine habitats, which in turn enhance the productivity, biomass, and functioning of recipient ecosystems.(4-6) Here, we test whether rat eradication restores seabird populations, their nutrient subsidies, and some of their associated benefits for ecosystem function to tropical islands and adjacent coral reefs. By comparing islands with different rat invasion histories, we found a clear hierarchy whereby seabird biomass, seabird-driven nitrogen inputs, and the incorporation of seabird-derived nutrients into terrestrial and marine food chains were highest on islands where rats were never introduced, intermediate on islands where rats were eradicated 4-16 years earlier, and lowest on islands with invasive rats still present. Seabird-derived nutrients diminished from land to sea and with increasing distance to rat-eradicated islands, but extended at least 300 m from shore. Although rat eradication enhanced seabird-derived nutrients in soil, leaves, marine algae, and herbivorous reef fish, reef fish growth was similar around rat-eradicated and rat-infested islands. Given that the loss of nutrient subsidies is of global concern,7 that removal of invasive species restores previously lost nutrient pathways over relatively short timescales is promising. However, the full return of cross-ecosystem nutrient subsidies and all of their associated demographic benefits may take multiple decades.

AB  - Measurements obtained from aerial imagery can be used to calculate body shape, condition and growth rates of large surface-associated marine megafauna. In this study, an unoccupied aerial vehicle (UAV) was used to obtain aerial images of an elasmobranch species, the whale shark (Rhincodon typus). Pre-caudal length (PCL) and multiple body width measurements were taken from aerial images of 26 juvenile whale sharks, obtained between November 2020 and February 2021 in the La Paz Bay, Mexico. PCL ranged from 2.98 to 6.43 m, with a mean of 4.93 m (SD =1.00). Body width was found to be greatest in the region by the snout and anterior contacts of the pectoral fins. Body width decreased in a near-linear manner from similar to 18% PCL at the midpoint to similar to 10% PCL at the posterior end of the body. There was a significant linear relationship between whale shark dorsal surface area (SA) and PCL on the log-log scale (LM: F1,24 = 647.7, P < 0.001), showing that whale sharks increase exponentially in overall body size as they increase in body length. However, there was no effect of PCL on the relative body width at the different measurement sites, suggesting that body shape of whale sharks was similar across the size range measured in this study. Finally, the body condition of the sharks, measured as the residual of the relationship between SA and PCL, varied between - 21.6% and +14.0%. This study highlights the benefits of using UAV photogrammetry to measure large marine fauna, to obtain valuable morphometric data to study their physiology and bioenergetics.

AB  - The Muscomorpha is one of the most species-rich brachyceran groups in Diptera, with many species serving as important disease vectors; however, its high-level phylogenetic relationships have long been controversial and unsolved. This study comparatively analyzed the characteristics of mitogenomes of 131 species that represent 18 superfamilies in Muscomorpha, in which mitogenomes of 16 species have been newly sequenced and annotated, demonstrating that their gene composition, order, AT bias, length variation, and codon usage are consistent with documented dipteran mitogenomes. The phylogenetic topologies demonstrated that the robustness of Muscomorpha and major clades within Muscomorpha are monophyletic: Cyclorrhapha, Schizophora, and Calyptratae. A clade of Empidoidea were recovered as the sister group to Cyclorrhapha. Within Cyclorrhapha, Platypezoidea and Syrphoidea were sequentially placed as basal groups of the Cyclorrhapha. The remaining cyclorrhaph superfamilies gathered as two main clades. Ephydroidea were, in most cases, placed as the sister group to Calyptratae. Within Calyptratae, Hippoboscoidea were sister to an assemblage of lineages composed of an Oestroid grade and Muscoidea. The Muscomorpha was proposed to originate in the early Jurassic, and the main clade diversified near the Cretaceous-Paleogene extinction event, estimated using the MCMCtree and six fossil calibration points. The ancestral area of origin and geographic range of Muscomorpha was deduced to be the Palaearctic region with 56.9% probability using the RASP software based on a dated tree.

AB  - Homeostasis preservation is essential for animal survival, and any event that causes a disturbance in homeostasis is defined as a stressor. Here, we aimed to evaluate the effect of scratch brushes and stages as an environmental enrichment to alleviate stress in dairy goats. Twenty-four mixed-breed goats were divided into two groups according to common physiological conditions in breeding farms: milking and dry (milk-producing and non-milk-producing, respectively). Ten days after exposure to environmental enrichment treatment or not (control), blood was sampled. Following the enrichment, we observed a reduction in reactive oxidative stress metabolites, advanced glycation end products (AGEs), and their binding protein (transferrin) in the dry goats, as determined by an ELISA. In contrast, no change in AGEs, along with an increase in transferrin levels, was observed in the milking goats. Moreover, oxytocin levels decreased in the dry and increased in the milking goats, while serotonin levels increased in the dry and remained unchanged in the milking goats. Additionally, gene expression of the cytokines, IL-6 and IL-1 ss, and anti-oxidative proteins, lysozyme and transferrin (in peripheral blood leukocytes), as determined by qPCR, presented the same pattern: down-regulation in the dry or up-regulation in the milking goats. In conclusion, a reliable methodology was developed for measuring husbandry stress in goats and to improve dairy goats' husbandry practice. Current environmental enrichment produced different responsiveness in goats correlated to their physiological status: beneficial effect in dry goats, detrimental effect in milking goats.

AB  - The rise of the Isthmus of Panama is one of the major biogeographical events of the Cenozoic. It is a massive natural experiment in biological migrations, as lands formerly separated-South America and Central/North America-became connected. There is, however, a difference in timing between the final closure of the Isthmus (4.2-3.5 Ma) and the onset of the massive mammal migrations (i.e., Great American Biotic Interchange, GABI, 2.7 Ma). This time lag has been brought up to suggest that other factors rather than a land connection were major drivers of the GABI. A large biome change from forest to savanna in Central America and Northwestern South America could have provided the conduit for accelerating the biotic interchange between both continents. This hypothesis has been rarely tested as the Plio-Pleistocene fossil record of those regions has not been sufficiently studied. Gheny K. Shuster discovered a brand new Upper Pleistocene fossil deposit in and under the Cauca River (Southwestern Colombia), one of such possible migration corridors. We conducted a field geophysical and sedimentological study to understand the geometry of the fossil-rich deposits, dated them using carbon isotopes (C14), and assessed the type of biome (savanna versus forest) that dominated the region by looking at pollen samples. We found that the conglomerates accumulated in lenticular bodies, perpendicular to the modern course of the Cauca River during the Late Pleistocene in alluvial fan settings. The vegetation corresponds to a tropical dry forest and there is no evidence of extensive savannas. The Cauca River deposits could become a relevant site for the Neotropical Pleistocene.

AB  - We aim to elucidate the long-term effects of elevated CO2 concentrations on the defensive traits of forest tree leaves using Fagus crenata saplings grown for 7-9 years in the free-air CO2 enrichment (FACE) system from 2003 to 2011. During 2009-2011, we checked the leaf phenology from budburst to leaf expansion and seasonal changes in defensive traits of leaves such as leaf mass per area (LMA) and concentration of condensed tannin because phenological synchrony between the leaf maturing process and herbivorous insects' emergence and feeding timing is essential. As a result, there was little difference in leaf phenology and the emergence of herbivorous insects between FACE and control sites. LMA increased significantly in 2010 and 2011, and carbon/nitrogen ratio increased significantly in 2009 and 2011 in FACE sites than in control sites. There were significantly higher total phenolics and condensed tannin concentrations at FACE sites than at control sites in only 2009. On the other hand, microscopic observation revealed no differences in the distribution of phenolic substances between FACE and control sites. Our results after 9 years of CO2 exposure showed that the effect of CO2 on each defensive trait varied from year to year. This could be because the experimental CO2 concentration was not high enough to have an effect or because it was a field experiment and other environmental factors were more critical.

AB  - Chlamydia are obligate intracellular bacterial pathogens affecting humans and animals, causing miscarriage, stillbirth, or weak fetuses in the late stages of pregnancy of goats and sheep. Because there is no commercial vaccine for chlamydia in animals, drug treatment has become the most effective curative method. Natural products, also known as secondary metabolites, are becoming one of the main sources used in new drug development because of their structural diversity and biodiversity. In natural products, plant sources play a major role in the development process of new drugs. In this study, five undescribed highly oxygenated bisabolane sesquiterpenes (Pararubin W, Pararubin X, Pararubin Y., Pararubin Z, and Pararubin AA) were isolated from whole plants of Ligularia narynensis. Their chemical structures were determined via analyses of HRESIMS, IR, 1D, and 2D NMR data, along with the assignment of their relative configurations. These compounds were tested for their anti-chlamydial activity. The results show that compounds 1 and 5 inhibited the growth of Chlamydia abortus in host cells in a dose-dependent manner.

AB  - Small-scale fisheries are often considered data poor due to amyriad of complex factors. Precise estimates of key demographic rates are central to the sustainable management of these fisheries. We used 3 years of acoustic telemetry data to derive survival estimates of Greenland halibut (Reinhardtius hippoglossoides; n = 255) within a small-scale community fishery in Pangnirtung, Nunavut. Cormack-Jolly-Seber survival estimates were similar for the three top models (quarterly phi > 0.80) and detection probability varied with time and as a result of different tag configurations used (p(Tag type + t)). Survival also differed depending on the location and timing of fish tagging (phi(Catch); summer vs. winter). A further joint analysis combining detections of live fish and returned tags estimated quarterly survival and site fidelity probability (s = 0.97, 0.92-1.00 CI (credible interval) and f = 0.96, 0.92-1.00 CI, respectively). Survival estimates were unachievable using traditional tagging methods, highlighting the value of acoustic telemetry mark-recapture as a management tool for estimating demographic parameters for poorly known small-scale fisheries.

AB  - Though bioaccumulation of pharmaceuticals by aquatic organisms continues to receive scientific attention, the internal disposition of these contaminants among different tissue compartments of fish species has been infrequently investigated, particularly among fish at different trophic positions. We tested a human to fish biological read-across hypothesis for contaminant disposition by examining tissue-specific accumulation in three understudied species, longnose gar (Lepisosteus osseus; piscivore), gizzard shad (Dorosoma cepedianum; planktivore/detritivore), and smallmouth buffalo (Ictiobus bubalus; benthivore), from a river influenced by municipal effluent discharge. In addition to surface water, fish plasma, and brain, gill, gonad, liver, and lateral muscle fillet tissues were analyzed via isotope dilution liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry. Caffeine and sucralose, two common effluent tracers, were quantitated at low micrograms per liter levels in surface water, while an anticonvulsant, carbamazepine, was observed at levels up to 37 ng/L. The selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) fluoxetine and sertraline and primary metabolites were detected in at least one tissue of all three species at low micrograms per kilogram concentrations. Within each species, brain and liver of select fish contained the highest levels of SSRIs compared to plasma and other tissues, which is generally consistent with human tissue disposition patterns. However, we observed differential accumulation among specific tissue types and species. For example, mean levels of sertraline in brain and liver tissues were 13.4 mu g/kg and 1.5 mu g/kg in gizzard shad and 1.3 mu g/kg and 7.3 mu g/kg in longnose gar, respectively. In contrast, smallmouth buffalo did not consistently accumulate SSRIs to detectable levels. Tissue-specific eco-exposome efforts are necessary to understand mechanisms associated with such marked bioaccumulation and internal dispositional differences among freshwater fish species occupying different trophic positions.

AB  - Translocations of musk deer males in a coniferous forest of the Sikhote-Alin Nature Reserve were studied in 2014-2015 in order to determine home range use in relation to environmental factors and social environment. The study methods included many-day long tracking, visual observations of musk deers accustomed to humans, radio tracking, and habitat analyses. GIS technologies and mathematical data processing were used. As a result, a variant of home range use, in which the musk deer male maintained the external size (1.02-1.1 km(2)) and shape of a home range for a long time while redistributing its activity in the general center of its activity (39% size of the home range) was identified. The neighbor male home ranges overlapped with the home range of the resident to 64.7-65.5%, while the center of activity to 53.5%. The amount of the main food sources (epiphytic lichens) at different times was 60-300 times higher than the needs of a musk deer. In the conditions of food availability over the entire area, the distribution of musk deer activity, scent marks, and male translocation patterns were generally coordinated with the social environment such as the distribution of females and the visits of activity kernels by male neighbors. Remote contacts between males prevailed. The distribution of musk deer crossings included wide traversal "lanes" and a central system that combined local activity kernels. This structure was consistent both with relief forms and the boundaries of plant communities. A significant time (more than 84%) of the presence of a male in the center of the activity of its home range was associated with frequent visits of male neighbors. These were accompanied by the formation by the resident male of modules as functional elements of the structure, in which the musk deer sustained its life and protection in the form of "duty patrolling" and created barriers from the penetration of male neighbors.

AB  - Phytoseiidae mites' survival and reproduction depend on optimal environmental factors. A total of five different agro-ecological zones (AEZs) were surveyed twice each year from 2017 to 2019 in Kenya. In Eastern Kenya sample farms were small scale citrus orchards in the counties of Machakos [Low Midlands-Four (LM4)] and Makueni [Upper Midlands-Three (LM3)]. In the Coastal Lowlands-Four (CL4) similar small-scale citrus plots were sampled in Kwale, while in the highland Rift Valley region sample sites were ADC-Suam orchards of Kitale of the Lower Highlands-Two (LH2), where the large-scale farms were under citrus crop culture. The fifth site sampled was Baringo area of the Low Midlands-Five (LM5) where small plot citrus crop dominated the sample sites. Out of 68 fields of repeat surveys, 40% of citrus plots yielded varied diversity of phytoseiid mites. The major pest from the sites was citrus brown mite, Eutetranychus africanus. In this study, population fluctuation of phytoseiid mites was observed under different climatic conditions of temperature, relative humidity, dew-point and citrus plant age (in years). On the major pest E. africanus, three factors were evaluated for correlation and significance to infestation levels on the citrus crop. Of the three evaluated factors of temperature, citrus tree age and phytoseiid density in the orchards, temperature parameter did not significantly influence the pest mite (E. africanus) infestation levels for all combined AEZs factors. In the present case studies of specific AEZs, older trees led to higher pest mite density while low phytoseiid numbers correlated inversely to higher E. africanus infestation levels on the citrus trees. The information here could be used proactively to plan for management of E. africanus as the major pest in citrus orchards in specific agro-ecological zones.

AB  - Considering the interconnections between human well-being, animal welfare, and the environment, this study aimed to investigate the impacts of drought and the COVID-19 pandemic on small-scale goat farmers' well-being and their perception of goats' welfare following the One Welfare framework. Using a telephone survey, close-ended questions, and Likert scales, we assessed the impacts of drought and the COVID-19 pandemic on human well-being and animal welfare in the Coquimbo region of Chile. The DASS-21 questionnaire was used to evaluate farmers' mental health. Goat farmers perceived the scarcity of water and food for animals as factors that negatively affected animal productivity and welfare and caused an increase in farmers' stress levels. Farmers who had not been visited by a veterinarian showed higher levels of stress than those who received one visit during the year (M = 10 vs. 2, p = 0.025). Additionally, farmers who perceived better welfare of their animals showed lower levels of depression (r(s) = -0.17, p = 0.048), anxiety (r(s) = -0.21, p = 0.016), and stress (r(s) = -0.33, p < 0.001). These findings emphasize the importance of addressing farmers' mental health and veterinary support as crucial aspects to ensure both goat welfare and farm productivity.

AB  - The likelihood of success of a marine protected area (MPA) is strongly dependent on stakeholders' support. A concern often raised by local fishers is their lack of involvement in the design or management of a MPA and their loss of income owing to lost fishing grounds. We used Algoa Bay, South Africa, as a case study to analyse fisher's and fish-processing factory managers' concerns and perceived economic losses from fishing closures using structured interviews. Since 2009, a 20 km-radius purse-seine fishing-exclusion zone has been tested in Algoa Bay to assess the benefit to population recovery of the endangered African penguin Spheniscus demersus. Costs to the industry were estimated in terms of loss of catches and additional travel time to fishing grounds with and without closures. Fisher responses to interviews revealed general support for conservation and MPAs, but individuals interviewed did not feel that the 20 km fishing exclusion zones in Algoa Bay would aid African penguin conservation. While they systematically raised concerns about potential economic costs to their industry from closures, neither their catch sizes nor travel times varied significantly with fishing exclusion measures. Acknowledgement and assessment of the economic concerns may aid in initiating an informed dialogue amongst the various stakeholders in Algoa Bay, which may increase compliance and success of the newly proclaimed Addo elephant National Park MPA. Continued dialogue may also act as a catalyst for more integrated ocean management of biodiversity and human uses in the bay.

AB  - Habitat loss and fragmentation are two of the biggest threats facing wildlife today. Understanding the role of wildlife pathways in connecting resource areas is key for maintaining landscape connectivity, reducing the impacts of habitat loss and helping address human-wildlife conflict. In this study, we used sign surveys and camera trapping to understand the fine scale movement of elephants moving between a protected area and agricultural zone in the Masai Mara, Kenya. We used generalised linear models to determine factors driving high frequency of pathway use by elephants. Our results showed strong seasonal trends in pathway use, with peaks coinciding with the dry season. However, no correlations between rainfall and pathway use were found. Temporal patterns of pathway use indicate that elephants use risk avoidance strategies by moving between the two areas at times of low human disturbance. Spatial analysis revealed that the most frequently used pathways were closer to farms, saltlicks and forest and those that had a higher percentage of forest cover. Our models also showed a positive relationship between pathway use and the number of elephant crop raiding incidents, highlighting that pathways can play a role in human-elephant conflict. As habitat loss continues, pathways may become more important for linking resources. However, they are also likely to facilitate movement into farmland. The results from this study provide an opportunity for planned management activities to ensure connectivity and to mitigated conflict.

AB  - In circumboreal regions, Rangifer populations depend heavily on ground reindeer lichens ( Cladonia subgenus Cladina) ) during the winter, but this critical resource was depleted over the 20th century as a result of land encroachment and habitat loss. Fires, both wild and controlled, can also contribute to the decline of reindeer lichen. Depending on the context, accelerating the return of winter pasture through reindeer lichen transplantation after fire may be needed to conserve threatened caribou populations and semi-domestic reindeer herding. Following a field experiment established in 2008, two years after a forest fire, we evaluated the success of restoration through lichen transplantation, measuring biomass on restoration, control and reference sites. We also assessed the dispersal of lichen fragments from the restoration plots into the surrounding burnt area. Eleven growing seasons after lichen transplantation, the lichen biomass measured on restoration sites (62 g m(-2)) was on average significantly higher than on control sites (0.8 g m(-2)), but remained non-significantly lower than on reference sites (109 g m(-2)). This confirms the success of the transplanting operation and the remaining progress towards a fully restored lichen mat. The distance distribution of lichen fragments showed that reindeer lichen had dispersed by at least 20 m from the restoration plots, and locally by much greater distances, of up to 60 m. The absence of a clear pattern of dispersal on all sites indicates the importance of microsite conditions and post- dispersal processes. Perspectives for future restoration operations are discussed, including the fire-lichen-Rangifer Rangifer relationship, and implications for local and Indigenous populations who depend on them.

AB  - The typical Mammuthus-Coelodonta Faunal Complex dominated the mid- and high latitudes of continental Eurasia during the Mid-Late Pleistocene; the dominant taxa include woolly mammoth (Mammuthus primigenius), woolly rhino (Coelodonta antiquitatis), steppe bison (Bison priscus) and diverse horses (Equus spp.), etc. Recent excavations at the Early Pleistocene site Shanshenmiaozui in Nihewan Basin of North China resulted in the discoveries of rich mammalian fossils which include steppe mammoth (Mammuthus trogontherii), Nihowan woolly rhino (Coelodonta nihowanensis), archaic Chinese bison (Bison (Eobison) palaeosinensis) and rich collections of early horse fossil. In Nihewan Basin, a couple of sites (Xiashagou, Shanshenmiaozui and Yeniupo) yielded the Mammuthus-Coelodonta-Bison assemblage, which can be regarded as the closest ancestors of the Mammuthus - Coelodonta Faunal Complex or the forerunners of the later Mammuthus - Coelodonta Faunal Complex. Nihewan Basin bears the richest and most complete fossils of Early Pleistocene Coelodonta and Bison to date, and the juvenile specimens of M. trogontherii also represent the richest collection for its kind and its geologic age.

AB  - Large carnivores (order Carnivora) are among the world's most threatened mammals due to a confluence of ecological and social forces that have unfolded over centuries. Combining specimens from natural history collections with documents from archival records, we reconstructed the factors surrounding the extinction of the California grizzly bear (Ursus arctos californicus), a once-abundant brown bear subspecies last seen in 1924. Historical documents portrayed California grizzlies as massive hypercarnivores that endangered public safety. Yet, morphological measurements on skulls and teeth generate smaller body size estimates in alignment with extant North American grizzly populations (approx. 200 kg). Stable isotope analysis (delta C-13, delta N-15) of pelts and bones (n = 57) revealed that grizzlies derived less than 10% of their nutrition from terrestrial animal sources and were therefore largely herbivorous for millennia prior to the first European arrival in this region in 1542. Later colonial land uses, beginning in 1769 with the Mission era, led grizzlies to moderately increase animal protein consumption (up to 26% of diet), but grizzlies still consumed far less livestock than otherwise claimed by contemporary accounts. We show how human activities can provoke short-term behavioural shifts, such as heightened levels of carnivory, that in turn can lead to exaggerated predation narratives and incentivize persecution, triggering rapid loss of an otherwise widespread and ecologically flexible animal.

AB  - Corynebacterium pseudotuberculosis (C. pseudotuberculosis) is a causative agent of numerous chronic diseases, including caseous lymphadenitis (CLA) in sheep and goats, which has a zoonotic potential in humans in addition to a poor therapeutic response. In this study, out of 120 collected samples, only 12 (10%) were positive for C. pseudotuberculosis by PCR and by intraperitoneal injection of male Guinea pigs and then characterized for antimicrobial susceptibility and its genetic-relatedness by enterobacterial repetitive intergenic consensus polymerase chain reaction (ERIC-PCR), which showed 2-4 bands ranging from 100 to 3000 bp that can be clustered into four clusters (C1-C4). Despite the serotype biovar 1 only infecting sheep and goats, ERIC-PCR reveals intra-subtyping variation. Examination of affected LNs and organs revealed marked enlargement with either thick creamy green pus or multiple abscesses of variable sizes with a central caseated core surrounded by dense fibrous capsule. A histopathological examination revealed a central necrotic core surrounded by a peripheral mantle of mononuclear cells and a fibrous capsule. Positive immune expression of nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kappa B/p65) and interleukin-1 beta (IL-1 beta) and negative expression of tumor necrosis factor (TNF) in CLA is the first report to our knowledge. Conclusion: In CLA pyogranulomas, IL1 beta is a more crucial proinflammatory cytokine than TNF in the regulation of C. pseudotuberculosis infection, which is accompanied by marked NF-kappa B immunoexpression. Therefore, the NF-kappa B/p65 signaling pathway is involved in the activation of IL1 beta, and additional immunohistochemical studies are required to determine the various roles of NF-kappa B/p65 in the inflammatory response within CLA pyogranulomas to control this pathogen.

AB  - Whale sharks off the western coast of India have suffered high levels of fishing pressure in the past, and today continue to be caught in small-scale fisheries as by-catch. Additionally, coastlines in this region host very large and growing human populations that are undergoing rapid development. This exacerbates ongoing anthropogenic threats to this species such as pollution, habitat loss, and ship traffic. For these reasons, there is an urgent need for data on movement patterns of whale sharks in this region of the Indian Ocean. Here, we address this issue by providing the first data on the horizontal movements of whale sharks tagged in the northern Arabian Sea off the western coast of the Indian state of Gujarat. From 2011 to 2017, eight individuals, ranging from 5.4 to 8 m were tagged and monitored using satellite telemetry. Tag retention varied from 1 to 137 days, with the sharks traveling distances of 34 - similar to 2,230 km. Six of the eight individuals remained close to their tagging locations, although two sharks displayed wide ranging movements into the Arabian Sea, following frontal zones between water masses of different sea surface temperatures. We explore the relationship between the movement patterns of these whale sharks and the physical and biological processes of the region.

AB  - The mechanical strengthening of leaves protects seedlings from herbivore damage, particularly in shade-tolerant evergreens. Interspecific studies have shown that leaf mass per area (LMA) and leaf toughness (force-to-punch) can play this role. Here we compared the influence of LMA and leaf toughness on herbivory and plant performance in a temperate rainforest. In seedlings of 14 evergreen species, we addressed the across-species relationship between LMA and force-to-punch, and compared the strength of their associations with herbivory and with species' light requirements. Moreover, in four understory species we performed a multivariate analysis within-species, analogue to phenotypic selection analysis, evaluating the correlation between seedling performance, estimated as chlorophyll fluorescence (Fv/Fm), and force-to-punch, LMA, lamina density and lamina thickness. LMA and force-to-punch were positively associated across species. Herbivory was negatively correlated with both force-to-punch and LMA, but a stepwise multiple regression showed that force-to-punch was a better predictor of herbivory. Neither leaf lamina density nor thickness were associated with herbivore damage. Those species that were more shade-tolerant had leaves with higher force-to-punch and higher LMA, and less slender seedlings. In the within-species analyses in four shade-tolerant species, seedling performance was generally positively associated with force-to-punch, but not with LMA, lamina thickness, or lamina density. Both interspecific and within-species analyses showed that force-to-punch is more strongly related to herbivore damage and plant performance than LMA. This consistency between interspecific patterns of trait covariation and within-species trait-performance associations suggests that natural selection could have shaped the relationships between mechanical traits and ecological roles observed across species.

AB  - Peatlands are globally significant carbon sinks, but when disturbed, have the potential to release carbon back to the atmosphere as greenhouse gases. Feral horse populations in the Australian Alps degrade Sphagnum peatlands, which are highly sensitive to disturbance. However, the link between this degradation and peatland carbon cycling is not understood. Here, we compared the autumn daytime carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4) fluxes of 12 alpine and subalpine Sphagnum peatlands in Kosciuszko National Park, Australia. The presence of feral horses at these sites was correlated with higher carbon loss: sites with horses were losing carbon to the atmosphere (4.83 and 8.18 g CO2-e m- 2 d-1 in areas of Sphagnum moss and bare soil, respectively), whereas sites without horses were removing carbon from the atmosphere (-6.39 g CO2-e m- 2 d-1). Sites with feral horses also had higher soil bulk density, temperature, and electrical conductivity (EC), and higher water pH, EC, and turbidity, than sites without horses. Our findings suggest that excluding feral horses from peatland areas could reduce rates of carbon loss to the atmosphere, in addition to improving overall site condition, peat soil condition, and water quality. We discuss potential management applications, further research, and restoration opportunities arising from these results.

AB  - Accurate heritability estimates for fitness-related traits are required to predict an organism's ability to respond to global change. Heritability estimates are theoretically expected to be inflated if, due to limited dispersal, individuals that share genes are also likely to share similar environments. However, if relatives occupy similar environments due, at least partly, to genetic variation for habitat selection, then accounting for environmental similarity in quantitative genetic models may result in diminished heritability estimates in wild populations. This potential issue has been pointed out in the literature, but has not been evaluated by empirical studies. Here, we investigate whether environmental similarity among individuals can be partly explained by genetic variation for habitat selection, and how this link potentially blurs estimates for heritability in fitness-related traits. Using intensive GPS monitoring, we quantified home-range habitat composition for 293 roe deer inhabiting a heterogeneous landscape to assess environmental similarity. To investigate if environmental similarity might harbour genetic variation, we combined genome-wide data in a quantitative genetic framework to evaluate genetic variation for home-range habitat composition, which is partly the result of habitat selection at settlement. Finally, we explored how environmental similarity affects heritability estimates for behaviours related to the risk avoidance-resource acquisition trade-off (i.e. being in open habitat and distance to roads) and proxies of individual performance (i.e. body mass and hind foot length). We found substantial heritability for home-range habitat composition, with estimates ranging from 0.40 (proportion of meadows) to 0.85 (proportion of refuge habitat). Accounting for similarity in habitat composition between relatives decreased the heritability estimates for both behavioural and morphological traits (reduction ranging from 55% to 100% and from 22% to 41% respectively). As a consequence, only half of these heritability estimates remained significantly different from zero. Our results show that similar genotypes occupy similar environments, which could lead to heritable variation being incorrectly attributed to environmental effects. To accurately distinguish the sources of phenotypic variation and predict the ability of organisms to respond to global change, it is necessary to develop quantitative genetic studies investigating the mechanisms underpinning environmental similarity among relatives.

AB  - Arylalkylamine N-acetyltransferase (AANAT) plays a crucial role in synchronizing internal biological functions to circadian and circannual changes. Generally speaking, only one copy of AANAT gene has been found in mammals, however, three independent duplications of this gene were detected in several cetartiodactyl lineages (i.e., Suidae, Hippopotamidae, and Pecora), which originated in the middle Eocene, a geological period characterized with the increased climate seasonality. Lineage-specific expansions of AANAT and the associated functional enhancement in these lineages strongly suggest an improvement in regulating photoperiodic response to adapt to seasonal climate changes. In contrast, independent inactivating mutations or deletions of the AANAT locus were identified in the four pineal-deficient clades (cetaceans, sirenians, xenarthrans, and pangolins). Loss of AANAT function in cetaceans and sirenians could disrupt the sleep-promoting effects of pineal melatonin, which might contribute to increasing wakefulness, adapting these clades to underwater sleep. The absence of AANAT and pineal glands in xenarthrans and pangolins may be associated with their body temperature maintenance. The present work demonstrates a far more complex and intriguing evolutionary pattern and functional diversity of mammalian AANAT genes than previously thought and provides further evidence for understanding AANAT evolution as driven by rhythmic adaptations in mammals.

AB  - Carbon emission from pig production is an issue of great importance owing to its effect on global warming. Differed from widespread large-scale pig farms in North America and Europe, small-scale and smallholder pig farms are mainly concentrated in China. However, information on carbon emissions from Chinese smallholder pig farms is limited. Additionally, large amounts of drugs and vaccines have been applied during smallholder pig production in China, yet their contribution to carbon emissions is unclear. Therefore, detailed dataset which records all inputs during a pig's entire life cycle should be obtained, so as to accurately determine the magnitude of carbon emissions from Chinese smallholder pig farms. This study took Yancheng, eastern China, as an example and adopted the carbon footprint (CF), life cycle inventory (LCI), and Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) greenhouse gas (GHG) field calculations to accurately estimate the GHG emissions resulting from pig production of China. Furthermore, the contributions of vaccine application and other driving forces behind GHG emissions were identified using statistic methods. In the study area, the pig CFs in the nursery period, fattening period, and full life cycle were 5.83, 4.73, and 6.75 kg CO2 eq center dot kg(-1) respectively. The CF of pig production in the study area varied from 4.74 to 9.48 kg CO2 eq center dot kg(-1), with an average of 6.75 kg CO2 eq center dot kg(-1); this average was, overall, higher than that of large-scale pig farms in North America and Europe. GHG emissions from manure (42.87%) and fodder (27.77%) were responsible for a large proportion of the total CF. Normal vaccine inputs contributed highly (15.33%) to the total CF. The contribution of vaccine application to the CF is roughly evaluated, suggesting it may be a potentially important source of GHG emissions in pig production and should receive more attention in the future. Furthermore, GHG emissions from smallholder pig production farms can be significantly reduced by developing a mixed crop-livestock system, increasing the application of organic fertilizers, and installing biogas digesters.

AB  - Granivorous rodents are important components of ecosystems not only because they consume seeds but also because some aid in seed dispersal through seed-caching behaviors. Some rodents bury seeds in shallow pits throughout territories, called scatterhoards, that individuals recover, pilfer, or transfer to other caches. We suspect some single-seed caches in environments represent missed seeds from reclaiming or pilfering caches. We documented the sloppiness of seed removal from scatterhoards of soapweed yucca (Yucca glauca) seeds by Ord's kangaroo rats (Dipodomys ordii). We quantified the frequency and location of seeds remaining. In an experiment with artificial caches of three sizes, kangaroo rats harvested 51% of caches after one night, and 53% had incomplete recovery with at least one seed remaining. The greater the number of seeds in caches, the greater frequency of incomplete recovery. In another experiment with natural and artificial caches, 75% of caches were excavated after 8 days, with at least 70% having at least one seed remaining. Regardless of original cache size, a single seed represented the mode for seeds remaining. Incomplete recovery of seeds likely benefits plant establishment, potentially significantly in some systems. Remaining seeds, especially those buried at bottoms of caches, likely will stay undetected in landscapes, yielding propagules for subsequent plant generations. Soapweed yucca has large but light, flat wind-dispersed seeds, and removal of caches with smaller seeds might have greater frequency of missed seeds during recovery and pilfering by rodents. Our results suggest that scatter-hoarding granivores also contribute to plant establishment by leaving limited numbers of seeds behind when removing caches, at least in some systems.

AB  - Recently, nine Caenorhabditis elegans genes, grouped into two pathways/clusters, were found to be implicated in healthspan in C. elegans and their homologues in humans, based on literature curation, WormBase data mining and bioinformatics analyses. Here, we further validated these genes experimentally in C. elegans. We downregulated the nine genes via RNA interference (RNAi), and their effects on physical function (locomotion in a swim assay) and on physiological function (survival after heat stress) were analysed in aged nematodes. Swim performance was negatively affected by the downregulation of acox-1.1, pept-1, pak-2, gsk-3 and C25G6.3 in worms with advanced age (twelfth day of adulthood) and heat stress resistance was decreased by RNAi targeting of acox-1.1, daf-22, cat-4, pig-1, pak-2, gsk-3 and C25G6.3 in moderately (seventh day of adulthood) or advanced aged nematodes. Only one gene, sad-1, could not be linked to a health-related function in C. elegans with the bioassays we selected. Thus, most of the healthspan genes could be re-confirmed by health measurements in old worms.

AB  - It is largely unknown how mammalian genomes evolve under rapid speciation and environmental adaptation. An excellent model for understanding fast evolution is provided by the genus Sus, which diverged relatively recently and lacks postzygotic isolation. Here, we present a high-quality reference genome of the Visayan warty pig, which is specialized to a tropical island environment. Comparing the genome sequences and chromatin contact maps of the Visayan warty pig (Sus cebifrons) and domestic pig (Sus scrofa), we characterized the dynamics of chromosomal structure evolution during Sus speciation, revealing the similar chromosome conformation as the potential biological mechanism of frequent postdivergence hybridization among Suidae. We further investigated the different signatures of adaptive selection and domestication in Visayan warty pig and domestic pig with specific emphasize on the evolution of olfactory and gustatory genes, elucidating higher olfactory diversity in Visayan warty pig and positive and relaxed evolution of bitter and fat taste receptors, respectively, in domestic pig. Our comprehensive evolutionary and comparative genome analyses provide insight into the dynamics of genomes and how these change over relative short evolutionary times, as well as how these genomic differences encode for differences in the phenotypes.

AB  - Adaptation to changing environmental conditions is a driver of plant diversification. Elevational gradients offer a unique opportunity for investigating adaptation to a range of climatic conditions. The use of specialized metabolites as volatile and phenolic compounds is a major adaptation in plants, affecting their reproductive success and survival by attracting pollinators and protecting themselves from herbivores and other stressors. The wormseed Artemisia brevifolia can be found across multiple elevations in the Western Himalayas, a region that is considered a biodiversity hotspot and is highly impacted by climate change. This study aims at understanding the volatile and phenolic compounds produced by A. brevifolia in the high elevation cold deserts of the Western Himalayas with the view to understanding the survival strategies employed by plants under harsh conditions. Across four sampling sites with different elevations, polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) sampling and subsequent GCMS analyses showed that the total number of volatile compounds in the plant headspace increased with elevation and that this trend was largely driven by an increase in compounds with low volatility, which might improve the plant's resilience to abiotic stress. HPLC analyses showed no effect of elevation on the total number of phenolic compounds detected in both young and mature leaves. However, the concentration of the majority of phenolic compounds decreased with elevation. As the production of phenolic defense compounds is a costly trait, plants at higher elevations might face a trade-off between energy expenditure and protecting themselves from herbivores. This study can therefore help us understand how plants adjust secondary metabolite production to cope with harsh environments and reveal the climate adaptability of such species in highly threatened regions of our planet such as the Himalayas.

AB  - Species invasions are a leading threat to ecosystems globally, but our understanding of interactions among multiple invasive species and their outcomes on ecosystem properties is undeveloped despite their significance to conservation and management. Here we studied a large lake in Minnesota, USA, that experienced a simultaneous surge in invasive zebra mussel and spiny water flea populations. A long-term (2000-2018) dataset offered a rare opportunity to assess whole-ecosystem shifts following the co-invasion. Within two years, the native crustacean zooplankton community declined abruptly in density and productivity (-93% and -91%, respectively). Summer phytoplankton abundance and water clarity remained stable across the time series, an unexpected outcome given the high density of zebra mussels in the lake. Observational data and modeling indicate that removal of native herbivorous zooplankton by the predatory spiny water flea reduced zooplankton grazing pressure enough to compensate new grazing losses due to zebra mussels, resulting in a zero net effect on phytoplankton abundance and water clarity despite a wholesale shift in secondary production from the pelagic to the benthic food web. This study reveals the extent of direct and indirect effects of two aquatic invaders on food-web processes that cancel shifts in water clarity, a highly valued ecosystem service.

AB  - Objective: To measure the seasonal effect on endocrinological profiles and sex behavioural profiles during rainy and dry summer seasons in male Andaman local goat in Andaman and Nicobar Islands, India.
   Methods: Ten adult male Andaman local goats were selected from the goat breeding farm, ICAR-Central Island Agricultural Research Institute, Port Blair, Andaman and Nicobar Islands, India. Endocrinological profiles such as follicle stimulating hormone (FSH), luteinizing hormone (LH), testosterone, thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH), triiodothyronine (T3), thyroxine (T4), cortisol and prolactin were analysed with enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kits. Sex behavioural profiles such as libido score, mating ability score and sex behavioural score were measured during rainy and dry summer seasons in male Andaman local goat.
   Results: Endocrinological profiles as well as sex behavioural profiles differed significantly between rainy season and dry summer season (P<0.05). The levels of FSH, LH, testosterone, TSH, T3, and T4 were significantly higher in rainy season than in dry summer season whereas cortisol and prolactin were significantly higher in dry summer season than in rainy season (P<0.05). The ratio of T3:T4 was significantly higher in rainy season than in dry summer season. Similarly, libido score, mating ability score and sex behavioural score were significantly higher in rainy season than in dry summer season (P<0.05).
   Conclusions: Rainy season has significantly higher beneficial effects than summer season on reproduction and artificial breeding programmes in semi-intensive management of goat under the tropical humid island ecosystem in Andaman and Nicobar Islands.

AB  - Environmental heat stress negatively influences sheep production in warm semi-arid regions. An animal's ability to tolerate warm weather is difficult to measure naturally due to environmental variability and genetic variation between animals. In this study we developed a thermo-tolerance indicator (TTI) to define heat stress tolerance in pregnant sheep in a controlled environment. Next, we performed a genome-wide association study (GWAS) to identify genomic regions and target genes associated with thermo-tolerance in sheep. Pregnant ColumbiaRambouillet crossbred ewes (n = 127) were heat-stressed inside a climate-controlled chamber for 57 days by increasing the temperature-humidity index to >= 30. Rectal temperature (RT) and feed intake (FI) data were collected daily and used for the predictive TTI analysis. After the tenth day of heat stress, the regression analyses revealed that FI was stable; however, when the ewe's RT exceeded 39.8 degrees C their FI was less than thermo-tolerant ewes. This average predicted temperature was used to classify each ewe as heat stress tolerant (<= 39.8 degrees C) and non-heat stress tolerant ( 39.8 degrees C). A GWAS analysis was performed and genomic regions were compared between heat stress tolerant and non-tolerant ewes. The single-marker genomic analysis detected 16 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) associated with heat stress tolerance (P < 0.0001), whereas the multi-marker Bayesian analysis identified 8 overlapped 1-Mb chromosomal regions accounting for 11.39% of the genetic variation associated with tolerance to heat stress. Four intragenic SNP showed a remarkable contribution to thermo-tolerance, and these markers were within the genes FBXO11 (rs407804467), PHC3 (rs414179061), TSHR (rs418575898) and STAT1 (rs417581105). In conclusion, genomic regions harboring four intragenic SNP were associated with heat stress tolerance, and these candidate genes are proposed to influence heat tolerance in pregnant ewes subjected to an artificially induced warm climate. Moreover, these genetic markers could be suitable for use in further genetic selection programs in sheep managed in semi-arid regions.

AB  - Aqueous calcium (Ca) decline is threatening freshwater ecosystems worldwide. There are great concerns about the possible ecological consequences of Ca limitation combined with biological pressures like predation. Here we investigated the interactions between Ca restriction and fish predation risk on the phenotypic plasticity in the keystone herbivore Daphnia , together with physiological responses underlying the plastic trait changes. Fish predation risk induced D. pulex to mature earlier and produce more but smaller offspring at adequate Ca. Declining Ca inhibited the expression of defensive traits, with the inhibitive degree showing a linear or thresholdlimited dynamic. The presence of predation risk mitigated the negative effect of declining Ca on reducing body size but exacerbated the delay in maturity, indicating a life history trade-off for larger body size rather than the current reproduction in multi -stressed Daphnia . Actin 3 -mediated cytoskeleton and AMPK fl -mediated energy metabolism were highly correlated with these plastic trait changes. Altered phenotypic plasticity in planktonic animals is expected to trigger many ecological impacts from individual fitness to community structure, thus providing new insights into the mechanisms underlying decreased Ca affecting lake ecosystems.

AB  - The Atlantic Forest, a hotspot for biodiversity conservation, harbours five forest deer species (Mazama spp.). Due to their elusiveness, there is a severe scarcity of occurrence data to support ecological studies and conservation planning. Thus, we assembled an occurrence dataset of Atlantic Forest deer with reliable taxonomic information aggregating data from scat and camera traps surveys, and opportunistic data collection over the last 20 years. From 2002 to 2019, we surveyed 77 protected areas using scats detection dogs and genetically identifying the faecal samples. We successfully identified 1,147 out of 1,450 collected samples. From 2000 to 2020, we sampled six protected areas in 92 sampling points with 13,328 camera trap days of sampling effort. In addition, we established an active search for potential contributors within the scientific community and environmental consultants since 2010, offering a taxonomic identification service for camera traps images, and biological field-collected samples. With our efforts, we assembled a dataset with 1,456 records of forest deer occurrence at the Atlantic Forest. Of these records, 494 are from M. americana, 350 from M. bororo, 309 from M. gouazoubira, 268 from M. nana and 35 from M. nemorivaga. The faecal sampling was the most predominant method in these records (n = 1043) followed by photographs from camera traps (n = 388); both methods represent 98.2% of our dataset records. Most of the records (79.5%) in the dataset are inside protected areas (n = 1,130). Our dataset is the most comprehensive source of information on Neotropical forest deer occurrence to date.

AB  - PurposeMeeting the demands of a growing and increasingly affluent population necessitates a deeper understanding of the environmental and economic implications of production. This implication is most relevant in key production sectors including agriculture and livestock. This article is intended to provide an understanding of the influence of methods of assessing land-use change (LUC) with respect to minimizing both the global warming potential (GWP) and the monetary costs of pig feed formulation.MethodsFeed mixtures intended for slaughter pigs were generated for minimal cost and GWP impacts by applying four differing LUC assessment methods. The objective function was the Danish slaughter pig feed unit, minimized for cost in Danish crowns (DKK), with GWP impacts constrained in multiple steps. Attributional LCA methodology was applied using the Agri-footprint 6.3 database, with GWP impacts calculated excluding land use changes, including direct land-use changes and including the carbon opportunity cost. Analyses of the functional relationship between the optimal cost and the GWP impact were conducted, followed by a comparative LCA of the cost of comparable feed mixture by applying two sets of functional units: 100 slaughter pig feed units and 1 kg of pig live weight.Results and discussionA similar relationship between cost and GWP impact was observed across all methods, although variability of GWP impact magnitude depending on method was observed. Reducing at an equivalent cost, GWP reduction ranged from 5.6 to 27% based on the pig feed functional unit, and 2.4 to 13% based on the pig live weight functional unit. Optimizing feed mixtures for GWP impacts resulted in significantly increased contributions to other impact categories, including a 56% increase in terrestrial ecotoxicity. Despite the increased contributions to other impact categories, all optimized feed mixtures achieved a reduction in endpoint indicators and single score. Endpoint reductions to the feed unit were 2.3-25% for ecosystem damage, 7.4-15% for human health, and 6.0-16% based on a single score value.ConclusionsThe findings emphasize the key importance of addressing LUC when optimizing the GWP of agri-food production. Suggestions are provided for areas of improvement in future optimization studies applying a dietary unit as the objective function, including additional midpoint impact categories and/or extended optimization covering whole areas of protection. The findings suggest that GWP impacts may be reduced at no additional cost if included or embedded in the pig feed formulation procedure.

AB  - Representatives of Hippoidea, often called sand crabs or mole crabs, are an ingroup of Anomala. These marine crustaceans inhabit the tropical and subtropical coasts of the world, yet some also appear in temperate climates. Their adults are specialized for digging and living in sandy substrates. Hippoidean zoea-type larvae are planktic and reach large sizes up to a few centimetres. These larvae transform into megalopa larvae, strongly resembling the adult, mediating the transition to the benthic lifestyle of the adult. We reconstructed outlines in dorsal view of over 80 shields of hippoideans, including representatives of Blepharipodidae (sister group to all others), Albuneidae, and Hippidae and including adults, megalopa-type, and zoea-type larvae from all three ingroups. We conducted a morphological analysis on this data using an elliptic Fourier transformation and principal component analysis. We used the results of the analysis to discuss the life history of hippoideans and the special function of megalopae, which often lack emphasis in current research. Early stage zoea larvae, megalopae, and adults show a linear gradient in their morphological development according to our analysis. However, late stage zoea larvae deviate from this pattern, possibly due to their specialization to a long-lasting planktic life. Lastly, we discuss the influence of phenotypic plasticity in hippoidean zoea larvae.

AB  - This experiment was conducted to study the effects of supplementation of seaweed-based formulation (SWBF) on performance of lactating Murrah buffaloes. Eighteen lactating Murrah buffaloes were divided into 3 groups (T-0, T-1 and T-2) based on their body weight, parity, days in milk and milk yield following randomized block design. Two SWBF were tested; SWBF-I was combination of two tropical red seaweed species namely Kappaphycus alvarezii) and Gracilaria salicornia, whereas SWBF-II was combination of the two red seaweeds and one brown seaweed species Turbinaria conoides. All the animals were fed to meet their requirements (ICAR 2013). Animals in control (T-0) group were fed concentrate mixture, Hybrid Napier fodder and wheat straw without any supplemental seaweed. However, SWBF-I and SWBF-II were supplemented at 2.5% of the concentrate feed of groups T-1 and T-2, respectively. Intake and apparent digestibility of nutrients, plasma concentrations of selected metabolites. enzymes and hormones were similar among the groups. A tendency of decreased (P=0.060) plasma concentration of cortisol was observed in treatment groups. Total antioxidant capacity was improved (P=0.001) due to SWBF supplementation; the best response was observed in group T-2, followed by T-1. Concentration of lipid peroxides decreased (P<0.004) in treatment groups as compared to control. Supplementation of SWBF-augmented cell-mediated (P=0.002) and humoral (P<0.001) immune response in treatment groups as compared to the control group. Milk yield and the 6% fat corrected milk yield (kg day(-1)) were higher (P=0.002) in T-2, followed by T-1 and minimum in To. Thus, supplementation of both the SWBF improved antioxidant status, cellular and humoral immunity, and milk yield; the best response was obtained in T-2. It is concluded that supplementation of SWBF-II (K. alvarezii, G. salicornia and T. conoides) at 2.5% in the concentrate mixture of lactating Murrah buffaloes improves antioxidant status, immunity and milk yield.

AB  - The random encounter model (REM) is a camera trapping method to estimate population density (i.e. number of individuals per unit area) without the need for individual recognition. The REM can be applied considering camera trap data only by tracking the passages of animals in front of the camera (i.e. sequences). However, it has not been assessed how the number of sequences tracked (i.e. trajectory of the animal reconstructed) influences the REM estimates. In this context, we aimed to gain further insights into the relationship between the number of sequences tracked and reliability in REM estimates to optimize its applicability. We monitored multiple species using camera traps, and we applied REM to estimate population density. We considered red fox Vulpes vulpes, roe deer Capreolus capreolus, fallow deer Dama dama, red deer Cervus elaphus and wild boar Sus scrofa as model species. We tracked from a minimum of 154 (red fox) to a maximum of 527 (red deer) sequences per species, and we then sampled the dataset to simulate different scenarios in which a lower number of sequences were tracked (20, 40, 80 and 160). We also assessed the effect of adjusting the survey period to the minimum necessary to record the desired number of sequences. Our results suggest that tracking around 100 sequences returns a precision level equivalent to the one obtained by tracking a considerably higher number of sequences and reduced and optimized the human effort necessary to apply REM. Tracking less than 40 sequences could result in low precise density estimates. Our results also highlighted the relevance of considering study periods of ca. 2 months to increase the number of sequences recorded and tracking a random sample of them. Our results contribute to the optimization and harmonization of REM as a reference method to estimate wildlife population density without the need for individual identification. We make clear recommendations on the cost-effective sample size for estimating REM parameters, optimizing the human effort when applying REM, and discouraging REM applications based on low sample sizes.
   This study focused on random encounter model (REM) optimization for camera trap data. We concluded that reconstructing the trajectory of around 100 animals crossing the field of view of the camera returned equivalent precision to the one obtained by tracking a considerably higher number of sequences. Survey periods of ca. 2 months are also recommended.image

AB  - Nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) are two important nutrient elements that limit the growth of plants and microorganisms. The effect of the N supply on soil P cycling and its mechanism remain poorly known. Here, we characterized the effects of different N application rates on soil P availability, the abundances of P-cycling functional genes, and microbial communities involved in P-cycling following the application of N for 13 years in a tea plantation. Soil available P (AP) decreased significantly under N application. The opposite pattern was observed for the activity of soil phosphatases including alkaline (ALP) and acid phosphatase (ACP). Furthermore, N addition increased the abundance of ppa but decreased the abundance of phoD in soil. Both ppa- and phoDharboring communities varied with N application levels. Redundancy analysis (RDA) showed that soil pH was a key variable modulating ppa-harboring and phoD-harboring microbial communities. Partial least squares path modeling (PLS-PM) revealed that long-term N application indirectly reduced soil P availability by altering the abundances of phoD-harboring biomarker taxa. Overall, our findings indicated that N-induced reductions in AP increased microbial competition for P by selecting microbes with P uptake and starvation response genes or those with phosphatases in tea plantation system. This suggests that tea plantations should be periodically supplemented with P under N application, especially under high N application levels.

AB  - Habitat loss from forest conversion to agriculture threatens tropical biodiversity. Despite documented risk-avoidance behaviors, some species may adopt riskier strategies to gain access to food. Recent conversion of a protected area in southern Cameroon to an agro-industrial plantation coincides with increased sightings of forest elephants near human settlements, which is unusual and suggests a drastic change in their habitat use. This study aims to examine the influence of human activity on forest elephant habitat use and evaluate the effectiveness of two survey methods in documenting elephant and human occurrence. Twenty-one camera traps were deployed along the border between the declassified protected area and the community land, and reconnaissance walks were conducted between camera trap stations. Results from both methods were compared. Elephant occurrence tended to be negatively affected by human activity, and elephants were inactive during peak human activity. However, their presence near human settlements suggests a general risk-taking behavior in habitat use. Moreover, reconnaissance walks proved more effective than camera traps in providing a greater amount of data. This risky proximity to humans points to a complex trade-off between risk and access to food resources, where the nutritional benefits and easy access of crops and secondary forest resources may outweigh the perceived human-mediated risk. At the same time, elephants may adopt strategies to minimize direct interactions with humans. Further habitat fragmentation and human encroachment on wild areas are expected in the near future. As elephant presence near human settlements often lead to increased conflict, continued monitoring of elephant habitat use in human-dominated landscapes using efficient survey methods is crucial to design up-to-date and effective management and conservation strategies.

AB  - Plants produce an array of chemical and mechanical defences that provide protection against many herbivores and pathogens. Putatively defensive compounds and structures can even occur in floral rewards: for example, the pollen of some plant taxa contains toxic compounds or possesses conspicuous spines. Yet little is known about whether pollen defences restrict host-plant use by bees. In other words, do bees, like other insect herbivores, tolerate the defences of their specific host plants while being harmed by non-host defences? To answer this question, we compared the effects of a chemical defence from Lupinus (Fabaceae) pollen and a putative mechanical defence (pollen spines) from Asteraceae pollen on larval survival of nine bee species in the tribe Osmiini (Megachilidae) varying in their pollen-host use. We found that both types of pollen defences reduce larval survival rate in some bee species. These detrimental effects were, however, mediated by host-plant associations, with bees being more tolerant of the pollen defences of their hosts, relative to the defences of plant taxa exploited by other species. This pattern strongly suggests that bees are adapted to the pollen defences of their hosts, and that host-plant use by bees is constrained by their ability to tolerate such defences.

AB  - Why sex has evolved and is maintained is an open question in evolutionary biology. The Red Queen hypothesis predicts that host lineages subjected to more intense parasite pressure should invest more in sexual reproduction to continuously create novel defences against their rapidly evolving natural enemies. In this comparative study across the angiosperms, we show that hermaphrodite plant species associated with higher species richness of insect herbivores evolved flowers with higher biomass allocation towards the male sex, an indication of their greater outcrossing effort. This pattern remained robust after controlling for key vegetative, reproductive and biogeographical traits, suggesting that long-term herbivory pressure is a key factor driving the selfing-outcrossing gradient of higher plants. Although flower evolution is frequently associated with mutualistic pollinators, our findings support the Red Queen hypothesis and suggest that insect herbivores drive the sexual strategies of flowering plants and their genetic diversity.

AB  - Linguatula serrata is a worldwide zoonotic food-borne parasite. The parasite is responsible for linguatulosis and poses a concern to human and animal health in endemic regions. This study investigated the hematological changes, oxidant/antioxidant status and immunological responses in goats and sheep naturally infected with L. serrata. Hematological changes, antioxidant enzymes and malondialdehyde (MDA) levels were measured. The level of inter-leukin-2 (IL-2), IL-4, IL-5, IL-10, and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) mRNA expression was investigated in lymph nodes. According to the hemogram results, eosinophils were significantly increased in the infected goats and sheep, and Horizontal Gene Transfer (HGT), hematocrit (HCT), and mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration (MCHC) were significantly decreased. The levels of MDA and the activity of glutathione peroxidase (GPx) were significantly higher in infected animals than in non-infected animals. However, the activity of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT) was significantly lower in infected animals than in non -infected animals. A comparison of the cytokine mRNA expression in lymph nodes from infected and non-infected animals showed higher cytokine expression in the infected animals. Infection with L. serrata caused microcytic hypochromic and normocytic hypochromic anemia in goats and sheep. The inconsistent results of immunological changes were found in infected goats and sheep. In both animals, oxidative stress occurred and led to an increase in lipid peroxidation. L. serrata created a cytokine microenvironment biased towards the type 2 immune responses.

AB  - Premise Floral stalk height is known to affect seed dispersal of wind-dispersed grassland species, but it may also affect the attractiveness of flowers and fruits of animal-pollinated and animal-dispersed plants. Stalk height may thus be responsive to selection via interactions with both mutualist pollinators and seed dispersers, but also antagonist florivores and seed predators. In this study, we aimed to determine the effect of pollinators and seed predators on selection on floral stalk height in the insect-pollinated and wind-dispersed, alpine, andromonoecious herb Pulsatilla alpina, whose flowers also vary in their sex allocation and thus in the resources available to both mutualists and antagonists. Methods We measured the resource status of individuals in terms of their size and the height of the vegetation surrounding plants of P. alpina at 11 sites. In one population, we recorded floral stalk height over an entire growing season and investigated its association with floral morphology and floral sex allocation (pistil and stamen number) and used leaf-removal manipulations to assess the effect of herbivory on floral stalk height. Finally, in four populations, we quantified phenotypic selection on floral stalk height in four female components of reproductive success before seed dispersal. Results Stalk height was positively associated with female allocation of the respective flower, the resource status of the individual, and the height of the surrounding vegetation, and negatively affected by leaf removal. Our results point to disruptive selection on stalk height in terms of both selection differentials and selection gradients for fertilization, seed predation, and seed maturation rates and to positive selection on stalk height in terms of a selection differential for mature seed number. Conclusions Stalk height of P. alpina is a costly trait that affects female reproductive success via interactions with both mutualists and antagonists. We discuss the interplay between the resource status and selection imposed on female reproductive success and its likely role in the evolution of sex-allocation strategies, especially andromonoecy.

AB  - Insectivorous predators play a crucial role in suppressing herbivore populations and mitigating herbivory in terrestrial ecosystems. However, the outcomes of 'insectivore-herbivore-plant' interactions are context dependent. This study examines the effects of vertebrate insectivores (birds and bats) and carnivorous arthropods (spiders) on herbivorous insects (caterpillars and sap suckers) and their host plant, Machilus thunbergii (Lauraceae), in a subtropical evergreen forest. We employed a factorial field experiment with four treatments: control (no exclusion), bird/bat exclusion, spider removal, and bird/bat exclusion plus spider removal. Forty trees (10 per treatment) were surveyed for herbivore abundance, degree of herbivory, and herbivore community composition. The results indicate that the predator treatments had no effects on sap suckers or sap-sucking damage. However, compared to the control, the leaf-chewing damage was higher in the bird/bat exclusion plus spider removal treatment, accompanied by shifts in leaf-chewer community composition and a trend toward increased leaf-chewer abundance. Spider abundance was lower in the control than in the bird/bat exclusion treatment, suggesting intraguild predation of spiders by birds and bats. Nevertheless, the leaf-chewing damage remained similar between these treatments, indicating that intraguild predation did not weaken the trophic cascade. This study is one of the few experiments that manipulate both vertebrate insectivores and carnivorous arthropods, and provides rare evidence that these two predator groups can perform complementary roles in suppressing herbivory. Our findings suggest that the strength of trophic interactions in the 'insectivore-leaf chewer-plant' system of this subtropical evergreen forest are likely to be relatively stable.

AB  - The objectives of this work were (a) to present the changes in climatic parameters from 1989 to 2019, in 444 locations throughout Greece, where small ruminant farms have been based and (b) to present associations of the changes in the climatic parameters with clinical data related to small ruminant health. Climatic variables (1989-2019) were obtained for 444 locations with small ruminant farms throughout Greece. During this period, significant increases were noted in temperature-related parameters (annually 0.05 degrees C for average temperature and 0.14 degrees C for temperature range) and precipitation (annually 0.03 mm). There were significant differences in climatic conditions between locations of farms in accord with the management system applied therein, as well as in accord with the breed of animals on the farms (e.g., higher average temperature in locations with Greek breeds, higher temperature range in locations with imported breeds). There were significant associations of temperature-related parameters with the annual frequency of cases of neonatal hypothermia seen at a veterinary teaching hospital, as well as with the average proportion of Haemonchus contortus larvae in faecal samples and the frequency of cases of H. contortus resistance reported by a veterinary parasitology laboratory.

AB  - Olive mill wastewater is a potent pollutant generated during the extraction of olive oil. This effluent poses a high toxic risk to the environment due to its content of organic compounds, especially polyphenols. This study aims to investigate the impact of phenolic compounds extracted from different varieties of olive mill wastewater on the rumen function of sheep. The experiment was carried out on sheep rumen liquor as inoculum supplemented with different polyphenols extract and a standard sample was composed only of vetch-oat hay. All samples were subjected to in vitro gas production technique. Results showed the richness of the three varieties (Sigoise, Azeradj and Chemlal) in polyphenols with respective values of 26.3, 23.97 and 20.09 g/L. Moreover, the polyphenol supplementation significantly improved the reduction in methane production after 24 h of incubation, considered by 7.31, 39.36, and 30.06% for Sigoise, Azeradj, and Chemlal, respectively. In addition, this decrease significantly affected the number of protozoa and the production of ammonia. Furthermore, this strategy proves its efficiency in simultaneously reducing OMW and CH4 pollution.

AB  - The impacts of extensively managed sheep on the natural environment has received little attention in comparison to beef and dairy cattle in New Zealand. In particular, there is a paucity of information on the interaction of sheep with natural waterways and their impact on water quality. The current study was designed to determine the behaviour of sheep on a hill country paddock, which was transected by a natural waterway, and assessed measures of water quality during winter conditions. The study also investigated sheep behaviour and impact on the water quality of the waterway when they had access to a reticulated water trough. Observations of behaviour showed that sheep spent little time near the waterway compared to other areas of the paddock. In addition, access to a water trough had no effect on ewe time spent grazing, walking, resting, and drinking. Ewes had minimal interaction with the waterway. Hence, under the current conditions of the study, sheep had little impact on the waterway. This may have been due to the high moisture content of pasture during winter; thus, the sheep were not required to interact with the waterway.
   Access of livestock, such as cattle, to waterways has been shown to be a cause of poor water quality due to pugging damage and excretion entering the water. In New Zealand, regulations require that cattle, deer, and pigs are excluded from accessing waterways, but there are no such requirements for sheep. The current study utilised 24 h video cameras, global positioning system units, and triaxial accelerometers to observe the interaction of Romney ewes (n = 40) with a natural waterway. Ewes were either restricted (week 1) or given access to a reticulated water trough (week 2). Proximity data showed that ewes spent more time within 3 m of the waterway when the trough was unrestricted than when restricted (14.1 +/- 5.7 and 10.8 +/- 5.1 min/ewe/day, respectively; p < 0.05). Ewes travelled shorter distances on the steeper areas of paddock than flatter areas. Similarly, ewes showed a spatial preference for the flat and low sloped areas of the paddock. Concentrations of suspended sediment and total phosphorus were higher during access to a reticulated water trough which coincided with the week with more rainy days. Phosphorus and E. coli concentrations in the stream water samples were the above recommended Australian and New Zealand Environment and Conservation Council water quality guidelines, especially after rainy days, but did not appear to be directly related to sheep activity. Overall, the results suggest that during winter, ewes interacted very little with the waterway and were thus unlikely to influence the levels of nutrient and pathogens in the waterway.

AB  - Understanding the capacity of animals to shift diet in times of food shortage is crucial in assessing their resilience to climate change. Dugongs are specialist herbivores that live in genetically discrete populations and forage locally. This study validated the use of stable isotope analysis of collagen from the permanent, continuously growing tusks of dugongs to assess potential trophic and/or spatial shifts in foraging. Tusks were accessed from museum collections and included five locations spanning the dugong's Australian subtropical to tropical distribution. Collagen from tusk growth layers deposited during three life stages (nursing calf, subadult, and adult) and two seasons (winter, summer) were analyzed for delta N-15 and delta C-13. In tropical Australia, mean delta N-15 values decreased significantly from calves to adults reflecting the ontogenetic dietary shift from milk to seagrass. In contrast, delta N-15 was significantly enriched in adult dugongs in subtropical Moreton Bay suggesting omnivory. delta C-13 values in tusks did not change with geographic location. Season did not appear to have a significant impact on delta N-15 or delta C-13 values in either tropical or subtropical locations, but dietary variation was greatest in the subtropics. Stable isotope analysis of tusks appears to be a useful method of investigating dietary/trophic shifts over a dugong's lifetime.

AB  - Coral reefs rely heavily on reef fish for their health, yet overfishing has resulted in their decline, leading to an increase in fast-growing algae and changes in reef ecosystems, a phenomenon described as the phase-shift. A clearer understanding of the intricate interplay between herbivorous, their food, and their gut microbiomes could enhance reef health. This study examines the gut microbiome and isotopic markers (delta 13C and delta 15N) of four key nominally herbivorous reef fish species (Acanthurus chirurgus, Kyphosus sp., Scarus trispinosus, and Sparisoma axillare) in the Southwestern Atlantic's Abrolhos Reef systems. Approximately 16.8 million 16S rRNA sequences were produced for the four fish species, with an average of 317,047 +/- 57,007 per species. Bacteria such as Proteobacteria, Firmicutes, and Cyanobacteria were prevalent in their microbiomes. These fish show unique microbiomes that result from co-diversification, diet, and restricted movement. Coral-associated bacteria (Endozoicomonas, Rhizobia, and Ruegeria) were found in abundance in the gut contents of the parrotfish species Sc. trispinosus and Sp. axillare. These parrotfishes could aid coral health by disseminating such beneficial bacteria across the reef. Meanwhile, Kyphosus sp. predominantly had Pirellulaceae and Rhodobacteraceae. Four fish species had a diet composed of turf components (filamentous Cyanobacteria) and brown algae (Dictyopteris). They also had similar isotopic niches, suggesting they shared food sources. A significant difference was observed between the isotopic signature of fish muscular gut tissue and gut contents, pointing to the role that host genetics and gut microbes play in differentiating fish tissues.

AB  - Insect herbivores must contend with constitutive and induced plant defenses. The mountain pine beetle, Dendroctonus ponderosae Hopkins (Coleoptera: Curculionidae, Scolytinae) has expanded its range east of the Rocky Mountains into the western boreal forest and is encountering evolutionarily naive lodgepole pines (Pinus contorta) and jack pines (Pinus banksiana). Pinus contorta and P. banksiana in the expanded range have different constitutive and induced defenses in response to wounding and inoculation with fungal associates of D. ponderosae. In the historic range, previous studies have examined phloem terpene content prior to and just after D. ponderosae mass attack, but the terpene profile of attacked trees post-overwintering is unknown. We examined the response of mature P. contorta and P. banksiana trees to experimentally-applied mass attack by D. ponderosae and quantified phloem terpenes at three time points, pre-attack, post-attack (same season), and the following spring, post-overwintering. Phloem content of total terpenes as well as many individual terpenes increased after D. ponderosae attack but were only significantly higher than pre-attack levels at the post-overwintering time point in both P. contorta and P. banksiana. The absence of a significant increase in phloem terpenes in the month following attack in naive pines is a potential cause for increased D. ponderosae offspring production reported in naive P. contorta. Beetle attack density did not influence the phloem terpene profiles of either species and there was no significant interaction between attack density and sampling time on terpene content. High phloem terpenes in trees that are attacked at low densities could prime these trees for defense against attacks in the following season but it could also make these trees more apparent to early-foraging beetles and facilitate efficient mass attack at low D. ponderosae population densities in the expanded range.

AB  - Combining carnivore movements with site visits to investigate predation events can inform investigators of carnivore diets, kill rates, and risk factors for prey. However, detecting remains of prey can be challenging when prey is small or when vegetation conceals prey. Conservation detection dogs (CDDs) have assisted with wildlife surveys to locate objects of conservation interest, often improving detection over human counterparts. We hypothesized that CDDs would improve efficacy for detection of prey remains at kill locations compared to human searchers. We compared the efficacy of CDD teams (1 dog, 1 human handler) and technician teams (2 humans) for locating prey remains at 729 carnivore cluster (potential predation) sites in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan, USA, during May to August of 2015. Carnivore species included gray wolves (Canis lupus), coyotes (C. latrans), bobcats (Lynx rufus), and American black bears (Ursus americanus). Overall, CDD teams identified prey remains at 2.3 times more clusters, required 42% less search time, and handlers traveled 83% less distance per detected prey remain compared to technician teams. Within carnivore species, CDD teams detected small prey remains at a greater rate than technician teams (4.0-4.3 times greater) for all carnivores except for bobcat which had similar detection rate. Detection of large prey remains (e.g., adult ungulates) was similar between CDD teams and technician teams. Our study supports CDDs ability to outperform humans when searching for objects of conservation interest which are visually cryptic but traceable by scent. Where logistics allow, we recommend use of CDDs over human searchers when it is a priority to locate remains of small prey and when vegetation is dense and may obscure even larger prey items.

AB  - Climate change is a major determinant of shifts in species' distribution ranges and habitat suitability. The Arctic is one of the planet's most rapidly warming regions, yet biogeographic responses to contemporary climate change remain unknown for most cold-adapted mammalian species. Using the maximum entropy machine learning algorithm and 40 years (1981-2020) of observation data of muskoxen (Ovibos moschatus) collected across the Northeast Greenland National Park (NGNP), we detect rapid northward shifts (69-108 km per decade) of high to medium suitable habitat coinciding with a southward shift (27 km per decade) of low suitable habitat. Biogeographic response rates accelerated after the start of the twenty-first century, when anomalies in temperature and precipitation became more frequent and intensified. Our study shows that contemporary climate change has led to extreme directional shifts in habitat suitability for the largest herbivore roaming the Arctic tundra when compared to other species from around the globe. The consequences of these extreme directional shifts in habitat suitability on local population persistence remain to be determined but gene flow and dispersal capacity across the rugged Arctic landscape are likely important drivers.

AB  - Understanding the ecological niche occupied by Neanderthals and their ancestors is at the forefront of many Palaeolithic investigations. In this study, a complex characterization of the environments once occupied by these hominins in Western Eurasia were performed. It included the determination of the biome and climatic zones occupied, the potential wind exposures, the classification of the karst regions where they lived, the direction of the entrance of caves inhabited and the average daily total solar irradiation values. In addition, the climatic suitability of the Mediterranean mosquito fauna, tick-borne encephalitis and four large mammal species as potential mammal hosts were also studied. It was found that Western Eurasian hominins occupied a wide ecological niche range from the semi-arid to the subarctic climates. Between the MIS20-MIS4 interval, the biomes occupied by Neanderthals and their ancestors shifted from the woodland-shrubland to the boreal biomes, indicating the increasing general biocultural adaptation to the more continental environments. These populations inhabited territories with weak to moderate wind exposure (Beaufort 2-5) and usually occupied caves with a south or southwest-oriented entrance. This habitat selection indicates the recognition of local microclimatic factors and a conscious choice of shelters. In the glacial periods, the increasing extension of temperate -subpolar karst regions at the expense of the more habitable subtropical karst areas might have adversely affected the overwintering chances of ancient western Eurasian populations in West, Central Europe, and Central Asia. The supraorbital area of ancient hominins with low receding foreheads and prominent supraorbital ridges may have been exposed to a greater risk of the development of frontal sinusitis and its complications than modern humans with more gracile skulls. Neanderthals and their predecessors were exposed to moderate average daily solar radiation values, although these values exhibit heterogenic picture in the comparison of Central and Southern Europe. While the southern European Neanderthal populations were dominantly exposed to the risk of mosquito-borne diseases, the northern and central populations could suffer from tick-borne diseases. However, both tick-borne encephalitis virus and its medium-large mammal hosts were present in most sites dwelled by Neanderthals and their ancestors.(c) 2023 The Author. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Background Understanding connectivity is critical to the management of exploited fish stocks, but migratory dynamics of Pacific halibut (Hippoglossus stenolepis) in the Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands region are not well-understood. In the current study, 145 Pacific halibut >= 82 cm fork length were tagged with Pop-up Archival Transmitting (PAT) tags to evaluate interannual dispersal, seasonal migration, and depth-specific habitat use. Results Endpoint locations obtained after 1 year at liberty (n = 79), fishery recoveries after 2-3 years at liberty (n = 5), and at-liberty geopositions based on light data (n = 5313 estimates from 109 fish) indicated geographically distinct movement patterns: Pacific halibut tagged in the Western and Central Aleutian Islands remained within the island groups in which the fish had been tagged; fish in the eastern Bering Sea remained in that ocean basin, moving among International Pacific Halibut Commission (IPHC) regulatory areas and into Russian waters; those tagged south of Unimak Pass in IPHC Regulatory Area 4A displayed the greatest amount of emigration, dispersing eastward both seasonally and interannually to as far south as Washington State. Analysis of daily maximum depth and temperature data from 113 individuals demonstrated group-level variation in summer temperatures experienced by the fish and in the timing, duration, and synchrony of movement to deep-water wintering grounds. Conclusions Depth-specific habitat use was suggestive of regionally explicit migratory contingents, while interannual dispersal patterns were consistent with the existence of multiple functional spawning units. The results may guide future research to examine cross-basin connectivity in the Northern Bering Sea and provide inputs for numerical modelling of individual movements, larval advection, and recruitment analyses.

AB  - Trapania is a genus of dorid nudibranchs and one of the lesser studied members in the family Goniodorididae. Previous studies have been limited to using morphological data for producing phylogenies and establishing species relationships. This study presents the first molecular phylogeny for the genus Trapania with the goal of resolving questions that surfaced in previous morphological studies and enhancing our understanding of Trapania clade structure and species relationships. Bayesian inference, maximum likelihood and two types of species delimitation analyses reveal 15 previously described species and nine new species, which are described: Trapania kahel sp. nov., Trapania kamagong sp. nov., Trapania kanaloa sp. nov., Trapania lemanioides sp. nov., Trapania stegodon sp. nov., Trapania tamaraw sp. nov., Trapania tatsulok sp. nov., Trapania tigger sp. nov. and Trapania undulata sp. nov. Preliminary evidence presented here suggests that Atlantic and eastern Pacific species form a distinct clade and diverged from ancestors that were more widespread. An Indo-Pacific clade is sister to this clade, but stronger support and broader taxon sampling are required to test this hypothesis.

AB  - Alternative protein interventions are common in conservation. They aim to reduce the hunting or consumption of wildlife by promoting substitutes. However, selecting suitable meat substitutes is challenging because many factors drive wild meat consumption. Palatability, one such factor, drives consumer food preference and is potentially crucial in determining meat substitutability in the context of alternative protein interventions. Nonetheless, there have been few assessments of wild meat palatability compared with other options. We collected data on the meat palatability of 96 animal species via a standardized questionnaire administered to 570 hunters, household members, and wild meat vendors (190 respondents in each group) in southeast Nigeria to examine the potential for wild meat substitution. We found positive correlations in the palatability of different species across pairs of respondent groups, highlighting preference similarities. We did not find a statistically significant difference in the average palatability of domestic meat, fish, invertebrates, or wild meat, suggesting scope for substitution based on palatability. Among mammalian orders, ungulates, carnivores, primates, and rodents had similar palatability, but pangolins (Phataginus sp. and Smutsia gigantea) had higher palatability than all orders except rodents. These findings suggest that substituting wild meat with other types of meat based on palatability might be appropriate, except for pangolins, which can only be suitably substituted with rodents.

AB  - Forage nutrient contents are an important factor explaining the dry matter intake (DMI), average daily gain (ADG), and methane emissions (CH4) of ruminants fed indoors. However, for grazing animals, the forage nutrient contents might be limited in explaining such response variables. We aimed to verify the explanatory power of forage nutrient contents and sward structure on daily intake, performance, and CH4 emissions by sheep and beef cattle grazing different grassland types in southern Brazil. We analyzed data from five grazing trials using sheep and beef cattle grazing on Italian ryegrass (Lolium multiflorum), mixed Italian ryegrass and black oat (Lolium multiflorum + Avena strigosa), pearl millet (Pennisetum americanum), and multispecies native grassland. We used mixed models, including the forage nutrient contents [crude protein (CP), neutral detergent fiber (NDF), and acid detergent fiber (ADF)], sward structure (sward height and herbage mass) and their interactions, as fixed effects and trial, season, methodologies, animal species, grassland type, and paddock, as random effects. The model for DMI (kg DM/LW0.75) had an adjusted coefficient of determination (R-adj(2)) of 71.6 %, where 11.3, 23.1, and 37.2 % of the R(adj )(2)were explained by the forage nutrient contents, sward structure, and their interaction, respectively. The ADG (kg/LW0.75) model presented an R(adj)(2)of 74.2 %, with 12.5 % explained by forage nutrient contents, 29.3 % by sward structure, and 32.4 % by their interaction. The daily CH4 emission (g/LW0.75) model had a lower adjusted coefficient of determination (R(adj)(2)j = 47.6 %), with 16.8 % explained by forage nutrient contents and 30.8 % explained by sward structure, but no effect of the interaction. Our results show that in grazing ecosystems, the forage nutrient contents explain a small fraction, and the greater explanatory power for DMI, ADG, and CH4 emissions models is related to sward structure descriptors, such as sward height and herbage mass. Moreover, the interaction between these variables explains most of the variation. In conclusion, forage

AB  - The application of Zooarchaeology by Mass Spectrometry (ZooMS) on Pleistocene sites in Europe and northern Asia has resulted in the discovery of important new hominin fossils and has expanded the range of identified fauna. However, no systematic, large-scale application of ZooMS on Palaeolithic sites in East Asia has been attempted thus far. Here, we analyse 866 morphologically non-diagnostic bones from Jinsitai Cave in northeast China and Yumidong Cave in South China, from archaeological horizons dating to 150-10 ka BP. Bones from both sites revealed a high degree of collagen preservation and potentially time-related deamidation patterns, despite being located in very distinct environmental settings. At Jinsitai, we identified 31 camel bones, five of which were radiocarbon dated to 37-20 ka BP. All dated specimens correspond to colder periods of Marine Isotope Stages 3 and 2. We regard the presence of camels at Jinsitai as evidence of wild camels being a megafauna taxon targeted, most likely by early modern humans, during their expansion across northeast Asia. This large-scale application of ZooMS in China highlights the potential of the method for furthering our knowledge of the palaeoanthropological and zooarchaeological records of East Asia.

AB  - Plant-arthropod interaction offers insight into the evolution of terrestrial ecosystems in the geological past. In this study, leaf fossils with arthropod traces, collected from the Miocene Huaitoutala flora, Qaidam Basin, northern Tibetan Plateau, were studied to provide direct evidence of plant-arthropod interactions on the Tibetan Plateau. The results show a total of 36 damage types belonging to eight different functional feeding groups, classified on 303 out 01433 leaf specimens with a damage frequency of 70%. Compared to other Miocene fossil floras worldwide, the Huaitoutala flora represents a relatively high frequency and diversity of damage. It indicates that, apart from climatic factors, the influence of local niche and biotic factors might have contributed to the intensive plantarthropod interactions observed at that time, suggesting that the Miocene ecosystem hereof was not as barren as previously thought.

AB  - The study investigated the influence of varied moisture levels in pig manure on the gut microbiome of black soldier fly larvae (BSFL) and their waste conversion efficiency. This encompassed alterations in nutrient components of both BSFL and pig manure, diversity and characterization of the BSFL gut microbiota, and the reciprocal effects between the BSFL gut microbiota and their growth performance and nutrient composition. Additionally, the investigation delved into the changes in the bacterial community and the presence of potential pathogenic bacteria in pig manure. An initial mixture of fresh pig manure and wheat bran was prepared with a 60 % moisture content (Group A). Distilled water was subsequently added to adjust the moisture levels, resulting in mixtures with 65 % (Group B), 70 % (Group C), and 75 % (Group D) moisture content. Each group underwent BSFL digestion over ten days. Groups C (3.87 +/- 0.05 mg/worm) and D (3.97 +/- 0.08 mg/worm) showed significantly higher bioconversion efficiencies and enhanced BSFL growth compared to Groups A (2.66 +/- 0.21 mg/worm) and B (3.09 +/- 0.09 mg/worm) (P < 0.05). A 75 % moisture level was identified as ideal, positively influencing fecal conversion efficiency (FCE) (9.57 +/- 0.14 %), crude fat intake (8.92 +/- 0.56 %), protein (46.60 +/- 0.54 %), and total phosphorus (1.37 +/- 0.08 %) from pig manure, and subsequent nutrient accumulation in BSFLs. A decline in larval crude ash content indicated higher organic matter and an increased pig manure conversion rate with elevated moisture. High-throughput sequencing and diversity analyses confirmed different moisture contents influenced the BSFL gut microbiota. Bacteroidetes (32.7-62.0 %), Proteobacteria (6.8-29.3 %), Firmicutes (5.8-23.4 %), and Actinobacteria (1.9-29.0 %) were predominant phyla. A 75 % moisture content significantly impacted the BSFL biomass conversion and growth performance. Additionally, Larval feces met non-hazardous fertilizer standards, according to NY-525 (2012).

AB  - Formerly common in tropical and subtropical waters of the Atlantic Ocean, the Critically Endangered smalltooth sawfish, Pristis pectinata, underwent severe declines over the past century, restricting population(s) to south and south-west Florida in the US, and Bahamian waters. Anecdotal evidence (e.g. encounter reports from the public) suggests that P. pectinata have recently been observed in historically occupied US waters; however, no directed surveys have been conducted to verify their extent of occupancy. Here, environmental DNA (eDNA) surveys were used to investigate the occurrence of P. pectinata in three formerly occupied estuaries in US waters. Water samples were collected in the summer from the Indian River Lagoon and Tampa Bay, Florida, in 2018 and 2019, and from Mississippi Sound, Mississippi, in 2018, and screened for target DNA using a highly sensitive Droplet Digital (TM) polymerase chain reaction assay. Target DNA was detected at four sites in the Indian River Lagoon in 2018 and at one site in 2019 (average concentration: 0.086 copies mu l(-1); SE = 0.004), but was not detected in either year in Tampa Bay. Target DNA was also detected at three sites near Deer Island in Mississippi Sound in 2018 (average concentration: 0.090 copies mu l(-1); SE = 0.005). These surveys provide additional lines of evidence that P. pectinata is re-occurring within two historically occupied estuaries in US waters. More comprehensive eDNA surveys in historically occupied regions, combined with clearly defined post-survey management actions, can direct additional research and outreach initiatives in emerging priority areas, fostering recovery of this Critically Endangered species.

AB  - Monitoring plant responses to stress is an ongoing challenge for crop breeders, growers, and agronomists. The measurement of below-ground stress is particularly challenging as plants do not always show visible signs of stress in the above-ground organs, particularly at early stages. Hyperspectral imaging is a technique that could be used to overcome this challenge if associations between plant spectral data and specific stresses can be determined. In this study, three genotypes of red raspberry plants grown under controlled conditions in a glasshouse were subjected to below-ground biotic stresses (root pathogen Phytophthora rubi and root herbivore Otiorhynchus sulcatus) or abiotic stress (soil water availability) and regularly imaged using hyperspectral cameras over this period. Significant differences were observed in plant biophysical traits (canopy height and leaf dry mass) and canopy reflectance spectrum between the three genotypes and the imposed stress treatments. The ratio of reflectance at 469 and 523 nm showed a significant genotype-by-treatment interaction driven by differential genotypic responses to the P. rubi treatment. This indicates that spectral imaging can be used to identify variable plant stress responses in raspberry plants.

AB  - Simple Summary Protection of genetic diversity is important for the sustainable development of the animal industry. Due to the unique environment in Hainan Province, the local pig populations have excellent heat resistance and adaptability. Moreover, the meat quality of these pigs is excellent and very popular with the market. Analysis of the genetic composition of the population may provide valuable information for conservation and utilization of the breed. Therefore, in our study, we aimed to assess the genetic diversity and population structure of three Chinese indigenous pig populations in Hainan Province, and further identified candidate selection signatures based on whole-genome sequencing data. Our analysis shows that native Chinese pig populations are more diverse than commercial pigs. In addition, analysis of selection signatures revealed some candidate genes related to certain traits, such as stress resistance. Indigenous pig populations in Hainan Province live in tropical climate conditions and a relatively closed geographical environment, which has contributed to the formation of some excellent characteristics, such as heat tolerance, strong disease resistance and excellent meat quality. Over the past few decades, the number of these pig populations has decreased sharply, largely due to a decrease in growth rate and poor lean meat percentage. For effective conservation of these genetic resources (such as heat tolerance, meat quality and disease resistance), the whole-genome sequencing data of 78 individuals from 3 native Chinese pig populations, including Wuzhishan (WZS), Tunchang (TC) and Dingan (DA), were obtained using a 150 bp paired-end platform, and 25 individuals from two foreign breeds, including Landrace (LR) and Large White (LW), were downloaded from a public database. A total of 28,384,282 SNPs were identified, of which 27,134,233 SNPs were identified in native Chinese pig populations. Both genetic diversity statistics and linkage disequilibrium (LD) analysis indicated that indigenous pig populations displayed high genetic diversity. The result of population structure implied the uniqueness of each native Chinese pig population. The selection signatures were detected between indigenous pig populations and foreign breeds by using the population differentiation index (F-ST) method. A total of 359 candidate genes were identified, and some genes may affect characteristics such as immunity (IL-2, IL-21 and ZFYVE16), adaptability (APBA1), reproduction (FGF2, RNF17, ADAD1 and HIPK4), meat quality (ABCA1, ADIG, TLE4 and IRX5), and heat tolerance (VPS13A, HSPA4). Overall, the findings of this study will provide some valuable insights for the future breeding, conservation and utilization of these three Chinese indigenous pig populations.

AB  - The selection of animals with greater feed efficiency has unknown parasitological and physiological parameters when confined in full sun or shade. Thus, we aimed to assess the effect of residual feed intake (RFI) and the confinement environment on the hematological, parasitological and physiological parameters in male Dorper sheep (n = 60; 30 with positive RFI and 30 with negative RFI) distributed in 2 confinement environments (full sun and shade), in a 2 x 2 factorial scheme, with 15 animals for treatment. Animals kept in the shade showed an increase (P < 0.05) of erythrocytes, hemoglobin and albumin. Animals kept in full sun showed higherOocysts gamma glutamyltransferase, direct bilirubin, transaminase aspartate and respiratory rate (P<0.05). There was a higher incidence of Eimeria spp oocysts in RFI negative animals (P<0.05). Positive RFI animals increased respiratory rate (P<0.05). The RFI did not influence the blood parameters of Dorper sheep, however, it had an effect on respiratory rate and presence of Eimeria spp. oocysts. Thermal environment promoted changes in blood parameters and the physiological parameters of Dorper sheep.

AB  - Potentially toxic elements from geothermal springs can cause significant pollution of the surrounding environment and pose potential risk to the ecosystem. The fate of potentially toxic elements in the water-soil-plant system in the Yangbajain geothermal field on the Tibetan Plateau, China was investigated to assess their impact on the eco-environment. The concentrations of Be, F, As, and Tl were highly elevated in the headwaters of the Yangbajain geothermal springs, and their concentrations in the local surface water impacted by the geothermal springs reached 8.1 mu g/L (Be), 23.9 mg/L (F), 3.83 mg/L (As), and 8.4 mu g/L (Tl), respectively, far exceeding the corresponding thresholds for surface and drinking water. The absence of As-Fe co-precipitation, undersaturated F-, and weak adsorption on minerals at high geothermal spring pH may be responsible for the As- and F-rich drainage, which caused pollution of local river. As concentrations in the leaves of Orinus thoroldii (Stapf ex Hemsl.) Bor were up to 42.7 mu g/g (dry weight basis), which is an order of magnitude higher than the allowable limit in animal feeds. The locally farmed yaks are exposed to the excessive amount of F and As with high exposure risk through water-drinking and grass-feeding.

AB  - Understanding how management influences forage nutritive value and grazer selection within grazing seasons is an ongoing effort for researchers and land managers globally. We used six, 65 ha pastures managed with patchburn grazing and stocked with either cow-calf pairs (0.45-0.5 ha center dot AUM-1) or gestating ewes (0.4-0.48 ha center dot AUM-1) to explore how patterns in rangeland forage drive grazer selection in semi-arid rangeland over four summer grazing seasons at monthly intervals. We used near-infrared spectroscopy to determine nutritive value parameters from monthly forage clippings. We evaluated livestock performance as the average daily weight gains of each animal. We used mixed-effect models and ordination to compare patch and grazer types across the timesince-fire gradient and found that time-since-fire was significant for all measured variables. Cattle and sheep consistently preferred recently burned patches throughout grazing seasons. These recently burned patches typically contained available forage with higher crude protein and moisture content, lower biomass, and lower acid detergent fiber, acid detergent lignin, and neutral detergent fiber compared to intermediate time since fire patches and patches burned three years ago. Differences between patch-burn grazing with cattle and sheep were observed as additional patch contrasts for available biomass and crude protein, but grazer type and ecological site were not statistically significant factors for the nutritive value ordination. Our study indicates that patchburn grazing is capable of imposing and maintaining heterogeneous, grazer selection, forage biomass, and nutritive value patterns desirable for heterogeneity focused land management, regardless of grazer type. These findings are especially relevant to the northern Great Plains where introduced grasses are homogenizing the structural environment of remaining rangelands. With prescribed fire currently an uncommon practice throughout the region, these findings provide a baseline of expectations for practitioners and land managers implementing patch-burn grazing and illustrate how grazing livestock can benefit from the patch contrast in forage nutritive value and biomass.

AB  - Fibrillin-1 (FBN1) functions as a structural protein in the ovary, while the role of its protein product asprosin remains unknown. Both proteins are encoded by the FBN1 gene and when it is cleaved at the C-terminal end, asprosin is produced. Asprosin is associated with various metabolic parameters and sex-related hormones in women. One goal of this research was to quantify FBN1 and the presumed asprosin receptor, olfactory receptor family 4 subfamily M member 1 (OR4M1) mRNA in water buffalo gran-ulosa cells and correlate them to aromatase (CYP19A1) gene expression. A second goal was to determine the effect of asprosin on follicular growth in vivo. In Exp. 1, ovaries were collected from a local slaugh-terhouse, follicular fluid and granulosa cells from small (<6 mm) and large (6-13 mm) follicles were aspirated, cellular RNA extracted for gene expression analysis, data analyzed using ANOVA, and Pearson correlation coefficients were calculated among FBN1, OR4M1, and CYP19A1 gene expression. In Exp. 2, an intra-follicular injection of asprosin (600 ng of asprosin/194 mL of PBS) or vehicle (200 mL of PBS; Con-trols) was given via the theca layer of the dominant follicle of synchronized cows (n = 5/group) 1 day after injection of PGF2a , follicle sizes were measured daily via transrectal ultrasonography for 3 days, a two-way repeated measures ANOVA was used to determine the effect of asprosin on growth rate of follicles from day 0-2, and Chi-square analysis for the percentage of cows ovulated 2 days following asprosin injections. In Exp. 1, FBN1 mRNA abundance was 1.9-fold greater in cells of follicular aspirates from small than large follicles (P < 0.05), but abundance of OR4M1 and CYP19A1 mRNA did not differ (P > 0.10) between the two sizes of follicles. Abundance of FBN1 mRNA was positively correlated with CYP19A1 (r = 0.55, P < 0.05) and OR4M1 mRNA (r = 0.50, P < 0.06) across follicle sizes. In Exp. 2, cows treated with asprosin revealed a greater follicle growth rate from day 0-2 (63.4% increase in diameter) than placebo cows (36.8% increase in diameter) post-injection, and more follicles from asprosin treatment vs. control group (100% vs. 20%; P < 0.05) ovulated within 2 days. These findings suggest that FBN1 may be developmentally regulated in follicular cells, and that asprosin may induce follicular growth in buffaloes, but further studies will be required to determine if asprosin directly regulates estradiol production during follicle development.

AB  - Simple Summary The addition of protected sodium butyrate to the diet of fattening pigs during the whole fattening period (approximate to 90 days) at a dose of 3 kg per ton of feed, did not modify the overall richness of microbiota composition of the pigs at slaughter, but may have caused some significant changes in specific taxa that could be associated with better gut health parameters. In any case, these results should be taken with caution, as the role of a given taxon on the pig's gut health is influenced by numerous variables such as age, diet, environment, treatments, other taxa present, infections, or even the physiological status of the animal. The study assessed changes in the gut microbiota of pigs after dietary supplementation with protected sodium butyrate (PSB) during the growing-fattening period (approximate to 90 days). One gram of colon content from 18 pigs (9 from the treatment group -TG- and 9 from the control group -CG-) was collected. Bacterial DNA was extracted and 16S rRNA high-throughput amplicon sequencing used to assess microbiota changes between groups. The groups shared 75.4% of the 4697 operational taxonomic units identified. No differences in alpha diversity were found, but significant differences for some specific taxa were detected between groups. The low-represented phylum Deinococcus-Thermus, which is associated with the production of carotenoids with antioxidant, anti-apoptotic, and anti-inflammatory properties, was increased in the TG (p = 0.032). Prevotellaceae, Lachnospiraceae, Peptostreptococcaceae, Peptococcaceae, and Terrisporobacter were increased in the TG. Members of these families have the ability to ferment complex dietary polysaccharides and produce larger amounts of short chain fatty acids. Regarding species, only Clostridium butyricum was increased in the TG (p = 0.048). Clostridium butyricum is well-known as probiotic in humans, but it has also been associated with overall positive gut effects (increased villus height, improved body weight, reduction of diarrhea, etc.) in weanling pigs. Although the use of PSB did not modify the overall richness of microbiota composition of these slaughter pigs, it may have increased specific taxa associated with better gut health parameters.

AB  - Silicon-based defenses deter insect herbivores in many cultivated and wild grass species. Furthermore, in some of these species, silicon (Si) uptake and defense can be induced by herbivory. Tropical trees also take up Si and leaf Si concentrations vary greatly across and within species. As herbivory is a major driver of seedling mortality and niche differentiation of tropical tree species, understanding anti-herbivore defenses is pivotal. Yet, whether silicon is a constitutive and inducible herbivory defense in tropical forest tree species remains unknown. We grew seedlings of eight tropical tree species in a full factorial experiment, including two levels of plant-available soil Si concentrations (-Si/+Si) and a simulated herbivory treatment (-H/+H). The simulated herbivory treatment was a combination of clipping and application of methyl jasmonate. We then carried out multiple-choice feeding trials, separately for each tree species, in which leaves of each treatment combination were offered to a generalist caterpillar (Spodoptera frugiperda). Leaf damage was assessed. Three species showed a significant decrease in leaf damage under high compared to low Si conditions (by up to 72%), consistent with our expectation of Si-based defenses acting in tropical tree species. In one species, leaf damage was increased by increasing soil Si and in four species, no effect of soil Si on leaf damage was observed. Opposite to our expectation of Si uptake and defense being inducible by herbivory damage, simulated herbivory increased leaf damage in two species. Furthermore, simulated herbivory reduced Si concentrations in one species. Our results showed that tropical tree seedlings can be better defended when growing in Si-rich compared to Si-poor soils, and that the effects of Si on plant defense vary strongly across species. Furthermore, Si-based defenses may not be inducible in tropical tree species. Overall, constitutive Si-based defense should be considered part of the vast array of anti-herbivore defenses of tropical tree species. Our finding that Si-based defenses are highly species-specific combined with the fact that herbivory is a major driver of mortality in tropical tree seedling, suggests that variation in soil Si concentrations may have pervasive consequences for regeneration and performance across tropical tree species.

AB  - Goat milk and oligosaccharides play important roles in gastrointestinal health. A combination of goat milk with three oligosaccharides, stachyose (STS), fructo-oligosaccharide (FOS), and a prebiotics mixture (FGS), was fed to mice. Changes and functions of the microbiota, short chain fatty acid (SCFA) concentrations, and immune gene expression in the small intestines were determined. The FOS treatment increased the beneficial bacteria Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium, the FGS treatment helped stabilize the microbial community, and the STS treatment significantly enhanced microbial diversity and the growth of Bacteroidetes. The oligosaccharide treatments regulated the gene expression levels of the immune factors tumor necrosis factor alpha (Tnf alpha), granzyme B (Gzmb), perform (MP, and aryl hydrocarbon receptor (Ahr). Stachyose significantly increased the concentrations of acetate and propionate compared with other treatments. These findings demonstrate that STS is the preferred carbon source for microbiota, slightly modulates SCFA production, and results in low immunogenicity in the small intestines of mice.

AB  - Cell-based toxicity testing has emerged as a useful tool in (eco)toxicological research, allowing the ethical assessment of the effects of contaminants such as trace metals on marine megafauna. However, metal interactions with various dissolved ligands in the microplate environment may influence the effective exposure concentrations. Hence, the cells are not exposed to the nominal concentrations within the test system. This study aimed to establish and evaluate the effectiveness of cell-based bioassays for investigating the toxicity of selected metals in dugongs through the following objectives: (1) measure the cytotoxic potential of cadmium (Cd2+), and chromium (Cr6+) to dugong skin cell cultures, (2) investigate the interactions between media constituents and selected trace metals in cell-based bioassays, and (3) evaluate the risk to a free-ranging population of dugong based on effect values. Chromium was the most toxic of the metals tested (EC50 = 1.14 mu M), followed by Cd (EC50 = 6.35 mu M). Assessment of ultrafiltered (< 3 kDa) exposure media showed that 1% and 92.5% of Cr and Cd were associated with larger organic components of the media. Further, the binding of Cd to media constituents was calculated to underestimate Cd toxicity in cell-based assays by an order of magnitude. This understanding of metal partitioning in cell-based bioassays provides a more accurate method for assessing toxicity in cell-based bioassays. In addition, this study illustrated that dugong cells are more sensitive to Cr and Cd than other marine wildlife species. The chemical risk assessment found the dugong population in Moreton Bay to be at high risk from Cd exposure.

AB  - The Aransas-Wood Buffalo population (the only non-reintroduced, migratory population) of endangered whooping cranes (Grus americana) overwinters along the Texas Gulf Coast, USA. Understanding whooping crane space use on the wintering grounds reveals essential aspects of this species' ecology, which subsequently assists with conservation. Using global positioning system telemetry data from marked whooping cranes during 2009-2017, we fit continuous-time stochastic process models to describe movement and home range using autocorrelated kernel density estimation (AKDE) and explored variation in home range size in relation to age, sex, reproductive status, and drought conditions. We used the Bhattacharyya coefficient of overlap and distance between home range centroids to quantify site fidelity. We examined the effects of time between winter home ranges and the sex of the crane on site fidelity using Bayesian mixed-effects beta regression. Winter whooping crane 95% AKDE home range size averaged 30.1 +/- 45.2 (SD) km(2) (median = 14.3, range = 1.1-308.6). Home ranges of sub-adult females were approximately 2 times larger than those of sub-adult males or families. As drought worsened, home ranges typically expanded. Between consecutive years, the home ranges of an adult crane exhibited 68 +/- 31% overlap (site fidelity), but fidelity to winter sites declined in subsequent winters. The overlap of adult home ranges with the nearest unrelated family averaged 33 +/- 28%. As a whooping crane aged, overlap with its winter home range as a juvenile declined, regardless of sex. By 4 years of age, a whooping crane had approximately 14 +/- 28% overlap with its juvenile winter home range. Limited evidence suggested male whooping cranes return to within 2 km of their juvenile home range by their fifth winter. Previous data obtained from aerial surveys led ecologists to assume that whooping crane families normally used small areas (similar to 2 km(2)) and expressed persistent site fidelity. Our analyses showed <8% of families had home ranges <= 2 km(2), with the average area 15 times greater, and waning site fidelity over time. Our work represents an analysis of whooping crane home ranges for this population, identifying past misconceptions of winter space use and resulting in better estimates of space requirements for future conservation efforts.

AB  - Wildlife and wildlife interfaces with people and livestock are essential surveillance targets to monitor emergent or en-demic pathogens or new threats affecting wildlife, livestock, and human health. However, limitations of previous in-vestments in scope and duration have resulted in a neglect of wildlife health surveillance (WHS) systems at national and global scales, particularly in lower and middle income countries (LMICs). Building on decades of wildlife health activities in LMICs, we demonstrate the implementation of a locally-driven multi-pronged One Health approach to establishing WHS in Cambodia, Lao PDR and Viet Nam under the WildHealthNet initiative. WildHealthNet utilizes existing local capacity in the animal, public health, and environmen-tal sectors for event based or targeted surveillance and disease detection. To scale up surveillance systems to the na-tional level, WildHealthNet relies on iterative field implementation and policy development, capacity bridging, improving data collection and management systems, and implementing context specific responses to wildlife health intelligence.National WHS systems piloted in Cambodia, Lao PDR, and Viet Nam engaged protected area rangers, wildlife rescue centers, community members, and livestock and human health sector staff and laboratories. Surveillance activities de-tected outbreaks of H5N1 highly pathogenic avian influenza in wild birds, African swine fever in wild boar (Sus scrofa), Lumpy skin disease in banteng (Bos javanicus), and other endemic zoonotic pathogens identified as surveillance prior-ities by local stakeholders. In Cambodia and Lao PDR, national plans for wildlife disease surveillance are being signed into legislation.Cross-sectoral and trans-disciplinary approaches are needed to implement effective WHS systems. Long-term commit-ment, and paralleled implementation and policy development are key to sustainable WHS networks. WildHealthNet offers a roadmap to aid in the development of locally-relevant and locally-led WHS systems that support the global ob-jectives of the World Organization for Animal Health's Wildlife Health Framework and other international agendas.

AB  - Megaherbivore carcasses represent sporadic but energetically rewarding resources for carnivores, offering a unique opportunity to study coexistence dynamics between facultative scavengers. South African fenced protected areas, such as Madikwe Game Reserve (Madikwe hereafter), host viable populations of large carnivores and high densities of elephants, Loxodonta africana. However, high carnivore densities can lead to potentially fatal interspecific encounters and increased competition, particularly around high-quality trophic resources. This study explores the temporal partitioning and co-detection strategies of carnivores at six elephant carcasses in Madikwe, aiming to understand how the increased carrion biomass available at elephant carcasses influences coexistence dynamics. Camera traps were deployed to monitor carcasses during two periods (2019 and 2020), revealing occurrences of six carnivore species. Carnivores, particularly black-backed jackals, Lupulella mesomelas, (hereafter jackal), lions, Panthera leo, and spotted hyaenas, Crocuta crocuta, comprised 56.7% of carcass observations, highlighting their pivotal roles in scavenging dynamics. Pairwise co-detection analysis demonstrated consistent association and shared peak activity periods between jackals and spotted hyaenas, indicating potential resource sharing. However, the minimal co-detection rates between lions and other carnivores highlight their resource domination. There was some evidence of temporal partitioning between carnivores, with most species exhibiting earlier peaks in nocturnal activity to avoid temporal overlap with lions. This study emphasises the importance of elephant carcasses in the diet of multiple species and coexistence techniques utilised to exploit this ephemeral resource. As fenced protected areas become crucial for conserving intact carnivore guilds globally, further research into carnivore behavioural adaptations at carcasses is recommended to shed light on their coexistence strategies.
   Megaherbivore carcasses represent sporadic but energetically rewarding resources for carnivores and it is poorly understood how these carrion resources impact interspecific interactions. We studied elephant carcasses in Madikwe Game Reserve, South Africa, to investigate temporal partitioning and co-occurrence between the carnivore guild. Co-occurrence was high between some carnivores, suggesting aggressive interactions may be reduced by abundant food resources.image

AB  - Pig manure (PM), wheat straw (WS), compost product (CP) and improved compost product (IC) are very important agricultural organic resources. In this study, their applicability as soil organic fertilizations (OFs) in terms of their prop-erties and influence on soil properties through an incubation experiment and a field verification were evaluated. The property differences indicated that wheat straw has the highest C/N ratio, and compost products contain more aro-matic compounds compared with pig manure and wheat straw. The results of incubation experiment showed that OFs promoted the carbon and nitrogen transformation driven by related microorganisms and their functional metab-olisms. The PM treatment had the highest proportion of Labile organic carbon to soil organic carbon (LOC/SOC) and ratio of dissolved organic carbon to soil organic carbon (DOC/SOC), while WS treatment had the lowest values. The highest net N mineralization rate and nitrification rate was observed in the WS treatment, but the lowest amounts were under the PM treatment. Additionally, the similar findings were also obtained from the field examination. There-fore, compost products were more applicable in agricultural soil as OF insight from changes in carbon, nitrogen and microbial community. Furthermore, the result of UV-vision showed that the largest amount of aromatic structure was observed in IC relative to CP. It can be concluded that CP was more conducive to fix carbon and provide available nitrogen for crops among four OFs.

AB  - This work aimed to assess the suitability of a microalgal blend as a dietary ingredient for feeding juveniles of marine carnivorous and herbivorous teleost, as is the case of Sparus aurata and Mugil cephalus, respectively, and to isolate microorganisms from different media and characterize them on the base of their enzymatic activities and their antagonism against important fish pathogens. Thirty juveniles of each species (70 +/- 3.2 g S. aurata mean weight and 47 +/- 2.8 g M. cephalus mean weight) were distributed in four tanks (15 individuals each) corresponding to four independent dietary treatments (control and microalgae diets designed for each species). Fish were fed their corresponding diets ad libitum for 108 days. At the end of the trial, fish were weighed, and plasma, liver, perivisceral fat, and the entire intestines were obtained for the evaluation of growth performance and metabolic assessment. Furthermore, 117 bacterial strains were isolated in different culture media from the gastrointestinal tract of S. aurata fed the microalgae blend and further characterized for their potential use as probiotics in aquaculture. S. aurata fed the microalgae-supplemented diet (25% dietary inclusion) showed a significant increase in weight gain, specific growth rate, feed efficiency, hepatosomatic, and intestine length indices. However, growth performance and somatic indices in M. cephalus were not affected by the experimental diets. Plasma samples from S. aurata fed the microalgal diet revealed higher levels of glucose and triglycerides and a decrease in cortisol levels. No significant differences were found in any biochemical parameters among the experimental diets in M. cephalus. In conclusion, both species demonstrated a favorable adaptation to the nutritional formulation employed in this study, and bacterial strains UMA-169 and UMA-216 (both identified as Bacillus pumilus) could be considered for use in aquaculture as they might benefit host health by improving digestion and absorption of different energy sources and by minimizing the colonization of pathogenic species.

AB  - Biochar promotes microbial metabolic activities and reduces N2O on aerobic composting. However, the effects of magnetic biochar (MBC) on the microbial succession and N2O emissions during pig manure composting remain unclear. Herein, a 42-day composting experiment was conducted with five treatment regimes: pig manure without biochar (CK), 5 % pig manure-based biochar (5 % PBC), 2 % MBC (2 % MBC), 5 % MBC (5 % MBC) and 7.5 % MBC (7.5 % MBC)), to clarify the variation in functional microorganisms and genes associated with nitrogen and direct interspecies electron transfer via metagenomics. Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy showed that MBC possessed more stable aromatic structures than pig manure-based biochar (PBC), indicating its greater potential for nitrous oxide reduction. MBC treatments were more effective in composting organic matter and improving the carbon/nitrogen ratio than PBC. The microbial composition during composting varied significantly, with the dominant phyla shifting from Firmicutes to Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria, and Bacteroidota. Network and hierarchical clustering analyses showed that the MBC treatment enhanced the interactions of dominant microbes (Proteobacteria and Bacteroidota) and accelerated the composting process. The biochar addition accelerated assimilatory nitrate reduction and slowed dissimilatory nitrate reduction and denitrification. The Mantel test demonstrated that magnetic biochar potentially helped regulate composting nutrients and affected functional nitrogen genes. These findings shed light on the role of MBC in mitigating greenhouse gas emissions during aerobic composting.

AB  - Sarcophagidae is a family of true flies frequently found colonizing carcasses and corpses as adults and/or larvae, therefore, they are of great forensic value in the medico-legal field. Thus, this study aims to inventory the sarcophagids species and describe their succession process in the decomposition of swine carcasses in the Cerrado (savanna-like vegetation), Brazilian Northeastern region. A total of 10,819 specimens were collected, belonging to 45 sarcophagid species. Of this total, one species was recently described (Helicobia neuzalmeidae Silva, Brasil, De-Souza & Carvalho-Filho), two [Blaesoxipha (Acanthodotheca) denieri (Blanchard) and Dexosarcophaga pusilla Lopes] are new records for the Cerrado biome, five [Argoravinia (Argoravinia) catiae Carvalho Filho & Esposito, B. (A.) denieri, Nephochaetopteryx orbitalis (Curran & Walley), Peckia (Sarcodexia) tridentata (Hall) and Tricharaea (Sarcophagula) ramirezi (Lopes)] are new records for the Northeast region and eight are new records for the state of Maranhao. The species A. (A.) catiae, Blaesoxipha (Gigantotheca) stallengi (Lahille), D. pusilla, H. neuzalmeidae, Lipoptilocnema misella Lopes, Oxysarcodexia bakeri (Aldrich) and Retrocitomyia retrocita (Hall) were collected for the first time in pig carcasses. Peckia (Sarcodexia) lambens (Wiedemann) and Oxysarcodexia thornax (Walker) were the most abundant species. In both collection seasons, five species were carcasses pioneers at an early stage. The majority of species (42 spp.) were collected during the dry season, primarily during the black putrefaction (39 spp.) and butyric fermentation (30 spp.) stages. The greatest number specimens (n = 6,484) were recorded during the rainy season, at the butyric fermentation (n = 2,517) and black putrefaction (n = 2,080).

AB  - PurposeTapeworms of Avitellina spp. are among those gastrointestinal parasitic helminths which infect wild and domestic ruminants worldwide leading to various clinical manifestations in the ruminant hosts, thereby causing considerable economic losses in livestock production. While these worms are among the major constraints in ruminant livestock raising, there is very meagre molecular information available making their identity error-prone. This study aimed to provide insights into the genetic characterization of these economically important tapeworms.MethodsIn the present study, we examined 480 guts of slaughtered goats (n = 413) and sheep (n = 67) of which 74 guts were found infected with anoplocephalid cestodes (sheep gut:18; goat gut:56). A total of 27 Avitellina lahorea worms (19 from goat and 8 from sheep) were isolated, fixed, relaxed and stained using Gower's carmine stain. For molecular analyses, the genomic DNA was extracted and fragments of cytochrome c oxidase subunit 1 (cox1) gene, internal transcribed spacer1-5.8S ribosomal RNA (ITS1-5.8S rRNA) gene, and small subunit ribosomal RNA (18S rRNA) gene were amplified and sequenced.ResultsBased on snail-shaped paruterine organs and other morphological and morphometric features, the worms were identified as Avitellina lahorea. The phylogenetic analyses, based on our original cox1 gene sequence and those available from NCBI GenBank, showed Avitellina tapeworms as a sister lineage of Thysaniezia with 14 to 17% genetic divergence. Molecular analyses of 18S rRNA gene sequences depicted the present isolate as one of the species of the genus Avitellina clustering with A. centripunctata as a separate species in the phylogenetic tree with 92% homogeneity in sequences. In conjunction with existing data of internal transcribed spacer1-5.8S rRNA (ITS1-5.8S rRNA) gene, the phylogenetic analysis placed the present isolate among the anoplocephalids as one of the species.ConclusionThe present study is the first molecular report on A. lahorea isolated from sheep and goats with the simultaneous use of a morphological approach, and certainly contributes to bridging the existing gaps in the understanding of these economically important parasites.

AB  - Biological control programs provide simplified systems in which to investigate the influence of temperature on trophic interactions. We investigated the interaction between the invasive thistle Carduus nutans and its specialist herbivore, the biological control agent weevil Rhinocyllus conicus, along a temperature gradient spanning an urban-to-rural urbanization gradient in central Pennsylvania. As expected, more urbanized sites were warmer than rural sites. Nevertheless, C. nutans phenology was only slightly earlier at warmer sites, and the timing of observations of adult R. conicus on thistles did not shift earlier, leaving synchrony apparently unchanged. Despite unchanged phenological matching, seasonal patterns in weevil damage varied with temperature: early-appearing capitula at warmer sites were more heavily damaged than early capitula at cooler sites, yet overall a lower proportion of capitula was damaged at warmer sites. Rising temperatures may therefore reduce effectiveness of R. conicus for C. nutans control, as more capitula escape damage. Biological control systems and naturally occurring temperature gradients are useful systems in which to investigate climate change impacts, but a focus on the phenology of organisms' presence or absence may not be sufficient; our study demonstrates that consideration of the interaction itself may be necessary.

AB  - This research paper delves into the two-dimensional discrete plant-herbivore model. In this model, herbivores are food-limited and affect the plants' density in their environment. Our analysis reveals that this system has equilibrium points of extinction, exclusion, and coexistence. We analyze the behavior of solutions near these points and prove that the extinction and exclusion equilibrium points are globally asymptotically stable in certain parameter regions. At the boundary equilibrium, we prove the existence of transcritical and perioddoubling bifurcations with stable two-cycle. Transcritical bifurcation occurs when the plant's maximum growth rate or food-limited parameter reaches a specific boundary. This boundary serves as an invasion boundary for populations of plants or herbivores. At the interior equilibrium, we prove the occurrence of transcritical, Neimark-Sacker, and period-doubling bifurcations with an unstable two-cycle. Our research also establishes that the system is persistent in certain regions of the first quadrant. We demonstrate that the local asymptotic stability of the interior equilibrium does not guarantee the system's persistence. Bistability exists between boundary attractors (logistic dynamics) and interior equilibrium for specific parameters' regions. We conclude that changes to the food-limitation parameter can significantly alter the system's dynamic behavior. To validate our theoretical findings, we conduct numerical simulations.

AB  - Although there is a high number of publications listing fish species in the Adriatic, only a few have focused on chondrichthyans, while their conservation status has been investigated even less. Thus, this paper aims to provide an updated and annotated checklist of the chondrichthyans occurring in the Adriatic waters with their presence and conservation status. Each species is evaluated against the criteria defined in IUCN (International Union for Conservation of Nature) Red List Categories and Criteria and according to the guidelines for national and regional level assessments. In total, 60 chondrichthyan species from 27 families and 42 genera are listed. The list contains 33 species of sharks, 26 species of rays and one chimera. Assessment of the conservation status reveals that three species are now considered Regionally Extinct (namely Squatina oculata, Pristis pectinata and Rhinobatos rhinobatos). A total of 21 species are assessed as Critically Endangered, 8 are Endangered and 10 are Vulnerable. Of the remaining species, six are Near Threatened and the same number of species are Least Concern and Data Deficient. Considering that the principal driver of chondrichthyan decline and regional extinction is overfishing, it is recommended that the Adriatic countries adopt the same management measures and strengthen their coordination.

AB  - Simple Summary Feeding habits were the main factor affecting the gut microbial community structure of Ensifera (Insecta: Orthoptera). The gut microbial communities of Ensifera with different feeding habits were significantly different, as insects with more diverse feeding habits had gut microorganisms with less specific functions. However, feeding habits are not the only factors that affect the gut microbial community structure of Ensifera. Factors related to energy and nutrition acquisition also affect them, such as the abundance of some microbial functional genes unrelated to feeding habits but related to survival. Feeding habits were the primary factor affecting the gut bacterial communities in Ensifera. However, the interaction mechanism between the gut microbiota and feeding characteristics is not precisely understood. Here, the gut microbiota of Ensifera with diverse feeding habits was analyzed by shotgun metagenomic sequencing to further clarify the composition and function of the gut microbiota and its relationship with feeding characteristics. Our results indicate that under the influence of feeding habits, the gut microbial communities of Ensifera showed specific characteristics. Firstly, the gut microbial communities of the Ensifera with different feeding habits differed significantly, among which the gut microbial diversity of the herbivorous Mecopoda niponensis was the highest. Secondly, the functional genes related to feeding habits were in high abundance. Thirdly, the specific function of the gut microbial species in the omnivorous Gryllotalpa orientalis showed that the more diverse the feeding behavior of Ensifera, the worse the functional specificity related to the feeding characteristics of its gut microbiota. However, feeding habits were not the only factors affecting the gut microbiota of Ensifera. Some microorganisms' genes, whose functions were unrelated to feeding characteristics but were relevant to energy acquisition and nutrient absorption, were detected in high abundance. Our results were the first to report on the composition and function of the gut microbiota of Ensifera based on shotgun metagenomic sequencing and to explore the potential mechanism of the gut microbiota's association with diverse feeding habits.

AB  - Yak is a unique species of cattle that is adapted to the harsh natural environment of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau. Research on the function of the yak rumen is limited to animal experiments, and the cell molecular mechanism is very limited. The high cost of isolation and culture of adult yak rumen epithelial cells (YRECs), low success rate, and limited cell life limit the scope of long-term physiological functions and nutrient absorption mechanisms of yak rumen epithelium in vitro studies. This study aimed to explore the isolation and immortal culture methods of primary YRECs and establish a new cell line model for studying cell molecular mechanisms. The human telomerase reverse transcriptase gene (hTERT) and simian virus 40 large T antigen (SV40T) were transferred into primary YDECs using mammalian gene expression lentiviral vectors. The immortalized cell line (SV40T-YREC-hTERT) retains the morphological and functional characteristics of primary cells. The epithelial cell marker protein cytokeratin 18 of the immortalized cell lines was positive, and the cell proliferation and karyotype were normal. The SV40T and hTERT genes were successfully transferred into immortalized cell lines and maintained high expression. Simultaneously, the immortalized cell lines had normal function of short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) transport and absorption, and the immortalized yak rumen epithelial cell lines were successfully established. In addition, the transepithelial electrical resistance value gradually increased with culture time, and the permeability of epithelial cells decreased by culturing epithelial cells in Transwell culture chambers. Transmission electron microscopy demonstrated the submicroscopic structure of cells in the integrity barrier model and established the YREC barrier model in vitro.

AB  - Humans have exploited wild animals for thousands of years. Recent studies indicate that harvest-induced selection on life-history and morphological traits may lead to ecological and evolutionary changes. Less attention has been given to harvest-induced selection on behavioural traits, especially in terrestrial systems. We assessed in a wild population of large terrestrial mammals whether decades of hunting led to harvest-induced selection on trappability, a proxy of risk-taking behaviour. We investigated links between trappability, horn growth and survival across individuals in early life and quantified the correlations between early-life trappability and horn growth with availability to hunters and probability of being shot. We found positive among-individual correlations between early-life trappability and horn growth, early-life trappability and survival and early-life horn growth and survival. Faster growing individuals were more likely to be available to hunters and shot at a young age. We found no correlations between early-life trappability and availability to hunters or probability of being shot. Our results show that correlations between behaviour and growth can occur in wild terrestrial population but may be context dependent. This result highlights the difficulty in formulating general predictions about harvest-induced selection on behaviour, which can be affected by species ecology, harvesting regulations and harvesting methods used. Future studies should investigate mechanisms linking physiological, behavioural and morphological traits and how this effects harvest vulnerability to evaluate the potential for harvest to drive selection on behaviour in wild animal populations.
   We quantified among-individual correlations in behaviour, growth and survival in a wild bighorn sheep population and assessed whether decades of size-selective hunting led to indirect harvest-induced selection on behaviour. We found positive among-individual correlations between early-life trappability, growth and survival but no correlations between early-life behaviour and vulnerability to hunters. Our results show that correlations between behaviour, growth and life-history traits can occur in wild terrestrial population but may be context dependent and highlight the difficulty in formulating general predictions about harvest-induced selection on behaviour.image

AB  - Introduction Monitoring bycatch of protected species is a fisheries management priority. In practice, protected species bycatch is difficult to precisely or accurately estimate with commonly used ratio estimators or parametric, linear model-based methods. Machine-learning algorithms have been proposed as means of overcoming some of the analytical hurdles in estimating protected species bycatch.Methods Using 17 years of set-specific bycatch data derived from 100% observer coverage of the Hawaii shallow-set longline fishery and 25 aligned environmental predictors, we evaluated a new approach for protected species bycatch estimation using Ensemble Random Forests (ERFs). We tested the ability of ERFs to predict interactions with five protected species with varying levels of bycatch in the fishery and methods for correcting these predictions using Type I and Type II error rates from the training data. We also assessed the amount of training data needed to inform a ERF approach by mimicking the sequential addition of new data in each subsequent fishing year.Results We showed that ERF bycatch estimation was most effective for species with greater than 2% interaction rates and error correction improved bycatch estimates for all species but introduced a tendency to regress estimates towards mean rates in the training data. Training data needs differed among species but those above 2% interaction rates required 7-12 years of bycatch data.Discussion Our machine learning approach can improve bycatch estimates for rare species but comparisons are needed to other approaches to assess which methods perform best for hyperrare species.

AB  - Understanding the causes of variability in functional traits is an important question in earthworm ecology. While interspecific variation in anatomical dimensions for the same trait is well accepted, the role of environmental filters, soil degradation, and environmental stress in affecting the variability of functional traits is not well understood. In this study, we sought to determine the relative importance of environmental factors and earthworm species taxonomy on the variability in functional traits within species (intraspecific variability). We focused on eight functional traits including body mass, body length, body diameter, gizzard, gizzard thickness, septum thickness, typhlosole, and gut organic matter. We sampled earthworms of 11 different species in various regions of the eastern Amazon to determine the general responses of different species' characteristics when exposed to various ecosystem and soil conditions. Our results suggest that the functional traits of earthworms are influenced in different ways by environmental conditions. One set of traits, including body mass, body length, and body diameter, was more constant and independent of environmental variability, while another set, including gizzard diameter and length, gizzard muscle thickness, septum thickness, typhlosole, and intestinal organic matter, was more sensitive. The most affected by different environmental variables was septum thickness. We also examined which environmental factors are most important for trait variability. Our study highlights the importance of considering both environmental factors and taxonomic classification when studying the variability of functional traits within earthworm species. Overall, our results suggest that taxonomic classification alone is a good guide for estimating the major functional traits of earthworms in the Brazilian Amazon, but local conditions can their variability is which is essential for informing conservation efforts and maintaining ecosystem function.

AB  - Reproductive traits are central to organismal fitness, and so the factors influencing patterns of reproduction and offspring survival are at the heart of biology. Making use of breeding data collected over 16 years at the King Khalid Wildlife Research Centre in Saudi Arabia, we investigated the reproductive biology of Arabian gazelles Gazella arabica. Offspring survival was mainly a function of birth weight, with heavier offspring having higher survival rates than lighter offspring. However, while sons were heavier than daughters, daughters had higher survival rates. We could not find evidence that giving birth to sons negatively impacts offspring weight in the following year. We uncovered large narrow-sense heritability (h(2)) in offspring weight at birth, while maternal effects (m(2)) on birth weight were of lesser importance. However, maternal effects on offspring survival were strong until weaning age, while paternal effects dominated survival to sexual maturity and first reproduction. We propose that variation in maternal postnatal care might overshadow the effects of maternal inheritance of birth weights, while the overall strong heritability of weight at birth and the paternal effects on survival illustrates strong variance in sire fitness based on genetic quality, suggesting a role for sexual selection by female mate choice in wild populations.

AB  - The existence of bronchopulmonary nematodes in German roe deer Capreolus capreolus is well documented, with two types of lung parasites that have been described previously: Dictyocaulus capreolus and Varestrongylus capreoli. However, little is known about the impact of these parasites on their host animal or which parameters influence outbreak and intensity of infection. The aim of this study was to obtain new information on the relevance of factors such as season, environmental conditions or age, sex, and body mass of the infected roe deer. To obtain our results, the respiratory tracts of 762 roe deer from south-eastern Germany were examined. In the sample, 42.5% of roe deer were infested with V. capreoli and 14.0% with D. capreolus, and 51.3% of animals were completely free of lung parasites. Testing for influencing variables, our regression models found both sex and age of the roe deer to statistically influence infestation, with male sex and younger age correlating with both stronger infestation and higher infestation rates. Accordingly, in male animals the infestation rates with V. capreoli and D. capreolus (45.1% and 20.1%, respectively) were higher than in females (39.4% and 8.0%, respectively). The overall infestation rate of juvenile animals was remarkably higher (73%) than those of sub-adults (38.3%) or adults (28.4%). Across all age groups, infested animals showed lower body weights compared to non-infested animals. According to our multiple linear regression model, roe deer infected with D. capreolus on average weighed 0.65 kg less than their healthy counterparts, and in the case of V. capreoli 0.72 kg less on average. While the burden on the well-being of infested animals can only be assumed, these concrete figures (reduced body weight in infested compared to healthy animals) demonstrate the economic damage lung parasites cause to meat harvesting from bagged roe deer.

AB  - Microplastics have emerged as a significant environmental threat, yet their distribution in goat farms and their impact on livestock products remain underexplored. This study aims to identify and quantify microplastics in various components of goat farming, including soil (grass fields), main feed, supplementary feed, drinking water, goat feces, and goat milk. The research methodology involved sampling 1 kg from each livestock component, followed by chemical digestion for sample preparation and microplastic analysis using FTIR spectroscopy. The microplastic data were analyzed by shape (fiber, fragment, film, filament, granule, sheet) and color (black, blue, red, transparent, yellow), as well as the polymer type, to assess their distribution across the farm. The results showed that fiber was the most dominant form of microplastic, with the highest number found in goat farm (250 particles/kg), while black dominated the entire sample and the type of polyethylene and low-density polyethylene polymer found. These findings suggest that feed, water, and the farm environment are major sources of microplastics, which may accumulate in goats' bodies and subsequently enter dairy products. This study provides valuable insights into the potential risks microplastics pose to livestock health and food safety, highlighting the need for efforts to reduce microplastic pollution in the livestock industry.

AB  - Estimating the population parameters, performance and factors that influence reproduction from long-term, individual-based monitoring data is the gold standard for effective wildlife management and conservation. Yet this information is often difficult and costly to collect or inaccessible to managers. We synthesized a 20-year set of individual-based monitoring data from a subset of black rhinoceros Diceros bicornis subpopulations across a range of environmental conditions in Namibia. Our findings demonstrate that despite the relatively arid landscape in Namibia, the black rhinoceros metapopulation is performing well, measured by age at first reproduction, inter-birth interval, population growth and survivorship. Information-theoretic modelling revealed that a univariate model including normalized differential vegetative index had a greater influence upon age at first reproduction than population density. The inter-birth interval model set identified cumulative rainfall during the 15 months prior to the birth month as the top model, although the mean normalized differential vegetative index during the inter-birth interval was comparable. There was little evidence for density-dependence effects on reproduction. These findings suggest that although browse quality could have a greater impact on parameters spanning multiple years, shorter-term parameters could be more influenced by rainfall. Our analysis also revealed a synchronous pattern of conceptions occurring in the rainy season. Our study provides a set of population parameter estimates for Namibian black rhinoceros subpopulations and preliminary insights on factors driving their reproduction. These expand our collective knowledge of global black rhinoceros population dynamics and improve our confidence and capability to adaptively manage the black rhinoceros metapopulation of Namibia.

AB  - Context. Carrion is a high-energy and nutrient-rich resource that attracts a diverse group of vertebrate scavengers. However, despite the carrion pool being highly seasonal in its availability, there is little understanding of how scavengers utilise carcasses across all four seasons. Aim. To assess how season influences carcass-detection times by vertebrate scavengers and their rates of scavenging. Methods. We used remote cameras to monitor vertebrate scavenging at 15 eastern grey kangaroo (Macropus giganteus) carcasses in four consecutive seasons (summer, autumn, winter, and spring; total 58 carcasses) in the Australian Alps. Key results. In total, 745 599 remote-camera images were captured, within which 34 vertebrate species were identified, nine of which were recorded to actively scavenge. Time to first detection of carcasses by vertebrate scavengers was 5.3 and 9.6 times longer during summer (average 144 h) than during spring (average 34 h) and winter (average 24 h) respectively. Rates of vertebrate scavenging were highest in winter and spring, with brushtail possums (Trichosurus vulpecula) accounting for 78% of all scavenging events during winter, and ravens (Corvus spp.) accounting for 73% during spring. High rates of carcass use by these mesoscavengers may reflect a scarcity of other food sources, the demands of their breeding season, or a relative absence of scavenging by larger dominant species such as dingoes (Canis dingo) and wedge-tailed eagles (Aquila audax). Conclusions. These findings demonstrate the highly seasonal nature of vertebrate scavenging dynamics in an alpine ecosystem, and that mesoscavengers, not apex scavengers, can dominate the use of carcasses. Implications. Accounting for the effects of season is integral to understanding the way animals utilise carcasses in alpine and other strongly seasonal environments; and for developing further our knowledge of ecosystem processes linked to decomposition.

AB  - The Subfamily Dolichotinae comprises two living species, Dolichotis patagonum, an emblematic component of the Patagonian fauna of Argentina, and Dolichotis salinicola, endemic to the Chaco ecoregion. These two species are also considered as pertaining to different genera, D. patagonum and Pediolagus salinicola. The oldest records of Dolichotis come from the Pliocene-Pleistocene boundary of northeastern and central Argentina, and the late Pleistocene from southern Brazil, and northern and southern Uruguay. Five fossil species were described from the Pleistocene and Holocene in central Argentina (D. minor, D. plathycephala, D. major, D. intermedia, and D. improla). "Orthomyctera" chapalmalense was described on the basis of remains from the coast of Mar del Plata and Chapadmalal, Buenos Aires Province, Chapadmalal Formation (late Pliocene, 3.74-3.04 Ma). A new detailed description of the holotype and its comparison with closely related taxa suggests that this species is more related to the genus Dolichotis, resulting in the new combination D. chapalmalense. The close affinities with Dolichotis revealed by phylogenetic analyses combined with molecular and morphological characters were corroborated in previous analyses. The origin of this lineage extends at least to a million years ago, taking the record back to the middle Pliocene. The evolutionary novelties that appear at least since the Pliocene, marking a key period for the Caviidae, are analyzed. Based on a phylogenetic perspective with the inclusion of the fossil record, our data support the inclusion of the two species (D. patagonum and D. salinicola) in a single genus.

AB  - PCV-3 and PCV-4 are novel viruses that can infect domestic pigs and wild boars. Both viruses are associated with multiple disorders in domestic pigs (reproductive failure, respiratory damage, etc.). However, the clinical impact on wild boars remains unknown. This study aimed to assess the presence of these viruses in wild boars from mid-western Spain and their sanitary impact on the species. A total of 166 submandibular lymph nodes were collected from hunted wild boars, along with available information about their reproductive status, lung injuries, body condition, and tuberculosis status. The samples were used to detect PCV-3 and PCV-4 using real-time PCR. In total, 84.9% of the sampled animals were positive for PCV-3, and 33.7% were positive for PCV-4. The detection of PCV-4 was more frequent in wild boars that had received supplementary feeding, suggesting that the direct contact favored by this practice could increase the transmission of this virus in wild boar populations. The infections did not seem to influence the body condition, reproductive status, lung lesions, or TB lesion severity patterns in the studied animals. Thus, although these viruses have been widely detected throughout wild boar populations from the studied area, they do not seem to be a health threat to this species. Nevertheless, their monitoring in wild boars is recommended, as they are often in contact with extensively reared pigs, which are susceptible to these viruses.

AB  - The ARG profiles in pet feces, such as cat and dog feces, and their potential threat to environmental safety are still unclear. In this study, ARGs in 45 cat and 28 dog fecal samples were detected, and a diffusion experiment was performed to assess the risk of ARGs diffusion into the air. The results showed that the abundances of ARGs in cat feces and dog feces were high, and the abundance in dog feces (0.89 +/- 0.17 copies/bacterial cell) was significantly higher than that in cat feces (0.46 +/- 0.09 copies/bacterial cell) (P < 0.05). The bacterial community, especially Firmicutes and Desulfobacterota in cat feces, and Proteobacteria in dog feces, was the main factor affecting the variation in the ARG profiles, contributing to 31.6% and 32.4% of the variation in cat feces and dog feces, respectively. Physicochemical factors (especially NH4+ -N) and age also indirectly affected the variation in the ARG profiles by affecting the bacterial community. In addition, the ARGs in cat feces and dog feces diffused into the air, but there was no evidence that this diffusion posed a threat to environmental safety and human health. These results can provide reference data for healthy animal breeding and the prevention and control of ARG pollution.

AB  - Elevated concentrations of atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2), a consequence of anthropogenic global change, may profoundly interfere with natural ecological processes, perhaps even interactions across trophic levels. Even the survival prospects of organisms at higher trophic levels could be affected, as follows. We showed previously that the endoparasitoid Diaeretiella rapae, a specialized parasitoid of the cabbage aphid Brevicoryne brassicae, exposed to elevated CO2 concentrations (800 ppm) for up to 10 weeks, performed far worse (e.g., lower survival and parasitism rates) compared with ambient CO2 (400 ppm). To investigate whether these CO2-related effects in the parasitoids were mediated by changes in the quality of the aphids as hosts, we measured the nutritional and energy content of cabbage aphids under the above conditions. Specifically, we measured lipid, protein and water-soluble carbohydrate concentrations. We tested the hypothesis that when insects feed from plants with altered nutritional content, they incur a cost in dealing with such biotic stresses. That cost reduces their metabolic well-being and, thus, reduces their nutritional status with respect to parasitoids developing at their expense. We found that CO2 had significant effects on aphid body mass (i.e., wet weight) and chemical composition, with elevated CO2 concentrations reducing aphid mass by more than 50%. Aphids grown under elevated CO2 also had significantly reduced soluble carbohydrates but significantly more lipids, on a weight-per-weight basis, than aphids grown under ambient CO2. A significant decrease in total energy reserves (i.e., the sum of total proteins, lipids, and water-soluble carbohydrates) thus typified aphids grown under elevated CO2. Our results contribute to explaining the impaired performance of the aphid B. brassicae and its parasitoid D. rapae previously reported under elevated CO2, and provide evidence that under future climate change, host plants might affect the development and performance of parasitoids through their impacts on the nutritional quality of their herbivorous hosts.

AB  - Simple Summary This work investigated lameness on sheep and goat farms in Greece in an extensive study throughout the country. The prevalence of lameness was found to be low, specifically 1.9% among sheep farms and 2.6% among goat farms. Application of vaccination against foot-rot, increased precipitation at farm locations and longer annual grazing periods for sheep and increased precipitation at farm locations for goats emerged as significant predictors for the prevalence of lameness among the farms in the study. Antibiotic administration (mainly lincomycin or oxytetracycline) was the preferred method for treatment of the disorder. Lameness was considered to be an important health problem by 5.6% of farmers, whilst mastitis was ranked first, which reflects the dairy production type prevailing in small ruminant farms in Greece.Abstract The present study refers to an extensive investigation of lameness performed countrywide in Greece, on 325 sheep and 119 goat farms. The specific objectives of this work were to present data on the occurrence of lameness on sheep and goat farms and to identify variables (including variables related to climatic factors) associated with the disorder on the farms. Farms were visited and animals on the farm were assessed for the presence of lameness; further, an interview was carried out with the farmer to obtain information regarding practices applied on the farm. Climatic variables at the location of each farm were derived from NASA research. The within farm prevalence rate varied from 0.0% to 25.0% in sheep flocks and from 0.0% to 30.0% in goat herds. The mean +/- standard error (median (interquartile range)) within farm prevalence rate among sheep farms was 1.9% +/- 0.2 (0.0% (0.0%)); among goat farms, it was 2.6% +/- 0.5% (0.0% (0.0%)). Multivariable analysis for within farm prevalence of lameness revealed three significant predictors in sheep farms: application of vaccination against foot-rot, increased precipitation at the farm location and longer annual grazing period for sheep, and one in goat farms: increased precipitation at the farm location. Treatment of lameness involved mostly administration of antibiotics (on 104 farms); the antibiotics administered most often were lincomycin (on 69 farms) and oxytetracycline (on 33 farms). There was a tendency for higher median within farm prevalence of lameness among farms where no antibiotic administration was practiced. Finally, 6.2% of sheep farmers and 4.2% of goat farmers considered lameness as an important health problem for the animals, specifically the third and fifth most important problem on the respective farms.

AB  - Termites play a vital role in litter decomposition, yet a comprehensive global-scale quantitative analysis of their effects and key drivers still needs to be developed. Here, we conducted a meta-analysis using 187 observations to evaluate the impacts and drivers of termite influence on litter decomposition. Our findings revealed that termites enhanced litter decomposition by an average of 41.2% globally, with mean annual precipitation (MAP) being the primary factor driving termite effects. Moreover, termites exert a more substantial influence on woody litter decomposition compared to foliar litter, whereas they play a more influential role in forests than in grasslands, showing a more significant impact on litter placed on the soil surface than underground. Additionally, MAP acts as the sole dominant driver of decomposition in woody litter, while both MAP and mean annual temperature (MAT) are the key factors affecting the termite-drived litter decomposition in the forest. MAP, MAT and elevation were also detected as the dominant factors in regulating the degradation of plant debris when litter is placed on the soil surface or using meshbag to exclude termites. Our results indicated that termites could significantly contribute to litter decomposition, and MAP mainly derives these material recycling processes globally and regionally.

AB  - Coral reefs are in global decline primarily due to climate change. Herbivory is often viewed as key to maintaining coral-dominated reefs, and herbivore management is gaining traction as a possible strategy for promoting reef resilience. The functional impact of herbivorous fishes has typically been inferred from total biomass, but robust estimates of ecological processes are needed to better inform management targets. Here, we provide a framework to calculate rates of herbivory across Pacific reefs. We synthesized available observations of foraging metrics in relation to fish body size and found considerable variation, even among closely related species. We then applied these allometric functions to survey data and calculated rates of herbivory for acanthurids and scarines, which make up the vast majority of herbivorous fish biomass in the Pacific. Estimated rates of algal consumption, area scraped, and bioerosion varied across islands, with noticeable differences that may align with the relative influence of human population density among underlying herbivore functional groups. We found no evidence of compensatory relationships among herbivore processes whereby decreasing rates in one type of herbivory is offset by increasing rates in another. We observed nonlinear, positive relationships between fish biomass and rates of herbivory. Yet, for a given biomass, the corresponding rates of herbivory varied among regions, and we observed instances where islands with the greatest biomass did not also have the highest rates of herbivory. Islands with the largest size classes of herbivores did not consistently exhibit greater rates of herbivory, and we did not find a clear, consistent pattern between the number of fish species and corresponding rates of herbivore processes. Cropping Acanthurus spp. provided the greatest proportion of algal consumption at every island, yet no single species accounted for the majority of this process, whereas we identified parrotfish species that provided >75% of scraping or bioerosion at certain islands. Our results emphasize the importance of considering the species and size composition of herbivore assemblages when estimating processes, rather than relying on total biomass alone. Lastly, we highlight gaps in foraging observations and additional work needed to further broaden our ability to quantify the ecological processes of herbivores.

AB  - Simple Summary Inbred strains of guinea pigs are a vital resource in the study of human disease and infection. However, maintenance of these colonies can be challenging due to lower reproductive fitness than outbred lines, and other strain-specific clinical considerations. Here, we report on the reproductive characteristics of strain 13/N guinea pigs, and investigate whether the choice of breeding parameters, including parental age, parity, and pairing approaches, can increase reproductive success in colonies. Guinea pigs are important animal models for human disease, and both outbred and inbred lines are utilized in biomedical research. The optimal maintenance of guinea pig colonies, commercially and in research settings, relies on robust informed breeding programs, however, breeding data on specialized inbred strains are limited. Here, we investigated the effects of parental age, parity, and pairing approaches on mean total fetus count, percentage of female pups in the litter, and pup survival rate after 10 days in strain 13/N guinea pigs. Our analysis of colony breeding data indicates that the average litter size is 3.3 pups, with a 25.2% stillbirth rate, a failure-to-thrive outcome in 5.1% of pups, and a 10 day survival rate of 69.7%. The only variable to significantly affect the reproductive outcomes examined was parental age (p < 0.05). In comparison to adults, both juvenile and geriatric sows had lower total fetus counts; juvenile boars had a higher percentage of females in litters, and geriatric boars had a lower 10 day survival rate of pups. These studies provide valuable information regarding the reproductive characteristics of strain 13/N guinea pigs, and support a variety of breeding approaches without significant effects on breeding success.

AB  - The population size of capercaille Tetrao urogallus in Scotland was estimated from annual counts of males at 151 known spring lek sites and 45 counts of males, females and their broods in August during the period 2010-2020, combined with published survival estimates. Population size declined from an estimated 580 birds (95% CL: 462-698) in 2011 to 304 (239-369) in 2020 and the extinction probability was 23% after 25 years, 95% after 50 years and 100% after 100 years. Removing mortality associated with collisions against fences lowered extinction probabilities to 0, 3 and 40% respectively, emphasizing fence removal as a management priority. Greatest declines occurred in Deeside and Donside, Morayshire and Ross-shire and Perthshire and Trossachs. In the Badenoch and Strathspey stronghold, where an estimated 83% of males remain, numbers of occupied leks and lekking males have decreased in the last five years and are associated with reduced breeding success over the last 10 years. Our estimates of population size are only half that derived from the last official national survey in winter 2015/2016. We discuss possible reasons for this difference including underestimates from lek-based surveys linked to male detection probabilities. Finally, we recommend improvements to the current annual monitoring scheme, including repeat counts at leks and use of novel remote acoustic devices and restoration of annual brood counts in remaining key forests.

AB  - Simple Summary Sufficient fat cover is necessary for an optimum dry-curing process of Teruel dry-cured hams. However, in recent years, gilts intended for this type of hams are characterized by lack of fat deposition, since male pigs are surgically castrated, to miss boar taint, and castration increases fatness. Thus, immunocastration or the increase of energy in the diet or the decrease of dietary crude protein and amino acids could solve this problem. On the other hand, the surgical castration of male pigs could be banned in the near future in the European Union. Hence, immunocastration could be a solution, as well. However, immunocastrated males seems to present lower fatness than surgically castrated males. Thus, it would be interesting to study feeding plans that increase fatness. Therefore, two experiments were conducted, one with females and another with males, to evaluate the effect of immunocastration and diet on meat and fat quality. In conclusion, immunocastration is a good practice in gilts, as it improves meat quality and technological fat quality. However, in the case of males, this strategy deteriorates meat quality when compared with surgical castration, and it should be accompanied with a high-energy diet or a low-crude-protein diet to guarantee an adequate fat consistency. Two experiments were carried out; one with female pigs and the other with male pigs destined for Teruel dry-cured ham production, to evaluate the effect of immunocastration (entire gilts-EG vs. immunocastrated gilts-IG and surgically castrated males vs. immunocastrated males-IM) and diet (control vs. high energy vs. low crude protein and amino acids) on meat quality and fat composition. Fifteen meat samples and eight fat samples of each treatment were analyzed in both experiments. In the case of males, six fat samples per treatment were analyzed to determine boar taint. Immunocastration is a good strategy in gilts intended for dry-cured ham production because improves meat composition; however, in males, immunocastration impairs the results of pork chemical composition compared with surgical castration. The IG presented a lower polyunsaturated/saturated fatty acids ratio than EG, improving fat technological quality. Diets had little effect on pork or fat quality in gilts, but a high-energy level using oilseeds and a low-crude-protein and -amino-acids diet from 80 to 137 kg of body weight could be interesting in IM to maintain or increase fat consistency, respectively. Moreover, in general, immunocastration is effective in avoiding boar taint in males.

AB  - The environment is considered a major reservoir of antimicrobial resistant microorganisms (AMR) and antimicrobial resistance genes (ARG). Colistin, a "last resort" antibiotic, is used for the treatment of severe infections caused by multidrug-resistant Gram-negative bacteria. The global dissemination of mobile colistin resistance genes (mcr) in natural and non-natural environments is a major setback in the fight against antimicrobial resistance. Hitherto, there is a limited number of studies screening this resistance determinant in bacteria from wildlife. In this study, we describe for the first time the detection of plasmid-mediated colistin resistance in Escherichia coli from wild ungulates in Portugal, which are also widely distributed across Europe. This information is critical to identify the importance of ungulates in the dissemination of resistant bacteria, and their corresponding genes, across the environment. Here, 151 resistant-Enterobacteriaceae isolated from 181 samples collected from different wild ungulate species throughout Portugal were screened for mcr genes. Four mcr-1- positive Escherichia coli were detected from four fallow deer individuals that were sampled in the same hunting ground. These four isolates harboured mcr-1-related IncP plasmids belonging to sequencing types ST155, ST533 and ST345 (n = 2), suggesting bacterial and/or plasmid circulation. All mcr-1-positive E. coli also showed other resistance phenotypes, including MDR, including the B1 commensal phylogenetic profile. All mcr-1-positive E. coli show additional resistance phenotypes, including MDR, including the B1 commensal phylogenetic profile. Our findings are upsetting, highlighting the global dissemination of colistin resistance genes in the whole ecosystem, which, under the One Health framework, emphasizes the urgent need for effective implementation of AMR surveillance and control in the human-animal-environment interfaces.

AB  - Boar sperm is a highly sensitive biological product, and its quality is susceptible to various environmental factors during transportation. Presently, vibration emissions were observed and documented during the transportation of artificial insemination doses. Vibrations, serving as an environmental stressor, harbor the potential to exert an influence on sperm quality. However, the precise mechanism underlying the detrimental effects of vibration emissions on sperm functionality remains elusive. In the present research, we discerned that vibration emissions impair the quality of boar sperm by modulating their metabolic processes, ultimately resulting in a diminished fertilization capability. Artificial insemination (AI) with liquid-preserved semen has recently become common in pig breeding. The semen doses are produced in a centralized manner at the boar stud and then subsequently distributed and transported to sow farms. However, vibration emissions during transportation by logistic vehicles may adversely affect the quality of boar sperm. Therefore, this study aimed to explore the impact of vibration-induced emissions on sperm quality and function under simulated transportation conditions. Each time, ejaculates from all 15 boars were collected and then pooled together to minimize individual variations, and the sample was split using an extender for dilution. Different rotational speeds (0 rpm, 80 rpm, 140 rpm, 200 rpm) were utilized to simulate varying intensities of vibration exposure using an orbital shaker, considering different transportation times (0 h, 3 h, and 6 h). Subsequently, evaluations were conducted regarding sperm motility, plasma membrane integrity, acrosome integrity, mitochondrial function, adenosine triphosphate (ATP) levels, mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels, pH, glycolytic pathway enzyme activities, and capacitation following exposure to vibration emissions. Both vibration time and intensity impact sperm motility, plasma membrane integrity, and acrosomal integrity. Vibration exposure significantly reduced sperm ATP levels, mitochondrial membrane potential, and the levels of mitochondria-encoded proteins (MT-ND1, MT-ND6) (p < 0.05). After vibration emission treatment, the pH value and mitochondrial ROS levels significantly increased (p < 0.05). Inhibition of sperm glycolysis was observed, with reduced activities of hexokinase (HK), pyruvate kinase (PK), and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), along with decreased lactate levels (p < 0.05). Additionally, sperm tyrosine phosphorylation levels were significantly reduced by vibration emissions compared to the control group (p < 0.05). After the vibration emission treatment, the number of sperm bound to each square millimeter of oviduct explants decreased significantly compared to the control group (p < 0.05). Similarly, compared to the control group, using semen subjected to vibration stress for AI results in significantly reduced pregnancy rates, total born litter size, live-born litter size, and healthy born litter size (p < 0.05).

AB  - Klasies River main site (KRM) is a prominent Middle Stone Age (MSA) site located on the southern Cape coast in the Eastern Cape province of South Africa. This contribution discusses the animal remains from the DC member in Cave 1B not reported on before. These animals fall within MSA II (Mossel Bay) techno-complex that, at KRM, dates from before 110 to 78ka. Despite heavy fragmentation, the fauna from this period shows a variety of taxa, including mammals, birds, reptiles, amphibians, fish and molluscs. The most common taxa in the sample include indeterminate medium and small mammals, tortoises, indeterminate small birds, Cape fur seals, and indeterminate Bovid I and II's. The presence of several stacked hearths, shellfish, lithics and burnt and butchered bones all suggest that humans were the main agent of accumulation of the fauna. This is further supported by low values for the carnivore-ungulate ratio, the carnivore richness-and the leopard index, which measures the probabilities of brown hyena, leopard and human accumulations. However, the presence of chew marks presumably caused by carnivores suggests brown hyenas or leopards accumulated, or had access to some fauna. Assuming that humans accumulated most fauna, there is evidence of a summer occupation at KRM during the MSA II. People were exploiting a variety of environments during the MSA II, including coastal dunes, grasslands, savanna woodlands and closed, bush environments. During the MSA II at KRM, people focused on hunting ungulates.

AB  - Accurate monitoring of wildlife diets and nutrient requirements is needed for effective biodiversity conservation. This also rings true for the world's tallest ruminant, the giraffe (Giraffa camelopardalis). The complexity of its anatomy is also reflected in its intricate ruminant, digestive properties. Being selective browsers, giraffes have evolved unique ways to effectively maximise the absorption of dietary nutrients and thereby maintain their critical energy balance. Using non-invasive faecal collections, the current study analysed 10 chemical parameters (dry matter, organic matter, ash, crude protein [CPf], crude fat, gross energy, neutral-detergent fibre, acid-detergent fibre [ADFfOM], acid-detergent lignin [ADLfOM], and phosphorous) by chemical analyses, commonly used in domestic livestock health and nutrition monitoring. Fresh giraffe faecal samples were collected from six different locations, with different feeding practices, across different seasons from 2021 to 2023 in the Free State Province, South Africa. Results indicate that % CPf, % ADFfOM, and % ADLfOM may successfully and significantly differentiate between different feeding practices and between seasons from faeces collected from giraffe populations in the Free State Province and could be used conjunctive with each other to determine diet quality and nutrient value.

AB  - The production of high-quality tea by Camellia sinensis (L.) O. Ktze is the goal pursued by both producers and consumers. Rapid, nondestructive, and low-cost monitoring methods for monitoring tea quality could improve the tea quality and the economic benefits associated with tea. This research explored the possibility of monitoring tea leaf quality from multi-spectral images. Threshold segmentation and manual sampling methods were used to eliminate the image background, after which the spectral features were constructed. Based on this, the texture features of the multi-spectral images of the tea canopy were extracted. Three machine learning methods, partial least squares regression, support vector machine regression, and random forest regression (RFR), were used to construct and train multiple monitoring models. Further, the four key quality parameters of tea polyphenols, total sugars, free amino acids, and caffeine content were estimated using these models. Finally, the effects of automatic and manual image background removal methods, different regression methods, and texture features on the model accuracies were compared. The results showed that the spectral characteristics of the canopy of fresh tea leaves were significantly correlated with the tea quality parameters (r >= 0.462). Among the sampling methods, the EXG_Ostu sampling method was best for prediction, whereas, among the models, RFR was the best fitted modeling algorithm for three of four quality parameters. The R-2 and root-mean-square error values of the built model were 0.85 and 0.16, respectively. In addition, the texture features extracted from the canopy image improved the prediction accuracy of most models. This research confirms the modeling application of a combination of multi-spectral images and chemometrics, as a low-cost, fast, reliable, and nondestructive quality control method, which can effectively monitor the quality of fresh tea leaves. This provides a scientific reference for the research and development of portable tea quality monitoring equipment that has general applicability in the future.

AB  - Marine food webs are structured through a combination of top-down and bottom-up processes. In coral reef ecosystems, fish size is related to life-history characteristics and size-based indicators can represent the distribution and flow of energy through the food web. Thus, size spectra can be a useful tool for investigating the impacts of both fishing and habitat condition on the health and productivity of coral reef fisheries. In addition, coral reef fisheries are often data-limited and size spectra analysis can be a relatively cost-effective and simple method for assessing fish populations. Abundance size spectra are widely used and quantify the relationship between organism size and relative abundance. Previous studies that have investigated the impacts of fishing and habitat condition together on the size distribution of coral reef fishes, however, have aggregated all fishes regardless of taxonomic identity. This leads to a poor understanding of how fishes with different feeding strategies, body size-abundance relationships, or catchability might be influenced by top-down and bottom-up drivers. To address this gap, we quantified size spectra slopes of carnivorous and herbivorous coral reef fishes across three regions of Indonesia representing a gradient in fishing pressure and habitat conditions. We show that fishing pressure was the dominant driver of size spectra slopes such that they became steeper as fishing pressure increased, which was due to the removal of large-bodied fishes. When considering fish functional groups separately, however, carnivore size spectra slopes were more heavily impacted by fishing than herbivores. Also, structural complexity, which can mediate predator-prey interactions and provisioning of resources, was a relatively important driver of herbivore size spectra slopes such that slopes were shallower in more complex habitats. Our results show that size spectra slopes can be used as indicators of fishing pressure on coral reef fishes, but aggregating fish regardless of trophic identity or functional role overlooks differential impacts of fishing pressure and habitat condition on carnivore and herbivore size distributions.

AB  - Simple Summary African swine fever (ASF) is one of the most important animal diseases affecting the domestic swine population globally. Whole-genome sequence analysis on the circulating African swine fever virus (ASFV) strains would provide valuable information in tracking the outbreaks of the disease. The aim of this study was to prepare a curated dataset of ASFV genome sequences and investigate genome-wide diversity of circulating ASFV strains. We prepared a curated dataset containing 123 high-quality ASFV genome sequences representing 10 genotypes collected from 28 countries between 1949 and 2020. Phylogenetic analysis based on whole-genome sequences provided high-resolution topology in genotyping ASFV isolates, which was supported by pairwise genome sequence similarity comparison. Wide distribution and high variation of tandem repeat sequences were found in ASFV genomes. Structural variation and highly variable poly G or poly C tracts were also identified. This study improved our understanding on the patterns of genetic variation of ASFV and facilitated future studies on ASFV molecular epidemiology. African swine fever (ASF) is a lethal contagious viral disease of domestic pigs and wild boars caused by the African swine fever virus (ASFV). The pandemic spread of ASF has had serious effects on the global pig industry. Virus genome sequencing and comparison play an important role in tracking the outbreaks of the disease and tracing the transmission of the virus. Although more than 140 ASFV genome sequences have been deposited in the public databases, the genome-wide diversity of ASFV remains unclear. Here we prepared a curated dataset of ASFV genome sequences by filtering genomes with sequencing errors as well as duplicated genomes. A total of 123 ASFV genome sequences were included in the dataset, representing 10 genotypes collected between 1949 and 2020. Phylogenetic analysis based on whole-genome sequences provided high-resolution topology in differentiating closely related ASFV isolates, and drew new clues in the classification of some ASFV isolates. Genome-wide diversity of ASFV genomes was explored by pairwise sequence similarity comparison and ORF distribution comparison. Tandem repeat sequences were found widely distributed and highly varied in ASFV genomes. Structural variation and highly variable poly G or poly C tracts also contributed to the genome diversity. This study expanded our knowledge on the patterns of genetic diversity and evolution of ASFV, and provided valuable information for diagnosis improvement and vaccine development.

AB  - Simple Summary: Our results revealed that the total gas production, CH4 production, and dry matter digestibility reduced significantly as 3NPA doses increased in both yak and cattle. In addition, the H-2 accumulation increased significantly in the tubes cultured with 3NPA compared to the control in both yak and cattle. The dynamic profile of total volatile fatty acid (TVFA) production, acetate concentration, and propionate concentration in both yak and cattle at 12 and 24 h incubation was consistent, in which they decreased as 3NPA doses increased, while those for 48 and 72 h incubation were divergent between them. These data demonstrated that the effects of 3NPA on fermentation characteristics between yak and cattle were divergent, and these effects were dose-dependent, and 3NPA regarded as a potential additive to mitigate methane production; although, it inhibits the dry matter digestibility in vitro, which is beneficial to determine the effective and safe dose for use to improve animal productivity in vivo. 3-nitropropionic acid (3NPA) has been proposed as an useful modifier to mitigate ruminal enteric methane emissions. However, few studies investigated the effects of 3NPA on ruminal fermentation characteristics of grazing ruminants in vitro. Rumen fluid from grazing yak and cattle were collected and incubated with additions of 0, 8, and 16 mM 3NPA. The total gas production, CH4 production, and dry matter digestibility significantly decreased with increasing 3NPA doses in both ruminant species (p < 0.05) and methane production decreased to almost 100% in cattle at 8 mM NPA but not yak, while H-2 accumulation showed an opposite trend. The total fatty acid (TVFA) production, acetate concentration, and propionate concentration in cattle decreased as 3NPA doses increased at 12 and 24 h incubation. For yak, the H-2 accumulation reached its apex at 8 mM NPA (p < 0.05). The TVFA in yak decreased significantly with increasing 3NPA doses at 12 and 72 h incubation. Moreover, the acetate concentration and propionate concentration in yak decreased as 3NPA doses increased at 12 and 24 h incubation. Overall, these findings demonstrated that 3NPA could be used as a strategy to mitigate methane emissions; although, it negatively affected the dry matter degradability in vitro.

AB  - Consumers mediate nutrient cycling through excretion and egestion across most ecosystems. In nutrient-poor tropical waters such as coral reefs, nutrient cycling is critical for maintaining productivity. While the cycling of fish-derived inorganic nutrients via excretion has been extensively investigated, the role of egestion for nutrient cycling has remained poorly explored. We sampled the fecal contents of 570 individual fishes across 40 species, representing six dominant trophic guilds of coral reef fishes in Moorea, French Polynesia. We measured fecal macro- (proteins, carbohydrates, lipids) and micro- (calcium, copper, iron, magnesium, manganese, zinc) nutrients and compared the fecal nutrient quantity and quality across trophic guilds, taxa, and body size. Macro- and micronutrient concentrations in fish feces varied markedly across species. Genera and trophic guild best predicted fecal nutrient concentrations. In addition, nutrient composition in feces was unique among species within both trophic guilds (herbivores and corallivores) and genera (Acanthurus and Chaetodon). Particularly, certain coral reef fishes (e.g., Thalassoma hardwicke, Chromis xanthura, Chaetodon pelewensis and Acanthurus pyroferus) harbored relatively high concentrations of micronutrients (e.g., Mn, Mg, Zn and Fe, respectively) that are known to contribute to ocean productivity and positively impact coral physiological performances. Given the nutrient-rich profiles across reef fish feces, conserving holistic reef fish communities ensures the availability of nutritional pools on coral reefs. We therefore suggest that better integration of consumer egestion dynamics into food web models and ecosystem-scale processes will facilitate an improved understanding of coral reef functioning.

AB  - Cavies are one of the most-specialized grinding rodents, with folivorous and grass-based diets. Antecedents on head myology are focused mainly on domestic guinea pig. Here, we analyze three specimens of wild caviines (two of Cavia aperea and one of Galea leucoblephara), describing, illustrating, mapping, and weighing facial and masticatory muscles. Overall, facial musculature in caviines is simpler, and some muscles are smaller than other rodents. This could be linked to lower demands on precise oronasal movements and lesser snout sensitivity during searching and prehension of food. Conversely, mm. malaris and buccinator are enlarged, suggesting intense processing of the bolus during chewing. Cavies, particularly the grass-eater Cavia, have highly modified osteo-myological masticatory apparatuses. The length and horizontalization of mm. masseter superficialis, profundus, and pterygoideus medialis are exacerbated. The latter two muscles are more developed than in other caviomorphs and most non-caviomorph rodents, enhancing horizontal grinding. Although framed in a rodent plan, functional characterization of facial and masticatory muscles partially resembles that of ungulates (especially grazers) rather than other derived rodent morphotypes. Implications and variations of hystricomorphy and hystricognathy for caviines and other ctenohystricans are discussed. Caviines are hystricomorphous rodents with a particularly short m. zygomaticomandibularis and a small infraorbital part, which would limit gape and ensure homogeneous occlusal pressures. The m. masseter superficialis configuration, with a long origin tendon and the extended fleshy bundles that wrap the mandible posteriorly, is here recognized as a key factor for understanding hystricognathy and propalinal grinding. Myology of cavies allows arguing that the "cavioid type" is a modification but not a reversion of hystricognathy.

AB  - Though aerobic composting is commonly used in kitchen waste (KW) disposal, the high-oil and high-salt characteris-tics of KW could affect composting efficiency and lead to the land using risk of produced fertilizer. The impact of hy-drothermal pretreatment (HTP) and addition of compound microbial agent (CMA) on compost maturity, greenhouse gas (GHGs) emissions and bacterial community during the kitchen waste composting were evaluated in the present work. Results indicated that N2O, CH(4 )and CO2 emissions from treatment by HTP and CMA addition were reduced by 82.72%, 13.77% and 20.78%, respectively, comparing with the control (without HTP and without CMA addition). The seed germination index (GI) value of the HTP and CMA addition treatment was 1.03 and had the highest maturity in all treatments. Furthermore, the bacterial community analysis indicated that CMA inoculation could increase the relative abundance of genus Bacillus at the thermophilic stage of composting to accelerate organic biodegradation. This work provided important insight into mitigating GHGs emissions and improving compost quality in kitchen waste composting.

AB  - Habitat use data are key to understanding species ecology and extinction risk. However, such information is lacking for the elusive deer species of Neotropical region. In this context, fecal sampling has emerged as an alternative tool, in which development and evaluation are essential to obtaining unbiased ecological data. We aimed to compare data from GPS-tracked animals and fecal sampling using scat detection dogs to evaluate the noninvasive performance of this method in habitat selection analysis. We carried out the study in the Brazilian Pantanal, where we monitored six free-living Gray Brocket Deer (Mazama gouazoubira) with GPS collars for 1 year (average of 584 GPS locations/animal) and collected fecal samples (n = 649) simultaneously along a set of transects designed for a scat detection dog survey. We evaluated habitat selection using the chi-square test in an availability/utilization analysis and submitted both data to a bootstrap procedure to assess its precision and accuracy with increasing sample size. GPS data indicated habitat selection at a fine utilization scale, in which savanna and cerrado were preferred and open grassland habitat was avoided. Exclusive fecal sampling also indicated habitat selection, revealing the preference for cerrado and avoidance of open grassland. The GPS and fecal habitat utilization estimates did not differ significantly and fecal sampling increased precision and accuracy with increased sample size, reaching minimal values once n = 200 which should be considered a sufficient survey effort. The similarity between the two methods suggested the reliability of fecal sampling, as long as a standardized sampling design is used. This noninvasive sampling framework can provide previously unavailable ecological data for threatened Neotropical deer as well as other elusive species.

AB  - Hunting tourism can have significant positive economic effects on the local community. The objective of the paper is to estimate the direct economic impact of roe deer hunting tourism, with a focus on regional level, by applying the Nordic Model. Analysis was based on data gathered in the autumn of 2021, from the interviews with hunting ground managers and hunting tourism outfitters, and a literature review. The length of stay of tourist hunters ranged from 2 to 6 days. According to the interviews and statistical data, one hunting tourist spent an average of 2,121 is an element of per hunting day in Serbia. In 2019 the direct economic income of roe deer hunting tourism in Vojvodina was 623,574 is an element of. The regional economic impact of hunting tourism in Vojvodina is significant given the small number of tourists from whom substantial income is generated. Developing of hunting activates on one or more game species could bring significant economic benefits to these kind of local communities. Resources raised through hunting tourism are later used in these regions through direct investment and as a tool for sustainable wildlife management, and thus, the ecological and economic sustainability of hunting tourism is crucial and must be considered in future development process.

AB  - Blister blight (BB) disease is caused by the obligate biotrophic fungal pathogen Exobasidium vexans Massee and seriously affects the yield and quality of Camellia sinensis. The use of chemical pesticides on tea leaves substantially increases the toxic risks of tea consumption. Botanic fungicide isobavachalcone (IBC) has the potential to control fungal diseases on many crops but has not been used on tea plants. In this study, the field control effects of IBC were evaluated by comparison and in combination with natural elicitor chitosan oligosaccharides (COSs) and the chemical pesticide pyraclostrobin (Py), and the preliminary action mode of IBC was also investigated. The bioassay results for IBC or its combination with COSs showed a remarkable control effect against BB (61.72% and 70.46%). IBC, like COSs, could improve the disease resistance of tea plants by enhancing the activity of tea-plant-related defense enzymes, including polyphenol oxidase (PPO), catalase (CAT), phenylalanine aminolase (PAL), peroxidase (POD), superoxide dismutase (SOD), & beta;-1,3-glucanase (Glu), and chitinase enzymes. The fungal community structure and diversity of the diseased tea leaves were examined using Illumina MiSeq sequencing of the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region of the ribosomal rDNA genes. It was obvious that IBC could significantly alter the species' richness and the diversity of the fungal community in affected plant sites. This study broadens the application range of IBC and provides an important strategy for the control of BB disease.

AB  - Aesculus hippocastanum trees are commonly infested by the leaf miner Cameraria ohridella, whose larval activity causes the destruction of the leaf parenchyma and induces defoliation. Pest attacks result in, e.g., production of smaller fruits and tree re-flowering in autumn. Concerning pest influence on stem structure only scarce information of narrower annual growth rings of wood has been published. Therefore, we determined the effect of the presence of the leaf miner infestation on intra-annual cambial activity and on differentiation of conductive tissues. These data were compared with phenological phases and pest activity. Pest feeding resulted in changes in onset, cessation and duration of cambial divisions, and differentiation of secondary xylem. The duration of cambial activity was about a month shorter in heavily infested trees and was connected with premature tree defoliation. Affected trees were characterised by a reduction in cambial divisions and earlier cessation of wood differentiation resulting in narrower wood rings. Furthermore, the infested trees exhibited altered wood structure, with more vessels of smaller diameters, however these changes did not affect its theoretical hydraulic conductivity. Interestingly, pest attack did not influence secondary phloem differentiation. The probable influence of long-term infestation on tree growth and condition was discussed.

AB  - Milk from yaks, also called "liquid gold", is reputed to be very healthy for people, but the yield is relatively low. The intake of energy and amino acids, especially lysine and methionine, of grazing, lactating yaks are often below requirements and this could explain, at least in part, the low milk yield. We hypothesized that grazing, lactating yaks, supplemented with energy and/or amino acids, would improve their performance and the average daily gain (ADG) of their calves. Twenty-four multiparous yaks (218 +/- 5.3 kg), blocked by bodyweight, were offered one of four dietary treatments (n = 6 yaks per treatments) as: 1) no supplement (CON); 2) 15.0 g/d rumen-protected lysine plus 5.0 g/d rumen-protected methionine (SA); 3) 1.20 kg/d concentrate (SC); and 4) both SA and SC (SAC). The ADG was greater (P < 0.001) in yaks with than without supplementary concentrate, whereas the greatest ADG for calves was in the SAC group (interaction, P = 0.034). The concentration of ruminal total volatile fatty acids (VFAs) and of butyrate increased (P < 0.01) in yaks with supplementary concentrate, whereas iso-VFAs increased (P < 0.01) in yaks with supplementary rumen-protected lysine plus methionine (RPLM). The relative abundances of the ruminal bacteria Prevotella brevis and Ruminococcus albus increased (P < 0.01) in yaks with supplementary concentrate or RPLM, with the greatest abundance (interaction, P < 0.05) in the SAC group. Milk yield from hand-milking, and the concentrations of fat, protein, total solids and urea were not affected by dietary supplements, but lactose concentration increased (P = 0.021) with concentrate supplementation, whereas somatic cell count decreased (P < 0.01) when yaks received either supplementary concentrate or RPLM. Milk lysine and methionine, as proportions of total amino acids (TAAs), and concentration of TAAs increased with supplementary concen-trate or RPLM. The milk concentrations of C16:1, C18:2n-6c and C18:3n-6 increased (P < 0.05) in yaks supplemented with concentrate, whereas, the concentrations of saturated, monounsaturated, and polyunsaturated fatty acids were not affected (P > 0.05) by treatments. These results indi-cated that the ADG of calves improved, whereas the rumen fermentation capacity of the lactating yaks was enhanced with supplementary concentrate and RPLM. It was concluded that dietary supplements could be an effective management option to improve performance in grazing, lactating yaks and the ADG of their calves raised on the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau.

AB  - In support of the prediction of the enemy release hypothesis regarding a growth-defense trade-off, invasive alien plants often exhibit greater growth and lower anti-herbivory defenses than native plants. However, it remains unclear how nutrient enrichment of invaded habitats may influence competitive interactions between invasive alien and co-occurring native plants, as well as production of anti-herbivore defense compounds, growth-promoting hormones, and defense-regulating hormones by the two groups of plants. Here, we tested whether: (i) nutrient enrichment causes invasive alien plants to produce greater biomass and lower concentrations of the defense compounds flavonoids and tannins than native plants; and (ii) invasive alien plants produce lower concentrations of a defense-regulating hormone jasmonic acid (JA) and higher concentrations of a growth-promoting hormone gibberellic acid (GA3). In a greenhouse experiment, we grew five congeneric pairs of invasive alien and native plant species under two levels each of nutrient enrichment (low vs. high), simulated herbivory (leaf clipping vs. no-clipping), and competition (alone vs. competition) in 2.5-L pots. In the absence of competition, high-nutrient treatment induced a greater increase in total biomass of invasive alien species than that of native species, whereas the reverse was true under competition as native species benefitted more from nutrient enrichment than invasive alien species. Moreover, high-nutrient treatment caused a greater increase in total biomass of invasive alien species than that of native species in the presence of simulated herbivory. Competition induced higher production of flavonoids and tannins. Simulated herbivory induced higher flavonoid expression in invasive alien plants under low-nutrient than high-nutrient treatments. However, flavonoid concentrations of native plants did not change under nutrient enrichment and simulated herbivory treatments. Invasive alien plants produced higher concentrations of GA3 than native plants. Taken together, these results suggest that impact of nutrient enrichment on growth of invasive alien and co-occurring native plants may depend on the level of competition that they experience. Moreover, invasive alien plants might adjust their flavonoid-based defense more efficiently than native plants in response to variation in soil nutrient availability and herbivory pressure. Our findings suggest that large-scale efforts to reduce nutrient enrichment of invaded habitats may help to control future invasiveness of target alien plant species.

AB  - Introduction Hippophae rhamnoides, a temperate species with a transcontinental distribution spanning Eurasia, demonstrates preferential establishment in water-limited ecosystems (arid/semi-arid zones), particularly occupying high-elevation niches with skeletal soils and high solar flux. This ecologically significant plant, prized for dual ecological provisioning and economic services, shows biogeographic concentration in China's northern desertification belts, northwestern Loess Plateau, and southwestern montane corridors. Studying the possible areas where H. rhamnoides may be found can offer a scientific foundation for the protection and sustainable management of its resources.Methods This study utilized the biomod2 software to assess an integrated model based on 312 distribution points and 23 environmental factors. Furthermore, a modeling analysis was conducted to examine how the geographical distribution of H. rhamnoides changes over time under the SSP245 scenario.Results The findings show that the distribution of H. rhamnoides is primarily affected by three factors: annual mean temperature, temperature seasonality and mean temperature of the coldest quarter. Currently, H. rhamnoides is predominantly distributed in the provinces of Shanxi, Shaanxi, Gansu, Hebei, Yunnan, Xinjiang, Tibet, Sichuan, Qinghai, and Ningxia. The suitable habitat covers an area of 212.89x10(4) km(2), which represents 22.15% of China's total land area. Within this region, high, medium, and low suitability areas make up 23.15%, 22.66%, and 54.20% of the suitable habitat, respectively.Discussion In the future, the centroid of the suitable habitat for H. rhamnoides is expected to gradually shift northwest, with a trend of increasing suitability in the west and decreasing suitability in the east. This study aims to provide an in-depth exploration of the distribution of H. rhamnoides and the influence of environmental factors on it from a geographical perspective. These results are important for improving the conservation, management, cultivation, and propagation of H. rhamnoides, while also offering a scientific foundation for the research of other valuable plant species.

AB  - Tropical dry forests (TDFs) usually occur as mosaics at different stages of natural regeneration, along which variations in soil attributes (fertility and texture) can affect plant growth and leaf traits and, consequently, leaf herbivory. In the present study, we used a chronosequence approach to determine the variations in plant growth, leaf defense, and insect herbivory in different successional species groups, following the predictions of the resource availability hypothesis: plants at early successional stages would grow faster, have lower specific leaf mass (SLM), and suffer higher herbivore damage than late successional plants. For this purpose, we measured plant diameter and collected leaves at the end of the rainy season (April) during three consecutive years in three different successional stages (early, intermediate, and late). In total, we sampled 38 plant species, from which 31 species were exclusive to a single successional stage (10 early, 13 intermediate, and eight late species). Our results did not conform to the resource availability hypothesis, as plants growing in early successional stages had higher growth rates and SLM, and lower leaf damage by herbivores. Soil fertility and texture did not affect plant growth or SLM, but leaf damage was negatively affected by SLM. Apart from being a defensive trait, SLM is also involved in the conservation of water and nutrients and photoprotection, and its variation along successional gradients in TDFs conforms to a continuum from conservative traits in hot and dry, early successional stages, to acquisitive traits in more humid late stages. Although other plant defenses must be considered, our three-year study indicates that the resource availability hypothesis, which was formulated for wet forests, should be adapted to deciduous TDFs where water availability is the main environmental filter along succession.

AB  - Cluster bean [Cyamopsis tetragonoloba (L.) Taub.] is an important vegetable crop of industrial importance known as gaur, it is a self-pollinating and deep rooting crop, thus it is well adapted to semi-arid and arid rainfall areas. This legume crop is being grown for wider uses like human food, animal feed as well as fodder, and also for industrial uses for galactomannan gum extraction from a commercial perspective. In the crop genetic improvement is being limited, which could be due to insufficient diversity, or lack of exploitation of genetic resources. Therefore, we collected 70 gaur genotypes and were employed to estimate the genetic diversity along with four varieties using simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers. The PIC value ranged from 0.05 to 0.62, with an average of 0.38, while SSR marker amplification with 23 polymorphic primers detected 99 alleles with a mean of 4.30 alleles per SSR marker. Three separate groups emerged from the clustering analysis. Furthermore, twenty-four morphological traits were studied for the analysis of morphological diversity, and the genotypes and varieties were divided into eight subgroups based on standardized morphological data based on Mahalanobis D-2 statistics. Cluster IV had the greatest intracluster distance (D-2 = 7698.63), and clusters IV and VIII had the greatest intercluster distance (D-2 = 195,694.80). Thus, the study revealed that collected genotypes contain a wide range of diversity, and the molecular markers can be utilized in conjunction with morphological characterization for a better description of the level and pattern of genetic diversity, as well as for the cluster bean breeding and improvement programs.

AB  - Marine top predators are expected to adjust their foraging behaviour at multiple time scales concomitantly with changes in forage fish availability. Rhinoceros auklets Cerorhinca monocerata rearing chicks at Teuri Island, Japan Sea, fed on anchovy Engraulis japonicus in 2012 and 2013 (anchovy regime) but switched to sand lance Ammodytes spp in 2019 and 2020 (sand lance regime). Here, we studied their at-sea behaviour using the GPS locations of 33 birds and the depth-acceleration records of 26 birds, and compared their foraging behaviour between these prey regimes. At the trip scale, auklets used offshore waters (> 50 m sea depth) and coastal waters in the anchovy regime but used mainland coastal waters (< 50 m sea depth) in the sand lance regime. In the sand lance regime, the birds also conducted more overnight 2- to 4-day trips in 2020 and spent more time flying during 1-day trips as they fed in further areas compared to the anchovy regime. At the dive scale, auklets frequently dove to both < 5 m and 20-30 m depths in the anchovy regime but mainly to < 5 m depth in the sand lance regime. Within each dive, auklets showed a greater number of fast/strong wing stroke events in the anchovy regime than in the sand lance regime. These changes in auklet behaviour reflected the different habitats, depth distribution, and swim speed of the targeted prey species. Our study shows the behavioural flexibility of a wing-propelled flying-diving seabird in response to the inter-annual shifts in the dominant forage fish community. It also indicates the ecological constraints on the mechanisms determining nest productivity in this day-foraging/night-provisioning seabird.

AB  - Prey must balance resource acquisition with predator avoidance for survival and reproduction. To reduce risk of predation, prey may avoid areas with high predator use, but if they are unable to due to resource acquisition requirements, they may instead change their habitat use or movement speed to mitigate predation risk. Prey risk response may depend on spatially or temporally varying forage availability as well as seasonal variation in prey vulnerability and availability of alternate foods for predators. To quantify how prey respond to spatial and temporal variation in risk of brown bear predation, we examined Roosevelt elk (Cervus canadensis roosevelti) spatiotemporal behavior responses to brown bear (Ursus arctos) habitat use on Afognak and Raspberry islands, Alaska, using Global Positioning System location data during elk parturition (20 May-15 June), summer (16 June-20 September), and autumn (21 September-10 November). During parturition and summer, elk used forest and shrub landcover in areas of higher brown bear probability of use. During parturition, elk used areas with lower forage productivity in areas of higher bear probability of use, and movement speed decreased with higher bear probability of use, especially in shrub landcover. During summer, elk used areas with higher forage productivity in areas of higher brown bear probability of use. During autumn, elk were less likely to use areas with higher bear habitat probability of use across landcover categories and forage productivity. During summer and autumn, elk movement speed increased with higher brown bear probability of use. Elk behavioral response to risk of brown bear predation could increase energy expenditure and decrease their ability to acquire forage, therefore negatively impacting survival and reproduction with spatiotemporal variation in risk response potentially amplifying these impacts.

AB  - Predation can effectively limit insect herbivores with cascading effects on plant community composition and diversity of tropical rainforests. Assessing variation in predation is therefore important to understand the mechanisms structuring complex rainforest ecosystems. Variation in predation with time of day may provide herbivores with temporal enemy-free space. Trichomes (plant hairs) may provide spatial enemy-free space by increasing climbing resistance for walking arthropod predators and by scattering bat echolocation calls. Artificial model prey is commonly used to measure predation pressure on insect herbivores. Whether model prey shape is sufficient to deceive predators and whether attacks represent actual predation however remain unresolved. We used artificial, plasticine prey to assess temporal and spatial variation in predation in two Panamanian rainforests and tested whether model prey shape is as important for prey recognition by predators as often assumed. We assessed the effect of prey shape and size, time of day, and trichomes on predation by comparing attacks on caterpillar- and humanoid-shaped figurines. We find higher nocturnal than diurnal predation in one but not the other forest, suggesting that herbivores may benefit from enemy-free space during the day in some forests. We find no evidence for an effect of trichomes on predation in the two plant species tested. Equal attack numbers on caterpillar- and humanoid-shaped objects challenge the idea that the visual resemblance of model prey alone is sufficient to deceive predators. We conclude that attacks on model prey represent a variety of responses to novel objects (e.g. exploration, aggression, possibly predation) and urge caution when interpreting their results.

AB  - Context. Mesopredators experience top down pressure from apex predators, which may lead to behavioural changes such as spatial avoidance to reduce both interference and exploitative competition. However, apex predators may also facilitate mesopredators through the provision of carrion, so mesopredators should respond flexibly to the presence of apex predators. Aims. We aimed to investigate the drivers of black-backed jackal (Canis mesomelas) space use and detection in areas with and without lions (Panthera leo). We predicted that jackal detection and space use will be greater if apex predators facilitate rather than suppress them. Additionally, we predicted that in the absence of lions, the relative abundance of small ungulate species may become important drivers of space use and detection, because jackals can switch from scavenging to hunting. Comparatively, in the presence of lions, larger ungulate species will become important drivers of space use and detection as these species become accessible to jackals through scavenging. Methods. We used camera-trapping surveys, a single-species, single-season occupancy modelling approach, and the assessment of activity patterns to explore how apex predators influence the presence and probability of use of different sites in the Eastern Cape province of South Africa. Key results. Apex predators both positively and negatively affected the detection of jackals, indicating that these mesopredators show behavioural flexibility at the individual site level. There was high overlap between jackal activity patterns in the presence and absence of lions; however, at one site with lions, jackal activity did not peak at night as observed at other sites. Conclusions. Our results indicate that jackals demonstrate behavioural flexibility in the presence and absence of apex predators. Importantly, our results show that apex predators can both facilitate and suppress mesopredators, and that their behavioural responses are dependent on site-specific factors.

AB  - Simple Summary: The Italian pig sector is renowned for dry-cured ham production, which requires heavy pigs (raised for at least nine months and slaughtered at more than 160 kg). Nevertheless, efficiency and utilisation of every part of the pig, including the loin, should be maximised. To avoid boar taint, surgical castration is necessary, albeit raising welfare concerns. Immunocastration offers a promising alternative. This study investigated the effects of immunocastration compared to surgical castration on the chemical composition and fatty acid profile of loins and adipose tissue from Italian heavy pigs. The results revealed differences in the fatty acid profiles, suggesting that immunocastrated meat may offer higher levels of saturated fatty acids. These findings highlight the importance of exploring alternative castration methods in terms of pig welfare improvement while also considering meat quality. The Italian pig sector requires heavy pigs (raised for at least nine months and slaughtered at >160 kg). In order to avoid boar taint and lower the impact on welfare, immunocastration provides an alternative to surgical castration. This study investigated the effects of immunocastration compared to surgical castration on the chemical composition and fatty acid profile of loins (longissimus dorsi muscle) and adipose tissue in Italian heavy pigs raised for dry-cured ham. Twenty-four male pigs were subjected to surgical castration (n = 12) or immunocastration (n = 12). Carcass parameters were monitored at slaughter, and samples of longissimus dorsi muscle and subcutaneous fat were analysed. This study showed no significant differences in carcass characteristics and proximate composition of fresh meat. However, variations were observed in the fatty acid profiles of meat and adipose tissue between groups. Notably, saturated fatty acids, particularly stearic acid (18:0), were higher in the intramuscular fat (IMF) of the immunocastrated pigs compared to the surgically castrated pigs. Conversely, monounsaturated fatty acids, predominantly oleic acid (18:1n-9), were higher in the IMF from the surgically castrated pigs compared to the immunocastrated pigs. While immunocastration may offer benefits in terms of animal growth and carcass composition, it could lead to unfavourable lipid changes in fresh loin meat for Italian heavy pigs.
