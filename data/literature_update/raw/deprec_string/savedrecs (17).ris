AB  - Shear force is commonly used to evaluate tenderness, one of the most crucial eating quality aspects of sheep meat. The effect size of various factors on tenderness is still unknown. Studies have suggested that both genetic and environmental factors contribute to the variation in meat tenderness, and there are possible interactions between these factors. An extensive data set (n = 23,696) was analyzed to examine genetic and non-genetic influences on the shear force at 5 days postmortem (SF5). SF5 was measured on lamb loins (Longissimus lumborum) taken from lambs reared over 12 years at eight sites across Australia. The results showed that all carcass traits had a significant (p < 0.001) impact on SF5, with the largest effect on SF5 associated with intramuscular fat (IMF %) (f = 1035). There was also a significant effect of sex, cold shortening at 18 degrees C, sire type and cohort on SF5 (p < 0.001), with a large variation observed between the minimum cohort at 15.9 +/- 1.5 N and maximum at 51.2 +/- 2.1 N. In conclusion, a complex matrix of production, processing and genetic factors impact lamb tenderness as measured by shear force. This experiment helps identify the size of the contribution of these factors towards lamb tenderness, enabling the sheep industry to enhance consumers' satisfaction.

AB  - This study was designed to comparatively evaluate an experimental pulp-capping agent radiopaque dicalcium silicate cement (RDSC), white-colored mineral trioxide aggregate (WMTA), iRoot BP Plus and Biodentine both ex vivo and in vivo. Fourier Transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and X-ray diffraction (XRD) were utilized to analyze the phase composition of pulp-capping agents. The surface morphology and element analysis were finished by Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and Energy Dispersive X-Ray Spectroscopy (EDX). Color stability of the cements and pulp responses induced by different cements were examined by ex-vivo human tooth culture model and in-vivo miniature pig model. Micro-computed tomography was used for quantitative evaluation of the newly formed mineralized tissue. RDSC exhibited discoloration in both models, while WMTA exhibited more visible discoloration. The occurrence of discoloration for WMTA was significantly higher than that of RDSC (p < 0.05), iRoot BP Plus and Biodentine on the 7th day, also higher (p < 0.05) than that of iRoot BP Plus and Biodentine on the 70th day. Mineralized foci were noted in all 7-days groups except the control group both ex vivo and in vivo. Intact and complete reparative dentin bridge formation which possessed tubular structures was noted in all 70-days groups in vivo. RDSC appeared to induce the thickest dentin bridge formation among all these pulp-capping agents which showed statistically significant difference to that of Biodentine (p < 0.05). With decent biological properties, RDSC may have the potential to be a pulp-capping agent recommended in the non-aesthetic area alternative to WMTA, Biodentine and iRoot BP Plus.

AB  - Recent pharmacological research on milk whey, a byproduct of the dairy industry, has identified several therapeutic properties that could be exploited in modern medicine. In the present study, we investigated the anticancer effects of whey from Mediterranean buffalo (Bubalus bubalis) milk. The antitumour effect of delactosed milk whey (DMW) was evaluated using the HCT116 xenograft mouse model of colorectal cancer (CRC). There were no discernible differences in tumour growth between treated and untreated groups. Nevertheless, haematoxylin and eosin staining of the xenograft tissues showed clearer signs of different cell death in DMW-treated mice compared to vehicle-treated mice. Detailed biochemical and molecular biological analyses revealed that DMW was able to downregulate the protein expression levels of c-myc, phospho-Histone H3 (ser 10) and p-ERK. Moreover, DMW also activated RIPK1, RIPK3, and MLKL axis in tumour tissues from xenograft mice, thus, suggesting a necroptotic effect. The necroptotic pathway was accompanied by activation of the apoptotic pathway as revealed by increased expression of both cleaved caspase-3 and PARP-1. At the molecular level, DMW-induced cell death was also associated with (i) upregulation of SIRT3, SIRT6, and PPAR-gamma and (ii) downregulation of LDHA and PPAR-alpha. Overall, our results unveil the potential of whey as a source of biomolecules of food origin in the clinical setting of novel strategies for the treatment of CRC.

AB  - Nik1 orthologs or group III hybrid histidine kinases (HHK3) represent a unique cytoplasmic osmosensor that act upstream of HOG/p38 MAPK pathway in fungi. It is an important molecular target for developing new antifungal agents against human pathogens. HHK3 orthologs contain a linear array of alternative HAMP and HAMP-like linker domains (poly-HAMP) in the N-terminal region. HAMP domains are quite common in prokaryotic histidine kinases where it mostly functions as signal transducer mediating conformational changes in the kinase domains. In contrast, poly-HAMP in HHK3 acts as a sensor and signal transducer to regulate histidine kinase activity. However, the mechanistic detail of this is poorly understood. Interestingly, recent studies indicate that the poly-HAMP-mediated regulation of the kinase activity varies among the orthologs. Hik1 is an important HHK3 ortholog from fungus Magnaporthe oryzae. In this paper, we aimed to decipher the role HAMP and HAMP-like linker domains in regulating the activity of Hik1p. We show that Hik1p acts as a bona fide osmosensor and negatively regulates the downstream HOG/p38 MAPK pathway in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Our data suggest a differential role of the HAMP domains in the functionality of Hik1p. Most interestingly, the deletion of individual domains in poly-HAMP resulted in distinct active forms of Hik1p and thereby indicating that the poly-HAMP domain, instead of acting as on-off switch, regulates the histidine kinase activity by transition through multiple conformational states.

AB  - The pink spotted lady beetle Coleomegilla maculata has been identified as a promising predator to mass rear and release into greenhouses and high tunnels to control aphids on small fruits and vegetables. This study tested the hypothesis that laboratory-reared C. maculata, without any exposure to aphids for multiple generations, could recognize, attack, and consume live aphids. The aphid adults of two species were collected from non-crop host plants (weeds) over two consecutive seasons. The time (seconds) that C. maculata adults required to recognize and partially or completely consume live, healthy adult aphids was recorded in Petri dish arenas in the laboratory. Regardless of the non-prey food source (brine shrimp egg diet, mealworm-protein-based artificial diet), C. maculata adults readily recognized aphids. Adult females were occasionally more voracious than males. One aphid species (Uroleucon erigeronense) was consumed more readily than the other aphid species (Aphis nerii). In conclusion, multigenerational rearing on non-prey foods did not affect the prey recognition behavior of C. maculata adults in the laboratory. Validating the ability of lady beetles reared on artificial diets to recognize and consume live aphids is an important protocol before augmentative releases for aphid control in greenhouses and high tunnels.

AB  - Flea beetles (Alticini) represent one of the most diverse groups within the family Chrysomelidae and are associated with more than 100 different plant families. Conspicuously, only 10 genera account for about a quarter of flea beetle diversity, whereas about 380 genera each comprise less than 10 species, indicating different rates of diversification within the Alticini. Here, we reconstructed the phylogenetic relationships of 608 species in 101 Alticini genera using mitogenomes and cytochrome oxidase I, and applied several frameworks of clade-specific diversification rate analyses. Increased diversification rates were consistently detected in the cosmopolitan genera Altica Goffroy, Longitarsus Berthold, and Phyllotreta Chevrolat, and in neotropical taxa of the subtribe Oedionychina. In addition, we tested whether the evolution of specialized interactions with plants of the order Brassicales influenced the diversification of Phyllotreta and Psylliodes Berthold flea beetles. Specialization on Brassicales was only associated with increased diversification rates in Phyllotreta but not in Psylliodes. Our results indicate that host associations per se do not explain different diversification rates and lay the groundwork for investigating the evolutionary drivers of rapid radiations in Alticini.

AB  - The welfare status of an animal is dependent on its ability to cope and exist in harmony with its environment, such that good physical and psychological health is maintained. Improving animal welfare is an increasingly important aspect of livestock production systems due, in a large extent, to increased consumer concerns about animal production practices. Animal welfare is an integrated part of quality assurance programmes for sustainable animal production, considering that welfare, health, management, economy, consumer acceptance and environmental impact are interdependent. The major welfare concerns in the livestock industry in recent years relate to the rearing and management of dairy calves, the welfare of the dairy cow, effect of husbandry management procedures on the welfare of beef cattle, rearing of sows in gestation and farrowing crates, and the broiler (meat) chicken sector. The paper will focus on scientific research underpinning these welfare concerns, with a particular focus on research conducted on the island of Ireland.

AB  - Plant biotic stressors, including insect damage to economically important crops, are on the rise because of climate change (Skendzic et al., 2021; Matzrafi, 2019; Hatfield et al., 2011). Corn earworm (CEW) Helicoverpa zea (Boddie) is one of the economically important insect pests of maize (Zea mays L.) and sorghum (Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench). In this study, maize near-isogenic lines with high flavonoid content in silks, husks, and kernel pericarps were used to test against the survival of CEW larvae. Larvae feeding on high-flavonoid maize lines had increased mortality and reduced body weight. These larvae showed leakage of the midgut peritrophic matrix, indicating leaky-gut-like syndrome suggesting involvement of microbiome changes in the larval gut. Moreover, the expression of chitin formation and gut health-related genes was changed in the midgut of larvae consuming the flavonoid-rich husks. CEW herbivory caused high and localized accumulation of flavonols around the damaged husk area. Silks and husks of high flavonoid lines also had elevated levels of 3-deoxyanthocyanidins (3-DAs) and flavan-4-ols, which contributed to increased larval mortality. Feeding assays using an artificial diet supplemented with a sorghum 3-DAs-rich extract further confirmed the efficacy of these flavonoids in increasing larval mortality. Altogether, this study suggests a novel option for integrated pest management for CEW larvae.

AB  - Root mutualistic microbes can modulate the production of plant secondary metabolites affecting plant-herbivore interactions. Still, the main mechanisms underlying the impact of root mutualists on herbivore performance remain ambiguous. In particular, little is known about how changes in the plant metabolome induced by root mutualists affect the insect metabolome and post-larval development. By using bioassays with tomato plants (Solanum lycopersicum), we analyzed the impact of the arbuscular mycorrhizal fungus Rhizophagus irregularis and the growth-promoting fungus Trichoderma harzianum on the plant interaction with the specialist insect herbivore Manduca sexta. We found that root colonization by the mutualistic microbes impaired insect development, including metamorphosis. By using untargeted metabolomics, we found that root colonization by the mutualistic microbes altered the secondary metabolism of tomato shoots, leading to enhanced levels of steroidal glycoalkaloids. Untargeted metabolomics further revealed that root colonization by the mutualists affected the metabolome of the herbivore, leading to an enhanced accumulation of steroidal glycoalkaloids and altered patterns of fatty acid amides and carnitine-derived metabolites. Our results indicate that the changes in the shoot metabolome triggered by root mutualistic microbes can cascade up altering the metabolome of the insects feeding on the colonized plants, thus affecting the insect development.

AB  - Bats represent the second largest mammal group, with over 1400 known species dispersed across six continents. Bats are unique in many ways. Notably, their incredible longevity, with a life span of up to ten times longer than what might be expected from their body size and a unique ability to tolerate viruses without displaying any symptoms, means they provide an area of particular importance from a disease risk perspective. In addition, the warm, humid environments in which bats occur provide ideal habitats for fungi to grow, and the bats potentially carry various

AB  - This study evaluated the antioxidative and anti-inflammatory effects of a low-molecular-weight hydrolysate derived from black goat extract using alcalase, ProteAX, and trypsin (APT6 < 3 kDa). The APT6 < 3 kDa exhibited high antioxidative activities with estimated contents of 41.24% for antioxidative amino acids and 49.55% for hydrophobic amino acids. APT6 < 3 kDa inhibited nitric oxide and prostaglandin E-2 production in RAW 264.7 cells induced by lipopolysaccharide (p < 0.05), which was accompanied by the inhibition of inducible nitric oxide synthase and cyclooxygenase-2 protein expression. Additionally, APT6 < 3 kDa downregulated the mRNA expression and production of TNF-alpha and IL-1 beta (p<0.05). Mechanistically, these anti-inflammatory effects of APT6 < 3 kDa were shown by downregulating the MAPK and NF-kappa B pathways in a dose-dependent manner. Overall, 43 peptides were isolated from a certain fraction (F5) of APT6 < 3 kDa, demonstrating high antioxidative and anti-inflammatory activities. These results suggest that identified peptides from APT6 < 3 kDa possess natural antioxidants and hold potential as anti-inflammatory agents.

AB  - To identify key traits brought about by citrus domestication, we have analyzed the transcriptomes of the pulp of developing fruitlets of inedible wild Ichang papeda (Citrus ichangensis), acidic Sun Chu Sha Kat mandarin (C. reticulata) and three palatable segregants of a cross between commercial Clementine (C. x clementina) and W. Murcott (C. x reticulata) mandarins, two pummelo/mandarin admixtures of worldwide distribution. RNA-seq comparison between the wild citrus and the ancestral sour mandarin identified 7267 differentially expressed genes, out of which 2342 were mapped to 117 KEGG pathways. From the remaining genes, a set of 2832 genes was functionally annotated and grouped into 45 user-defined categories. The data suggest that domestication promoted fundamental growth processes to the detriment of the production of chemical defenses, namely, alkaloids, terpenoids, phenylpropanoids, flavonoids, glucosinolates and cyanogenic glucosides. In the papeda, the generation of energy to support a more active secondary metabolism appears to be dependent upon upregulation of glycolysis, fatty acid degradation, Calvin cycle, oxidative phosphorylation, and ATP-citrate lyase and GABA pathways. In the acidic mandarin, downregulation of cytosolic citrate degradation was concomitant with vacuolar citrate accumulation. These changes affected nitrogen and carbon allocation in both species leading to major differences in organoleptic properties since the reduction of unpleasant secondary metabolites increases palatability while acidity reduces acceptability. The comparison between the segregants and the acidic mandarin identified 357 transcripts characterized by the occurrence in the three segregants of additional downregulation of secondary metabolites and basic structural cell wall components. The segregants also showed upregulation of genes involved in the synthesis of methyl anthranilate and furaneol, key substances of pleasant fruity aroma and flavor, and of sugar transporters relevant for sugar accumulation. Transcriptome and qPCR analysis in developing and ripe fruit of a set of genes previously associated with citric acid accumulation, demonstrated that lower acidity is linked to downregulation of these regulatory genes in the segregants. The results suggest that the transition of inedible papeda to sour mandarin implicated drastic gene expression reprograming of pivotal pathways of the primary and secondary metabolism, while palatable mandarins evolved through progressive refining of palatability properties, especially acidity.

AB  - Classical biological control aims to suppress alien invasive plant populations by introducing host-specific natural enemies from the native range. This relies on the assumption that invasive plant populations in the invaded range benefit from the release of natural enemies. Pre-release surveys in the invaded range are a useful way to determine if enemy release applies to a particular invasive alien plant, and to determine what other factors may contribute to the invasion. Similarly, pre-release surveys gather information that can be used to compare invaded sites before and after the release of biological control agents and may also identify whether natural enemies have been accidentally introduced into the country. Pre-release surveys were conducted in South Africa on the invasive Nymphaea mexicana Zuccarini (Nymphaeaceae) to gather such information about this species, for which a biological control programme is being developed. There was lower diversity and abundance of herbivores in the native range compared to South Africa, suggesting that N. mexicana does experience enemy release at most sites in South Africa. This support for the enemy release hypothesis justifies the investment in biological control for its management. However, a native weevil, Bagous longulus Gyllenhal (Coleoptera: Curculionidae), was found feeding and reproducing on N. mexicana at three sites, resulting in damage to the leaves and suggesting that a novel association has formed between these species. Bagous longulus may have potential to be distributed to sites of N. mexicana where it is not present, though further investigation is necessary to confirm if its host range is suitable for this to be a safe endeavour. With the exception of sites where B. longulus was present, leaf sizes were large and damage was low, and there is no evidence that any natural enemies have been accidentally introduced from the native range. Findings such as these emphasise the importance of conducting thorough surveys during the development of biological control programmes.

AB  - The skin functions as the body's primary defense barrier; when compromised, it can lead to dehydration, infection, shock, or potentially life-threatening conditions. Miniature pigs exhibit skin characteristics and healing processes highly analogous to humans. Mesenchymal stem cells contribute to skin injury repair through a paracrine mechanism involving exosomes. This research examines whether adipose-derived MSC exosomes effectively enhance healing following autologous skin grafting in miniature pigs. It also compares the roles and distinctions of ADSCs and ADSC-Exos in inflammatory responses and tissue regeneration. This study found significantly reduced levels of oxidative stress products and pro-inflammatory factors, while antioxidant factors, anti-inflammatory factors, and pro-regenerative factors were elevated, and anti-regenerative factor levels decreased. Moreover, the expression levels of key markers-namely, PI3K, Akt, and mTOR-in the regeneration-associated signaling pathway were increased. The alterations in these indicators indicate that ADSC-Exos can regulate inflammatory responses and promote regeneration. This study provides a novel theoretical foundation for the implementation of acellular therapy in clinical settings.

AB  - Metabolic syndrome (MetS) is associated with low-grade inflammation, which can be exacerbated by renal artery stenosis (RAS) and renovascular hypertension, potentially worsening outcomes through pro-inflammatory cytokines. This study investigated whether mesenchymal stem/stromal cells (MSCs) could reduce fat inflammation in pigs with MetS and RAS. Twenty-four pigs were divided into Lean (control), MetS, MetS + RAS, and MetS + RAS + MSCs. In the MSC-treated group, autologous adipose-derived MSCs (107 cells) were injected into the renal artery six weeks after RAS induction. After four weeks, fat volumes and inflammatory markers were assessed. MSC treatment reduced levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines (MCP-1, TNF-a, IL-6) in the renal vein blood and in perirenal fat. The MSCs also decreased fat fibrosis, restored adipocyte size, and altered adipogenesis-related gene expression, particularly in the perirenal fat. These effects were less pronounced in subcutaneous fat. The MSC therapy attenuated fat inflammation and improved metabolic outcomes in pigs with MetS + RAS, suggesting that adipose-derived MSCs may offer a promising therapeutic approach for metabolic disorders.

AB  - The synapses between inner hair cells (IHCs) and spiral ganglion neurons (SGNs) are the most vulnerable structures in the noise-exposed cochlea. Cochlear synaptopathy results from the disruption of these synapses following noise exposure and is considered the main cause of poor speech understanding in noisy environments, even when audiogram results are normal. Cochlear synaptopathy leads to the degeneration of SGNs if damaged IHC-SGN synapses are not promptly recovered. Oxidative stress plays a central role in the pathogenesis of cochlear synaptopathy. C-Phycocyanin (C-PC) has antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities and is widely utilized in the food and drug industry. However, the effect of the C-PC on noise-induced cochlear damage is unknown. We first investigated the therapeutic effect of C-PC on noise-induced cochlear synaptopathy. In vitro experiments revealed that C-PC reduced the H2O2-induced generation of reactive oxygen species in HEI-OC1 auditory cells. H2O2-induced cytotoxicity in HEI-OC1 cells was reduced with C-PC treatment. After white noise exposure for 3 h at a sound pressure of 118 dB, the guinea pigs intratympanically administered 5 mu g/mL C-PC exhibited greater wave I amplitudes in the auditory brainstem response, more IHC synaptic ribbons and more IHC-SGN synapses according to microscopic analysis than the saline-treated guinea pigs. Furthermore, the group treated with C-PC had less intense 4-hydroxynonenal and intercellular adhesion molecule-1 staining in the cochlea compared with the saline group. Our results suggest that C-PC improves cochlear synaptopathy by inhibiting noise-induced oxidative stress and the inflammatory response in the cochlea.

AB  - The sodium smelting of vanadium-titanium magnetite (VTM) can realize a multi-component comprehensive utilization of VTM. To broaden the application of the vanadium-bearing pig iron produced through this process, it is imperative to maintain the titanium content in molten iron at a very low level. In this study, the effects of temperature, the added amounts of sodium carbonate and anthracite, and the smelting time on the titanium content of molten iron were investigated using thermodynamic calculations and experiments. The results indicate that the introduction of sodium carbonate makes the reduction reaction of VTM a relatively low-temperature smelting system. In the smelting process, the Ti content in molten iron increases with the increase in temperature and decreases with the addition of sodium carbonate, while the amount of anthracite added has little effect on it. The appropriate technological parameters were determined as temperature: 1150-1250 degrees C, smelting time: >= 2 h, anthracite consumption: 25-35%, and sodium carbonate consumption: >= 60%. In addition, it was determined that the Ti impurities in the V-bearing pig iron were mainly (Ti,V)(C,N), CaTiO3, and Na2TiO3. All results obtained from this work contribute to the comprehensive utilization of VTM, and also provide theoretical support for the sodium smelting of VTM.

AB  - Featured Application Raman spectroscopy could be used as a non-invasive and rapid detector of small molecules in the skin of patients. Raman spectroscopy was used to detect low quantities of Vismodegib in the skin after its topical application via transfersomes. Vismodegib is a novel antineoplastic drug approved for oral administration for treatment of basal cell carcinoma. Transfersomes loaded with Vismodegib were prepared by thin film resuspension and extrusion, and were characterized physicochemically. Transfersomes were applied to human and pig skin specimens using the Saarbrucken penetration model. The skin was then sectioned by tape stripping, followed by penetration assessment by UV-Vis spectroscopy and Raman spectroscopy in a confocal Raman microscope. Raman signals from Vismodegib and transfersomes were recovered from skin sections, showing a similar distribution in the stratum corneum obtained by the other techniques. On the other hand, pig and human skin showed differences in their penetration profiles, proving their lack of equivalence for assessing the performance of these transfersomes. Raman spectroscopy appears as a potential non-invasive, direct tool for monitoring hard-to-detect molecules in a complex environment such as the skin.

AB  - Circadian disruption due to artificial light affects cellular redox homeostasis and may lead to neurodegenerative diseases. The aim of the present study was to investigate the effect of continuous light exposure (CLE) and continuous dark exposure (CDE) along with melatonin supplementation on neuronal redox status, mitochondrial complexes, membrane bound transporters, inflammation, autophagy and neurodegeneration in chronodisrupted model of rat. In the study artificial light of white LED bulb with 500 lux intensity was used. Melatonin (10 mg/kg b.w., orally) was supplemented to control and CLE groups for 10 days. Standard protocols were employed to measure pro-oxidants, non-enzymatic antioxidants, and mitochondrial complexes in brain tissues. Membrane-bound ion transporter activities were evaluated in the crude synaptosomes. Gene expression analysis was performed to assess the expression of inflammatory, autophagy and neuronal marker genes. Histopathological changes in cerebral cortex and different hippocampus regions of the brain were studied. Melatonin exerted a significant normalization of redox status biomarkers in brain tissue. Further melatonin restored the activities of mitochondrial complexes and synaptosomal membrane bound ion transporters. RT-PCR data revealed that melatonin downregulated the expression of inflammatory (TNF-alpha, IL-6) autophagy (Atg-3, Beclin-1) and neurodegenerative genes (Ngb and NSE) in CLE group. Melatonin also preserved the histology architecture in cerebral cortex and hippocampus. Our results indicate that melatonin exerts a potent neuroprotective effect through reduction of oxidative stress, inflammation and autophagy. Melatonin supplementation might be a promising neurotherapeutic in the treatment neurodegenerative disorders caused by circadian disturbances.

AB  - 1. Discretional cannibalism is a widespread phenomenon among lepidopteran herbivores. Herbivores encounter variation in dietary nutrient quality when foraging, which alters feeding behaviour, as well as population- and trophic-level dynamics. For example, plant resistance traits directly influence feeding patterns in insect herbivores through reduced consumption of plant tissue and increased rates of cannibalism. 2. However, the effects of dietary composition, in particular unbalanced macronutrient ratios, on driving cannibalism remain unknown. 3. We examined the effects of unbalanced macronutrient ratios on cannibalism in the generalist caterpillar Trichoplusia ni using an artificial diet experiment with varied ratios of two important macronutrients: protein and carbohydrates. We quantified cannibalistic behaviour from the second instar to pupation and measured survival among cannibals and non-cannibals to understand the long-term and short-term costs and benefits of cannibalism. 4. Caterpillars in high carbohydrate, low protein treatments cannibalised 20% more than the optimum control diet treatment, whereas herbivores in high protein, low carbohydrate treatments cannibalised 33% more than herbivores reared on the optimum macronutrient diet treatment. Survival of cannibals in macronutrientdeficient diet treatments was 10.4%, compared with 76.9% for cannibals in the optimal macronutrient diet treatment. 5. While previous work demonstrates the importance of induced chemical defence in promoting shifts to cannibalism, our results indicate that unbalanced macronutrient ratios can also promote cannibalism in insect herbivores. We propose that understanding how unbalanced macronutrient ratios drive cannibalism yields insight into how dietary quality, including both plant resistance traits and plant nutrients, influences behavioural plasticity and mediates plant-herbivore interactions.

AB  - Fern-feeding insects have not received much attention because ferns have been considered herbivore-resistant plants. However, ferns are attacked by herbivorous insects, including specialized spore feeders. For a better understanding of host specialization, we investigated the effect of experimentally transferred larvae of a spore-feeding moth, Stathmopoda sp. (Lepidoptera: Stathmopodidae), from its original fern host Amauropelta linkiana (C. Presl) Pic. Serm., to three closely related species [Amauropelta rudis (Kunze) Pic. Serm, Amauropelta oligocarpa (Humb. & Bonpl. ex Willd.) Pic. Serm., and Amauropelta resinifera (Desv.) Pic. Serm.], and one alien fern species, Macrothelypteris torresiana (Gaudich.) Ching (all Thelypteridaceae). After experimental host-plant transfer, we measured spore consumption of the larvae, and the survival and duration of each developmental stage. Once larvae were transferred to alternative hosts, they were still able to complete their life cycle, but consumed more spores, required more time to reach the adult stage, and had lower survival rates than on their original host, or even skipped the fifth instar on alternative hosts. Thus, our results suggested a strong adaptation of this moth species on its original host plant. We discuss some traits of experimental hosts, as the spores may contain fewer nutrients, or higher concentrations of toxic agents for larval development, thus restricting successful host-plant switching. Further studies to measure the frequency and successful colonization of alternative hosts in nature are needed, by assessing variation in the chemical composition of spores between original and alternative hosts.

AB  - Introduction Agarwood, a prized aromatic resin from Aquilaria sinensis, is formed as a defensive response to injury or fungal infection. However, the factors influencing its chemical composition remain poorly understood. This study aimed to explore the relationship between endophytic fungal communities and volatile oil content in ordinary-type and Qinan-type A. sinensis. Methods Using high-throughput sequencing, we analyzed the fungal composition in both the healthy wood and agarwood layers of different A. sinensis germplasms. Additionally, gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) was employed to quantify the volatile oil content. Results The results revealed that the fungal community composition in the agarwood layer differed between the two types of A. sinensis, with Fusarium, Hermatomyces, and Rhinocladiella linked to sesquiterpene production (r>0.8, p<0.01), while Microidium, Cladosporium, and Cephalotrichum were associated with chromone levels (r>0.8, p<0.01). Furthermore, the volatile oil content in Qinan-type agarwood was significantly higher than that in ordinary-type agarwood, with distinct chemical profiles observed in each germplasm. Discussion These findings provide critical insights into the role of endophytic fungi in shaping agarwood's chemical composition and have practical implications for enhancing agarwood production in the industry. Consequently, this research has significant implications for the agarwood industry, as it enhances our understanding of how fungi influence resin quality and paves the way for improving the efficiency of agarwood induction, ultimately leading to higher-quality and more sustainable production.

AB  - The responses of nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions to nitrogen (N) application in acidic, perennial agricultural systems, and the factors driving these emissions, remain poorly understood. To address this gap, a 12-year field experiment was conducted to investigate the effects of different N application rates (0, 112.5, 225, and 450 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1)) on N2O emissions, tea yield, and the associated driving factors in a tea plantation. The study found that soil pH significantly decreased with long-term N application, dropping by 0.32 to 0.85 units. Annual tea yield increased significantly, by 148-243%. N application also elevated N2O emission fluxes by 33-277%, with notable seasonal fluctuations observed. N2O flux was positively correlated with N rates, water-filled pore space (WFPS), soil temperature (T-soil), and inorganic N (NH4+-N and NO3--N), while showing a negative correlation with soil pH. Random forest (RF) modeling identified WFPS, N rates, and Tsoil as the most important variables influencing N2O flux. The cumulative N2O emissions for N112.5, N225, and N450 were 1584, 2791, and 45,046 g N ha(-2), respectively, representing increases of 1.33, 2.34, and 3.77 times compared to N0. The N2O-N emission factors (EF) were 0.35%, 0.71%, and 0.74%, respectively, and increased with higher N rates. These findings highlight the importance of selecting appropriate fertilization timing and improving water and fertilizer management as key strategies for mitigating soil acidification, enhancing nitrogen use efficiency (NUE), and reducing N2O emissions in acidic tea-plantation systems. This study offers a theoretical foundation for developing rational N fertilizer management practices and strategies aimed at reducing N2O emissions in tea-plantation soils.

AB  - Simple Summary A method to improve meat production at guinea pig farms is by applying crossbreeding schemes. Our study evaluates the application of a two-way crossbreeding scheme using four genetic lines (two paternal and two maternal lines) to estimate the heterosis for productive traits. Positive heterosis effects in both types of crosses were found only for birth weight: 3.7% for paternal crosses and 12.7% for maternal crosses. However, the heterosis was not observed for weight at 10 days of age, weaning, or at 60 days of age (slaughter age). Based on this, applying a two-way crossbreeding scheme of paternal and maternal guinea pig lines for meat production would not be recommended for our population. On the other hand, assessing the three- or four-way crossbreeding schemes could be interesting.Abstract This study aimed to estimate the heterosis for productive traits in a two-way crossbreeding scheme. Four guinea pig lines were originally selected for the following traits: line P1 for the growth rate, P2 for the partial feed conversion rate, M1 for the growth rate of the litter at 10 days of age, and M2 for the litter size at birth. The comparison included 176 purebreds (P1: 46, P2: 43, M1: 54 and M2: 33) and 150 crosses (P1P2: 42, P2P1: 38, M1M2: 11 and M2M1: 59); body weights at birth, 10 days, weaning and 60 days of age were analyzed. A linear fixed-effect model was used, and heterosis was estimated as the difference between the average performance of the crossbred and pure-line animals. The pure line comparisons showed that P2 was lower than P1 for weight at 10 days and weaning weight, while all other comparisons between the paternal and maternal pure lines were not significant. The results indicated significant positive heterosis effects for both types of crosses, but only for birth weight: 3.7% for paternal crosses and 12.7% for maternal crosses. The heterosis estimates were mostly positive but not significant for all other traits. A reason for the low levels of heterosis could be that the lines are not very genetically differentiated. These results suggest that applying a two-way crossbreeding scheme within paternal and maternal guinea pig lines for meat production is not recommended due to the absence of heterosis for growth traits.

AB  - Acute spinal cord injury (ASCI) is a devastating event that can have severe hemodynamic consequences, depending on location and severity of the lesion. Knowledge of hyperacute hemodynamic changes is important for researchers using porcine models of thoracic ASCI. The goal of this study was to determine the hyperacute hemodynamic changes observed after ASCI when using pigs as their own controls. Five Yucatan gilts were anesthetized, and a dorsal laminectomy performed at T10-T12. Standardized blunt trauma was applied for 5 consecutive min, and hemodynamic variables were collected 5 min before ASCI, and at 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 20, 30, 60, 80 and 120 min after ASCI. Arterial blood gas samples were collected at 60 min and 10 min before, and at 30 min and between 120 and 240 min after ASCI. Parametric data were analyzed using a mixed effects model with time point as the fixed factor and subject as the random factor. We found no effect on heart rate, pulse pressure, SpO(2), EtCO2, and respiratory rate between baseline and timepoints after ASCI. Diastolic arterial pressure, mean arterial pressure, and systolic arterial pressure fell significantly by 18%, 16%, and 15%, respectively, at 2 min after ASCI. However, none of the decrements in arterial pressures resulted in hypotension at any time point. Heart rate did not change significantly after ASCI. Blood glucose progressively increased to 50% above baseline between 120 and 240 minutes after ASCI. Low thoracic ASCI caused a consistent and statistically significant but clinically minor hyperacute decrease in arterial pressures (-15%) that did not produce hypotension or metabolic changes suggestive of tissue hypoperfusion. Our findings using this model suggest that mean arterial pressures should be maintained above 85 mm Hg prior to spinal trauma in order to avoid hypotensive states after ASCI.

AB  - Simple Summary
   Piglets at weaning face numerous changes: they are separated from the sow, are transitioned from milk to solid feed, and are frequently mixed with other litters in a totally new environment. In addition, they are predisposed to bacterial infections. In this context, there is a strong need to develop mitigating dietary strategies to limit the impact of these changes, which alter performance and immune status. In our study, we mimicked a mild bacterial infection in weaned piglets by intraperitoneally administering lipopolysaccharide (LPS), a bacterial endotoxin. Half of the challenged piglets were fed with a diet supplemented with a mixture of functional amino acids. Our study showed that LPS challenge increased markers of inflammation in piglets, which could be partially reversed by the supplementation of the amino acid mixture supplementation. These data indicate that the amino acid mixture supplementation could have a protective effect for challenged piglets during weaning.
   In order to investigate the effect of a dietary amino acid mixture supplementation in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-challenged weaned piglets, twenty-seven 28-day-old (8.2 +/- 1.0 kg) newly weaned piglets were randomly allocated to one of three experimental treatments for five weeks. Diet 1: a CTRL treatment. Diet 2: an LPS treatment, where piglets were intraperitoneally administered LPS (25 mu g/kg) on day 7. Diet 3: an LPS+MIX treatment, where piglets were intraperitoneally administered LPS on day 7 and fed a diet supplemented with a mixture of 0.3% of arginine, branched-chain amino acids (leucine, valine, and isoleucine), and cystine (MIX). Blood samples were drawn on day 10 and day 35, and serum was analysed for selected chemical parameters and proteomics. The LPS and LPS+MIX groups exhibited an increase in haptoglobin concentrations on day 10. The LPS group showed an increased cortisol concentration, while this concentration was reduced in the LPS+MIX group compared to the control group. Similarly, the LPS+MIX group showed a decreased haptoglobin concentration on day 35 compared to the two other groups. Immunoglobulin concentrations were affected by treatments. Indeed, on day 10, the concentrations of IgG and IgM were decreased by the LPS challenge, as illustrated by the lower concentrations of these two immunoglobulins in the LPS group compared to the control group. In addition, the supplementation with the amino acid mixture in the LPS+MIX further decreased IgG and increased IgM concentrations compared to the LPS group. Although a proteomics approach did not reveal important alterations in the protein profile in response to treatments, LPS-challenged piglets had an increase in proteins linked to the immune response, when compared to piglets supplemented with the amino acid mixture. Overall, data indicate that LPS-challenged piglets supplemented with this amino acid mixture are more protected against the detrimental effects of LPS.

AB  - Early weaning in intensive pig production induces stress, compromising gastrointestinal health. Poor fat digestion results from the piglets' underdeveloped digestive system. Dietary emulsifiers can enhance fat utilization, and glyceryl polyethylene glycol ricinoleate (GPGR) has been shown to improve pig performance. This study evaluated GPGR's effects on intestinal health in weaned piglets in a commercial production farm. A total of 380 just weaned (21 days old) piglets were divided in two groups of 190 animals each (in four replicates) that received either a basal diet (control) or a basal diet + 350 g/ton GPGR pharmaceutical formulation as top dress. Blood samples were collected at pre-established days, and intestinal sampling occurred 15 days post-weaning. Plasma cortisol, citrulline, intestinal morphology, mucus quality, enzymatic activity, volatile fatty acids (VFAs), and cecal microbiota were analyzed. GPGR did not alter plasma cortisol but increased citrullinemia (P: 0.024), suggesting greater enterocyte functional mass. GPGR piglets showed improved intestinal morphology (greater villus height, villus height:crypt depth ratio, and intestinal absorption area, p < 0.05) and higher enzymatic maltase activity (p <= 0.014). VFAs, bacterial adherence to mucus, and goblet cell counts were unaffected. Dietary GPGR increased Firmicutes and Actinobacteria (P: 0.014 and P: 0.045, respectively) while reducing Proteobacteria (p < 0.001). In conclusion, dietary GPGR promotes intestinal health in weaned piglets by improving epithelial structure, digestive function, and microbiota balance, representing a promising strategy to support piglets in overcoming the early nursery phase.

AB  - alpha-Farnesene, a crucial secondary metabolite in sesquiterpenes, is crucial for plant biotic and abiotic stress resistance. In this study, we screened an AFS gene from transcriptome data of tea plants (Camellia sinensis) intercropped with Chinese chestnut (Castanea mollissima), resulting in the cloning of CsAFS2. CsAFS2 expression increased following treatment with MJ (Methyl jasmonate), SA (Salicylic acid), GA(3) (Gibberellin A3), and various plant growth regulators, as well as under high-salt, drought, and low-temperature conditions. The heterologous genetic transformation of tobacco with CsAFS2 led to an enhanced resistance to low-temperature stress and aphid feeding, evident from elevated levels of osmotic regulatory substances, increased protective enzyme activity, and the upregulation of cold and insect resistance-related genes. Trichomes, crucial in cold and insect resistance, exhibited significantly greater length and density in transgenic tobacco as compared to control plants. These results confirm the vital role of CsAFS2 in enhancing cold and insect resistance, providing comprehensive insights into stress regulation mechanisms in tea plants and advancing stress-resistant tea plant breeding.

AB  - In mammalian hearing, type-I afferent auditory nerve fibers comprise the basis of the afferent auditory pathway. They are connected to inner hair cells of the cochlea via specialized ribbon synapses. Auditory nerve fibers of different physiological types differ subtly in their synaptic location and morphology. Low-spontaneous-rate auditory nerve fibers typically connect on the modiolar side of the inner hair cell, while high-spontaneous-rate fibers are typically found on the pillar side. In aging and noise-damaged ears, this fine-tuned balance between auditory nerve fiber populations can be disrupted and the functional consequences are currently unclear. Here, using immunofluorescent labeling of presynaptic ribbons and postsynaptic glutamate receptor patches, we investigated changes in synaptic morphology at three different tonotopic locations along the cochlea of aging gerbils compared to those of young adults. Quiet-aged gerbils showed about 20% loss of afferent ribbon synapses. While the loss was random at apical, low-frequency cochlear locations, at the basal, high-frequency location it almost exclusively affected the modiolar-located synapses. The subtle differences in volumes of pre- and postsynaptic elements located on the inner hair cell's modiolar versus pillar side were unaffected by age. This is consistent with known physiology and suggests a predominant, age-related loss in the low-spontaneous-rate auditory nerve population in the cochlear base, but not the apex.

AB  - An enriched environment is used as a behavioral intervention therapy that applies sensory, motor, and social stimulation, and has been used in basic and clinical research of various neurological diseases. In this study, we established mouse models of photothrombotic stroke and, 24 hours later, raised them in a standard, enriched, or isolated environment for 4 weeks. Compared with the mice raised in a standard environment, the cognitive function of mice raised in an enriched environment was better and the pathological damage in the hippocampal CA1 region was remarkably alleviated. Furthermore, protein expression levels of tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor 6, nuclear factor kappa B p65, interleukin-6, and tumor necrosis factor alpha, and the mRNA expression level of tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor 6 were greatly lower, while the expression level of miR-146a-5p was higher. Compared with the mice raised in a standard environment, changes in these indices in mice raised in an isolated environment were opposite to mice raised in an enriched environment. These findings suggest that different living environments affect the hippocampal inflammatory response and cognitive function in a mouse model of stroke.

AB  - Acoustic communication serves a crucial role in the social interactions of vocal animals. Duetting-the coordinated singing among pairs of animals-has evolved independently multiple times across diverse taxonomic groups including insects, frogs, birds, and mammals. A crucial first step for understanding how information is encoded and transferred in duets is through quantifying the acoustic repertoire, which can reveal differences and similarities on multiple levels of analysis and provides the groundwork necessary for further studies of the vocal communication patterns of the focal species. Investigating acoustic tradeoffs, such as the tradeoff between the rate of syllable repetition and note bandwidth, can also provide important insights into the evolution of duets, as these tradeoffs may represent the physical and mechanical limits on signal design. In addition, identifying which sex initiates the duet can provide insights into the function of the duets. We have three main goals in the current study: (1) provide a descriptive, fine-scale analysis of Gursky's spectral tarsier (Tarsius spectrumgurskyae) duets; (2) use unsupervised approaches to investigate sex-specific note repertoires; and (3) test for evidence of acoustic tradeoffs in the rate of note repetition and bandwidth of tarsier duet contributions. We found that both sexes were equally likely to initiate the duets and that pairs differed substantially in the duration of their duets. Our unsupervised clustering analyses indicate that both sexes have highly graded note repertoires. We also found evidence for acoustic tradeoffs in both male and female duet contributions, but the relationship in females was much more pronounced. The prevalence of this tradeoff across diverse taxonomic groups including birds, bats, and primates indicates the constraints that limit the production of rapidly repeating broadband notes may be one of the few 'universals' in vocal communication. Future carefully designed playback studies that investigate the behavioral response, and therefore potential information transmitted in duets to conspecifics, will be highly informative.

AB  - Tea plants, in particular, leafy cash crops, prefer warm and humid climates. Our previous work identified CsPAT1 as a facilitator of lignin biosynthesis in tea plants. The specific role of CsPAT1 in tea plants' abiotic stress response remains unclear. In this study, we found that the expression of CsPAT1 in tea plants was induced under drought, cold, heat, and ABA treatments. CsPAT1 transgenic Arabidopsis lines displayed enhanced drought tolerance compared with wild-type (WT) controls. The SOD and POD activities, proline content, and expression levels of drought-responsive genes were significantly increased in transgenic Arabidopsis under drought stress treatment. Transcriptome analysis revealed a significant enrichment of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in the flavonoid biosynthesis pathway. Correspondingly, total flavonoid contents were significantly higher in the CsPAT1 transgenic lines. Through UPLC-MS/MS-based flavonoid metabolome analysis, we identified and quantified 24 flavonoid metabolites. Notably, CsPAT1 transgenic lines exhibited significantly lower levels of phenylpropanoids and hydroxycinnamic acids, key precursors in phenylpropanoid biosynthesis. Conversely, nine flavonoid compounds were significantly elevated in the transgenic lines, including apigenin, luteolin 7-Oglucoside, kaempferide, naringenin, butin, catechin, biochanin A, daidzin, and genistein. These findings suggest that CsPAT1 may enhance drought resistance by regulating the phenylpropanoid metabolic pathway. Our results provide insights for future breeding strategies to enhance drought tolerance in tea plants.

AB  - The cultivation of camelina (Camelina sativa L. Crantz) is increasing day by day owing to its high levels of oil content and potential source of alpha-linolenic acid, a precursor for omega-3 fatty acid. However, cultivation under drought stress, (e.g., under rainfed conditions) has a negative impact on the productivity and oil quality of oilseed crops, while supplementary irrigation in sensitive growth periods of plants improves plant performance by increasing nutrient absorption rate. This study aimed to examine the effects of different sources of fertilizers on nutrient content, agronomic traits, quantity, and quality of camelina oil under rainfed and irrigated conditions. Treatments included i) no fertilization (control), ii) complete chemical fertilizer (CF), iii) bio-fertilizer (BF), iv) chitosan nanoparticles (CS), v) 50 % CF + BF, vi) 50 % CF + CS, vii) BF + CS, and viii) 50 % CF + BF + CS under rainfed and irrigated conditions (supplementary irrigation). The maximum concentrations of N, P, and K were obtained under supplementary irrigation with application of 50 % CF + BF + CS. Likewise, the maximum biological yield, seed yield, and oil yield were obtained under supplementary irrigation with application of BF + CS + 50 % CF. In addition, the maximum activity of glutathione peroxidase (GPX), glutathione reductase (GR), superoxide dismutase (SOD), polyphenol oxidase (PPO), and phenylalanine ammonia lyase (PAL) were recorded in rainfed conditions and with the integrative application of 50 % CF + BF + CS. Furthermore, the highest content of anthocyanin and ascorbic acid were observed in rainfed conditions treated with BF + CS + 50 % CF. The main compounds of camelina oil were saturated fatty acids including palmitic and stearic acids as well as unsaturated fatty acids containing oleic, linoleic, linolenic, and eicosenoic acid, respectively. Supplementary irrigation along with the integrative application of BF + CS and 50 % CF + BF + CS improved the oil quality of camelina through increasing the unsaturated fatty acids such as oleic, linoleic, linolenic, eicosenoic, and erucic acids. Overall, supplementary irrigation with the integrative application of fertilizers, especially 50 % CF + BF + CS, could be a sustainable strategy for improving the content and quality of camelina oil in rainfed conditions.

AB  - NANOS3 is an evolutionarily conserved gene expressed in primordial germ cells that is important for germ cell development. Germ cell deletion by NANOS3 knockout has been reported in several mammalian species, but its function in pigs is unclear. In the present study, we investigated the germline effects of NANOS3 knockout in pigs using CRISPR/Cas9. Embryo transfer of CRISPR/Cas9-modified embryos produced ten offspring, of which one showed wild-type NANOS3 alleles, eight had two mutant NANOS3 alleles, and the other exhibited mosaicism (four mutant alleles). Histological analysis revealed no germ cells in the testes or ovaries of any of the nine mutant pigs. These results demonstrated that NANOS3 is crucial for porcine germ cell production.

AB  - Identification of innovative therapeutic targets for the treatment of cognitive impairment in Parkinson's disease (PD) is urgently needed. Hydrogen sulfide (H2S) plays an important role in cognitive function. Therefore, this work is aimed at investigating whether H2S attenuates the cognitive impairment in PD and the underlying mechanisms. In the rotenone- (ROT-) established PD rat model, NaHS (a donor of H2S) attenuated the cognitive impairment and promoted microglia polarization from M1 towards M2 in the hippocampus of PD rats. NaHS also dramatically upregulated the Warburg effect in the hippocampus of PD rats. 2-Deoxyglucose (2-DG, an inhibitor of the Warburg effect) abolished NaHS-upregulated Warburg effect in the hippocampus of PD rats. Moreover, the inhibited hippocampal Warburg effect by 2-DG abrogated H2S-excited the enhancement of hippocampal microglia M2 polarization and the improvement of cognitive function in ROT-exposed rats. Our data demonstrated that H2S inhibits the cognitive dysfunction in PD via promoting microglia M2 polarization by enhancement of hippocampal Warburg effect.

AB  - Although scurvy, the severe form of vitamin C deficiency, has been almost eradicated, the prevalence of subclinical vitamin C deficiency is much higher than previously estimated and its impact on human health might not be fully understood. Vitamin C is an essential molecule, especially in the central nervous system where it performs numerous, varied and critical functions, including modulation of neurogenesis and neuronal differentiation. Although it was originally considered to occur only in the embryonic brain, it is now widely accepted that neurogenesis also takes place in the adult brain. The subventricular zone (SVZ) is the neurogenic niche where the largest number of new neurons are born; however, the effect of vitamin C deficiency on neurogenesis in this key region of the adult brain is unknown. Therefore, through BrdU labeling, immunohistochemistry, confocal microscopy and transmission electron microscopy, we analyzed the proliferation and cellular composition of the SVZ and the lateral ventricle (LVE) of adult guinea pigs exposed to a vitamin-C-deficient diet for 14 and 21 days. We found that neuroblasts in the SVZ and LVE were progressively and significantly decreased as the days under vitamin C deficiency elapsed. The neuroblasts in the SVZ and LVE decreased by about 50% in animals with 21 days of deficiency; this was correlated with a reduction in BrdU positive cells in the SVZ and LVE. In addition, the reduction in neuroblasts was not restricted to a particular rostro-caudal area, but was observed throughout the LVE. We also found that vitamin C deficiency altered cellular morphology at the ultrastructural level, especially the cellular and nuclear morphology of ependymal cells of the LVE. Therefore, vitamin C is essential for the maintenance of the SVZ cell populations required for normal activity of the SVZ neurogenic niche in the adult guinea pig brain. Based on our results from the guinea pig brain, we postulate that vitamin C deficiency could also affect neurogenesis in the human brain.

AB  - Simple Summary The development of ovarian follicles is mainly regulated by the follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) released by the pituitary gland. FSH acts on the granulosa cell receptor FSHR to regulate oocyte development, follicular maturation, and ovulation. In this study, the optimal dose of FSH for promoting granulosa cells was explored by combining massively parallel sheep genome CRISPR-Cas9 knockout screening and transcriptome analysis. The CRISPR-Cas9 knockout libraries were designed on Chr 2, 3 and X and the sheep granulosa cell libraries were knocked out. This may be the first time that two methods have been combined to identify new FSH-responsive genes and pathways not foreseen in previous studies.Abstract Follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) regulates ovarian follicle development through specific gene expression programs. Granulosa cells (GCs) are somatic cells surrounding the oocytes, secreting gonadotropins to regulate ovulation and promote follicular development. By analyzing the effects of different doses of FSH on the proliferation of GCs, we found that adding 10 ng/mL of FSH, as the optimal concentration, could promote the growth of GCs. Furthermore, we have successfully constructed the first CRISPR-Cas9 knockout library targeting the genes on chromosomes 2 and 3 and the X chromosomes of the sheep massively parallel coding gene, as well as an ovarian GCs knockout cell library. For the first time, we have exposed the knockout cell library to a concentration of 10 ng/mL FSH to explore the underlying mechanisms. Through this screening, we have identified 836 positive-negative screening genes that are responsive to FSH, thereby revealing the regulatory mechanisms and screening the functionality of candidate genes. Next, RNA-Seq of control (0 ng/mL), low (10 ng/mL), and high (100 ng/mL) doses of FSH revealed 1708 differentially expressed genes, and combined with 836 genes, we obtained 129 FSH dose-dependent genes with extremely significant differences. This enables us to delve deeper into investigating and identifying the mechanisms by which FSH regulates GCs. More generally, we have discovered new regulatory factors and identified reproductivity-associated major effectors. These findings provide novel research directions for further studies on sheep reproduction.

AB  - Previously we showed that Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS) of the dorsal region (DRD) and of the lateral wings of the dorsal raphe (lwDR) respectively decreases anxiety and panic-like responses in the elevated T-maze (ETM). This study investigates neurobiological alterations which might respond for these behavioral effects. Male Wistar rats were submitted to high-frequency stimulation (100 mu A, 100 Hz) of the DRD or of the lwDR for 1 h, and subsequently tested in the avoidance or escape tasks of the ETM. Since serotonin (5-HT) reuptake inhibitors are first line pharmacological treatment for anxiety disorders, we also tested the effects of chronic fluoxetine administration (10 mg/kg, IP, 21 days) on a separate group of rats. An open field was used for locomotor activity assessment. Additionally, we evaluated c-Fos immunoreactivity (Fos-ir) in serotonergic cells of the dorsal raphe (DR). Results showed that DBS of the DRD decreases avoidance reactions, an anxiolytic-like effect, without altering escape or locomotor activity. Both fluoxetine and DBS of the lwDR decreased escape responses in the ETM, a panicolytic-like effect, without altering avoidance measurements or locomotor activity. While DBS of the DRD decreased double immunostaining in the DRD, DBS of the lwDR increased Fos-ir and double immuno-staining in the DRD and lwDR. Fluoxetine also increased double immunostaining in the lwDR and in the DRV but decreased it in the DRD. These results suggest that both the anxiolytic and panicolytic-like effects of DBS and fluoxetine are related to 5-HT modulation in different subnuclei of the DR.

AB  - Simple Summary The conditions and management practices imposed during mating can influence the success of a sheep production enterprise. However, the impact of mating practices across southern Australian sheep production systems are relatively unknown. Mating liveweight and body condition score data were collected at mating from four sheep breeds and during three seasons of mating across southern Australia. Further, the seasonal conditions during mating were ranked by the producers and ram percentage and region were also recorded. Bayesian Network analysis was used to explore the relationships between these variables and pregnancy and fetal number at scanning. The results of this survey study emphasize the interrelatedness of the explored mating conditions and practices and the importance of understanding their interactions for optimizing sheep reproduction and nutrition from mating. Sheep production in southern Australia may vary by breed, time of year, production output (wool, meat, or both), region and seasonal influence. Sheep producers with flocks of approximately 300-500 ewes (n = 58) were recruited across southern Australia to take part in a survey and mating variables were collected from over 30,000 ewes between October 2020 and August 2021. A Bayesian Network (BN) was developed to identify the interrelatedness and most influential variable on pregnancy and fetal number (of pregnant ewes) outcomes under different scenarios. The BN analysis indicated a low association between the variables explored, however, were breed dependent. In wool-based breeds a mating liveweight of 60-69.5 kg predicted the lowest non-pregnant and greatest number of fetuses, and in shedding ewes 70-79.5 kg predicted the lowest non-pregnant rate and 90-99.5 kg the greatest number of fetuses. Pregnancy rate and fetuses per ewe were optimized at ram percentages of 1.5% for Composite and Merino ewes and 2% for Maternal ewes. A mating BCS 4 resulted in greatest pregnancy rate and number of fetuses across all breeds. Curvilinear relationships between mating liveweight, BCS and ram percentage were observed with pregnancy rate and fetal number. Practically, reproductive potential is best managed on a breed basis and with consideration of all variables explored.

AB  - Processing and selection of fruits and vegetables generate high quantities of wastes that represent an economic and environmental issue for the agroindustry sector. According to the so-called "biorefinery " approach, this biomass can be exploited for the recovery of value-added molecules. In this study, the residues of industrial processing of tomato (Lycopersicon esculentum variety "Hybrid Rome "), fennel (Foeniculum vulgare), potato (Solanum tuberosum) and carrot (Daucus carota) were used as sole carbon sources to support cheap and sustainable microbial growth as well as the production of secondary metabolites (hydrogen and ethanol) by Thermoanaerobacterium thermostercoris strain BUFF, a thermophilic anaerobic microorganism isolated from buffalo-dung compost. Moreover, the use of hemicellulolytic enzymes of T. thermostercoris was assayed in the bioconversion reaction of the polymer fraction extracted from the rhizome of giant reed (Arundo donax) and of the leaves and stems of cardoon (Cynara cardunculus), dedicated non-food crops employed in energy supply.

AB  - This study was conducted through in vivo and in vitro experiments and aimed to reveal the regulatory effect of water extract of Artemisia annua L. (WEAA) on the antioxidant function of mutton sheep and the underlying mechanism. In the in vivo experiment, 32 Dorper x Han female sheep (3 months old; avg. body weight: 24 +/- 0.09 kg) were allocated to four groups (eight lambs/group) and fed a diet containing 0, 500, 1000, and 1500 mg/kg WEAA, respectively. In the in vitro experiments, peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBLs) were cultured with different doses of WEAA (0, 25, 50, 100, 200, 400 mu g/mL) to determine the optimal concentration, followed by a 2 x 2 factorial experiment with four treatment groups (six replicates per treatment group): the ML385(-)/WEAA(-) group, the ML385(-)/WEAA(+) group, the ML385(+)/WEAA(-) group, and the ML385(+)/WEAA(+) group. The results showed that WEAA supplementation dose-dependently increased serum, liver and spleen tissue total antioxidant capacity, glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px), and catalase (CAT) activity while reducing malondialdehyde level (p < 0.05). Moreover, WEAA supplementation significantly upregulated the liver and spleen expression of nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2, superoxide dismutase 2, GSH-Px, CAT and NAD(P)H quinone dehydrogenase 1 (p < 0.05) while significantly downregulating the kelch-like ECH associated protein 1 expression in a dose-dependent manner (p < 0.05), thereby activating the Keap1/Nrf2 pathway with the peak effect observed in the 1000 mg/kg WEAA group. Additionally, supplementation with 100 <mu>g/mL of WEAA had significant antioxidation activity in the culture medium of PBLs. Its action mechanism involved the Keap1/Nrf2 pathway; specifically, WEAA exerted its antioxidant effect by upregulating the gene expression related to the Keap1/Nrf2 pathway. In conclusion, WEAA enhances sheep's antioxidant capacity by up-regulating Keap1/Nrf2 pathway genes and boosting antioxidant enzyme activity. The results provided experimental support for the potential application of WEAA in intensive mutton sheep farming.

AB  - The tobacco cutworm, Spodoptera litura, is one of the most important agricultural insect pests. Plant essential oils can be considered potential candidates for eco-friendly control agents, as they exhibit insecticidal and feeding deterrent activity. The present study investigated the antifeedant and insecticidal activity of 29 essential oils. Their potential for habituation and association with the gustatory sensilla were also examined. In no-choice tests and contact-fumigation bioassays on third instar larvae, clove bud, fennel sweet, and lemongrass oils exhibited notable activities. Still, no direct correlation between insecticidal activity and feeding deterrence was observed. Second instar larvae were pre-exposed to those active oils to test the habituation effect. Larvae reared with lemongrass and clove bud oils showed gustatory habituation, whereas those with fennel sweet oil did not show any desensitization compared to the control. Comparable outcomes were observed in individuals exposed to the main constituents of the three oils. Additionally, the mixture of fennel sweet and clove bud oils showed a synergistic feeding deterrent effect. However, although statistically insignificant, potential habituation for the mixture was observed, and only robust inhibition of habituation was expected at physiologically high concentrations (FDI90 + FDI90). Electrophysiological studies showed that the response of the maxillary palp to citral decreased in the experienced group, while to trans-anethole, it was maintained at levels similar to the naive group. The reduction in feeding deterrence corresponded to the repeated exposure and desensitization of the maxillary palp, varying with the types of essential oils.

AB  - Estradiol is a steroid hormone excreted from the female gonads, mainly during the pre-estrus. However, the potential effects of estradiol are yet to be explored on sperm parameters through cryopreservation. In this study, we supplemented estradiol, 3 and 5 mu M, in the goat semen extender and assessed the sperm parameters after a freeze-thawing process. Sperm motility was assessed using the computer-assisted sperm analysis system. Sperm viability and membrane integrity improved using both 3 and 5 mu M concentrations of estradiol. The highest rate of progressive motility was observed in the 3 mu M estradiol group. However, a higher concentration of estradiol (5 mu M) reduced the progressive motility. Then, we were interested to see if the supportive effect of estradiol on sperm motility is mediated through the intracellular concentration of calcium ionophore. We supplemented the semen extender with 1 and 10 mM ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) and showed that 1 mM has no adverse effect on progressive sperm motility. Then, estradiol (3 mu M) was supplemented with or without EDTA (1 mM) into the semen extender. Individual EDTA treatment improved the progressive sperm motility compared to the control group. However, in the presence of estradiol, EDTA treatment reduced the progressive motility compared to the individual estradiol group. This indicated a considerable interaction between estradiol and EDTA for progressive sperm motility. Indeed, EDTA reduced the supportive effects of estradiol on sperm cryopreservation parameters. These results indicated that induction of higher progressive sperm motility in response to estradiol is a calcium-dependent process, as the EDTA did completely abrogate the estradiol-mediated effect.

AB  - Tau is typically an axonal protein, but in neurons of brains affected by Alzheimer's disease (AD), aggregation of hyperphosphorylated tau in the somatodendritic compartment causes neuronal death. We have previously demonstrated that tau mRNA is transported within dendrites and undergoes immediate translation and hyperphosphorylation of AD epitopes in response to NMDA receptor stimulation. Although this explains the emergence of hyperphosphorylated tau in dendrites, the relationship between tau hyperphosphorylation and aggregation is not well understood. In this study, we found that recombinant highly phosphorylated tau purified from NG10815 rodent neuroblastoma/glioma cells transfected with both tau and GSK3(3 expression vectors bound calcium ions and formed sarkosyl-insoluble aggregates. In addition, thioflavin T analysis revealed that this highly phosphorylated tau tended to aggregate on its own, further facilitated by calcium ions. When NG108-15 cells expressing the highly phosphorylated tau were treated with calcium ionophore, sarkosyl-insoluble tau was generated. Interestingly, these cells exhibited resistance to both calcium ionophore-induced cytotoxicity and glutamate-induced excitotoxicity. We further found that sarkosyl-insoluble phosphorylated tau was increased in cultured hippocampal neurons due to glutamate-induced hyperactivity. Our data suggest that hyperphosphorylated tau synthesized in response to NMDA receptor stimulation contributes to regulation of neuronal activity by binding calcium ions, but that this calcium binding may cause tau to adopt an aggregated form.

AB  - Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a long-term delayed mental disorder caused by sudden, threatening or catastrophic life events. Chlorogenic acid (CGA) is a polyphenolic acid rich in Eucommia ulmoides and other plants with potential neuroprotective effects, effectively enhances learning and memory, and exerts a beneficial impact on improving mood and attention. However, the effects and mechanisms of CGA on PTSD-like behaviors remain uncertain. This study is to explore the effects and mechanisms of CGA on PTSD by using network pharmacology analysis, molecular docking and experimental validation, and try to provide new strategies for the treatment of PTSD. The results indicated that 9 core targets with a strong binding affinity with CGA were screened out, and they were mainly enriched in apoptosis, inflammation, and oxidative stress. The followed vivo experiments indicated that CGA could alleviate single prolonged stress (SPS)-induced PTSD-like behaviors, and improve hippocampal pathological damage, apoptosis and synaptic plasticity through antioxidant and antiinflammatory effects by regulating Nrf2 and NF-kappa B pathways. Thus, CGA may inhibit hippocampal neuronal apoptosis, reduce neuroinflammatory and oxdiative stress response, and enhance hippocampal synaptic plasticity through regulating the crosstalk between Nrf2 and NF-kappa B signaling pathway, thereby improving SPS-induced PTSD-like behaviors.

AB  - The increasing need for new treatments for obesity and diabetes has led to the development of new drugs and food supplements that could reduce carbohydrate absorption. Many starch blockers, based on common bean proteinaceous inhibitors against alpha-amylase (alpha-AI), are already present on the market. The extraction and purification of alpha-amylase inhibitor from a promising common bean cultivar from Sardinia (Nieddone) is described, highlighting the unique value of the Nieddone cultivar, particularly for its inhibitory activity on digestive enzymes and its complete lack of a hemagglutination effect on human red blood cells. The purification of alpha-AI involved two chromatographic steps (IEC and SEC) and was essential for revealing certain properties of the inhibitor. The purified inhibitor has a tetrameric structure (alpha(2)beta(2)) and a molecular weight of approximately 42 kDa, as determined by SEC and SDS-PAGE, confirming it as a lectin-like inhibitor. The identification of the alpha-AI sequence was obtained by bottom-up high-resolution mass spectrometry, which allowed us to identify a unique peptide from the alpha chain and six unique peptides from the beta chains. alpha-AI exhibited an optimum temperature of around 40 degrees C and two pH optima at 5 and 6.5, respectively. Its remarkable stability at high temperatures was measured (approximately 25% of activity retained even after 5 h at 100 degrees C), whereas the raw extract lost its activity entirely after just 10 min at 90 degrees C. Thus, the purification process significantly enhances the thermal stability of alpha-AI. The demonstrated effectiveness of the purified alpha-AI against the alpha-amylase enzyme in pigs, humans and insects underscores the protein's potential for treating obesity and diabetes, as well as for managing insect pests.

AB  - Social deprivation can be stressful for group-living mammals. On the other hand, an amazing response of these animals to stress is seeking social contact to give and receive joint protection in threatening situations. We explored the effects of social isolation and social support on epigenetic and behavioral responses to chronic stress. More specifically, we investigated the behavioral responses, corticosterone levels, BDNF gene expression, and markers of hippocampal epigenetic alterations (levels of H3K9 acetylation and methylation, H3K27 methylation, HDAC5, DNMT1, and DNMT3a gene expressions) in middle-aged adult rats maintained in different housing conditions (isolation or accompanied housing) and exposed to the chronic unpredictable stress protocol (CUS). Isolation was associated with decreased basal levels of corticosterone, impaired long-term memory, and decreased expression of the BDNF gene, besides altering the balance of H3K9 from acetylation to methylation and increasing the DNMT1 gene expression. The CUS protocol decreased H3K9 acetylation, besides increasing H3K27 methylation and DNMT1 gene expression, but had no significant effects on memory and BDNF gene expression. Interestingly, the effects of CUS on corticosterone and HDAC5 gene expression were seen only in isolated animals, whereas the effects of CUS on DNMT1 gene expression were more pronounced in isolated than accompanied animals. In conclusion, social isolation in middle age showed broader effects than chronic un-predictable stress on behavioral and epigenetic alterations potentially associated with decreased BDNF expres-sion. Moreover, social support prevented the adverse effects of CUS on HPA axis functioning, HDAC5, and DNMT1 gene expressions.

AB  - Muscle mass development depends on increased protein synthesis and reduced muscle protein degradation. Muscle ring-finger protein-1 (MuRF1) plays a key role in controlling muscle atrophy. Its E3 ubiquitin ligase activity recognizes and degrades skeletal muscle proteins through the ubiquitin-proteasome system. The loss of Murf1, which encodes MuRF1, in mice leads to the accumulation of skeletal muscle proteins and alleviation of muscle atrophy. However, the function of Murf1 in agricultural animals remains unclear. Herein, we bred F1 generation Murf1(+/-) and F2 generation Murf1(-/-) Duroc pigs from F0 Murf1(-/-) pigs to investigate the effect of Murf1 knockout on skeletal muscle development. We found that the Murf1(+/-) pigs retained normal levels of muscle growth and reproduction, and their percentage of lean meat increased by 6% compared to that of the wild type (WT) pigs. Furthermore, the meat color, pH, water-holding capacity, and tenderness of the Murf1(+/-) pigs were similar to those of the WT pigs. The drip loss rate and intramuscular fat decreased slightly in the Murf1(+/-) pigs. However, the cross-sectional area of the myofibers in the longissimus dorsi increased in the adult Murf1(+/-) pigs. The skeletal muscle proteins MYBPC3 and actin, which are targeted by MuRF1, accumulated in the Murf1(+/-) and Murf1(-/-) pigs. Our findings show that inhibiting muscle protein degradation in MuRF1-deficient Duroc pigs increases the size of their myofibers and their percentage of lean meat without influencing their growth or pork quality. Our study demonstrates that Murf1 is a target gene for promoting skeletal muscle hypertrophy in pig breeding.

AB  - Camellia sinensis (L.) is widely cultivated in China and other countries as an economically important tree and supplies unique nutrients to ensure the development of Apis cerana cerana and Apis mellifera ligustica colonies in early spring in southern China. A. c. cerana was domesticated in China many years ago and exhibits a smaller body size, smaller colony size and some distinct physiology and behavior compared to A. m. ligustica. Here, to explore the changes in gene expression induced by C. sinensis in A. c. cerana and A.m. ligustica, we performed transcriptomic analysis of the 1st-instar, 5th-instar, 1st-adult and 7th-adult stages of the two species fed the nectar and pollen of C. sinensis. A total of 489, 1190, 991 and 243 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified in the four developmental stages of A. m. ligustica, and 995, 2785, 1513 and 213 DEGs were found in the corresponding stages of A. c. cerana. The changes in the gene expression profile were more significant in the 5th-instar and 1st-adult. Furthermore, the upregulated genes in the 5th-instar and 1st-adult were mainly enriched in pathways involved in growth- and development-related pathway: Hippo signaling pathway. In addition to the upregulated DEGs, growth- and development-related pathways, including the Wnt signaling pathway, Hedgehog signaling pathway-fly, and FoxO signaling pathway, were enriched in A. c. cerana. Finally, we hypothesized that C. sinensis pollen is beneficial to the growth and development of honeybees and give rise to diverse corresponding regulation to A. c. cerana than to A. m. ligustica.

AB  - Host plants have an effect on the susceptibility of lepidopteran insects to nucleopolyhedrovirus (NPV), but the role of the protein in peritrophic membrane (PM) of larvae has not been investigated. We determined a key PM gene (SeIIM8 gene) in Spodoptera exigua (Hubner), which plays a role in protecting against NPV infection. Then we quantified the activity of chitin synthase (SeCHS), the content of insect intestinal mucin (SeIIM) and the expression of their genes in S. exigua fed one of four foods (artificial diet, Brassica oleracea (L.), Glycine max (L.), or Ipomoea aquatica (Forsskal)) with or without inoculation of Spodoptera exigua multiple nucleopolyhedrovirus (SeMNPV). Our results showed that the larval mortality was highest for NPV-infected with siRNA-injected larvae, intermediate for NPV-infected larvae, and lowest for uninfected larvae. The SeCHS activity, SeIIM content, and their relative gene expressions of S. exigua fed G. max or artificial diet were lower compared to caterpillars fed other diets. The relative SeCHS and SeIIM8 gene expression levels of larvae depended on the interaction of NPV treatment, diet, and time. This study concluded that plants affected the susceptibility of insects to NPV by altering the enzyme activity and gene expression of insects.

AB  - Herein, marble tailings (MTs) were used as mineral filler to prepare polyvinyl chloride (PVC) based composite plates. In order to improve the toughness of MTs/PVC composites, chlorinated polyethylene (CPE), methyl methacrylate butadiene styrene (MBS), ethylene-vinyl acetate copolymer (EVA), and polyolefin elastomer (POE) were adopted to investigate the toughening effects on the performance of MTs/PVC composites. The results show that incorporation of tougheners in MTs/PVC composite enhances restraint on the movement of PVC molecular chain segments, leading to the decrease of energy storage modulus and loss factor. Although these four tougheners decrease tensile strength and flexural properties of MTs/PVC composite plates, they significantly increase notched impact strength. In particular, the impact strength of MTs/PVC composite is improved by nearly 179% via using CPE toughener. Taken together, CPE not only presents the relatively most excellent rheological properties for MTs/PVC composites, but also increases toughness to the maximum extent without significantly reducing the tensile strength and flexural properties of MTs/PVC composites. Hence, a pilot testing was carried out to produce CPE-MTs/PVC composite hollow flooring. This work points out an effective resource utilization direction for the marble tailings, and it provides a reference for industrial application of MTs/PVC composite in construction and building engineering.

AB  - Background/Objectives: Early postmortem mitochondrial function and apoptotic activation affect meat quality development. Nicotinamide riboside (NR) supplementation to pigs prior to harvest can improve pork color stability, but its mechanism remains unclear. This study aimed to evaluate the impact of NR supplementation on early postmortem mitochondrial functionality and apoptosis. Methods: Sixteen pigs (N = 16) were individually fed a control or NR-supplemented diet (30 mg.kg body weight(-1).d(-1)) for 10 days prior to harvest. Longissimus dorsi muscle samples were collected at 45 min and 24 h postmortem and analyzed for mitochondrial functionality using high-resolution respirometry and apoptotic protein abundance (apoptosis regulator Bcl-2-associated X (BAX), apoptotic inducing factor (AIF), and caspase 3 (CASP3)) via immunoblotting. Results: NR-supplemented muscle exhibited lower proton leak-associated respiration at 45 min postmortem (p < 0.05), followed by a slower accumulation of mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization (MOMP; p < 0.05) and a slower loss of mitochondrial integral function (p < 0.05) from 45 min to 24 h postmortem. NR supplementation decreased BAX abundance at 45 min postmortem but increased mature AIF abundance (62 kDa) at 24 h postmortem (p < 0.05). The abundance of CASP3 fragments (similar to 29 kDa) decreased from 45 min to 24 h postmortem, independent of treatment (p < 0.05). Conclusions: NR supplementation demonstrated the potential to protect mitochondrial integral function and alleviate apoptotic activation in early postmortem porcine skeletal muscle, which might contribute to a higher meat color stability in NR-supplemented pork during retail display.

AB  - Inflammation plays a key role in the pathogenesis of the major depressive disorder. Namely, neuroinflammation can induce the production of neuroactive metabolites that interfere with N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors (NMDAR)-mediated glutamatergic neurotransmission and contribute to depressive-like behaviour. On the other hand, mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) activity with synaptogenic effects is the main mediator of an-tidepressant effects of several potent NMDAR antagonists. In this study, we investigated the specific role of GluN2A subunits of NMDAR on the activity of mTOR signaling and behaviour in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-in-duces model of depression. The results showed that mice lacking GluN2A subunit did not display depressive-like behavior after the immune challenge, opposite to LPS-treated wild-type mice. Specifically, in GluN2A knockout mice, we estimated the activity of the mTOR pathway in the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex (PFC) by measuring synaptic levels of upstream regulators (p-Akt, p-ERK, and p-GSK3 beta) and downstream effectors (p-mTOR, and p-p70S6K) of mTOR activity. In addition, we assessed the changes in the levels of two important synaptic markers, GluA1 and PSD-95. Contrary to downregulated mTOR signaling and decreased synaptic markers in LPS-treated wild-type animals, the resilience of GluN2A KO mice to depressive-like behaviour was paralleled with sustained mTOR signaling activity synaptic stability in hippocampus and PFC. Finally, we dis-closed that resistance of GluN2A knockouts to LPS-induced depressive-like behavior was ERK-dependent. These findings demonstrate that GluN2A-ERK-mTOR signaling is a vulnerability factor of inflammation-related depressive behaviour, making this signaling pathway the promising target for developing novel antidepressants.

AB  - Elongation of pig conceptuses is a dynamic process, requiring adequate nutrient provisions. Glutamine is used as an energy substrate and is involved in the activation of mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) during porcine preimplantation development. However, the roles of glutamine have not been extensively studied past the blastocyst stage. Therefore, the objective of the current study was to determine if glutaminase (GLS), which is the rate-limiting enzyme in glutamine metabolism, was necessary for conceptus elongation to proceed and was involved in mTORC1 activation. The CRISPR/Cas9 system was used to induce loss-of-function mutations in the GLS gene of porcine fetal fibroblasts. Wild type (GLS(+/+)) and knockout (GLS(-/-)) fibroblasts were used as donor cells for somatic cell nuclear transfer, and GLS(+/+) and GLS(-/-) blastocyst-stage embryos were transferred into surrogates. On day 14 of gestation, GLS(+/+) conceptuses primarily demonstrated filamentous morphologies, and GLS(-/-) conceptuses exhibited spherical, ovoid, tubular, and filamentous morphologies. Thus, GLS(-/-) embryos were able to elongate despite the absence of GLS protein and minimal enzyme activity. Furthermore, spherical GLS(-/-) conceptuses had increased abundance of transcripts related to glutamine and glutamate metabolism and transport compared to filamentous conceptuses of either genotype. Differences in phosphorylation of mTORC1 components and targets were not detected regarding conceptus genotype or morphology, but abundance of two transcriptional targets of mTORC1, cyclin D1, and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator 1-alpha was increased in spherical conceptuses. Therefore, porcine GLS is not essential for conceptus elongation and is not required for mTORC1 activation at this developmental timepoint.
   Summary sentence
   Knocking out glutaminase in porcine embryos does not prevent development to the blastocyst stage nor elongation of the conceptus to a filamentous morphology.

AB  - Mylodontidae (Mammalia, Xenarthra) is a family of ground sloths widely distributed in the South American fossil record, with members also present in Central and North America. Within the Mylodontidae, Lestodon armatus is the largest species, with an estimated body mass of more than three tonnes. This work focuses on the enlarged lower caniniforms of L. armatus as possibly exaggerated sexually dimorphic structures. Lower caniniforms from the late Pleistocene of Argentina, Uruguay, and Bolivia were studied using specimens from seven palaeontological collections. The possible sexual dimorphism in the caniniforms and its implications regarding the existence of sexual selection was assessed through morphometric analyses. The results support the existence of sexual dimorphism in L. armatus. Sexual dimorphism in an exaggerated structure in a large mammal suggests the existence of sexual selection, via competition between males or female mate choice, resulting in the evolution of the dimorphic structure. In L. armatus, the enlarged caniniforms would correspond to males and could have functioned as armaments in intraspecific fights or ornaments for sexual display. Based on observations in extant mammals, a polygynous mating system is proposed as highly probable in L. armatus, although the existence or composition of social groups cannot be certainly determined.

AB  - Urban sprawl, increased traffic and modern forestry, as well as the globalisation of agriculture, have increasingly been affecting the landscape and its quality as habitat for species especially since the middle of the last century. Still, there are hardly any methods nor indicators which can measure the quality of the landscape for species over a long period. In this study, we investigated the influence of landscape structure and landscape quality on harvest data of 28 game spe-cies in South Tyrol, Italy, over the last 150 years. The harvest data were used to assess the population dynamics of in-dividual species and habitat guilds since 1870. As a first result, we could show, on the examples of six species, that count population data were highly correlated with harvest data and are therefore well suited to estimate their population size. Second, the populations of ungulates con-sistently increased during the study period. The numbers of mesocarnivores as well as smaller forest and alpine game species increased strongly until the 1970s/80s of the last century, followed by a decline. The populations of farmland species and some synanthropic species have decreased substantially, and some species have even disappeared completely. Based on these results, we were able to show, in a third step, that the landscape quality for game species in South Tyrol has developed differently: In particular, the agriculturally used habitats have lost quality, whereas for-ests and alpine regions have initially gained quality due to the extensification of use; during the last five decades, the quality decreases again, at least for small game species. Our results thus provide concrete implications for the active improvement of the landscape quality for farmland and forest species, as well as indications for future priorities in funding support of alpine pasture management.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to determine effects of various sources of omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids on ovarian response and embryo quality in Boer does when there was a superovulation treatment regimen imposed. Pluriparous does were randomly assigned to be treated with 300 g of one of four experimental supplements containing linseed oil (LO), soybean oil (SO), palm oil (PO), or a control supplement without fatty acids (CO), for 15 days. Does were fitted with a controlled internal drug release (CIDR) device containing 0.3 g progesterone for 7 days. At 48 h before CIDR withdrawal, does were treated with 80 mg follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) administered at 12 h intervals. Embryos were collected 7 days after the last natural mating. Estrous response and interval between CIDR withdrawals to estrous onset were similar between treatments (P > 0.05). Number of ovulations was similar for does in the different groups (10.0, 9.2, 7.0, and 7.0, in LO, SO, PO, and CO, respectively; P > 0.05). There was premature luteal regression in does of the SO, PO, and CO groups, except in LO group. The LO-treated does had a larger (P < 0.05) mean number of ova/embryos recovered than does of SO, PO, and CO groups (7.2, 2.0, 0.2, 0.2, respectively) and transferable embryos (5.1, 1.4, 0.2, 0.2, respectively). These results indicate that including LO in supplements may be a feasible strategy for preventing premature luteal regression and improving embryo quality in goats treated to induce follicular superstimulation for induction of superovulation.

AB  - Climate change-driven increases in air and sea temperaturesare rapidly thawing the Arctic cryosphere with potential for remobilizationand accumulation of legacy persistent organic pollutants (POPs) inadjacent coastal food webs. Here, we present concentrations of selectedPOPs in zooplankton (spatially and seasonally), as well as zoobenthos andsculpin (spatially) from Isfjorden, Svalbard. Herbivorous zooplanktoncontaminant concentrations were highest in May [e.g., n-ary sumation polychlorinatedbiphenyls (8PCB); 4.43, 95% CI: 2.72-6.3 ng/g lipid weight], coincidingwith thefinal stages of the spring phytoplankton bloom, and lowest inAugust ( n-ary sumation 8PCB; 1.6, 95% CI: 1.29-1.92 ng/g lipid weight) whenzooplankton lipid content was highest, and the fjord was heavily impactedby sediment-laden terrestrial inputs. Slightly increasing concentrations of alpha-hexachlorocyclohexane (alpha-HCH) in zooplankton fromJune (1.18, 95% CI: 1.06-1.29 ng/g lipid weight) to August (1.57, 95% CI: 1.44-1.71 ng/g lipid weight), alongside a higherpercentage of alpha-HCH enantiomeric fractions closer to racemic ranges, indicate that glacial meltwater is a secondary source of alpha-HCH to fjord zooplankton in late summer. Except for alpha-HCH, terrestrial inputs were generally associated with reduced POPconcentrations in zooplankton, suggesting that increased glacial melt is not likely to significantly increase exposure of legacy POPs in coastal fauna.

AB  - The diurnal activity budgets of giraffes were effectively studied from June 2012 until August 2013, in the Kalahari Region of southern Africa. Direct field observations identified how the daily activity budgets varied amongst the different subgroups of giraffes and the effects of seasonal changes and the time of the day. Feeding was the highest-performed activity whilst non-feeding activities were, however, also prominent. This study aimed to determine why giraffes are willing to sacrifice time on non-feeding activities. A deeper look into the social and non-feeding-related behaviour of giraffes might prove that giraffes devote significant time to various other activities to improve their health and comfort. It unveils trade-offs between digestion efficiency and foraging, impacting energy gain. Understanding this balance informs conservation strategies, habitat management and their well-being. Investigating the motivations behind these behavioural choices unveils adaptive mechanisms, shedding light on the intricate interplay between physiological and ecological needs, ultimately contributing to a holistic comprehension of giraffe's ecological roles and promoting their coexistence with their environment. Such investigations also aid in highlighting why giraffes' social structures should be considered as complex and why further research is needed to better understand these relationships, amongst subspecies.

AB  - Organochlorine pesticides are highly persistent environmental pollutants, generally shown to act through estrogen receptor alpha and alter estrogen biosynthesis. However, the molecular mechanism of regulation of estrogen biosynthesis by these pesticides is not clear. Estrogen is main female fertility hormone regulated by rate-limiting enzyme aromatase. It is encoded by the CYP19A1 gene, which is expressed using specific promoters. In the present study, the attempt has been made to elucidate the effect of dieldrin on the promoter-specific CYP19A1 gene expression and estrogen hormone production in buffalo granulosa cells. The buffalo granulosa cells were cultured and treated with dieldrin in a dose (100,150 and 200 ng/mL) and time (6, 12, and 24 h) dependent manner, followed by analysis of CYP19A1, promoter-specific CYP19A1 transcript expression, and estrogen production. Results showed that dieldrin significantly increased the expression of the CYP19A1 gene after 6 and 12 h while its expression was decreased after 24 h. To understand the upregulation of CYP19A1 gene, promoters' specific CYP19A1 transcript analysis was done. The finding showed that dieldrin significantly increased the proximal promoter specific CYP19A1 transcript while there was no effect on distal promoter specific CYP19A1 transcripts. This specific-promoter activity was quantified by chromatin immunoprecipitation assay (ChIP). Results confirmed the involvement of the proximal promoter in the overexpression of CYP19A1 gene. Furthermore, a significant increase in estradiol-17 beta level was also observed. Overall, the present study demonstrated the stimulatory effect of dieldrin on the CYP19A1 gene and will help to understand the toxicological role of dieldrin on the reproductive system.

AB  - Prolonged exposure to high-altitude environments may increase the risk of cognitive decline in young migrants. Recent studies suggest that hypobaric hypoxia-induced alterations in gut microbial composition could partly contribute to this risk. However, the absence of direct evidence from cohort studies and an unclear mechanism hinder intervention development based on this hypothesis. This study recruited 109 young male migrants living in Xizang to investigate the microbial mechanisms underlying cognitive impairment associated with high-altitude migration. Multi-omic analysis revealed distinct microbiome and metabolome features in migrants with cognitive decline, notably a reduced abundance of Clostridium species and disrupted fecal absorption of L-valine. Mechanistic studies showed that hypobaric hypoxia significantly damaged the intestinal barrier, leading to lipopolysaccharide (LPS) leakage and an influx of inflammatory factors into the peripheral blood, which activated microglia and caused neuronal injury in the hippocampus of mice. Additionally, compromised L-valine absorption due to intestinal barrier damage correlated with lower hippocampal glutamate levels and neurotrophic factors. Intervention with Clostridium sp. effectively restored the intestinal barrier and enhanced L-valine absorption, which mitigated hypobaric hypoxia-induced inflammation and hippocampal neural damage in mice. In conclusion, cognitive impairment among young migrants at high altitude may be attributed to hypobaric hypoxia-induced gut microbiota disruption and subsequent intestinal barrier dysfunction. This study may provide a promising approach for preventing and treating high-altitude-associated cognitive impairment.

AB  - The interplay between gut microbiota and host health is crucial for maintaining the overall health of the body and brain, and it is even more crucial how changes in the bacterial profile can influence the aftermath of traumatic brain injury (TBI). We studied the effects of probiotic treatment after TBI to identify potential changes in hepatic lipid species relevant to brain function. Bioinformatic analysis of the gut microbiota indicated a significant increase in the Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes ratio in the probiotic-treated TBI group compared to sham and untreated TBI groups. Although strong correlations between gut bacteria and hepatic lipids were found in sham mice, TBI disrupted these links, and probiotic treatment did not fully restore them. Probiotic treatment influenced systemic glucose metabolism, suggesting altered metabolic regulation. Behavioral tests confirmed memory improvement in probiotic-treated TBI mice. While TBI reduced hippocampal mRNA expression of CaMKII and CREB, probiotics reversed these effects yet did not alter BDNF mRNA levels. Elevated proinflammatory markers TNF-alpha and IL1-beta in TBI mice were not significantly affected by probiotic treatment, pointing to different mechanisms underlying the probiotic benefits. In summary, our study suggests that TBI induces dysbiosis, alters hepatic lipid profiles, and preemptive administration of Lactobacillus helveticus and Bifidobacterium longum probiotics can counter neuroplasticity deficits and memory impairment. Altogether, these findings highlight the potential of probiotics for attenuating TBI's detrimental cognitive and metabolic effects through gut microbiome modulation and hepatic lipidomic alteration, laying the groundwork for probiotics as a potential TBI therapy.

AB  - The electromagnetic field (EMF) is an environmental risk factor that may impair living organisms. This study aims to determine the functional effects of EMF exposure at 50 and 120 Hz for 2 or 4 h on estrogen synthesis and release in the endometrium. Endometrial slices were isolated from pigs (n = 5) during the peri-implantation period. To check whether progesterone (P-4) exerts any protective effects against EMF, selected EMF-treated slices were also treated with P-4. CYP19A3 mRNA transcript abundance was higher in slices exposed to EMF (50 Hz, 4 h) and treated with P-4. HSD17B4 mRNA transcript abundance was higher in slices exposed to EMF (50 and 120 Hz, 2 h) without P-4 treatment. Both EMF (50 Hz, 2 h) and EMF (50 and 120 Hz, 4 h) increased HSD17B4 mRNA transcript abundance in the presence of P-4; EMF (120 Hz, 2 h, and 50 Hz, 4 h) decreased cytochrome P450arom protein abundance in tissue slices not treated with P-4. Under exposure to EMF at 120 Hz (2 h), the abundance of hydroxysteroid 17 beta dehydrogenase decreased in P-4-treated slices and increased in slices not treated with P-4 (4 h). Progesterone treatment decreased the release of estradiol-17 beta (E-2) in endometrial slices exposed to EMF at 50 Hz (2 h), whereas in slices not treated with P-4, EMF (120 Hz, 2 h) increased estrone (E-1) release compared to control (without EMF). The EMF could disrupt the synthesis and release of E-1 and E-2 by the endometrium the

AB  - Aphids are one of the most important insect pests of wheat crop in all wheat growing regions of the world. Amongst various aphid species, the corn leaf aphid (Rhopalosiphum maidis F.) is considered one of the most destructive insect pests of wheat in the North Western Plains region of India. Transcriptome profiling of highly susceptible wheat Triticum durum genotype, A-9-30-1 and tolerant wheat Triticum aestivum genotype, HD2967 was performed to investigate aphid-host interactions. The results obtained from differential gene expression analysis of R. maidis on the highly susceptible genotype, A-9-30-1 plants, when compared with the tolerant genotype, HD2967, showed that 212 genes were significantly upregulated and 1009 genes were significantly downregulated. Our findings demonstrated that the genes associated with defense were significantly higher in response to R. maidis on HD2967 as compared to A-9-30-1. Additionally, various genes with physiological attributes were expressed during aphid attack. Based on gene ontology classification, three classifications, such as, cellular components (CC), molecular function (MF), and biological processes (BP) of sequences were identified. KEGG enrichment analysis revealed that twenty-five pathway genes were differentially expressed during the infestation of wheat with R. maidis. Notable changes were observed in A-9-30-1 and HD2967 transcriptomic profiling after infestation. The results obtained in the present study will help to elucidate the mechanism governing host-pest interaction and may lead to the development of new methods for increasing the resistance level of wheat against R. maidis, including over-expression of defense-related genes.

AB  - Autophagy is involved in aging-related cognitive impairment. Aerobic exercise training can improve cognitive function in the elderly and this effect may be associated with autophagic mechanisms and mitochondrial respiratory function. High intensity interval training (HIIT) has beneficial effects on heart and skeletal muscles by activating autophagy and/or mitophagy, but the effects of HIIT on autophagy/mitophagy in the aging brain are unknown. This study investigated the effects of HIIT on the mitochondrial respiratory complex and autophagy/ mitophagy, and its relation to brain function. Thirteen middle-aged male ICR mice underwent HIIT for 7 weeks. The exercise program reduced the spontaneous behavior and exploration activities of the mice. The phosphorylation level of cAMP response element binding protein (CREB) and the protein expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) decreased after the 7-week HIIT. Exercise downregulated the protein expression of Complex I and upregulated the protein expression of Complex III, Complex IV and Complex V. HIIT also decreased the expression of mitophagy-related proteins in the mitochondrial fractions of the hippocampus. However, HIIT did not change the expression of autophagy-related proteins LC3, P62, Atg5, Atg7, Beclin-1 and Lamp2 in the total lysate of the hippocampus. These data indicated that HIIT might have negative effects on the plasticity of the hippocampus in middle-aged mice. The effects may be related to the dysregulation of CREBBDNF signaling, mitochondrial respiratory complex and mitophagy induced by HIIT.

AB  - The investigation about the leaf wounding effect on plant physiological procedures and on leaf pigments content will contribute to the understanding of the plants' responses against this abiotic stress. During the experiment, some physiological parameters such as photosynthesis, transpiration and stomatal conductance as well as the chlorophyll and anthocyanin leaf contents of Ocimum basilicum, Salvia officinalis, and Mentha piperita plants were measured for about 20-40 days. All the measurements were conducted on control and wounded plants while in the latter, they were conducted on both wounded and intact leaves. A wide range of responses was observed in the wounded leaves, that is: (a) immediate decrease of the gas exchange parameters and long-term decrease of almost all the measured variables from O. basilicum, (b) immediate but only short-term decrease of the gas exchange parameters and no effect on pigments from M. piperita, and (c) no effect on the gas exchange parameters and decrease of the pigments content from S. officinalis. Regarding the intact leaves, in general, they exhibited a similar profile with the control ones for all plants. These results imply that the plant response to wounding is a complex phenomenon depending on plant species and the severity of the injury.

AB  - Shiftwork has been associated with elevated depressive symptoms; police officers frequently work shifts and may experience depressive symptoms. This study assessed the association between depressive symptoms and shiftwork in a police cohort from Buffalo, New York, USA using a repeated cross-sectional design with data collected in 2004-2009 (n = 428) and 2010-2014 (n = 261). Electronic payroll records were used to quantitatively classify officers on the day, evening, or night shift based on the shift they spent most of their working hours. Two self-reported depressive symptomology measures were used as outcomes - the Center for Epidemiological Studies - Depression (CES-D) scale and the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI). Repeated measures linear and logistic regression analyses were used to estimate least squares means or odds, respectively, of depressive symptom questionnaire scores by shiftwork category. Those working the evening/night shift had higher odds for depressive symptoms according to the BDI (based on a cut-point score of 14) than those working the day shift (OR = 4.60, 95% CI = 1.15-18.39). Similar results were observed for the evening shift group. No differences in mean CES-D or BDI scores were observed between groups for short-term shiftwork, long-term shiftwork, or shift changes. After stratifying by stress, as measured by the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS), total Impact of Events (IES), and the Spielberger Police Stress Survey (SPSS), mean values for depressive symptoms were higher in the high-stress categories regardless of shiftwork status. Further research should include biomarkers for depression, a longitudinal study design with a larger cohort, and joint effects of shiftwork and stress on depressive symptoms.

AB  - Personalized tissue engineered vascular grafts are a promising advanced therapy medicinal product alternative to autologous or synthetic vascular grafts utilized in blood vessel bypass or replacement surgery. We hypothesized that an individualized tissue engineered vein (P-TEV) would make the body recognize the transplanted blood vessel as autologous, decrease the risk of rejection and thereby avoid lifelong treatment with immune suppressant medication as is standard with allogenic organ transplantation. To individualize blood vessels, we decellularized vena cava from six deceased donor pigs and tested them for cellular removal and histological integrity. A solution with peripheral blood from the recipient pigs was used for individualized reconditioning in a perfusion bioreactor for seven days prior to transplantation. To evaluate safety and functionality of the individualized vascular graft in vivo, we transplanted reconditioned porcine vena cava into six pigs and analyzed histology and patency of the graft at different time points, with three pigs at the final endpoint 4-5 weeks after surgery. Our results showed that the P-TEV was fully patent in all animals, did not induce any occlusion or stenosis formation and we did not find any signs of rejection. The P-TEV showed rapid recellularization in vivo with the luminal surface covered with endothelial cells. In summary, the results indicate that P-TEV is functional and have potential for use as clinical transplant grafts.

AB  - There are limited reports about the effect of different heat treatments on the quality and flavor of Black Tibetan sheep meat. The current study examined the effect of pan-frying, deep-frying, baking, and boiling treatment on the quality of Black Tibetan sheep meat; the amino acid, fatty acid, and volatile flavor compounds (VFCs) were investigated by a texture analyzer, ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography (UHPLC), gas chromatography (GC), and headspace-gas chromatography-ion mobility (HS-GC-IMS). The key VFCs were identified through orthogonal partial least squares discrimination analysis (OPLS-DA), and variable importance projection (VIP) values. In addition, Pearson's correlations between meat quality parameters and key VFCs were examined. The sensory scores, including texture, color, and appearance, of baked and pan-fried meat were higher than those of deep-fried and boiled meat. The protein (40.47%) and amino acid (62.93 mu mol/g) contents were the highest in pan-fried meat (p < 0.05). Additionally, it contained the highest amounts of monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fatty acids, such as oleic, linoleic, and alpha-linolenic acids (p < 0.05). Meanwhile, pan-fried and deep-fried meat had higher amounts of VFCs than baked meat. The OPLS-DA similarity and fingerprinting analyses revealed significant differences between the three heat treatment methods. Aldehydes were the key aroma compounds in pan-fried meat. Importantly, 3-methylbutyraldehyde and 2-heptanone contents were positively correlated with eicosenoic, oleic, isooleic, linoleic, alpha-Linolenic, and eicosadiene acids (p < 0.05). To sum up, pan-fried Black Tibetan sheep meat had the best edible, nutritional, and flavor quality.

AB  - Gellan gum (GG) is a soft, tractable, and natural polysaccharide substrate used for cell incubation. In this study, we examined the effects of GG on porcine oocyte maturation. Cumulus cells and oocyte complexes (COCs) were collected from slaughterhouse-derived porcine ovaries and cultured on plastic plates containing 0.05% or 0.1% GG gels. The 0.1% GG gel improved the maturation rate and quality of blastocysts, as determined by the total cell number and the rate of abnormally condensed nuclei. GG gels have antioxidant abilities and oocytes cultured on GG gels (0.05% and 0.1%) have reduced reactive oxygen species (ROS) content. Furthermore, GG gels (0.05% and 0.1%) increased F-actin formation, whereas treatment of oocytes with H2O2 reduced F-actin levels. GG gels increased the ATP content in oocytes but did not affect the mitochondrial DNA copy number or mitochondrial membrane potential. In addition, the medium cultured on 0.05% GG increased the glucose consumption of COCs. In conclusion, GG gel reduced ROS content, increased energy content, and improved subsequent embryonic development in pigs.

AB  - The aim of this study was to determine the effect of nutrition and successive lactations on the content of selected chemical components and the fatty acid profile of sow milk. The chemical composition of milk samples collected from 108 PIC sows was evaluated. During the study, sows were allocated to two independent experiments. In Experiment I, sows were divided into three parity groups. In Experiment II, sows were divided into two groups based on the type of concen- trate included in the diet. In both experiments, the content of selected chemical components was determined in sow milk in view of the effect exerted by successive lactations (Experiment I, 54 animals) and nutrition (Experiment II, 54 animals). Milk samples were obtained by hand milking on lactation days 1 and 10, respectively. The samples were subjected to chemical anal- yses to determine their content of dry matter, total protein (Kjeldahl method), crude fat (Soxhlet extraction) and crude ash, and the fatty acid profile. Fat was extracted by the Soxhlet method. Fatty acids were separated and determined by gas chromatography in a gas chromatograph (CP-3800, Varian, Walnut Creek, California, USA). Fatty acid methyl esters (FAMEs) were prepared according to the modified Peisker method (methanol:chloroform:concentrated sulfuric acid, 100:100:1, v/v). Milk collected from sows fed diet 2 was characterized by higher concentrations of monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFAs), polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), unsaturated fatty acids (UFAs), hypocholesterolemic fatty acids (DFAs), n-3 and n-6 fatty acids, compared with milk collected from sows fed diet 1 that contained not only soybean oil but also hardened fish oil. Milk collected during the first and second lactation had higher fat content than milk collected during the third, fourth and subsequent lactations.

AB  - Hippophae rhamnoides L. (Elaeagnaceae), commonly known as "Sea buckthorn" and "Vitamin tree", is a spiny deciduous shrub whose fruit is known for its nutritional composition, such as vitamin C, and is consumed as a dietary supplement worldwide. As part of our ongoing efforts to identify structurally new and bioactive constituents from natural resources, the phytochemical investigation of the extract of H. rhamnoides fruits led to the isolation of one malate derivative (1), five citrate derivatives (2-6), and one quinate derivative (7). The structures of the isolated compounds were elucidated by analysis of 1D and 2D nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopic data and high-resolution electrospray ionization (HR-ESI) liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC/MS) data. Three of the citrate derivatives were identified as new compounds: (S)-1-butyl-5-methyl citrate (3), (S)-1-butyl-1'-methyl citrate (4), and (S)-1-methyl-1'-butyl citrate (6), which turned out to be isolation artifacts. The absolute configurations of the new compounds were established by quantum chemical electronic circular dichroism (ECD) calculation, which is an informative tool for verifying the absolute configuration of organic acid derivatives. The isolated compounds 1-7 were evaluated for their stimulatory effects on osteogenesis. Compounds 1, 3, 4, 6, and 7 stimulated osteogenic differentiation up to 1.4 fold, compared to the negative control. These findings provide experimental evidence that active compounds 1, 3, 4, 6, and 7 induce the osteogenesis of mesenchymal stem cells and activate bone formation.

AB  - Cold stress is one of the most important abiotic stresses affecting chickpea production in Northwestern India. Further, the short-duration varieties are more susceptible to cold injury as their reproductive phase coincides with the cold spell of this zone. So, enhancing the cold tolerance of the host plant is the only viable option to resolve this issue in chickpea. The present study involved a set of 13 advanced breeding lines (with differen-tial cold sensitivity) and three reference varieties (GPF2, PBG5, and PBG7) of chickpea which were exposed to cold stress at the reproductive stage under field conditions during the winters of 2019-20 and 2020-21. Various physiological and biochemical parameters such as proline, electrolyte leakage, photosynthetic pig-ments, lipid peroxidation, and 2, 2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) activity were measured before and after exposure to cold to delineate the mechanism of tolerance in these genotypes. Significant genotypic var-iations were observed for the above-mentioned traits in both years. The genotypes GL27059 P2, GL 28202-P1, and GL28202-P2 exhibited the highest lipid peroxidation and lesser magnitude of proline increase during reproductive cold stress on a pooled basis. These genotypes performed poorly for yield traits like pod set per-cent, filled pods plant (1), total seeds/ plant, and seed yield/plant and hence were susceptible to cold stress. Further, a significant reduction in reproductive function of male gametophyte i.e. pollen viability and pollen load under cold stress was also observed in these susceptible genotypes. In contrast, tolerant line GL29183-P2 had significantly more pollen load and pollen viability contributing to better yield performance (viz., higher flowers/plant, pods/plant, and maximum pod set percent) among the studied advanced breeding lines. Based upon the pooled analysis, the reference variety PBG5 outperformed in yield attributes i.e., total flower/ plant, total filled pods/plant, and had a significantly higher yield than GL29183 under cold stress at the early reproductive stage. A significant increment in levels of proline (125-160%) on exposure to cold spell was observed in genotypes, GL29183 and PBG5, which contribute toward cold tolerance. Thus, an increase in proline along with maintenance of pollen load can be used as prominent phenotypic markers in screening for cold tolerance at the reproductive stage in chickpea. (c) 2022 SAAB.

AB  - BACKGROUND Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) are soil-borne microorganisms that establish mutualistic associations with roots of most terrestrial plants. This symbiosis results in nutritional and defensive benefits to the host plant, usually conferring protection against biotic stresses, but its indirect impact on third trophic levels is still unknown. In the present work, we explore whether the symbiosis of tomato plants with Funneliformis mosseae (and/or exposition to herbivory) influences the interaction of the generalist pest Spodoptera exigua (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae) with bacterial (Bacillus thuringiensis) and viral (baculovirus, SeMNPV) natural entomopathogens. RESULTS Symbiosis with AMF and previous herbivory reduces the relative growth of S. exigua, increases its susceptibility to a sublethal dose of B. thuringiensis and has positive or neutral impact on the lethality of SeMNPV. Reduction of the phenoloxidase activity, a marker of the insect immune response, was associated with the larval feeding on plant material previously exposed to herbivory but not to the AMF. In addition, no changes in the insect gut microbiota could be associated with the observed changes in larval growth and susceptibility to the entomopathogens. CONCLUSION Our findings provide the first evidence of compatibility of AMF symbiosis in tomato with the use of bacterial and viral entomopathogens, contributing to the development of novel approaches to combine the beneficial effect of AMF and entomopathogens in biological pest control.

AB  - Many persons infected with HIV-1 (PWH) and opioid-dependent individuals experience deficits in sociability that interfere with daily living. Sociability is regulated by the prefrontal cortico-hippocampal-amygdalar circuit. Within this circuit HIV-1 trans-activator of transcription (HIV-1 Tat) and opioids can increase dendritic pathology and alter neuronal firing. Changes in sociability are also associated with dysregulation of hypothalamic neuropeptides such as oxytocin or corticotropin releasing factor (CRF) in the prefrontal cortico-hippocampalamygdalar circuit. Accordingly, we hypothesized that the interaction of HIV-1 Tat and morphine would impair inter-male social interactions and disrupt oxytocin and CRF within the PFC and associated circuitry. Male mice were exposed to HIV-1 Tat for 8 weeks and administered saline or escalating doses of morphine twice daily (s.c.) during the last 2 weeks of HIV-1 Tat exposure. Tat attenuated aggressive interactions with an unknown intruder, whereas morphine decreased both non-aggressive and aggressive social interactions in the residentintruder test. However, there was no effect of Tat or morphine on non-reciprocal interactions in the social interaction and novelty tests. Tat, but not morphine, decreased oxytocin levels in the PFC and amygdala, whereas both Tat and morphine decreased the percentage of oxytocin-immunoreactive neurons in the hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus (PVN). In Tat(+) or morphine-exposed mice, regional levels of CRF and oxytocin correlated with alterations in behavior in the social interaction and novelty tests. Overall, decreased expression of oxytocin in the prefrontal cortico-hippocampal-amygdalar circuit is associated with morphine- and HIV-Tatinduced deficits in social behavior.

AB  - Pre-adult conditioning on rearing hosts and adult conditioning on plant-herbivore cues can induce phenotypic plasticity in parasitoids. This is particularly important in pre-emptive biocontrol, when parasitoids may be mass reared on alternative hosts prior to the arrival of the target pest. We evaluated how rearing the egg parasitoid Trissolcus japonicus (Ashmed) (Hymenoptera: Scelionidae) on its exotic target host, Halyomorpha halys (St & aring;l), or on the alternative host, Dolycoris baccarum L. (both Hemiptera: Pentatomidae), affects its foraging behaviour. Parasitoid females were tested na & iuml;ve (without prior exposure to plant-host cues), or after one week of conditioning on a microcosm consisting of a Vicia faba L. plant continuously exposed to feeding by either stink bug. In the olfactometer, parasitoids reared on H. halys did not respond innately to either microcosm, but conditioned parasitoids were attracted to the same type of microcosm used for conditioning. Parasitoids reared on D. baccarum exhibited innate attraction to the corresponding microcosm, whereas conditioning induced positive response only to H. halys. In arrestment arena, T. japonicus preferred H. halys adult traces, regardless of the rearing host. Further studies should evaluate parasitoid responses in different ecologically relevant scenarios, also considering plants bearing stink bug eggs and the potential oviposition reward for parasitoids during conditioning. Our results suggest that, once pre-release approval is granted, T, japonicus can be reared on the alternative host in preparation for its release at the first detection of the target host, and that prior conditioning on host-associated cues would likely ensure parasitoid long-distance location of the target population.

AB  - In this study, we investigated the effect of a triple knockout of the genes alpha-1,3-galactosyltransferase (GGTA1), cytidine monophosphate-N-acetylneuraminic acid hydroxylase (CMAH), and alpha 1,3-galactosyltransferase 2 (A3GALT2) in Yucatan miniature pigs on human immune reactivity. We used the CRISPR/Cas9 system to create pigs lacking GGTA1 (GTKO) and GGTA1/CMAH/A3GALT2 triple gene knockout (TKO). The expression of all three xenoantigens was absent in TKO pigs, but there was no additional reduction in the level of Gal alpha 1,3Gal (alpha Gal) epitopes expression in the A3GALT2 gene KO. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), aorta endothelial cells (AECs), and cornea endothelial cells (CECs) were isolated from these pigs, and their ability to bind human IgM/IgG and their cytotoxicity in human sera were evaluated. Compared to wild type (WT) pigs, the level of human antibody binding of the PBMCs, AECs, and CECs of the transgenic pigs (GTKO and TKO) was significantly reduced. However, there were significant differences in human antibody binding between GTKO and TKO depending on the cell type. Human antibody binding of TKO pigs was less than that of GTKO on PBMCs but was similar between GTKO and TKO pigs for AECs and CECs. Cytotoxicity of transgenic pig (GTKO and TKO) PBMCs and AECs was significantly reduced compared to that of WT pigs. However, TKO pigs showed a reduction in cytotoxicity compared to GTKO pigs on PBMCs, whereas in AECs from both TKO and GTKO pigs, there was no difference. The cytotoxicity of transgenic pig CECs was significantly decreased from that of WT at 300 min, but there was no significant reduction in TKO pigs from GTKO. Our results indicate that genetic modification of donor pigs for xenotransplantation should be tailored to the target organ and silencing of additional genes such as CMAH or A3GALT2 based on GTKO might not be essential in Yucatan miniature pigs.

AB  - Cannabidiol (CBD), a non-psychotropic compound derived from Cannabis sativa, is known for its potential therapeutic effects on central nervous system (CNS) disorders. This study investigates the effects of chronic CBD administration on depressive and cognitive alterations induced by social isolation in male C57BL/6 mice. The experimental design involved adult mice subjected to either group housing or 12 weeks of social isolation. Behavioral assessments, including the sucrose preference test, open field test, light/dark box, novel object recognition, and tail suspension test, were performed to evaluate the impact of CBD on emotional and cognitive alterations. Additionally, hippocampal gene expression for cannabinoid type 1 receptors (CB1R), serotonin type 1 A receptors (5HT1AR), and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) were analyzed. Results indicate that CBD mitigated anhedonia in isolated mice and reduced immobility episodes in the TST. However, CBD did not exert significant anxiolytic effects and unexpectedly induced anxiety-like behavior in group-housed mice. The study also revealed that social isolation impaired recognition memory and reduced BDNF expression, while CBD treatment protected memory in isolated mice. These findings suggest that CBD has potential antidepressant and neuroprotective effects in social isolation-induced depressive models, although its anxiogenic effects in nonstressed mice warrant further investigation.

AB  - Introduction: Object-location memory (OLM) is essential for remembering the locations of objects within an environment and is often impaired in aging and neurodegenerative diseases. Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) has shown promise for improving OLM, although study outcomes have varied considerably. This study aimed to identify key brain regions involved in OLM that may serve as stimulation targets for future tDCS research and to assess the test-retest reliability (TRR) of both behavioral and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data. Methods: Twenty healthy young adults (10 females; mean age = 25.0 years, standard deviation [SD] = 5.56) completed two task-based fMRI sessions using parallel versions of an OLM task. Participants learned associations between house images and their locations on a two-dimensional street map across four feedback-based learning stages. Sham tDCS was administered in both sessions using a focal 3 x 1 electrode montage. TRR was assessed using intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) for behavioral performance and task-related fMRI activation. Results: Behavioral data showed significant improvements in response accuracy (estimate = 0.211, p < 0.001) and a reduction in response latency (estimate = -0.050, p < 0.001) across learning stages. fMRI analysis revealed predominantly right-lateralized activation, including the right hippocampus, the fusiform gyrus, the precuneus, and the lateral temporo-occipital areas. Behavioral measures showed moderate to good TRR (accuracy ICC = 0.801; reaction time ICC = 0.705). Task-related fMRI activity demonstrated good-to-excellent TRR in key regions, including the fusiform and temporo-occipital cortices. Conclusion: These findings support the validity of our OLM paradigm for assessing brain stimulation effects and highlight potential cortical targets for future tDCS interventions. The observed reliability of behavioral and neural measures further reinforces the utility of this protocol in crossover study designs.

AB  - Insect artificial diets are not only an important tool for mass rearing, nutritional research, and maintaining laboratory colonies but also for studying insect-plant interactions. For herbivorous insects able to sequester plant toxins, feeding and sequestration assays based on artificial diet allow for the investigation of physiological, ecological, and evolutionary questions which may be difficult to study using real plants representing complex chemical environments. We developed a simple artificial diet, consisting of sunflower meal pressed into pills, for the milkweed bugs Oncopeltus fasciatus (Dallas) and Spilostethus saxatilis (Scopoli) (Heteroptera: Lygaeidae), which are capable of sequestering cardenolides and colchicum alkaloids, respectively. We assessed insect performance, suitability of the diet for sequestration assays, and its shelf life. Compared to sunflower seeds which are widely used as a laboratory maintenance diet for milkweed bugs, no differences were found in terms of weight development, presence of deformities, speed of development, or mortality. Importantly, after feeding O. fasciatus and S. saxatilis sunflower pills enriched with crystalline ouabain (cardenolide) or colchicine (colchicum alkaloid), respectively, sequestration was observed in both species. Moreover, as a prerequisite to test ecological hypotheses, our method allows for adequate concentration control and homogenous distribution of toxins across the diet. Under relatively warm conditions (27 degrees C and 60% r.h.), the new diet was stable for up to 10 days when used for feeding assays with adult bugs. Therefore, studies focusing on the role of plant toxins in predator-prey interactions and plant defense, but also insecticide research could benefit from using this approach.

AB  - Probiotics and synbiotics supplementation have been shown to play potential roles in animal production. The present study aimed to evaluate the effects of dietary probiotics and synbiotics supplementation to sows during gestation and lactation and to offspring pigs (sow-offspring) on offspring pigs' growth performance and meat quality. Sixty-four healthy Bama mini-pigs were selected and randomly allocated into four groups after mating: the control, antibiotics, probiotics, and synbiotics groups. After weaning, two offspring pigs per litter were selected, and four offspring pigs from two litters were merged into one pen. The offspring pigs were fed a basal diet and the same feed additive according to their corresponding sows, representing the control group (Con group), sow-offspring antibiotics group (S-OA group), sow-offspring probiotics group (S-OP group), and sow-offspring synbiotics group (S-OS group). Eight pigs per group were euthanized and sampled at 65, 95, and 125 d old for further analyses. Our findings showed that probiotics supplementation in sow-offspring diets promoted growth and feed intake of offspring pigs during 95-125 d old. Moreover, sow-offspring diets supplemented with probiotics and synbiotics altered meat quality (meat color, pH(45min), pH(24h), drip loss, cooking yield, and shear force), plasma UN and AMM levels, and gene expressions associated with muscle-fiber types (MyHCI, MyHCIIa, MyHCIIx, and MyHCIIb) and muscle growth and development (Myf5, Myf6, MyoD, and MyoG). This study provides a theoretical basis for the maternal-offspring integration regulation of meat quality by dietary probiotics and synbiotics supplementation.

AB  - In the condensed liquid phase, both single- and multicomponent Lennard-Jones (LJ) systems obey the "hidden-scale-invariance" symmetry to a good approximation. Defining an isomorph as a line of constant excess entropy in the thermodynamic phase diagram, the consequent approximate isomorph invariance of structure and dynamics in appropriate units is well documented. However, although all measures of the structure are predicted to be isomorph invariant, with few exceptions only the radial distribution function (RDF) has been investigated. This paper studies the variation along isomorphs of the nearest-neighbor geometry quantified by the occurrence of Voronoi structures, Frank-Kasper bonds, icosahedral local order, and bond-orientational order. Data are presented for the standard LJ system and for three binary LJ mixtures (Kob-Andersen, Wahnstrom, NiY2). We find that, while the nearest-neighbor geometry generally varies significantly throughout the phase diagram, good invariance is observed along the isomorphs. We conclude that higher-order structural correlations are no less isomorph invariant than is the RDF.

AB  - The red palm weevil, Rhynchophorus ferrugineus, is a destructive, invasive pest to a diverse range of palm plantations globally. Commonly used broad-range chemical insecticides for insect control pose high risks to non-target organisms, humans, and the environment. A bio-rational approach of screening natural small-molecule inhibitors that specifically target R. ferrugineus proteins critical to its life processes can pave the way for developing novel bioinsecticides. Digestive enzymes (DEs), which impair feeding on plants (herbivory), are promising targets. We generated de novo transcriptomes, annotated DE-related genes from the R. ferrugineus gut and abdomen, manually annotated the DE gene family from the recently available genome and our transcriptome data, and reported 34 glycosidases, 85 lipases, and 201 proteases. We identified several tandem duplicates and allelic variants from the lipase and protease families, notably, 10 RferLip and 21 RferPro alleles, which emerged primarily through indels and single-site substitution. These alleles may confer enhanced digestive lipolysis and proteolysis. Phylogenetic analyses identified and classified different subfamilies of DEs and revealed close evolutionary relationships with other coleopterans. We assessed select candidate DEs' activity and the potential for inhibition in silico to better understand the herbivory arsenal. In silico analysis revealed that the selected enzymes exhibited similar ligand-binding affinity to their corresponding substrate, except for protease aminopeptidase N, RferPro40, which exhibited poorer affinity to the inhibitor bestatin. Overall, our study serves as a foundation for further functional analysis and offers a novel target for the development of a novel bio-rational insecticide for R. ferrugineus.

AB  - Integrated tick management (ITM) is a comprehensive strategy used to reduce presence of ticks and their associated pathogens. Such strategies typically employ a combination of host and non-host targeted treatments which often include fipronil-based, rodent-targeted bait boxes. Bait boxes target small-bodied rodents, specifically white-footed mice (Peromyscus leucopus Rafinesque) that not only play a crucial role in the blacklegged tick (Ixodes scapularis Say (Ixodida: Ixodidae)) life cycle, but also in the transmission of numerous pathogens, primarily Borrelia burgdorferi Johnson, Schmid, Hyde, Steigerwalt & Brenner (Spirochaetales: Spirochaetaceae), the causal agent of Lyme disease. This study aimed to determine the effect of bait box deployment configuration on tick burden reduction while also further exploring bait consumption and P. leucopus abundances as measures of bait box usage and effectiveness. Boxes were deployed on nine properties within each of six neighborhoods (n = 54) in two different configurations: grid and perimeter. Multiple factors were analyzed as potential predictors for reduction in tick burdens using a backward stepwise selection procedure. Results confirmed the perimeter configuration was a more effective deployment strategy. In addition, overall P. leucopus abundance was a significant predictor of tick burden reduction while bait consumption was not. These findings not only further support the recommended perimeter deployment configuration but provide insight into effective utilization in areas of high P. leucopus abundance. The identification of this significant relationship, in addition to configuration, can be utilized by vector control professionals and homeowners to make informed decisions on bait box placement to make sustained impacts on the I. scapularis vector and associated pathogens within an ITM framework.

AB  - The current study aimed to investigate the macro -micro mineral profile of four fodder trees (Salix nigra, Salix alba, Populus nigra, and Elaeagnus angustifolia) and two shrubs (Hippophae rhamnoides and Rosa webbiana) commonly utilized as livestock feed. A study was undertaken in three villages (Holshal, Broshal, and Hakalshal) of Hoper Valley, Gilgit- Baltistan, to determine the species and seasonal changes in macro and micro -mineral concentrations. Six composite samples from each village were collected across three seasons and measured via wet digestion. Except for sulfur (0.82%) in Salix alba, substantial amounts of macro -micro minerals of phosphorus (0.41), potassium (2.14), calcium (2.64%), zinc (217.5), and copper (11.63mg/kg DM) were identified in Populusnigra, whereas magnesium (0.45%), manganese (90.4), and iron (728.3 mg/kg DM) were found in Rosa webbiana. Phosphorus (0.54), potassium (1.87%), and copper (12.4 mg/kg DM) were found in high concentrations in the spring, while calcium (3.04), magnesium (0.34), sulfur (0.53%), zinc (102.0), manganese (69.6), and iron (514.1 mg/kg DM) were found in high concentrations in the autumn. The study suggests that the leaves from all fodder species should be mixed before being fed to ruminant animals to ensure the supply of all minerals in the ration. Mineral concentrations vary by species and season, necessitating a proper feed plan to meet the nutritional needs of ruminant animals, and local farmers should use diverse feeding strategies throughout the year.

AB  - This study aimed to investigate a new implantation site (intra-auricular subcutaneous - IA) compared to intramuscular (IM) in the cervical portion (cervical splenius muscle) of the neck for ovarian transplantation in goats. Morphological aspects of the implant, follicular activation and morphology, and type I and III collagen deposits of the transplanted tissue were evaluated. Four fragments of the ovarian cortex were allotransplanted at the IA and IM sites in all goat recipients and recovered 7 (IA-7; IM-7) or 15 (IA-15; IM-15) days later and submitted to histological analysis. Two fragments/animal were separated for the fresh control (FC) group. There was a higher percentage of normal and developing primordial follicles at the IA-7 site (P < 0.05) compared to the other treatments, with similar values to the fresh control. Type I and III collagen fibers differed between the groups (P < 0.05), showing a considerable decrease in type I collagen fibers at the IA-7 site compared to the FC. However, the IM-7 and IA-15 sites showed higher values of type I collagen fibers, showing similarity to the FC. Therefore, we conclude that the IA site in goats is an effective site for ovarian tissue transplantation, as it is easily accessible, low invasive and has presented satisfactory rates of morphology and follicular activation.

AB  - Miracle fruit (MF) has emerged as a promising option for healthy noncaloric sweeteners due to its sour-to-sweet taste-modifying effects and high antioxidant activity. We aimed to examine the feasibility and acceptability of using MF as a weight-loss strategy for individuals with diabetes or prediabetes. Fifty Korean-American men and women (25 participants each) aged 45-75 years with diabetes or prediabetes were recruited in this study. They participated in a randomized placebo-controlled crossover trial where they took the assigned tablet (either an MF tablet or a placebo-sugar candy) 10 min before consuming food. Using a 9-point hedonic scale, participants assessed the likings of overall, flavor, texture, and aftertaste for green apples, goat cheese, lemonade, pickles, and plain fat-free yogurt before and 10 min after taking the assigned tablet. Additionally, overall liking for meals and calorie intake were assessed during subsequent ad libitum meal sessions. An ANOVA for a crossover design, and independent and paired t-tests were used to compare the outcomes. The results revealed that all postintervention liking values for sour-tasting foods were higher than the respective preintervention liking values for both interventions. However, the MF intervention showed significantly higher pre-post differences in liking for all sour-tasting foods and the overall liking values for breakfast and dinner compared to the placebo intervention (P < 0.001). Furthermore, the MF intervention resulted in a significantly lower calorie intake for each meal than the placebo (P < 0.001). These findings suggest that MF intervention can be considered a viable weight-loss strategy for individuals with diabetes.

AB  - The Piwi-interacting RNA (piRNA) pathway is a genomic defense system that controls the movement of transposable elements (TEs) through transcriptional and post-transcriptional silencing. Although TE defense is critical to ensuring germline genome integrity, it is equally critical that the piRNA pathway avoids autoimmunity in the form of silencing host genes. Ongoing cycles of selection for expanded control of invading TEs, followed by selection for increased specificity to reduce impacts on host genes, are proposed to explain the frequent signatures of adaptive evolution among piRNA pathway proteins. However, empirical tests of this model remain limited, particularly with regards to selection against genomic autoimmunity.
   I examined three adaptively evolving piRNA proteins, Rhino, Deadlock, and Cutoff, for evidence of interspecific divergence in autoimmunity between Drosophila melanogaster and Drosophila simulans. I tested a key prediction of the autoimmunity hypothesis that foreign heterospecific piRNA proteins will exhibit enhanced autoimmunity, due to the absence of historical selection against off-target effects. Consistent with this prediction, full-length D. simulans Cutoff, as well as the D. simulans hinge and chromo domains of Rhino, exhibit expanded regulation of D. melanogaster genes. I further demonstrate that this autoimmunity is dependent on known incompatibilities between D. simulans proteins or domains and their interacting partners in D. melanogaster. My observations reveal that the same protein-protein interaction domains that are interfaces of adaptive evolution in Rhino and Cutoff also determine their potential for autoimmunity.

AB  - The heat stress (HS) induced by high temperatures can result in oxidative damage to muscles, thereby compromising both muscle growth and immune function within the organism. Mitophagy serves as a pivotal pathway in alleviating excessive ROS production and subsequent oxidative damage. However, the potential role of epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG), a natural antioxidant found in tea, in mitophagy under HS remains unexplored. Here, we present evidence of EGCG mitigating the oxidative-redox imbalance in porcine skeletal muscles induced by HS involving the antioxidant enzyme system mediated by the Keap1/Nrf2 pathway and mitophagy mediated by the PINK1/Parkin pathway. Importantly, we identified phosphate mutase 5 (PGAM5) for the first time as a key protein modulated by EGCG under HS conditions, regulating mitophagy. Inhibition of PGAM5 significantly attenuated the activation of mitophagy by EGCG. Molecular docking and dynamics simulations further suggested that EGCG directly binds to Keap1, disrupting the Keap1-PGAM5 protein interaction and thus promoting the release of PGAM5 and subsequently activating mitophagy. In summary, this study represents the first discovery of EGCG directly targeting Keap1/PGAM5-mediated mitophagy, which serves as a potential functional supplement for regulating the antioxidant capacity in pigs.

AB  - Conversion of keratin waste to value-added products not only reduces waste volumes but also creates new revenue streams for the animal production industry. In the present study, combination of alkaline pretreatment of cattle hair with enzymatic hydrolysis was studied to produce keratin hydrolysates with relatively high antioxidant activities. Firstly, the effect of pretreatment conditions at a high solid/liquid mass ratio of 1:2 with different NaOH loadings and temperatures was studied. Increasing NaOH concentration from 1.0% to 2.5% and temperature from room temperature to 110 degrees C increased hair hydrolysis by keratinase and protein recovery in hydrolysates. Mild pretreatment with 1.5% NaOH at 70 degrees C for 30 min led to a protein recovery of 30% in the enzymatic hydrolysate. The resulting hydrolysate showed a high antioxidant activity, scavenging 69% of the ABTS radical with a low EC50 of 0.8 mg/mL. Severe pretreatment with 2.5% NaOH at 110 degrees C for 30 min resulted in a higher protein recovery of 45%, but a lower ABTS radical scavenging activity of 56% and a higher EC50 of 1.3 mg/mL. The reduced antioxidant activity was attributed to the reduced proportion of small peptides (<3 kDa) and the increased extent of amino acid chemical modification. This study demonstrated that controlling alkali pretreatment conditions could lead to the production of enzymatic hydrolysates with higher antioxidant activities for potential value-adding applications. The information generated from this study will aid scale-up and commercialisation of processes with optimised antioxidant peptide production.

AB  - In Indonesia, the control of Coptotermes curvignathus populations as living tree termite pests has been carried out since the early 20th century. Recently, C. curvignathus has been considered the main termite pest and designated as the only species model for wood and wood products resistance tests against subterranean termite attack testing protocol in the Indonesian National Standard (SNI). However, the species distribution range of C. curvignathus has been long questioned as Coptotermes gestroi is commonly reported as a species found in urban areas of Southeast Asian region, particularly in Indonesia. One of the reasons for the species distribution discrepancies is the lack of morphological markers to distinguish both species in the field. Thus, limiting the field inspection effectiveness in termite pest management in Indonesia. This study reexamined and clarified the morphological differences between C. curvignathus and C. gestroi, based on soldier caste. The head shape, mandible shape, and distribution of genal setae on the ventro-anterior head part and pronotum marked the difference between the 2 species. These current results support previous findings of C. curvignathus as the forest dweller while clarifying C. gestroi as the common urban dweller in Indonesia. The putative benefit of morphological features related to the head, mandible, and setae distribution to the defensive adaptation in their common habitat was discussed. Ultimately, the inclusion of C. gestroi into the Indonesian National Standard (SNI) as an alternative species for efficacy tests against subterranean termites is highly recommended.

AB  - Diaporthe mahothocarpus GZU-Y2, a new pathogen responsible for leaf spot blight disease, leads to significant damage and economic losses in some Camellia oleifera plantations. The current study annotated the genome of the D. mahothocarpus isolate GZU-Y2 to advance our knowledge of the pathogen and facilitate improved disease management of leaf spot blight. The initial Pacbio-Illumina hybrid draft genome for GZU-Y2 resulted in a high-quality assembly with 62 contigs, characterized by an N50 length of 7.07 Mb. The complete genome of isolate GZU-Y2 was 58.97 Mbp, with a GC content of 50.65%. Importantly, the assembly exhibits remarkable integrity, with 97.93% of complete BUSCO validating genome completeness. The prediction results showed that a total of 15,918 protein-coding genes were annotated using multiple bioinformatics databases. The genome assembly and annotation resource reported here will be useful for the further study of fungal infection mechanisms and pathogen-host interaction.

AB  - Numerous herbivores orally secrete defense compounds to detoxify plant toxins. However, little is known about the role of orally secreted enzymes by a specialized pest, Plutella xylostella, in the detoxification of plant defense compounds. Three glucosinolate sulfatases (GSSs) or two sulfatase-modifying factors (SUMF1s) mutant strains were established on the basis of CRISPR/Cas9 technology to validate the existence of a species-specific GSSs-SUMF1s system. In comparison to the bioassay data from mutant strains of GSS1/GSS2 or SUMF1a/SUMF1b, GSS3 had a minimal role because no significant change was found in GSS3-/-under different feeding contexts. Antibody-based technologies were used to examine GSSs-related deficient strains, and the results showed that the GSS1 protein was primarily released through larval oral secretion. On the basis of high-performance liquid chromatography, we found that GSS1 was secreted to pre-desulfate the typical plant defensive glucosinolates known as 4(methylsulfinyl)butyl glucosinolate (4MSOB-GL) to suppress the production of the toxic substance, which is referred to as pre detoxification strategy. These findings highlighted that the GSSs-SUMF1s system is the key factor for counteradaptation of P. xylostella to cruciferous plants, which strengthens the concept that herbivores deploy pre-detoxification strategies to disrupt the plant chemical defenses to facilitate the colonization process.

AB  - Livestock farming produces high volumes of animal slurry that can be sanitized using low-cost treatments by pH adjustment, reducing pathogen contamination, and promoting slurry valorization as a safe fertilizer. This work aims to evaluate the impact of sandy soil amendment with dairy slurry treated by pH adjustment on the potential release of nutrients and coliforms into groundwater. A laboratory soil column leaching experiment was conducted and the surface application of six treatments was tested: raw dairy slurry, dairy slurry acidified with H2SO4, dairy slurry alkalinized with KOH, alkalinized/neutralized dairy slurry, mineral fertilizer, and a control. The fertilizer application rate was 0.08 g N kg(-1) dry soil. Leachates were analyzed for pH, electrical conductivity, N-NH4+ and N-NO3-, macro- and micronutrients, and fecal coliforms. Results showed that amendment with dairy slurry led to significantly lower nitrate leaching potential than mineral fertilizer (maximum 16.1 vs. 50.4%). The use of hygienized slurry by alkalinization decreased the potential leaching of coliforms relative to raw slurry. However, incomplete sanitization by acidification strongly promoted coliform leaching and the risk of groundwater contamination. It can be concluded that the use of alkalinized dairy slurry is a safer solution than raw slurry with regard to the risk of groundwater pollution.

AB  - Pyruvate is an important energy substance during early embryonic development of mammals. However, the underlying mechanisms of pyruvate during early embryonic development in pigs and its role in zygotic genome activation (ZGA) are not fully understood. Here, based on a previous RNA-seq dataset of porcine early embryos, we found that pyruvate metabolism-related genes started to be expressed at the 4-cell stage and that pyruvate metabolism-related genes were correlated with porcine ZGA marker genes. To determine the function of pyruvate in porcine embryos, in vitro fertilization (IVF) embryos were cultured in PZM-3 medium (control group); modified PZM-3 medium that only contains pyruvate and lactate plus salts ( thorn P group); or modified PZM-3 medium lacking pyruvate (-P group). The 4-cell arrest rate at 72 h was significantly increased in the -P group compared to the thorn P group (P < 0.05). In addition, we observed that the reactive oxygen species (ROS) level was significantly increased and that the adenosine triphosphate (ATP) level was significantly (P < 0.05) decreased in the -P group compared to the thorn P group. Moreover, the expression of ZGA marker genes and SIRT1 protein in embryos was significantly decreased in the -P group compared to the thorn P group (P < 0.05). Furthermore, the acetylation level of H3K9 was significantly decreased (P < 0.05) and the methylation level of H3K9 was significantly increased (P < 0.05) in the -P group compared to the thorn P group. In summary, our findings demonstrate that pyruvate affects early embryonic development in pigs by promoting ZGA and reducing oxidative stress levels.

AB  - Camelina sativa (L.) Crantz is a low-input oilseed crop that has great potential in providing sustainable feedstock for biofuels and bioproducts. Climate change is threatening production of camelina with rising global temperatures. Elucidating the genetic response to high temperatures is essential for successful breeding of heat-tolerant camelina varieties. Here, we report a combinatorial approach to identifying candidate genes associated with heat stress by quantitative trait locus (QTL) mapping and comparative transcriptome profiling. A population of recombinant inbred lines (RILs) was grown in a controlled growth chamber under the high-temperature regimes for 14 days beginning at the onset of the reproductive stage. Several traits related to seed production were evaluated at maturity. The QTL analysis identified several regions with co-located traits on chromosomes 8, 10, and 12. Two RILs with contrasting phenotypic responses to heat stress were chosen for gene expression profiling via RNA sequencing. Multiple pathways and genes were found to be strongly affected by heat stress, and many genes expressed differently between the two RILs. Several genes identified within the QTL regions were considered strong candidates that may control heat tolerance during reproduction in camelina. These studies provide resources for future studies that may assist in improving the heat tolerance of camelina.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Vitrification increases the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and the antioxidants in the vitrification solution may be beneficial by reducing excessive ROS production. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effect of retinol supplementation in vitrification solution on viability, apoptosis and development-related gene expression in vitrified sheep preantral follicles. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Preantral follicles were isolated and randomly assigned into one of five groups: Group1, control fresh preantral follicles; Group 2, vitrification treatment; Group 3, vitrification + 2 ??M retinol; Group 4, vitrification + 5 ??M retinol; Group 5, vitrification + 10 ??M retinol. Preantral follicles were placed in vitrification solutions and then plunged into liquid nitrogen (-196??C). After a week, the follicles were thawed and analyzed for follicular viability by trypan blue exclusion method and for gene expression. RESULTS: Vitrification with 5 ??M retinol positively affected viability in comparison with vitrification without retinol (P < 0.05). There was no significant difference in viability among the Group 1, Group 2, Group 3 and Group 5. Expression of apoptotic genes BAX and Casp 3 were higher in the vitrified group, and vitrification with 5 ??M retinol (Group 4) is comparable to the control fresh. Expressions of other apoptosis-related genes (i.e., BCL2L1, BAD and BAK) showed significant difference between the control fresh group and the vitrification group with 5 ??M retinol. Expression of Annexin5 was also significantly different among various groups. The expression of development competence genes GDF-9 and BMP-15 were higher (P < 0.05) in the Group vitrified with 5 ??M retinol. CONCLUSION: The supplementation of 5 ??M retinol in vitrification solution was beneficial for the vitrification of ovine preantral follicles.

AB  - This paper is based on a presentation made at the 9th London-Innsbruck Colloquium on Status Epilepticus and Acute Seizures in April 2024. Status Epilepticus (SE) is a neurological emergency involving prolonged seizures that disrupt brain function and may cause severe, long-term neurological damage. Developmental and Epileptic Encephalopathies (DEEs), a group of severe genetic disorders with early-onset epilepsy, often exhibit SE episodes that compound their inherent cognitive and developmental challenges. In patients with DEEs, SE may intensify excitotoxicity, metabolic strain, and neuroinflammatory processes, exacerbating developmental delays and cognitive deficits. SE episodes in DEEs frequently resist conventional anti-seizure medications, posing heightened risks of progressive neurological decline and mortality. This paper explores how SE contributes to worsening neurodevelopmental outcomes in DEEs, particularly through sustained structural and functional brain alterations observed in human neuroimaging and animal models. Findings from clinical studies and neuroimaging highlight SE's role in structural damage, including cortical atrophy, hippocampal sclerosis, and gray matter loss. Rodent models replicate SE through chemical or electrical induction, providing insights into SE-induced neurodegeneration, network reorganization, especially in critical areas like the hippocampus, which is more known, however few of scientists look that much outside it. The models reveal a progressive cycle where recurrent SE episodes increase brain excitability, predisposing to further seizures and cumulative developmental impairment. Moreover, genetic animal models of DEEs suggest that early-life seizures exacerbate the severity of the epilepsy phenotype and neurocognitive deficits. This paper underscores the need for advanced, individualized therapies to manage SE in DEE patients and prevent recurrence, aiming to minimize long-term neurological and developmental sequelae.

AB  - Simple Summary This study analyzed the relationship between soil microbes and the microbial diversity and structure of the distal gut of the terrestrial golden snub-nosed monkey and Eurasian otter in the Foping National Nature Reserve (FNNR), Shaanxi Province, China, and provides baseline information regarding the gut microbiota of these wild species. Understanding the interaction between the microbial composition in the habitat and the gut of wildlife will contribute to conservation efforts since changes in the gut microbiome have been proven to influence the healthy and nutritional status of the host. This study analyzed the relationship between soil microbes and the microbial diversity and structure of the distal gut of the terrestrial golden snub-nosed monkey and Eurasian otter in the Foping National Nature Reserve (FNNR). A total of 15 otter fecal samples and 18 monkey fecal samples were collected from which 5 and 6 samples, respectively, were randomly selected for microbiome analysis. The remaining samples were used for fecal short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) analysis. Soil samples from the otter and monkey habitats at each sampling point (eight in total) were also collected for microbiome analysis. The microbial phyla with the greatest relative abundance in soil or animal samples were Proteobacteria (41.2, 32.7, and 73.3% for soil, otters, and monkeys, respectively), Firmicutes (0.4% soil, 30.1% otters, and 14.4% monkeys), Bacteroidota (5.6% soil, 17.0% otters, and 8.3% monkeys), and Acidobacteriota (24.6% soil, 1.7% otters, and 0.1% monkeys). The estimation of alpha diversity indices revealed that the feature, Chao1, and Shannon indices of the soil microbiome were the greatest (p < 0.01) among the three groups, followed by those of the otter microbiome and those of the monkey microbiome (p < 0.01). Beta diversity analyses confirmed differences in the microbiota of the three types of samples. The determination of SCFA concentration in feces revealed that total volatile fatty acids, acetic acid, and isovaleric acid were greater (p < 0.05) in otters than in monkeys, while propionic acid followed the opposite pattern (p < 0.05). Correlation analysis of the microbiome and SCFA contents showed that propionic acid was positively correlated with significantly different bacterial groups, while acetic and butyric acid and total volatile acids were negatively correlated. This study confirmed that the fecal microbes of Eurasian otters and golden snub-nosed monkeys in the reserve are related to the soil microbial communities of their habitats, but they have different bacterial community structures and compositions, and there are different SCFA metabolic patterns in the gut of the two animals. The present study will help to improve wildlife protection in the FNNR.

AB  - Insularity provides ample opportunities for species diversification. Sri Lanka is home to a large diversity of species, many of which are endemic but morphologically similar to species found in southern India, due to recent speciation events, suggesting a complex evolutionary history. However, in some taxa although morphological diversity has been noted, the genetic level variations are minimal. Among the wide-ranging horseshoe bats such a phenomenon is noted. In this study, we used bioacoustics, morphometric and molecular data to evaluate the relationships between the taxa of lesser woolly horseshoe bats in the India and Sri Lanka. Our study reveals that the two taxa-Rhinolophus beddomei Andersen, 1905 and here we have validated the existing subspecies from peninsular India and R. sobrinus Andersen, 1918 from Sri Lanka are genetically very close to R. perniger Hodgson, 1843. Currently the taxa-beddomei and sobrinus are recognized as subspecies of Rhinolophus beddomei Andersen, 1905. We provide a detailed description of the taxa beddomei and sobrinus as the original descriptions are limited in nature.

AB  - Brain aging is associated with a progressive decrease in learning abilities, memory, attention, decision making, and sensory perception. Age-related cognitive disturbances may be related to a decrease in the functional capacities of the hippocampus. This brain region is essential for learning and memory, and the lifelong neurogenesis occurring in the subgranular zone of the dentate gyrus may be a key event mediating the mnemonic functions of the hippocampus. In the present study, we investigated whether age-related changes in hippocampal neurogenesis are associated with learning and memory disturbances. Four- and 24-month-old rats were trained to find a hidden platform in a water maze. Though the older group showed higher latency to search the platform as compared to the younger group, both groups learned the task. However, the density of proliferating (PCNA-positive), differentiating (Dcx-positive), and new neurons (pre-labeled BrdU-positive) was significantly lower in the hippocampus of aged rats as compared to young ones. This inhibition of neurogenesis could be related to increased local production of nitric oxide since the density of neurons expressing neuronal NO-synthase was higher in the aged hippocampus. Thus, we can suggest that an age-related decrease in neurogenesis is not directly associated with place learning in aged rats.

AB  - Caviid rodents have peculiar craniomandibular specializations toward masticatory propalinal movements and grinding, in relation to a grass-rich diet. The aim of this study is to: (1) analyse the variation of cheek tooth shape in the Caviinae and, (2) quantify the covariation relations between caviine cheek teeth. For this purpose, we perform the first geometric morphometric analysis on cheek teeth of fossil and extant caviids, ancestral shape reconstructions and covariation analyses. Our results show that caviine dentition is strongly integrated with a higher covariation between teeth of the same row than between opposite teeth, differing from mammals with complex interlocking. Each series acts as a single functional unit integrated during grinding action obtained by mainly propalinal movements. However, p4 shows more plasticity, allowing its morphology to differentiate from the common pattern of molars. Morphologically homogeneous cheek tooth series are ancestral in crown caviids and highly marked in Cavia, while stronger morphological differences between tooth pieces are observed in Microcavia and Galea. These differences are probably driven by diet changes. The tendency towards alignment of main masticatory movements with the tooth row axes seems to be a key factor in understanding cheek tooth covariation patterns in this and other rodent clades.

AB  - Genetic polymorphism research in livestock species aims to assess genetic differences within and among breeds, primarily for conservation and development objectives. The aim of the present study was to determine the point mutation in the IGF-1 gene (g.855G>C and g.857G>A) and its association with performance traits in Munjal sheep. In total, 50 Munjal sheep were selected and the genomic DNA was isolated using the Automated Maxell RSC DNA/RNA purification system and the Maxwell RSC whole blood DNA kit. A reported set of primers was used to amplify the 294-bp fragment encompassing the targeted region, i.e. the 5 ' flanking region of the IGF-1 gene. The polymerase chain reaction product of 294-bp size harbouring the g.857G>A mutation in the 5 ' flanking region of the IGF-1 gene was digested with HaeII enzyme. Three possible genotypes were defined by distinct banding patterns, i.e. GG (194, 100 bp), GA (294, 194, 100 bp) and AA (294 bp) in the studied population of Munjal sheep. The genotypic and allelic frequencies of g.857G>A single nucleotide polymorphism of the IGF-1 gene indicated that the frequency of the A allele was higher in the studied population, i.e. 0.59 and the GA genotype was found to be the predominant genotype (0.66). Allele A of the IGF-1 gene was found to be associated with higher body weights and can be used in selection criteria for improving the performance of Munjal sheep. The positive effect of the IGF-1 gene on several conformational traits as observed in this study suggests that this area of the ovine IGF-I gene is particularly important and warrants further investigation on a larger population size.

AB  - Oleoylethanolamide (OEA) is a lipid with anti-inflammatory activity that modulates multiple reward-related behaviors. Previous studies have shown that OEA treatment reduces alcohol self-administration (SA) while inhibiting alcohol-induced inflammatory signaling. Nevertheless, the specific mechanisms that OEA targets to achieve these effects have not been widely explored. Here, we tested the effects of OEA treatment during alcohol SA, extinction or previous to cue-induced reinstatement of alcohol seeking. In addition, we measured gene expression changes in the striatum and hippocampus of relevant receptors for alcohol consumption (Drd1, Drd2, Cnr1, Oprm) as well as immune-related proteins (Il-6, Il-1 beta, Tlr4) and the brain-derived neurotrophic factor (Bdnf). Our results confirmed that when administered contingently, systemic OEA administration reduced alcohol SA and attenuated cue-induced reinstatement. Interestingly, we also observed that OEA treatment reduced the number of sessions needed for the extinction of alcohol seeking. Biochemical analyses showed that OEA induced gene expression changes in dopamine and cannabinoid receptors in the striatum and hippocampus. In addition, OEA treatment modulated the long-term immune response and increased Bdnf expression. These results suggest that boosting OEA levels may be an effective strategy for reducing alcohol SA and preventing relapse.

AB  - Poultry slaughter effluents contain biodegradable organics, which include blood, feathers, viscera, soft tissues removed during trimming and cutting, bones, and soil. Slaughterhouse sludge usually contains many of these compounds and a high concentration of pathogenic microorganisms. In this study, the influence of thermal pretreatment on the conversion of mesophilic anaerobic digestion (MAD) to thermophilic anaerobic digestion (TAD) was evaluated, and micronutrient supplementation (Fe, Co, Ni, and Mo) to improve the production of biogas from poultry slaughter sludge. Six experimental stages were carried out, sludge sampling and characterization, application of thermal pretreatment, the adaptation of the mesophilic to thermophilic process, operation of TAD with increased organic loading rate (OLR), selection of micronutrient doses, and semicontinuous operation of TAD with micronutrients. The application of thermal pretreatment led to notable increases in the levels of carbohydrates, lipids, and soluble proteins, and a high inactivation of pathogens was obtained. The adaptation process from MAD to TAD required equidistant increments in temperature (+ Delta 5 degrees C) and operation time (Delta 15 days), resulting in a cumulative biogas production of 144.5 L. The TAD system effectively accommodated an OLR of 5 kgVS/(m3 d) without encountering inhibition. Moreover, the initial dose of micronutrients administered during the semicontinuous operation resulted in a 16% increase in biogas production compared to the control. Analysis of kinetic parameters using the modified Gompertz equation consistently yielded R2 values above 0.96 in all experimental stages. Overall, the findings highlight the positive impact of micronutrient supplementation and thermal pretreatment on biogas production within an enhanced TAD system.

AB  - A two-factorial experiment (temperature with three levels: 23 degrees C, 25.5 degrees C and 28 degrees C; diet with four kinds: live Artemia sp.+ copepods, live Artemia sp. + copepods and frozen Neomysis awatschensis [FNA]) was carried out to evaluate the effects of different temperatures and diets on biochemistry in the juvenile lined seahorse (Hippocampus erectus) for thirty days. The juveniles (n = 1260, body height: 5.1 +/- 0.48 cm, initial wet weight: 0.42 +/- 0.14 g) were distributed in 36 experimental aquaria (35 individuals each). Each treatment had 3 replicates. On day 30, the seahorses were vacuum freeze-dried at -56 degrees C before chemical analysis. Amino acids, fatty acids, Se, Zn, nucleosides, and nucleotides were measured in the present study. The results show that temperature, diet, and their interaction significantly affected all components. The content of amino acids and fatty acids in the juveniles fed FNA at 23 degrees C was the highest. The content of Zn in the juveniles fed FNA at 23 degrees C, and the content of Se fed Artemia sp. + copepod at 25.5 degrees C were the highest, respectively. The content of uracil, adenine, and thymidine in the juveniles at 23 degrees C was significantly lower than those treatments at 25.5 degrees C and 28 degrees C. The levels of uracil, guanine, cytosine, uridine, and guanosine at 28 degrees C were significantly higher than those at 23 degrees C or 25.5 degrees C when fed Artemia sp. + copepod. The juveniles fed Artemia sp. + copepod and Artemia sp. at 28 degrees C has the highest comprehensive scores of nucleoside and nucleotide. In conclusion, FNA is the best feed to improve the content of amino acids, fatty acids, and Zn at 23 degrees C.

AB  - Neuropathological aging is associated with memory impairment and cognitive decline, affecting several brain areas including the neurogenic niche of the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus (DG). In the healthy brain, homeostatic mechanisms regulate neurogenesis within the DG to facilitate the continuous generation of neurons from neural stem cells (NSC). Nevertheless, aging reduces the number of activated neural stem cells and diminishes the number of newly generated neurons. Strategies that promote neurogenesis in the DG may improve cognitive performance in the elderly resulting in the development of treatments to prevent the progression of neurological disorders in the aged population. Our work is aimed at discovering targeting molecules to be used in the design of pharmacological agents that prevent the neurological effects of brain aging. We study the effect of age on hippocampal neurogenesis using the SAMP8 mouse as a model of neuropathological aging. We show that in 6-month-old SAMP8 mice, episodic and spatial memory are impaired; concomitantly, the generation of neuroblasts and neurons is reduced and the generation of astrocytes is increased in this model. The novelty of our work resides in the fact that treatment of SAMP8 mice with a transforming growth factor-alpha (TGFa) targeting molecule prevents the observed defects, positively regulating neurogenesis and improving cognitive performance. This compound facilitates the release of TGFa in vitro and in vivo and activates signaling pathways initiated by this growth factor. We conclude that compounds of this kind that stimulate neurogenesis may be useful to counteract the neurological effects of pathological aging.

AB  - This research aims to evaluate how incorporating sun-dried olive leaves (OL) in the diets of Awassi lambs affects production costs, intake and nutrients digestibility, growth performance, and carcase quality. Thirty-six newly weaned male lambs were randomly allocated to one of three diet groups as dry matter (DM) in diets: 1) the control diet (CON), 2) 50 OL g/kg (OL50), and 3) 100 OL g/kg (OL100). On the 50th day, four lambs were randomly selected from each treatment and transported to metabolic cages to evaluate digestibility and N balance. The DM intake was higher (p = .003) in the OL50 and OL100 diets than those on the CON diet. At the same time, the ether extract and metabolisable energy intakes were the highest (p < .0001) in OL100, followed by OL50 and the CON diet. Intake of neutral detergent fibre and acid detergent fibre for lambs fed the OL50 diet surpassed (p < .0001) the other diets. The growth performance parameters were comparable among diets. However, the cost of gain was lower (p = .03) in diets containing OL. The OL incorporation had no treatment effect (p > .05) on the digestibility, N retention, carcase characteristics and meat quality. In conclusion, while the addition of OL at 50 g/kg and 100 g/kg did not affect the growth performance and characteristics of carcase, it did decrease the cost of production, making it a good candidate to replace part of the wheat straw in diets of growing lambs.

AB  - Camellia oleifera is a woody edible oil species with late self-incompatibility characteristics. Previous transcriptome analysis showed that genes involved in jasmonic acid signal transduction were significantly different in self-and cross-pollinated pistils of Camellia oleifera. To investigate the relationship between jasmonate signal and self-incompatibility by studying the core genes of jasmonate signal transduction. The results showed that exogenous JA and MeJA at 1.0 mM significantly inhibited pollen tube germination and pollen tube elongation. and JA up-regulated CoCOI1, CoJAZ1, and CoMYC, the core genes of jasmonate signal transduction. Subcellular localization indicated that CoCOI1 and CoJAZ1 were located in the nucleus and CoMYC2 in the endoplasmic reticulum. The three genes exhibited tissue-specific expression pattern. CoCOI1 was significantly expressed in pollen, CoJAZ1 was significantly expressed in ovary, CoMYC2 was significantly expressed in filaments, but not in pollen. Furthermore, CoJAZ1 and CoMYC2 were highly expressing at 24 h in self-pollinated styles. These results suggested that JA signal transduction of C. oleifera was involved in the process of self-pollination, and thus in the process of plant defense. When pollen tubes grew slowly in the style, ovary may receive JA signal, which initiates the molecular mechanism of inhibiting the growth of self-pollinating pollen tubes.

AB  - The aim of this study was to evaluate the vasoactive and neuroprotectiveeffects of c-Jun N-terminal kinase inhibitor IQ-1 (11H-indeno[1,2-b]quinoxalin-11-oneoxime) in chronic cerebral hypoperfusion caused by irreversiblebilateral common carotid artery ligation [two-vessel occlusion (2VO)model]. Cerebral blood flow was measured quantitatively (hydrogenclearance method) simultaneously in the parietal cortex, hippocampus,substantia nigra, and striatum of the brain of awake rats. It wasfound that 2VO caused a decrease in blood flow in the brain regionswith a more pronounced decrease in the cortex (by 48% of the initiallevel) and with a minimum drop in the substantia nigra (by 25% ofthe initial level). The reduced level of blood flow persisted for14 days of measurements. The responses of the cerebral vessels tohypercapnic probes (5% CO2) were lost duringthe 2-week hypoperfusion period, and the neurological status ofthe animals did not improve. The administration of IQ-1 (50 mg/kg,intraperitoneally, every 48 h for 14 days) was accompanied by anincrease in blood flow in all brain regions. A maximum increasein blood flow was observed in the striatum and a minimum in thesubstantia nigra. After the administration of IQ-1, the sensitivityof the cerebral vessels to the hypercapnic stimulus was restored,and the neurological state of the animals significantly improvedby the end of the second week of cerebral hypoperfusion. The resultsshow that the use of the JNK inhibitor can reduce cerebrovascular disordersand related neurological disorders in hypoperfusion brain injury.

AB  - In brief: In the present study the sustainable effect of L-carnitine during the culture period on the post-transfer development was investigated. Taken together, we uncovered direct effects of L-carnitine on the bioenergetic profile of day 7 blastocysts along with sustainable effects on mtDNA copy numbers and transcriptome profile of bovine day 14 embryos. Abstract: L-Carnitine (LC) is known to play key roles in lipid metabolism and antioxidative activity, implicating enhanced cryotolerance of bovine blastocysts. However, sustainability of LC supplementation during culture period on preimplantation development beyond the blastocyst stage has not been investigated so far. Therefore, all embryos were cultured under fatty acid-free conditions, one group with LC (LC embryos) and the control group without LC (control) supplementation. Transfer to recipients was conducted on day 6. Elongation-stage embryos were recovered on day 14; metrics of embryo recollection, developmental rates as regards early elongation-stage as well as mean embryo length did not differ between the groups. Gene expression analyses via NGS revealed 341 genes to be differentially regulated between elongation-stage embryos derived from LC supplementation compared to controls. These played mainly a role in molecular functions and biological processes like oxidoreductase activity, ATP-dependent activity, cellular stress, and respiration. Pathways like oxidative phosphorylation and thermogenesis, extracellular matrix receptor signaling, PI3K-Akt, and focal adhesion were affected by differentially regulated genes. Moreover, all DEGs located on the mitochondria were significantly downregulated in LC embryos, being in line with lower mitochondrial copy number and mtDNA integrity compared to the control group. Finally, we uncovered alterations of the bioenergetic profile on day 7 as a consequence of LC supplementation for the first time, revealing significantly higher oxygen consumption rates, ATP linked respiration and spare capacity for LC embryos. In summary, we uncovered direct effects of LC supplementation during the culture period on the bioenergetic profile along with sustainable effects on mtDNA copy numbers and transcriptome profile of bovine day 14 embryos.

KW  - IMPUTATION
AB  - Odor is a very serious problem worldwide. Thus, odor prediction research has been conducted consistently to help prevent odor. Odor substances that are complex odors are known, but complex odors and odor substances do not have a linear dependence. In addition, depending on the combination of odor substances, the causal relationships, such as synergy and antagonism, are different for complex odors. Research is needed to know this, but the situation is incomplete. Therefore, in this study, research was conducted through data-based research. The complex odor was predicted using various machine learning methods, and the effect of odor substances on the complex odor was verified using an explainable artificial intelligence method. In this study, according to the Malodor Prevention Act in Korea, complex odors are divided into two categories: acceptable and unacceptable. Analysis of variance and correlation analysis were used to determine the relationships between variables. Six machine learning methods (k-nearest neighbor, support vector classification, random forest, extremely randomized tree, eXtreme gradient boosting, and light gradient boosting machine) were used as predictive classification models, and the best predictive method was chosen using various evaluation metrics. As a result, the support vector machine that performed best in five out of six evaluation metrics was selected as the best model (f1-score = 0.7722, accuracy = 0.8101, sensitivity = 0.7372, specificity = 0.8656, positive predictive value = 0.8196, and negative predictive value = 0.8049). In addition, the partial dependence plot method from explainable artificial intelligence was used to understand the influence and interaction effects of odor substances.

AB  - Simple Summary Biological control is an important direction for pest control in the future, and chemical ecology is an indispensable part of biological control. Therefore, we tested the selection of Spodoptera litura and parasitic wasps on the volatiles of different treatments of cabbage and collected and analyzed the volatiles of different treatments of cabbage. This study found that cabbage was fed by Spodoptera litura to produce volatiles to avoid Spodoptera litura while also attracting Microplitis similis. As a result, some compounds were found to be related to the behavior of Spodoptera litura and Microplitis similis. These results provide a theoretical basis for searching for biological control resources and chemical control. Plants respond to herbivorous insect attacks by releasing volatiles that directly harm the herbivore or that indirectly harm the herbivore by attracting its natural enemies. Although the larvae of Spodoptera litura (the tobacco cutworm) are known to induce the release of host plant volatiles, the effects of such volatiles on host location by S. litura and by the parasitoid Microplitis similis, a natural enemy of S. litura larvae, are poorly understood. Here, we found that both the regurgitate of S. litura larvae and S. litura-infested cabbage leaves attracted M. similis. S. litura had a reduced preference for cabbage plants that had been infested with S. litura for 24 or 48 h. M. similis selection of plants was positively correlated with the release of limonene; linalool and hexadecane, and was negatively correlated with the release of (E)-2-hexenal and 1-Butene, 4-isothiocyanato. S. litura selection of plants was positively correlated with the release of (E)-2-hexenal, 1-Butene, 4-isothiocyanato, and decanal, and was negatively correlated with the release of limonene, nonanal, hexadecane, heptadecane, and octadecane. Our results indicate that host plant volatiles can regulate the behavior of S. litura and M. similis.

AB  - The aim of this study was to investigate the potential neuroprotective efficacy of coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10) against doxorubicin (DOX) -induced behavioral disturbances in rats. Female rats were randomly assigned into 4 groups as control, CoQ10, DOX, and DOX plus CoQ10. The CoQ10 groups received CoQ10 (200 mg kg(-1)) for 21 days, and the DOX groups received DOX (4 mg kg(-1)) on days 7 and 14 of the study. The open field (OF) and elevated plus maze (EPM) tests were performed to assess locomotor activity and anxiety levels. Additionally, malondialdehyde (MDA), and protein carbonyl (PC) levels and acetylcholinesterase (AChE), and glutathione peroxidase (GPx) activities and total antioxidant capacity (TAC) were quantified in brain tissue. DOX administration caused alterations in locomotor activity, and anxiety-like behaviors. Moreover, DOX produced significant elevation in AChE activity . PC level and GPx activity tended to alter with DOX administration. Co-treatment with CoQ10 significantly attenuated DOX-induced behavioral alterations via improving AChE activity in the brain tissue of rats. CoQ10 treatment may be potential for the alleviation of DOX-induced behavioral disturbances. This improvement might be due to the inhibition of AChE activity.

AB  - RASSF1A promoter methylation has been correlated with tumor dedifferentiation and aggressive oncogenic behavior. Nevertheless, the underlying mechanism of RASSF1A-dependent tumor dedifferentiation remains elusive. Here, we show that RASSF1A directly uncouples the NOTCH-HES1 axis, a key suppressor of differentiation. Interestingly, the crosstalk of RASSF1A with HES1 occurs independently from the signaling route connecting RASSF1A with the Hippo pathway. At the molecular level, we demonstrate that RASSF1A acts as a scaffold essential for the SUMO-targeted E3 ligase SNURF/RNF4 to target HES1 for degradation. The reciprocal relationship between RASSF1A and HES1 is evident across a wide range of human tumors, highlighting the clinical significance of the identified pathway. We show that HES1 upregulation in a RASSF1A-depleted environment renders cells non-responsive to the downstream effects of gamma-secretase inhibitors (GSIs) which restrict signaling at the level of the NOTCH receptor. Taken together, we report a mechanism through which RASSF1A exerts autonomous regulation of the critical Notch effector HES1, thus classifying RASSF1A expression as an integral determinant of the clinical effectiveness of Notch inhibitors.

AB  - Oocytes and cumulus cells undergo meiotic resumption and proliferation via gonadotropins and growth factors during maturation, and various small G proteins are activated when COCs undergo physiological changes. This study investigated the influence of gonadotropins and growth factors on Ras and its GTPases during porcine COC maturation. Unmatured COCs were treated with FSH, LH, or EGF for 44 h. The mRNA expression levels of the Ras subfamily (H-Ras, K-Ras, N-Ras, and R-Ras), its GTPases (RASA1 and SOS1), and proliferation factors (ERK, CCNB1, and Cdc2) were analyzed using RT-PCR. In contrast to other Ras subfamilies, R-Ras expression is upregulated during COC maturation. We evaluated the effects of FSH, LH, and EGF at various concentrations that most effectively regulated the expression of R-Ras and GTPases. The results demonstrated that 0.5 mu g/mL FSH, 10 IU/mL human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG), and 10 ng/mL EGF effectively enhanced R-Ras expression and cell proliferation. FSH supplementation during porcine COC maturation significantly upregulated R-Ras and ERK expression, independent of LH and EGF, and downregulated Cdc2 expression. These results indicated that FSH regulates R-Ras expression, thereby promoting cell proliferation during COC maturation. These results provide fundamental knowledge for understanding the role of Ras and its family members in the development of follicular environments in pigs.

AB  - Biotic (e.g., heavy metal) and abiotic stress (e.g., insect attack) can affect plant chemical defense, but little is known about the changes in plant defense when they occur concurrently. Herein, the impacts of heavy metal cadmium (Cd) stress and insect herbivory stress on the direct and indirect defense of two cultivar cabbages of Brassica campestris, the low-Cd cultivar Lvbao701 and the high-Cd cultivar Chicaixin No.4, against the herbivore cutworm Spodoptera litura were investigated. Although 10 mg kg(-1) Cd stress alone inhibited leaf secondary metabolites (total phenolics, flavonoids), it reduced the feeding rate and odor selection of S. litura towards both cultivar cabbages, especially for Lvbao701, by increasing leaf Cd content and repellent volatile organic compounds (VOCs) (6-methyl-5-hepten-2-one, 7,9-di-tert-butyl-1-oxaspiro (4,5)deca-6,9-diene-2,8-dione), and reducing soluble sugar and attractive VOCs (3-methyl-3-pentanol, 2,5-hexanedione, tetradecanal). Under 2.5 mg kg(-1) Cd and herbivory stress, although leaf total phenolics and flavonoids increased significantly, the feeding rate and odor selection of S. litura towards both cultivar cabbages increased, especially for Chicaixin No.4, indicating that the chemical defense of cabbages was depressed. Therefore, Cd stress alone improved the insect resistance of cabbages, whereas herbivory stress weakened the enhanced cabbages defence by Cd stress. The lowCd cultivar Lvbao701 presented stronger insect resistance than Chicaixin No.4, suggesting that Lvbao701 application in Cd-polluted soil can not only decrease Cd transmission to higher levels in the food chain but also reduce pest occurrence.

AB  - Introduction: Cadmium (Cd) has been recognized as a significant contributor to the pollution of farmland soils in China, and biochars have been reported to be effective in mitigating soil Cd pollution. However, most studies have been conducted in laboratory or greenhouse settings, not at a field scale, and the biochars used have been applied at unrealistically high amounts (> 10 t/ha).Methods: In this research, three biochars: rice straw biochar (RSB), pig manure biochar (PMB) and rice husk biochar (RHB) were produced from readily available farm residues. Then the effects at low-level application (1.8 and 3.6 t/ha) on Cd were investigated in a field experiment cropped with rape (Brassica campestris L.).Results: Batch adsorption experiments indicated Cd adsorption capacity of three biochars followed the order of RSB (43.5 mg/g) > PMB (33.3 mg/g) > RHB (24.4 mg/g). Field experiment indicated biochar amendments could slightly change soil pH and cation exchange capacity (CEC); yet led to considerable and significant decreases in extractable Cd concentrations [reductions of: 43%-51% (PMB), 29%-35% (RSB) and 17%-19% (RHB)]. Reduced extractable Cd correlated with lower Cd concentrations in rape plants. PMB and RSB were more effective in decreasing Cd phytoaccumulation into edible parts of rape (> 68% reduction) than RHB.Discussion: Low-level application of PMB or RSB could efficiently decrease the phytoaccumulation of Cd from soils into crops. These results demonstrate the reality of biochar-based remediation solutions to contribute to the mitigation of diffuse Cd contamination in farmland. The results also highlight the need to trail biochars in the presence of the soil to be targeted for remediation.

AB  - Premise of research. Seed production by flowering plants depends on abiotic and biotic factors whose interacting effects may be hidden. We previously reported that exposure to dust from unpaved roads reduced the average amount of pollen on flowers of Ipomopsis aggregata but did not consistently reduce mean seed set per fruit. Here we explore one possible explanation-that the expected detrimental effect of lower pollen loads on seed production was obscured because dust reduces not only pollination success but also attack by a predispersal seed predator. Methodology. Over three consecutive summers, we scored the fates of more than 4000 flowers, comparing those on hand-dusted I. aggregata plants with those on clean control plants in the same natural populations. We censused plants throughout each flowering season, marking phenological cohorts of flowers and examining them for eggs of the anthomyiid fly Hylemya sp. We subsequently scored expanded fruits for seed loss to Hylemya larvae. Pivotal results. Control plants consistently had higher egg loads and rates of seed loss to larvae than dusty plants. Furthermore, most eggs appeared early in the season, when flowers are most likely to set fruit and ovule numbers are highest. In agreement with earlier studies, unparasitized fruits from dusty plants did not contain fewer seeds than fruits from control plants. But when we simulated a system without Hylemya by assigning each parasitized fruit the average number of seeds for unparasitized flowers in the same phenological cohort, control plants outproduced dusty plants. Conclusions. Predispersal seed predation likely contributed to the previous lack of a negative effect of dust on seed set in I. aggregata. This study illustrates how exploring unexpected experimental outcomes can reveal important ecological interactions and how the mechanistic understanding so gained can improve the ability to generalize results to other systems.

AB  - Sertoli cells, the only somatic cells in testis seminiferous tubules, provide a supporting microenvironment for male germ cells and play essential roles in spermatogenesis. The insulin-degrading enzyme (IDE), a ubiqui-tous zinc peptidase of the inverzincin family, plays crucial role in sperm production, as IDE-knockout mice presented decreased testis weight and impaired sperm viability and morphology. However, whether and how IDE affects swine Sertoli cell proliferation remains unclear. Thus, in the present study, we aimed to evaluate the effects of IDE on the proliferation of swine Sertoli cells, as well as its underlying molecular mechanism. After knocking down IDE expression with small interfering RNA transfection, we analyzed the prolifera-tion of swine Sertoli cells as well as the expression of related regulatory factors (WT1, ERK, and AKT). The results showed that IDE knockdown promoted swine Sertoli cell proliferation and increased WT1 expression, possibly through activating ERK and AKT. Overall, our findings suggest that IDE may be involved in male reproduction by regulating Sertoli cell proliferation, which provides new information to better understand the regulatory mechanisms of swine Sertoli cells and improve the reproductive traits of male pigs.

AB  - Diaspididae are one of the most serious small herbivorous insects with piercing-sucking mouth parts and are major economic pests as they attack and destroy perennial ornamentals and food crops. Chemical control is the primary management approach for armored scale infestation. However, chemical insecticides do not possess selectivity in action and not always effective enough for the control of armored scale insects. Our previous work showed that green oligonucleotide insecticides (olinscides) are highly effective against armored and soft scale insects. Moreover, olinscides possess affordability, selectivity in action, fast biodegradability, and a low carbon footprint. Insect pest populations undergo microevolution and olinscides should take into account the problem of insecticide resistance. Using sequencing results, it was found that in the mixed populations of insect pests Dynaspidiotus britannicus Newstead and Aonidia lauri Bouche, predominates the population of A. lauri. Individuals of A. lauri comprised for 80% of individuals with the sequence 3 '-ATC-GTT-GGC-AT-5 ' in the 28S rRNA site, and 20% of the population comprised D. britannicus individuals with the sequence 3 '-ATC-GTC-GGT-AT-5 '. We created olinscides Diasp(80)-11 (5 '-ATG-CCA-ACG-AT-3 ') and Diasp(20)-11 (5 '-ATA-CCG-ACG-AT-3 ') with perfect complementarity to each of the sequences. Mortality of insects on the 14th day comprised 98.19 +/- 3.12% in Diasp(80)-11 group, 64.66 +/- 0.67% in Diasp(20)-11 group (p < 0.05), and 3.77 +/- 0.94% in the control group. Results indicate that for maximum insecticidal effect it is necessary to use an oligonucleotide insecticide that corresponds to the dominant species. Mortality in Diasp(80)-11 group was accompanied with significant decrease in target 28S rRNA concentration and was 8.44 +/- 0.14 and 1.72 +/- 0.36 times lower in comparison with control (p < 0.05) on the 10th and 14th days, respectively. We decided to make single nucleotide substitutions in Diasp(20)-11 olinscide to understand which nucleotide will play the most important role in insecticidal effect. We created three sequences with single nucleotide transversion substitutions at the 5 '-end - Diasp(20)(5 ')-11 (A to T), 3 '-end - Diasp(20)(3 ')-11 (T to A), and in the middle of the sequence - Diasp(20)(6)-11 (6th nitrogenous base of the sequence; G to C), respectively. As a result, mortality of mixed population of the field experiment decreased and comprised 53.89 +/- 7.25% in Diasp(20)(5 ')-11 group, 40.68 +/- 4.33% in Diasp(20)(6)-11 group, 35.74 +/- 5.51% in Diasp(20)(3 ')-11 group, and 3.77 +/- 0.94% in the control group on the 14th day. Thus, complementarity of the 3 '-end nucleotide to target 28S rRNA was the most important for pronounced insecticidal effect (significance of complementarity of nucleotides for insecticidal effect: 5 ' nt < 6 nt < 3 ' nt). As was found in our previous research works, the most important rule to obtain maximum insecticidal effect is complete complementarity to the target rRNA sequence and maximum coverage of target sequence in insect pest populations. However, in this article we also show that the complementarity of 3 '-end is a second important factor for insecticidal potential of olinscides.
   Also in this article we propose 2-step DNA containment mechanism of action of olinscides, recruiting RNase H. The data obtained indicate the selectivity of olinscides and at the same time provide a simple and flexible platform for the creation of effective plant protection products, based on antisense DNA oligonucleotides.

AB  - BACKGROUNDBecause of the considerable damage caused by tomato leafminer in tomato crops, the use of integrated methods is recommended. In this study, the effect of three different elicitors, methyl jasmonate, salicylic acid and ascorbic acid, on the life table parameters of Tuta absoluta was evaluated. A paired bootstrap test and different bootstrap percentiles were used to compare projected population sizes on specific dates. Survival probabilities were calculated by innovatively linking life tables and multinomial theorem. RESULTSPreadult duration and mortality significantly increased, and the net reproductive rate (R-0), intrinsic rate of increase (r), and finite rate of increase (& lambda;) significantly decreased in all elicitor treatments. The lowest fecundity (F = 71.89 eggs/female) was observed in the salicylic acid treatment, with an R-0 value of 13.48 offspring/individual, r of 0.0932 d(-1), and & lambda; of 1.0977 d(-1). The population projection revealed the stage structure of T. absoluta during population growth, which was significantly reduced by the elicitor treatments. The survival probability of bootstrap samples was significantly lowered, whereas the extinction probabilities increased in elicitor treatments compared with control when the survival criterion was set to two fertile pairs. CONCLUSIONOur results demonstrated that the application of elicitors could reduce the risk of T. absoluta damage. Furthermore, population projection based on life tables is applicable to obtain the frequency distribution of the population size at different times. Combined application of life tables and multinomial theorem can be used to calculate the risk of pest emergence. & COPY; 2023 Society of Chemical Industry.

AB  - Genetically modified pigs play a critical role in mimicking human diseases, xenotransplantation, and the development of pigs resistant to viral diseases. The use of programmable endonucleases, including the CRISPR/ Cas9 system, has revolutionized the generation of genetically modified pigs. This study evaluates the efficiency of electroporation of oocytes prior to fertilization in generating edited gene embryos for different models. For single gene editing, phospholipase C zeta (PLC zeta) and fused in sarcoma (FUS) genes were used, and the concentration of sgRNA and Cas9 complexes was optimized. The results showed that increasing the concentration resulted in higher mutation rates without affecting the blastocyst rate. Electroporation produced double knockouts for the TPC1/TPC2 genes with high efficiency (79 %). In addition, resistance to viral diseases such as PRRS and swine influenza was achieved by electroporation, allowing the generation of double knockout embryo pigs (63 %). The study also demonstrated the potential for multiple gene editing in a single step using electroporation, which is relevant for xenotransplantation. The technique resulted in the simultaneous mutation of 5 genes (GGTA1, B4GALNT2, pseudo B4GALNT2, CMAH and GHR). Overall, electroporation proved to be an efficient and versatile method to generate genetically modified embryonic pigs, offering significant advances in biomedical and agricultural research, xenotransplantation, and disease resistance. Electroporation led to the processing of numerous oocytes in a single session using less expensive equipment. We confirmed the generation of gene -edited porcine embryos for single, double, or quintuple genes simultaneously without altering embryo development to the blastocyst stage. The results provide valuable insights into the optimization of gene editing protocols for different models, opening new avenues for research and applications in this field.

AB  - Effects were assessed of the dilutants TRIS and ACP - 101c (R) with the addition of different guinea fowl (Numida meleagris) egg yolk concentrations. Fifteen ejaculates were collected from five goats of the Anglo Nubian breed. The ejaculates were pooled and then divided into 12 groups, two control groups (GC1 TRIS, with 2.5% Gallus gallus domesticus hen egg yolk GOGD), (GC2 Control Group ACP - 101c (R), with the addition of 2.5% Gallus gallus domesticus hen egg yolk GOGD) and ten experimental groups (EG), containing TRIS and ACP added with different concentrations of egg yolk from guinea hen (Numida meleagris) (TRIS 2,5% GONM; TRIS 5% GONM; TRIS 10% GONM; TRIS 15% GONM; TRIS 20% GONM; ACP (R) 2,5% GONM; ACP (R) 5% GONM; ACP (R) 10% GONM; ACP (R) 15% GONM; ACP (R) 20% GONM). Then cryopreservation was carried out and the samples stored in liquid nitrogen (-196 degrees C). After seven days, the samples were thawed and assessed for spermatic kinetics, immunofluorescence and sperm morphology. Analysis of GOMN by the CASA system showed that the various parameters were similar to those of GOGD (P>0.05). The membrane integrity, mitochondrial potential and the acrosome were not influenced by the treatment (P>0.05) nor by the dilutant used for cryopreservation (P>0.05). The spermatic morphology was also preserved by the different GOGD and GONM concentrations in the ACP (R) and TRIS dilutants, with no statistically significant differences (P<0.05). It was concluded that Numida meleagris egg yolk, as external membrane cryoproctant added to the dilutants ACP-101c (R) and TRIS, improved goat semen quality.

AB  - Simple Summary: At zoos, paying attention to animal welfare during interactive activities between exhibited animals and visitors is becoming increasingly necessary. Many zoos in Japan conduct petting activities where people place guinea pigs on their laps, but it is necessary to encourage participants to be aware of the welfare of the animals. The experience of involvement among the participants are involved in together plays an important role in promoting animal welfare. This study showed that changes in body temperature measured with a digital ear thermometer for human infants may be used as a physiological indicator. In addition, by simultaneously measuring the expression of negative behavior and stress hormones in guinea pigs and correlating it with changes in body temperature, it is possible to determine which types of interaction are or are not burdensome to guinea pigs. However, more data are needed to clarify the relationships between behavior, body temperature changes, and stress hormones. Guinea pigs (Cavia porcellus) are used for interactive activities in zoos; therefore, it is important to investigate their welfare. This study aimed to evaluate the validity of measuring the guinea pigs' body temperature of guinea pigs through the ear canal and investigate the relationship among changes in the expression of negative behavior, changes in body temperature, and changes in salivary cortisol concentration, and examine the effects of different interactive activities. In the normal interactive activities performed at the site, the decreased body temperature of pigs was observed over time. In contrast, increased body temperature was observed in excessive interactive activities, which are not recommended. Among the negative behaviors, "Head turning" and "Locomotion" increased significantly in excessive interactions compared to normal interactions, but "Head tossing" decreased significantly over time in both types of interactions. "Freezing" was observed only in excessive interactions. Salivary cortisol concentration increased significantly for all activities. Investigating the relationship between the individual expression of negative behavior and changes in body temperature and changes cortisol level made it possible to uncover the potential for inferring an animal's physiological state. Combining ear temperature monitoring and behavioral observation during zoo interaction activities is recommended as an ethical and scientifically supported practice.

AB  - Insects and their gut bacteria can degrade insecticides separately, which is helpful for insecticide resistance development. However, there is little knowledge about insect and gut bacteria cooperation or their respective roles in an insecticide degradation complex. In this study, we investigated the activities of three enzymes related to pesticide degradation in a leaf beetle, Ambrostoma quadriimpressum Motschulsky. The activities of glutathione S-transferase (GST), carboxylesterase (CarE), and catalase (CAT) were up-regulated in the holo-gut (including lumen) after 5 days of exposure to beta-cypermethrin. The roles of the beetle gut and its bacteria were partitioned via transcriptome sequencing and 16S rDNA sequencing. The results showed that the elevated activities of CarE were attributed to the beetle gut, whereas GST and CAT were attributed to its bacteria. Pathway enrichment analysis based on a reference database hybridized with the BioCyc and KEGG databases showed that the gluconeogenesis pathway plays an important role in the gut of the beetle to counter the insecticide. The guts may be injured by the insecticide, and the epithelial cells regenerated via the Hippo signaling pathway activated by glutamate. The results from PICRUSt 2 and LEfSe showed a possible community pathway degrading the insecticide in the gut, i.e., beta-cypermethrin was degraded into intermediates (e.g., protocatechuate and catechol) and subsequently degraded by gut bacteria via the ortho- or meta-cleavage pathway.

AB  - Astrocytes play a critical role in brain function, but their contribution during ethanol (EtOH) consumption remains largely understudied. In light of recent findings on the heterogeneity of astrocyte physiology and gene expression, an approach with the ability to identify subtypes and capture this heterogeneity is necessary. Here, we combined measurements of calcium signaling and gene expression to define EtOHinduced astrocyte subtypes. In the absence of a demonstrated EtOH receptor, EtOH is believed to have effects on the function of many receptors and downstream biological cascades that underlie calcium responsiveness. This mechanism of EtOHinduced calcium signaling is unknown and this study provides the first step in understanding the characteristics of cells displaying these observed responses. To characterize underlying astrocyte subtypes, we assessed the correlation between calcium signaling and astrocyte gene expression signature in response to EtOH. We found that various EtOH doses increased intracellular calcium levels in a subset of astrocytes, distinguishing three cellular response types and one nonresponsive subtype as categorized by response waveform properties. Furthermore, single-cell RNA-seq analysis of astrocytes from the different response types identified type-enriched discriminatory gene expression signatures. Combining singlecell calcium responses and gene expression analysis identified specific astrocyte subgroups among astrocyte populations defined by their response to EtOH. This result provides a basis for identifying the relationship between astrocyte susceptibility to EtOH and corresponding measurable markers of calcium signaling and gene expression, which will be useful to investigate potential subgroup-specific influences of astrocytes on the physiology and pathology of EtOH exposure in the brain.

AB  - Simple SummaryNutrition and the seasons are two of the better-known variables that affect the reproductive performance of farm animals. In recent years, many antioxidants have been proposed as a tool to improve male reproductive performance. Although such antioxidants, in most cases, are expensive and artificial, tannin extract presents a cheap and natural source of antioxidants. This research evaluated the supplementation effects of tannin extract (TE) and encapsulated tannin extract (ETE) on testicular measurements, semen quality, hormonal status, and oxidative status, as well as the seasonal effect on the testicular measurements of South African Mutton Merino rams. The results suggest that the encapsulation may afford the maximum benefit of TE on sperm concentration and motility. Treatments did not affect the hormonal and oxidative status. The testicular measurements were significantly higher in autumn compared to winter. The plasma level of cortisol correlates negatively with sperm mass motility, progressive motility, viability, and acrosome integrity.We investigated the supplementation effects of Acacia mearnsii tannin extract (TE) and encapsulated tannin extract (ETE) on reproductive performance and oxidative status of South African Mutton Merino rams. We also observed the season effect on the testicular measurements. Thirty rams were divided into five groups: 0.0 g TE (control), 1.5 g TE, 3 g TE, 1.5 g ETE, and 3 g ETE supplemented daily for 16 weeks transiting from autumn to winter. Bodyweight and testicular measurements were recorded biweekly. Semen and blood samples were collected weekly during the last five weeks of supplementation. Results showed that the increase in the ETE from 1.5 to 3 g increased the testicular length and sperm concentration, as well as decreased the percentages of low and non-progressive spermatozoa (p < 0.05). Simultaneously, the increase in the TE from 1.5 to 3 g decreased semen volume and elevated the percentage of abnormal sperm (p < 0.05). The results suggest that the encapsulation of TE affords the maximum benefit of the TE on the sperm quality. Treatments did not affect the hormonal and oxidative status. Testicular measurements were significantly higher in autumn compared to winter. The plasma level of cortisol significantly correlates negatively with sperm motility, viability, and acrosome integrity.

AB  - Nitrate Vulnerable Zones (NVZs) are faced with a surplus of animal manure due to intensive livestock produc-tion, and the high use of mineral nitrogen (N) fertilisers in crop production. Recovery of N from animal manure to replace synthetic mineral fertilisers is considered a key strategy to close the N loop for more sustainable agriculture and to meet strict legal frameworks. In this study, N recovery from swine wastewater by an ammonia (NH3) stripping process followed by purification via an aerated constructed wetland (ACW) was proposed as an alternative approach to conventional systems based on biological nitrification-denitrification (NDN) treatment. The performance of the NH3 stripping pilot as well as the ACW was monitored in 2019-2020 over three periods, to evaluate the quality of recovered ammonium nitrate (AN) solution and the effluent of the ACW. Results showed that the NH3 stripping unit recovered 21% of total-N (32% of mineral-N) in the form of AN solution. This could be used as a mineral fertiliser according to the criteria of the European Fertilising Products Regulation 2019/1009 and the technical proposal of manure-derived RENURE (REcovered Nitrogen from manURE) prod-ucts by the European Joint Research Centre. As a RENURE product, AN solution would reach an end-of-manure status and could be used as a synthetic N fertiliser replacement. The tested ACW achieved a high removal ef-ficiency with respect to suspended solids (96%), biological oxygen demand (96%), chemical oxygen demand (90%), total-N (80%), and total phosphorus (97%). The quality of ACW effluent was comparable to that of NDN treatment. Though the overall cost of the proposed pilot-scale process consisting of NH3 stripping (5.1 euro t-1) and ACW (12 euro t-1) was calculated slightly higher than conventional NDN treatment (16 euro t-1), it is foreseen to outcompete at a higher loading rate (over 45 m3 ha-1 d-1). Furthermore, post-purification will be needed for the ACW effluent to meet the requirements for discharge to surface water.

AB  - The Italian National Pig Breeders Association (ANAS) manages the breeding programs of the Italian Large White (ILW), Landrace (IL), and Duroc (ID) breeds, mainly oriented to the production of PDO hams. ANAS evaluates the inclusion of genetic resistance in its breeding scheme. This study aimed to estimate variance components and breeding values (EBV) using threshold (TM) and linear (LM) models. During the sib test performed at the genetic station of ANAS from 1997 to 2021, 9,595 (respiratory diseases) and 12,046 (enteritis) diagnoses were collected by the veterinary. The trait was recorded as a dichotomous variable: affected animals with 1, whereas healthy with 2. A multi-breed model was applied with the breed, sex, and farm sector as fixed effects and litter, animal, and residual as random effects. The same model was also applied within each breed, removing the breed effect. The limited data size within single breed did not allow to estimate accurate variance components. With the multi-breed model, low heritabilities were estimated for respiratory (0.09) and enteritis (0.15), with TM and LM leading to the same values. The multibreed model led to more precise variance components estimation and to EBV very close to the ones from the single breed analyses. Pearson and Spearman rank correlations between EBV estimated with TM and LM in the multibreed scenario were >= 0.97. Results of this study demonstrated the feasibility of including disease resistance among the breeding goals of ANAS and that both TM and LM could be used to reach this objective.

AB  - Understanding plant-insect interactions requires the uncovering of the host plant use of insect herbivores, but such information is scarce for most taxa, including nocturnal moth species, despite their vital role as herbivores and pollinators. In this study, we determined the plant species visited by an important moth species, Spodoptera exigua, by analyzing attached pollen on migratory individuals in Northeast China. Pollen grains were dislodged from 2334 S. exigua long-distance migrants captured between 2019 and 2021 on a small island in the center of the Bohai Strait, which serves as a seasonal migration pathway for this pest species, and 16.1% of the tested moths exhibited pollen contamination, primarily on the proboscis. Subsequently, 33 taxa from at least 23 plant families and 29 genera were identified using a combination of DNA barcoding and pollen morphology, primarily from the Angiosperm, Dicotyledoneae. Moreover, the sex, inter-annual, and seasonal differences in pollen adherence ratio and pollen taxa were revealed. Notably, compared to previously reported pollen types found on several other nocturnal moths, we found that almost all of the above 33 pollen taxa can be found in multiple nocturnal moth species, providing another important example of conspecific attraction. Additionally, we also discussed the indicative significance of the pollen present on the bodies of migratory individuals for determining their migratory route. Overall, by delineating the adult feeding and pollination behavior of S. exigua, we advanced our understanding of the interactions of the moths with their host plants, and its migration pattern, as well as facilitated the design of (area-wide) management strategies to preserve and optimize ecosystem services that they provide.

AB  - Learning associative information and extracting regularities from that remembered information to adaptively meet goals is a hallmark of navigating life. Adaptive goal-directive behavior has been historically attributed to prefrontal functions, and more recently to hippocampal relational memory. Disruptions in either of these systems, both frequently seen in Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI), have far reaching consequences in everyday life. In the current study, we investigate the impact of chronic, moderate-to-severe TBI on both relational memory processes as well as the ability to use regularities or rules extracted from that remembered information to guide behavior via both overt responses and eye-tracking. Individuals with and without TBI completed a context-dependent relational memory task designed to assess both 1) the formation and organization of overlapping relational associations (hippocampal-dependent); and 2) the acquisition and flexible use of learned, context-dependent rules (ventromedial prefrontal-dependent). Behavioral measures revealed that relative to neurotypical matched comparison participants, participants with TBI were significantly impaired on context-dependent relational memory measures, but showed spared memory guided rule-use. Eye-tracking data indicated largely intact information gathering at study for participants with TBI, but impaired flexibility at test leading to poor behavioral outcomes. Critically, these data suggest that relational memory impairment is a significant source of behavioral dysfunction in TBI, which likely contributes to poor outcomes in both laboratory testing and real-life, long-term trajectories following injury. Furthermore, this study highlights the feasibility and strength of incorporating eye-tracking into studies of TBI to gain novel insights into information gathering and use across time.

AB  - Simple Summary Porcine parvovirus 7 (PPV7) infection or co-infections with other pathogens have been documented in aborted pig fetuses and in sows that experienced reproductive failure, which has led to concern about the viral infection. Therefore, it is important to investigate the prevalence and genetic characterization of PPV7. In this study, we reported the prevalence and genetic characteristics of PPV7 circulating in swine in Hunan, China. These results will be of interest to those working in virus evolutionary dynamics analysis and would be helpful to provide the impetus and basis to further elucidate the pathogenesis of PPV7.Abstract Porcine parvovirus 7 (PPV7) was first discovered in swine in 2016, and PPV7 infection has been detected in aborted pig fetuses and in sows that experienced reproductive failure. The objective of this study was to report the prevalence and genetic characterization of PPV7 in Hunan, China. Seventy of the four hundred and twenty-two (16.6%) serum, semen, and tissue samples collected from pigs were positive for PPV7. One complete PPV7 strain and eighteen complete cap gene sequences were obtained; nucleotide and amino acid identity among the nineteen Cap sequences were 88.1-99.4% and 88.1-100%, respectively. They shared identity with previously discovered sequences ranging from 86.6 to 98.9% and 83.7 to 99.8% at the nucleotide- and amino acid-level, respectively. The phylogenetic tree analysis exhibited that PPV7 strains had two major groups based on the presence or absence of five amino acid (181-185) insertions on the Cap protein. Analysis of the Cap protein demonstrated that PPV7 Cap had significant variability, implying that PPV7 evolved at high substitution rates. Substantial variations of that PPV7 Cap may enable the emergence of newly mutated capsid profiles due to its viral adaptation to host responses. Furthermore, antigenic alteration owing to PPV7 Cap protein amino acid mutations at immune epitopes may enable viruses to escape from the host's immune system. This study determined the prevalence and genetic characteristics of PPV7 circulating in swine in Hunan, China, and provided the impetus and basis to further investigate the pathogenicity and epidemiology of PPV7.

AB  - Protein kinases regulate protein activity through phosphorylation, and many have been reported to participate in brain development. Among them, serine/threonine-protein kinase 24 (STK24) is believed to influence apoptosis, spinal synaptogenesis, and neuronal migration. Despite its recognized roles, the functions of STK24 in the brain remains insufficiently explored. Here, we present an in vivo study of brain-specific Stk24 conditional knockout mice. We investigate the impact of Stk24 deletion through histological analysis, behavior assays, and the molecular changes. In our results, Stk24 deletion disrupts the hippocampal formation during development and decreased subsequent adult hippocampal neurogenesis whilst neuronal morphology is relatively unaffected. Additionally, Stk24-deficient mice exhibit anxiety-like behavior and altered stress responses, featuring increased hippocampal neuronal activity, dysregulated HPA axis reactivity, and modified expression patterns of glucocorticoid receptor signaling-related genes. In conclusion, our findings highlight the involvement of Stk24 in brain development, adult hippocampal neurogenesis, as well as anxiety and stress responses.

AB  - In the course of a lifetime the crowns of teeth wear off, cementum thickens and the pulp closes-in or may stiffen. Little is known about how these changes affect the tooth response to load. Using a series of finite element models of teeth attached to the jawbone, and by comparing these to a validated model of a 'young' pig 3-rooted tooth, the effects of these structural changes were studied. Models of altered teeth show a stiffer response to mastication even when material properties used are identical to those found in 'young' teeth. This stiffening response to occlusal loads is mostly caused by the thicker cementum found in 'old' teeth. Tensile stresses associated with bending of dentine in the roots fall into a narrower distribution range with lower peak values. It is speculated that this is a possible protective adaptation mechanism of the aging tooth to avoid fracture. The greatest reduction in lateral motion was seen in the bucco-lingual direction. We propose that greater tooth motion during mastication is typical for the young growing animal. This motion is reduced in adulthood, favoring less off-axis loading, possibly to counteract natural bone resorption and consequent compromised anchoring.

AB  - Mysids have become the preferred diet for Sepia and Hippocampus breeding due to their nutritional content and size. Despite their potential as a high-quality feed, limited literature exists on the specific nutritional needs of N. orientalis and how diet influences their reproduction. This study investigated the effects of various diets - Corethron sp., Chlorella sp., mixed algae, and flakes -on the survival, total reproductive output, and whole tissue nutritional composition of N. orientalis . The main results were as follows: 1) N. orientalis fed with Corethron sp. exhibited the highest survival (90.11 +/- 5.09% at 14 d; 57.78 +/- 5.09% at 21 d); 2) Significant differences in total reproductive output were observed among the dietary groups, with the mixed diet group showing the highest output (121.67 +/- 5.03 ind), followed by the Corethron sp. group (102.67 +/- 3.51 ind); 3) Principal component analysis revealed that the nutritional composition of mysids predominantly comprises C18:2n-6, C22:6n-3, En-3 PUFA, Asp, Glu, Val, Phe, and TAA; 4) Correlation analysis indicated a strong positive correlation between the dietary C18:2n-6 and En-3 PUFA and the survival and total reproductive output of N. orientalis . Additionally, the dietary C20:4n-6 and C20:5n-3 showed a strong positive correlation with the C22:5n-3 and En3 PUFA in N. orientalis . A similar strong positive correlation was observed between dietary amino acids and those in mysids. In conclusion, the study demonstrates that different diets directly influence the nutritional composition of mysids, affecting their survival and total reproductive output during the breeding period. Consequently, Corethron sp. emerges as a suitable diet for N. orientalis , enriching C20:5n-3 and En-3 PUFA, which fulfills the nutritional requirements of N. orientalis during their reproductive period, thereby enhancing individual survival and reproduction.

AB  - Wastewater generated by the pork industry urgently requires the implementation of low-cost, high-benefit, and efficient treatment systems. Accordingly, a microalgae-bacteria consortia-based treatment system is proposed for the removal of contaminants released, by the pork-producing industry, in swine wastewater. In this study, different inoculum concentrations of the microalgae-bacteria consortium were tested to document variation in the removal of nutrients from the wastewater. At varying concentrations, it was efficient and did not present a significant difference in the removal kinetics. The treatment with the greatest amount of inoculum removed close to 87% of total nitrogen, approximately 70% of orthophosphate, and 77% of chemical oxygen demand. Removals of 84% iron, 44% copper, and 48% manganese were also obtained. These results demonstrate that microalgae-bacteria consortia are an economically viable and environmentally desirable option for the efficient treatment of wastewater from the pork industry.

AB  - The application of the circular economy concept should utilize the cycles of nature to preserve materials, energy and nutrients for economic use. A full-scale pig farm plant was developed and validated, showing how it is possible to integrate a circular economy concept into a wastewater treatment system capable of recovering energy, nutrients and enabling water reuse. A low-cost swine wastewater treatment system consisting of several treatment modules such as solid-liquid separation, anaerobic digestion, biological nitrogen removal by nitrifi-cation/denitrification and physicochemical phosphorus removal and recovery was able to generate 1880.6 +/- 1858.5 kWh d(-1) of energy, remove 98.6% of nitrogen and 89.7% of phosphorus present in the swine manure. In addition, it was possible to produce enough fertilizer to fertilize 350 ha per year, considering phosphorus and potassium. In addition, the effluent after the chemical phosphorus removal can be safely used in farm cleaning processes or disposed of in water bodies. Thus, the proposed process has proven to be an environmentally su-perior swine waste management technology, with a positive impact on water quality and ensuring environmental sustainability in intensive swine production.

AB  - Bats form a diverse order of mammals with a crucial ecological role. Bat populations appear to be declining because of human-induced environmental stress. Genetic methods can contribute to detailed investigations of species diversity and assessments of population status. Here, we aimed to study the genetic diversity of bats across the Rhodope Moun-tain Range, where species with a large distribution as well as rare species with a limited distribution are found. Bat sam-ples were collected and morphologically identified within the catchment area of Nestos (Mesta) River and from caves in the region of Momchilgrad - Komotini. Based on the analysis of a mitochondrial COI gene region of 650 bp length, the samples were classified in 9 distinct genera and 21 species, an important part of Balkan bat species diversity. Min-iopterus schreibersii displayed the highest number of haplotypes and Rhinolophus hipposideros the highest mtDNA di-versity levels. The majority of the samples were grouped with other European sequences and no specific geographic distribution of haplotypes was observed, except for Barbastella barbastellus and Hypsugo savii, where a western/eastern divide is apparent. Three species with the highest number of samples were further analyzed using 4-5 microsatellite markers per species. No sign of population differentiation was found between studied samples for these three species and moderate to high diversity levels were detected for Rhinolophus blasii and Rhinolophus euryale, in contrast to mito-chondrial analysis. The results confirm the presence of specific bat species in the cross-border area of Greece and Bulgaria through genetic identification and provide information for levels of genetic variation for some of them that may con-tribute to future bat management efforts in the region.

AB  - This paper describes advances made to aerial surveys of macropods in New South Wales and Queensland. Regular aerial surveys of macropods across large areas of Australia's arid and semi-arid rangelands were established as a response to concerns for the species' conservation. They became integral to the harvest management of the four macropod species - Eastern Grey Kangaroo (Macropus giganteus), Western Grey Kangaroo (M. fuliginosus), Red Kangaroo (Osphranter rufus) and Common Wallaroo (O. robustus). Harvest quotas are set as a proportion of population size, requiring absolute estimates of abundance. Counts were made in strip transects from fixed-wing aircraft, but required correction for animals that are missed. In New South Wales and Queensland, counts are now made using line transect sampling, providing survey-specific correction. Helicopters are used in more rugged and timbered areas and where Common Wallaroo can be more frequently found and harvested. Mark-recapture distance sampling is used in more open country that can be surveyed using fixed-wing aircraft and improves the accuracy of density estimates by accounting for animals missed on the transect line. Macropod populations are likely to be surveyed in the future by airborne imagery and by drones, but the technology needs further development. Spatial models could usefully provide small-scale density estimates and address non-random sampling.

AB  - Acromyrmex subterraneus molestans (Hymenoptera: Formicidae) is a leaf-cutting ant species found in the Brazilian Cerrado and the Atlantic Forest and causes serious damages to cultivated plants. Knowledge about its foraging activity could help to improve the integrated pest management of this species and to better understand its ecology. The relationship between ambient temperature and the biomass collected by individuals of one Ac. subterraneus molestans colony was studied in the laboratory. The colony remained in an experimental room at 24 degrees C and its foragers had access to an arena in an incubator set at six different temperatures (10, 16, 22, 28, 34 or 40 degrees C). Fresh leaves of Hibiscus sp. were put in the arena and the flow of ants leaving and returning to the nest, the proportion of ants returning to the nest with a leaf fragment, as well as the dry mass of these fragments, were evaluated during 1 h for each temperature. The head width of foraging ants (laden and unladen) and their running speed were also measured. The rate of biomass collected was almost null at 10 degrees C, increased from 16 to 34 degrees C, and decreased abruptly at 40 degrees C. The size of the workers did not vary across temperatures, and the running speed increased with increasing temperatures but more rapidly for unloaded ants than for loaded ones. The lower flow intensity at 28 and 40 degrees C was somewhat compensated at the individual level by the selection of larger leaf fragments or by an increase in the probability to return loaded to the nest, respectively. The results obtained in this study could improve the management of these ants, allowing to target the most favourable meteorological conditions to apply toxic baits, increase the probability for the baits to be carried to the nest, in addition to reducing their availability to nontarget organisms. Furthermore, they could be used to make predictions on the effects of global warming on the foraging activity of this species.

AB  - Immunocastration vaccines achieve their effects through neutralization of the endogenous hormone by the humoral antibody produced against the immunized genes, but there is little information regarding cell-mediated immune response on the gonadal function of the immunized model is available. In this study, we used ram as a model animal to identify the cellular immune response in testicular tissues of rams immunized with intranasal KISS1 gene vaccine. The immune castration model was evaluated by sexual behaviours, spermatogenesis and serum hormone profiles after the KISS1 gene immunization. Transcriptome analysis of testicular tissues was carried out to identify the expressions of protein-coding genes involved in cellular immunity. The results showed that we successfully constructed the KISS1 immune castration ram model, in which testicular growth and development, testosterone and kisspeptin-54 levels, and sexual function were suppressed in immunized rams (p < .05). Using Hiseq (TM) 2000 high sequencing for ram testicular, we identified 21 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) related to cellular immunity, of which, 14 genes were upregulated and seven genes were downregulated in the testis of the immunized group (p < .05). The Gene Ontology (GO) and the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) enrichment showed that these differentially expressed genes were enriched in the antigen presentation process mediated by MHC class I and the cytotoxic pathway mediated by natural killer cells. It is concluded that KISS1 gene vaccine induced the cell-mediated immune response in testicular tissue to suppress reproductive activities in rams.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Due to the increasing presence of insecticide resistance across cereal aphid populations, new aphid management strategies, including the engineering of host resistance to aphids into commercial wheat varieties, are required. Previous studies have identified ancestor wheat, Triticum monococcum accessions MDR045 and MDR049, with resistance against the grain aphid, Sitobion avenae. To test the hypothesis that resistance can be accounted for by antixenosis (reduced attractiveness of host plants) via the release of repellent volatile organic compounds (VOCs), we explored the response of S. avenae to MDR045 and MDR049 following S. avenae herbivory, using behaviour and electrophysiology experiments. RESULTS: In four-arm olfactometry assays, alate S. avenae showed aphid density-dependent reduced preference to VOC extracts from T. monococcum MDR045 and MDR049. By contrast, alate S. avenae showed aphid density-dependent increased preference to extracts from aphid-susceptible hexaploid wheat, Triticum aestivum var. Solstice and T. monococcum MDR037. Coupled gas chromatography-electroantennography (GC-EAG), using the antennae of alate S. avenae, located 24 electrophysiologically active compounds across all tested accessions. Synthetic blends created from 21 identified EAG-active compounds confirmed bioactivity of corresponding VOC extracts in four-arm olfactometry assays against alate S. avenae. CONCLUSION: Our data suggest that resistance of T. monococcum MDR045 and MDR049 to S. avenae can be at least partially accounted for by antixenosis through antennal perception of specific repellent VOC blends induced by S. avenae feeding behaviour.

AB  - ContextThe bandgap of metal monochalcogenides (MMCs) is a key property that governs their physical and chemical properties. Accurate measurement of the bandgap is essential for a range of applications, including optoelectronics and photovoltaics. However, many theoretical approximations fail to accurately calculate the bandgap for MMCs, making it difficult to obtain precise values. This study investigated the suitability of the FP-LAPW/GAM-MPW1K scheme for determining the bandgap of MMCs. The investigation included lattice parameters, bandgap, band structure, and density of states, which were compared against both previous theoretical calculations and available experimental data. The findings of the study indicate that the FP-LAPW/GAM-MPW1K approach accurately calculates the bandgap value of MMCs by efficiently treating d-state electrons. The results are consistent with prior studies, confirming the method's reliability in determining the bandgap of these semiconductors.Methodsour study used the GAM-MPW1K functional and the full potential linearized augmented plane wave method (FP-LAPW) in the ELK code to calculate the lattice parameters, electronic band structure, and bandgap of ZnS, ZnSe, ZnTe, CdS, CdSe, and CdTe compounds in the wurtzite structure. The crystallographic data were obtained from the COD database and the inputs were prepared by CIF2CELL code. The results were visualized using Xmgrace and VESTA software.

AB  - Simple Summary Oocytes obtained from the ovaries of slaughtered prepubertal ewes can be incorporated into an in vitro embryo production system. The collection of this material is possible at two different times of the year, spring and autumn. The first period is linked to the natural reproductive cycle of the sheep. The second, on the other hand, is linked to the manipulation of the reproductive seasonality which allows the oestrus cycle to be controlled artificially. The analysis highlighted that the collection season influences oocytes quality from prepubertal donors in terms of improved energetic and oxidative status, microtubular organization, and developmental competence in oocytes recovered in spring. Data obtained underline that oocytes seem to be genetically and evolutionarily programmed to give their best in spring, this being the most favorable period for newborns. The reproductive seasonality of domestic animals is often manipulated in order to have more reproductive periods for commercial purposes related to the production of milk and meat. It is scientifically proven that such an alteration of the reproductive activity in sheep entails a deterioration in oocyte quality, leading to an inability to generate embryos. Since oocytes obtained from prepubertal ewes can be incorporated into an in vitro embryo production system and considering that their quality is crucial to the success of in vitro procedures, the aim of this work was to investigate the effect of seasons on the quality of prepubertal ovine oocytes collected in autumn and spring. Ovaries were collected from a local slaughterhouse from 30-40-day-old suckling lambs during both seasons. Following 24 h of in vitro maturation, oocytes developmental competence, reactive oxygen species (ROS) intracellular levels, and mitochondrial activity were evaluated, and a tubulin assessment was performed. The results on embryo production, as a percentage of first divisions and number of blastocysts obtained, were significantly higher in oocytes collected in the spring. Mitochondrial activity in oocytes was higher, and ROS production significantly lower, in spring than in autumn. Tubulin PTMs (tyrosinated and acetylated alpha-tubulin) showed a higher immunoreactivity in oocytes collected in spring compared with autumn sampling. Our data showed that seasons may affect the developmental competence, energetic status, and tubulin assessment of oocytes recovered from prepubertal ewes. Therefore, special care should be taken when choosing the period of the year for prepuberal ovine oocytes collection aimed at in vitro embryo reproduction programs.

AB  - Tetralogy of Fallot is a congenital heart disease affecting newborns and involves stenosis of the right ventricular outflow tract (RVOT). Surgical correction often widens the RVOT with a transannular enlargement patch, but this causes issues including pulmonary valve insufficiency and progressive right ventricle failure. A monocusp valve can prevent pulmonary regurgitation; however, valve failure resulting from factors including leaflet design, morphology, and immune response can occur, ultimately resulting in pulmonary insufficiency. A multimodal platform to quantitatively evaluate the effect of shape, size, and material on clinical outcomes could optimize monocusp design. This study introduces a benchtop soft biorobotic heart model, a computational fluid model of the RVOT, and a monocusp valve made from an entirely biological cell-assembled extracellular matrix (CAM) to tackle the multifaceted issue of monocusp failure. The hydrodynamic and mechanical performance of RVOT repair strategies was assessed in biorobotic and computational platforms. The monocusp valve design was validated in vivo in ovine models through echocardiography, cardiac magnetic resonance, and catheterization. These models supported assessment of surgical feasibility, handling, suturability, and hemodynamic and mechanical monocusp capabilities. The CAM-based monocusp offered a competent pulmonary valve with regurgitation of 4.6 +/- 0.9% and a transvalvular pressure gradient of 4.3 +/- 1.4 millimeters of mercury after 7 days of implantation in sheep. The biorobotic heart model, in silico analysis, and in vivo RVOT modeling allowed iteration in monocusp design not now feasible in a clinical environment and will support future surgical testing of biomaterials for complex congenital heart malformations.

AB  - The combination of 4-week repeated social defeat stress (RSDS) and Opisthorchis felineus infection was modeled in C57BL/6 mice. Various parameters were compared between three experimental groups of male mice (SS: mice subjected to RSDS, OF: mice infected with O. felineus, and OF + SS: mice subjected to both adverse factors) and behavior-tested and intact (INT) controls. The combination caused liver hypertrophy and increased the blood level of proinflammatory cytokine interleukin 6 and proteolytic activity of cathepsin B in the hippocampus. Meanwhile, hypertrophy of the spleen and of adrenal glands was noticeable. Anxious behavior in the elevated plus-maze test was predominantly due to the infection, with synergistic effects of an interaction of the two adverse factors on multiple parameters in OF + SS mice. Depression-like behavior in the forced swimming test was caused only by RSDS and was equally pronounced in SS mice and OF + SS mice. Helminths attenuated the activities of cathepsin B in the liver and hypothalamus (which were high in SS mice) and increased cathepsin L activity in the liver. The highest blood level of corticosterone was seen in SS mice but was decreased to control levels by the trematode infection. OF mice had the lowest level of corticosterone, comparable to that in INT mice. Thus, the first data were obtained on the ability of O. felineus helminths-even at the immature stage-to modulate the effects of RSDS, thereby affecting functional connections of the host, namely "helminths -> liver <-> brain axis."

AB  - Apelin (APLN) is an adipokine mainly produced by adipose tissue and related to an individual's nutritional status as well as digestive apparatus functions. In this work, APLN and its receptor (APLNR) were investigated, by immunohistochemistry, in the abomasum and duodenum of 15 Comisana x Appenninica adult sheep reared in a semi-natural pasture. Organ samples were collected after maximum pasture flowering (M x F group) and after maximum pasture dryness (M x D group); the experimental group (E x p group) received a feed supplementation of 600 grams/day/head of barley and corn in addition to M x D group feeding. APLN and APLNR were identified in the lining epithelium and the fundic gland chief cells of the abomasum. APLNR was observed in the lining epithelium, in the crypts and the serotonin secreting cells of the duodenum. Similar reactivity was observed between the M x F and E x p groups, while the M x D group showed a lower intensity of immunostaining for both APLN and APLNR in all positive structures but the duodenal serotonin neuroendocrine cells. Hence, our findings show that the E x p group presents a picture quite overlapped with M x F and suggest that food supplementation has a maintaining effect on the apelinergic system expression in the investigated digestive tracts of the sheep.

AB  - A mixture of valine (Val) and isoleucine (Ile) not only decreases the negative impact of very low protein (VLP) diets on the growth of pigs, but also influences the nitrogen (N) balance and lipid metabolism; however, the underlying pathways are not well understood. This study aimed to investigate the effect of dietary Val and Ile on lipogenesis, lipolysis, and ureagenesis under protein restriction. After one week of acclimation, forty three-week-old pigs were randomly assigned to following dietary treatments (n = 8/group) for 5 weeks: positive control (PC): normal protein diet; negative control (NC): VLP diet; HV: NC supplemented with Val; HI: NC supplemented with Ile; and HVI: NC supplemented with both Val and Ile. HVI partially improved the body weight and completely recovered the feed intake (FI) of pigs fed with NC. HVI increased thermal radiation and improved the glucose clearance. HVI had a lower blood triglyceride than PC and blood urea N than NC. NC and HV promoted lipogenesis by increasing the transcript of fatty acid synthase (FAS) in the liver and lipoprotein lipase (LPL) in adipose tissue but reducing hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL) in the liver. HVI reduced the increased rate of lipogenesis induced by the NC group through normalizing the mRNA abundance of hepatic FAS, sterol regulatory element binding transcription factor 1, and HSL and LPL in adipose tissue. NC, HV, HI, and HVI reduced the ureagenesis by decreasing the protein abundance of carbamoyl phosphate synthetase I, ornithine transcarboxylase, and arginosuccinate lyase in the liver. Overall, HVI improved the growth, FI, and glucose clearance, and decreased the rate of lipogenesis induced by VLP diets.

AB  - Background Blowflies are ubiquitous insects, often shiny and metallic, and the larvae of many species provide important ecosystem services (e.g., recycling carrion) and are used in forensics and debridement therapy. Yet, the taxon has repeatedly been recovered to be para- or polyphyletic, and the lack of a well-corroborated phylogeny has prevented a robust classification. Results We here resolve the relationships between the different blowfly subclades by including all recognized subfamilies in a phylogenomic analysis using 2221 single-copy nuclear protein-coding genes of Diptera. Maximum likelihood (ML), maximum parsimony (MP), and coalescent-based phylogeny reconstructions all support the same relationships for the full data set. Based on this backbone phylogeny, blowflies are redefined as the most inclusive monophylum within the superfamily Oestroidea not containing Mesembrinellidae, Mystacinobiidae, Oestridae, Polleniidae, Sarcophagidae, Tachinidae, and Ulurumyiidae. The constituent subfamilies are re-classified as Ameniinae (including the Helicoboscinae, syn. nov.), Bengaliinae, Calliphorinae (including Aphyssurinae, syn. nov., Melanomyinae, syn. nov., and Toxotarsinae, syn. nov.), Chrysomyinae, Luciliinae, Phumosiinae, Rhiniinae stat. rev., and Rhinophorinae stat. rev. Metallic coloration in the adult is shown to be widespread but does not emerge as the most likely ground plan feature. Conclusions Our study provides the first phylogeny of oestroid calyptrates including all blowfly subfamilies. This allows settling a long-lasting controversy in Diptera by redefining blowflies as a well-supported monophylum, and blowfly classification is adjusted accordingly. The archetypical blowfly trait of carrion-feeding maggots most likely evolved twice, and the metallic color may not belong to the blowfly ground plan.

AB  - Allene oxide synthase (AOS) is a key enzyme involved in the biosynthesis of 12-oxo-phytodienoic acid (OPDA) and jasmonic acid and plays an important role in plant defense against herbivore attacks. In the liverwort, Marchantia polymorpha, we previously identified cytosol-type MpAOS1 and chloroplast-type MpAOS2 that show AOS activities. However, there is no direct evidence to show the subcellular localization of MpAOSs and their contribution to plant defense via OPDA production in M. polymorpha. In this study, we generated M. polymorpha mutants, with the MpAOS1 and MpAOS2 genes disrupted via CRISPR/Cas9-mediated genome editing; the loss of OPDA production was analyzed in double knockout mutants. On AOS mutants, the survival rate and oviposition of spider mites (Tetranychus urticae) increased relative to those on wild-type plants. Overall, these findings suggest that defense systems via OPDA-signaling pathways in response to spider mites have been established in M. polymorpha.

AB  - Neurotrophin-4 (NT-4), a neurotrophic factor, appears to affect early embryonic development because it is secreted not only by neurons but also by oviductal and uterine epithelial cells. However, no studies have characterized the effects of NT-4 on early embryonic development in pigs. In this study, we applied the experimental model of parthenogenetic-activation (PA)-derived embryos. Herein, we investigated the effect of NT-4 supplementation during the in vitro culture (IVC) of embryos, analyzed the transcription levels of specific genes, and outlined the first cell lineage specification for porcine PA-derived blastocysts. We confirmed that NT-4 and its receptor proteins were localized in both the inner cell mass (ICM) and trophectoderm (TE) in porcine blastocysts. Across different concentrations (0, 1, 10, and 100 ng/mL) of NT-4 supplementation, the optimal concentration of NT-4 to improve the developmental competence of porcine parthenotes was 10 ng/mL. NT-4 supplementation during porcine IVC significantly (p < 0.05) increased the proportion of TE cells by inducing the transcription of TE lineage markers (CDX2, PPAG3, and GATA3 transcripts). NT-4 also reduced blastocyst apoptosis by regulating the transcription of apoptosis-related genes (BAX and BCL2L1 transcripts) and improved blastocyst quality via the interaction of neurotrophin-, Hippo-yes-associated protein (Hippo-YAP) and mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular regulated kinase (MAPK/ERK) pathway. Additionally, NT-4 supplementation during IVC significantly (p < 0.05) increased YAP1 transcript levels and significantly (p < 0.01) decreased LATS2 transcript levels, respectively, in the porcine PA-derived blastocysts. We also confirmed through fluorescence intensity that the YAP1 protein was significantly (p < 0.001) increased in the NT-4-treated blastocysts compared with that in the control. NT-4 also promoted differentiation into the TE lineage rather than into the ICM lineage during porcine early embryonic development. In conclusion, 10 ng/mL NT-4 supplementation enhanced blastocyst quality by regulating the apoptosis- and TE lineage specification-related genes and interacting with neurotrophin-, Hippo-YAP-, and MAPK/ERK signaling pathway during porcine in vitro embryo development.

AB  - Myostatin (MSTN) is a major gene target for skeletal muscle overgrowth in animals. We hypothesized that deletion of the entire mature peptide encoded by MSTN in pigs would knock out its bioactive form and accordingly stimulate skeletal muscle overgrowth. Thus, we engineered two pairs of single-guide RNAs (sgRNAs) to target exons 1 and 3 of MSTN in primary fetal fibroblasts of Taoyuan black pigs. We found that sgRNAs targeting exon 3, which encodes the mature peptide, had higher biallelic null mu-tation efficiency than those targeting exon 1. Somatic cell nuclear transfer was conducted using the exon 3 mutation cells as donor cells to generate five cloned MSTN null piglets (MSTN-/-). Growth testing revealed that both the growth rate and average daily weight gain of MST-/- pigs were greater than those of wild-type (MSTN & PLUSMN;/& PLUSMN;) pigs. Slaughter data demonstrated that the lean ratio of MSTN-/- pigs was 11.3% higher (P < 0.01) while the back-fat thickness was 17.33% lower (P < 0.01) than those of MSTN & PLUSMN;/& PLUSMN; pigs. Haematoxylin-eosin staining indicated that the increased leanness of MSTN-/- pigs resulted from muscle fibre hyperplasia rather than hypertrophy.HE staining showed markedly decreased adipocyte size in MSTN-/- pigs. We also critically examined the off-target and random integration by resequencing, which showed that the founder MSTN-/- pigs contained no non-target mutations or exogenous plasmid elements. This study is the first to report the successful knock out of the mature MSTN peptide using dual sgRNA-mediated deletion, leading to the most prominent alteration of meat production traits in pigs published thus far. This new strategy is expected to have a wide impact on genetic improvements in food animals. & COPY; 2023 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Nitrate (NO3-) in mine waste rock derived from undetonated NH4NO3 can contaminate receiving waters. An in-situ bioremediation experiment was conducted at a coal mining operation in Elk Valley, British Columbia, Canada to remediate NO3-from large volumes of mine water. Over the test period (201 d), 5000 to 7500 m(3) d(-1) of NO3-rich (mean concentration 22 mg N L-1) mine water was injected into saturated waste rock along with methanol, nutrients, and a conservative tracer (Br). Complete denitrification (< 0.5 mg N L-1) was recorded in monitoring wells located 38 m from the injection wells after 114 to 141 d of operation. Plots of delta N-15- and delta O-18-NO3- versus NO3-N concentrations for monitoring wells yielded isotopic enrichment factors (epsilon) for delta N-15- and delta O-18-NO3-of -25.7 and -13.2 parts per thousand for high C/C-0 NO3-concentrations (> 10.5 mg N L-1) and -5.5 and -3.6 parts per thousand for lower C/C-0 values. The fraction of NO3- denitrified (Dp) calculated using bi-linear epsilon values for delta N-15- and delta O-18 reproduced the Dp determined independently using a conservative tracer indicating that stable isotope tracers of the NO3-reducing processes in bioremediation are invaluable to determine Dp. Based on the success of this ongoing bioremediation experiment, the technology is being applied at other sites.

AB  - Liver fibrosis occurs in many chronic liver diseases, while severe fibrosis can lead to liver failure. A chitosan-phenol based self-healing hydrogel (CP) integrated with decellularized liver matrix (DLM) is proposed in this study as a 3D gel matrix to carry hepatocytes for possible therapy of liver fibrosis. To mimic the physiological liver microenvironment, DLM is extracted from pigs and mixed with CP hydrogel to generate DLM-CP self-healing hydrogel. Hepatocyte spheroids coated with endothelial cells (ECs) are fabricated using a customized method and embedded in the hydrogel. Hepatocytes injured by exposure to CCl4-containing medium are used as the in vitro toxin-mediated liver fibrosis model, where the EC-covered hepatocyte spheroids embedded in the hydrogel are co-cultured with the injured hepatocytes. The urea synthesis of the injured hepatocytes reaches 91% of the normal level after 7 days of co-culture, indicating that the hepatic function of injured hepatocytes is rescued by the hybrid spheroid-laden DLM-CP hydrogel. Moreover, the relative lactate dehydrogenase activity of the injured hepatocytes is decreased 49% by the hybrid spheroid-laden DLM-CP hydrogel after 7 days of co-culture, suggesting reduced damage in the injured hepatocytes. The combination of hepatocyte/EC hybrid spheroids and DLM-CP hydrogel presents a promising therapeutic strategy for hepatic fibrosis.
   In this study, hepatocytes exposed to a carbon tetrachloride-containing medium are utilized as the in vitro model of toxin-mediated liver fibrosis. The model involved co-culturing endothelial cell (EC)-covered hepatocyte spheroids embedded in hydrogel with the injured hepatocytes. The results suggest that the combination of hepatocyte/EC hybrid spheroids and decellularized liver matrix-chitosan-phenol hydrogel offers potential benefits for treating hepatic fibrosis. image

AB  - During herbivore feeding, plants can recognize herbivore-associated molecular patterns (HAMPs) present in saliva and trigger pattern-triggered immunity (PTI). Piercing-sucking insects secrete gel saliva, forming salivary sheaths that aid in feeding. However, the role of proteins within these salivary sheaths in modulating plant defences remains poorly understood. In this study, we identified a novel HAMP, Nlsp5, from the salivary sheath of the brown planthopper (Nilaparvata lugens, BPH). Nlsp5 is a planthopper-specific protein and acts as an elicitor of BAK1-dependent PTI responses in both tobacco and rice plants. Moreover, the 19-amino-acid peptide (NP19) within Nlsp5 functions as a minimal immunogenic epitope, which is specifically recognized by plants, stimulating jasmonic acid and hydrogen peroxide pathways. Through exogenous treatment with synthetic NP19 and overexpressing Nlsp5 in rice, we further found that the induced defence responses not only impaired planthopper performance directly but also triggered the emission of volatile compounds that attract a common parasitoid. Additionally, NP19 treatment enhanced the resistance of rice, tobacco, and cotton to several chewing and sap-sucking insects. However, silencing Nlsp5 in BPH disrupted salivary sheath formation, reducing insect feeding efficiency. This study demonstrates that Nlsp5 from the BPH salivary sheath acts as an unavoidable HAMP, triggering resistance in multiple plants to various insect pests. The critical role of this protein in insect feeding precludes evolutionary adaptations to evade detection by plants.

AB  - Simple Summary Long-term evolution has resulted in plants developing defense mechanisms against herbivores, including physical defenses (such as hard outer skin, needles, thorns, etc.) and chemical defenses (such as toxic plant secondary metabolites, etc.) that interfere with animal eating, digestion, and metabolism, thus restricting animals' food choices. In this study, we investigated the effects of dietary tannic acid on the digestion and mucosal barrier function of Brandt's voles. The results revealed that plant tannins are a very powerful deterrent for Brandt's voles. This research advances our broad knowledge of interactions between plants and herbivores, as well as the ecological significance of plant secondary metabolites. Brandt's vole (Lasiopodomys brandtii) is a small herbivorous mammal that feeds on plants rich in secondary metabolites (PSMs), including tannins. However, plant defense mechanisms against herbivory by Brandt's voles are not clearly established. This study aimed to investigate the effects of dietary tannic acid (TA) on the growth performance, intestinal morphology, digestive enzyme activities, cecal fermentation, intestinal barrier function, and gut microbiota in Brandt's voles. The results showed that TA significantly hindered body weight gain, reduced daily food intake, changed the intestinal morphology, reduced digestive enzyme activity, and increased the serum zonulin levels (p < 0.05). The number of intestinal goblet and mast cells and the levels of serum cytokines and immunoglobulins (IgA, IgG, TNF-alpha, IL-6, and duodenal SlgA) were all reduced by TA (p < 0.05). Moreover, TA altered beta-diversity in the colonic microbial community (p < 0.05). In conclusion, the results indicate that TA could damage the intestinal function of Brandt's voles by altering their intestinal morphology, decreasing digestive ability and intestinal barrier function, and altering microbiota composition. Our study investigated the effects of natural PSMs on the intestinal function of wildlife and improved our general understanding of plant-herbivore interactions and the ecological role of PSMs.

AB  - Background Recent studies show that gender may have a significant impact on brain functions. However, the reports of sex effects on spatial ability and synaptic plasticity in rodents are divergent and controversial. Here spatial learning and memory was measured in male and female rats by using Morris water maze (MWM) task. Moreover, to assess sex difference in hippocampal synaptic plasticity we examined hippocampal long-term potentiation (LTP) at perforant pathway-dentate gyrus (PP-DG) synapses. Results In MWM task, male rats outperformed female rats, as they had significantly shorter swim distance and escape latency to find the hidden platform during training days. During spatial reference memory test, female rats spent less time and traveled less distance in the target zone. Male rats also had larger LTP at PP-DG synapses, which was evident in the high magnitude of population spike (PS) potentiation and the field excitatory post synaptic potentials (fEPSP) slope. Conclusions Taken together, our results suggest that sex differences in the LTP at PP-DG synapses, possibly contribute to the observed sex difference in spatial learning and memory.

AB  - To successfully locomote across leaf surfaces, which vary in roughness and inclination, beetles evolved tarsal structures (setae and claws) that allow attachment. Structures form a synergistic system, with adhesive setae being effective on smoother surfaces, while claws are adapted for larger asperities. Many beetles also migrate using flight, attaching to surfaces during landing. However, the role of tarsal structures in this dynamic form of attachment is far less studied. To explore this question, we separated Hippodamia convergens beetles into three groups, manipulating setae or claws in two while the final group was unmodified. We exposed groups to diverse surfaces at different inclines, inducing flight and observing landing success. Logistic regression showed that landing success was significantly lower in modified groups compared with the control, but surface type did not have a strong effect. Interestingly, the claw removal group had low success across all surfaces/inclines, highlighting the importance of this feature.

AB  - The acoustic signals of sheep grazing carry a wealth of information. To date, the information on grazing behavior and intake in acoustic signals has been thoroughly explored and utilized. However, information on grass growth conditions (grass conditions) has received little attention from scholars, although it is crucial for making rotational grazing decisions. This study tries to efficiently mine and process the grass condition information in acoustic signals to obtain a high-performing recognition model. First, the acoustic signals collected under three grass conditions were divided into many segment samples. Second, six types of formal samples were constructed from every segment sample. Last, the log-Mel features of the six formal samples were separately fed into a convolutional neural network (CNN) model or a recurrent neural network (RNN) model to identify the grass conditions. Before the log-Mel features were fed into the model, two methods of unifying the sample length and multiple specified lengths were used to pre-process the formal samples. The results showed that the combination of the fixed chewing and biting connection (FCB) sample and the CNN model performed the best, with an accuracy of 90.24%. The method of filling or truncating the sample's waveform tended to be better than scaling the sample's log-Mel feature when the specified length was longer than 8 s. The different specified lengths had an essential effect on the accuracy of the model with the filling method. The application of this study could provide a data reference for constructing a more rational rotational grazing strategy.

AB  - The ability of herbivorous insects to discriminate suitable host plants for the development of their progeny is not homogenous. Herbivores with broader diets show weaker correlation between oviposition preference and offspring performance in comparison with specialist insects. The neural constraints hypothesis postulates that due to neural limitation, generalist insects would have greater difficulty in processing a large number of stimuli from diverse host plants. Under this framework, it is expected that generalists would be more efficient in discriminating suitable plants when faced with more similar stimuli from closely related plants (simplified environment), and less efficient when faced with more diverse stimuli from unrelated plants (complex environment). In this study, we evaluated this in the generalist aphid Myzus persicae (Sulzer) (Hemiptera: Aphididae). Preference was evaluated as the aphid's ability to discriminate between congeneric plant species or between plants from different families. The congeneric host plants were the cultivated potato, Solanum tuberosum L., the wild potato, Solanum commersonii Dunal, tomato, Solanum lycopersicum L., and eggplant, Solanum melongena L. (Solanaceae). The plant species of different families used were spinach, Spinacia oleracea L. (Amaranthaceae), squash, Cucurbita maxima Duchesne (Cucurbitaceae), and basil, Ocimum basilicum L. (Lamiaceae). Performance was evaluated as the population growth in one generation on whole-plant conditions and on excised leaves. The results showed positive correlations between settlement and larviposition preferences and the performance of M. persicae for all comparisons between unrelated plant species. Positive correlations between preference and performance were also observed for two of the three comparisons between congeneric plants. These results indicate that M. persicae can efficiently discriminate between suitable plants for their progeny regardless of the degree of relatedness of the plants, which is at odds with the neural constraints hypothesis. The results contribute to the knowledge of host selection mechanisms in generalist herbivores, particularly in an underrepresented insect group.

AB  - Electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy is an established technique to site-specifically monitor conformational changes of spin-labeled biomolecules. Emerging in-cell EPR approaches aiming to address spin-labeled proteins in their native environment still struggle to reach a broad applicability and to target physiologically relevant protein concentrations. Here, we present a comparative in vitro and in-cell double electron-electron resonance (DEER) study demonstrating that nanomolar protein concentrations are at reach to measure distances up to 4.5 nm between protein sites carrying commercial gadolinium spin labels.

AB  - Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRS) is a chronic disease, which is related to reproductive and respiratory and caused by PRRS virus (PRRSV) binding to specific porcine receptors in pigs. Different pig breeds have different infection and resistance abilities to PRRSV. To study the expression levels of genes related to PRRSV infection and resistance in healthy lung tissues form different pig breeds, we collected lung tissue from healthy Tibetan pigs (TB), Wuzhishan pigs (WZS),and Meishan pigs (MS), as well as Bama mini-pigs (BM). For each breed, we used three independent biological replicates. Real-time fluorescence quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) was performed to detect the expression levels of CD163, CD169, CD151, MYD88, TRAF6, TLR3, IFN-alpha, IFN-gamma, IL-1 beta, IL-6, IL-8, CCl4, NF-kB, and CD86. The results showed that CD163, CD169, CD151, IFN-alpha, IFN-gamma, IL-1 beta, CCl4 and NF-kB had significant differences among different breeds. Our results of different related gene expression among pig breeds might provide new insights into the genetic strategies for improvement of resistance to PRRSV infection in pigs.

AB  - Bis(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP) is the most used member of the phthalate class of compounds. Extensive use of this plasticizer allows daily exposure to humans via various routes. A positive relationship between DEHP exposure and neurobehavioral disorders is suspected. But, there are insufficient data on the harmfulness of neurobehavioral disorders caused by DEHP exposure, particularly at daily exposure levels. In this study, we assessed the consequences of daily DEHP ingestion (2 and 20 mg/kg diets) in male mice for at least 100 days and examined its effects on neuronal functions associated with neurobehavioral disorders, such as depression and cognitive decline. We found the marked depressive behaviors and reduced learning and memory function in the DEHP-ingestion groups, and that biomarkers related to chronic stress were increased in plasma and brain tissues. Long-term DEHP ingestion induced collapse of glutamate (Glu) and glutamine (Gln) homeostasis as a result of disruption of the Glu-Gln cycle in the medial prefrontal cortex and hippocampus. The reduced glutamatergic neurotransmission activity caused by DEHP ingestion was demonstrated using an electrophysiological method. This study revealed that long-term exposure to DEHP is hazardous and can cause neurobehavioral disorders, even at daily exposure levels.

AB  - "Yinghong 9" is a widely cultivated large-leaf variety in South China, and the black tea made from it has a high aroma and strong sweet flavor. "Huangyu" is a light-sensitive tea variety with yellow leaves. It was cultivated from the bud-mutation of "Yinghong 9" and has a very low level of chlorophyll during young shoot development. Due to chlorophyll being involved in carbon fixation and assimilation, the changes in photosynthesis might potentially affect the accumulation of flavor metabolites, as well as the quality of "Huangyu" tea. Although "Huangyu" has a golden yellow color and high amino acid content, the mechanism underlying the formation of leaf color and drinking value remains unclear. The widely targeted metabolomics and GC-MS analysis were performed to reveal the differences of key metabolites in fresh and fermented leaves between "Yinghong 9" and "Huangyu." The results showed that tea polyphenols, total chlorophyll, and carotenoids were more abundant in "Yinghong 9." Targeted metabolomics analysis indicated that kaempferol-3-glycoside was more abundant in "Yinghong 9," while "Huangyu" had a higher ratio of kaempferol-3-glucoside to kaempferol-3-galactoside. Compared with "Yinghong 9" fresh leaves, the contents of zeaxanthin and zeaxanthin palmitate were significantly higher in "Huangyu." The contents of alpha-farnesene, beta-cyclocitral, nerolidol, and trans-geranylacetone, which were from carotenoid degradation and involved in flowery-fruity-like flavor in "Huangyu" fermented leaves, were higher than those of "Yinghong 9." Our results indicated that "Huangyu" was suitable for manufacturing non-fermented tea because of its yellow leaf and flowery-fruity-like compounds from carotenoid degradation.

AB  - (1) Background: Adiponectin is an adipocyte-secreted hormone that has antidepressant- and anxiolytic-like effects in preclinical studies. Here, we investigated the antidepressant- and anxiolytic-like effects of sub-chronic treatment with AdipoRon, an adiponectin receptor agonist, and its potential linkage to changes in hippocampal adult neurogenesis and synaptic plasticity. (2) Methods: Different cohorts of wild-type C57BL/6J and CamKII alpha-Cre male mice were treated with sub-chronic (7 days) AdipoRon, followed by behavioral, molecular, and electrophysiological experiments. (3) Results: 7-day AdipoRon treatment elicited antidepressant- and anxiolytic-like effects but did not affect hippocampal neurogenesis. AdipoRon treatment reduced hippocampal brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) levels, neuronal activation in the ventral dentate gyrus, and long-term potentiation of the perforant path. The knockdown of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor subunits GluN2A and GluN2B in the ventral hippocampus did not affect the antidepressant- and anxiolytic-like effects of AdipoRon. (4) Conclusions: Increasing adiponectin signaling through sub-chronic AdipoRon treatment results in antidepressant- and anxiolytic-like effects independent of changes in hippocampal structural and synaptic function.

AB  - Introduction Tea-oil Camellia species play a crucial economic and ecological role worldwide, yet their mitochondrial genomes remain largely unexplored.Methods In this study, we assembled and analyzed the complete mitochondrial genomes of Camellia oleifera and C. meiocarpa, revealing multi-branch structures that deviate from the typical circular mitochondrial genome observed in most plants. The assembled mitogenomes span 953,690 bp (C. oleifera) and 923,117 bp (C. meiocarpa), containing 74 and 76 annotated mitochondrial genes, respectively.Results Comparative genomic analyses indicated that C. oleifera and C. meiocarpa share a closer genetic relationship, whereas C. drupifera is more distantly related. Codon usage analysis revealed that natural selection plays a dominant role in shaping codon bias in these mitochondrial genomes. Additionally, extensive gene transfer events were detected among the three species, highlighting the dynamic nature of mitochondrial genome evolution in Tea-oil Camellia. Phylogenetic reconstruction based on mitochondrial genes exhibited incongruence with chloroplast phylogenies, suggesting potential discordance due to hybridization events, incomplete lineage sorting (ILS), or horizontal gene transfer (HGT). Furthermore, we identified species-specific mitochondrial markers, which provide valuable molecular tools for distinguishing Tea-oil Camellia species.Discussion Our findings enhance the understanding of mitochondrial genome evolution and genetic diversity in Tea-oil Camellia, offering essential genomic resources for phylogenetics, species identification, and evolutionary research in woody plants.

AB  - The functional and neurophysiological distinction between the dorsal and ventral hippocampus affects also GABAergic inhibition. In line with this notion, ventral CA1 pyramidal cells displayed a more dynamic and effective response to inhibitory input compared to their dorsal counterparts. We posit that this difference is effected by the dorsal-ventral gradient of activin A, a member of the transforming growth factor-beta family, which is increasingly recognized for its modulatory role in brain regions involved in cognitive functions and affective behavior. Lending credence to this hypothesis, we found that in slices from transgenic mice expressing a dominant-negative mutant of activin receptor IB (dnActRIB), inhibitory transmission was enhanced only in CA1 neurons of the dorsal hippocampus, where the basal activin A level is much higher than in the ventral hippocampus. We next asked how a rise in endogenous activin A would affect GABAergic inhibition along the longitudinal axis of the hippocampus. We performed ex vivo recordings in wild-type and dnActRIB mice after overnight exposure to an enriched environment (EE), which engenders a robust increase in activin A levels in both dorsal and ventral hippocampi. Compared to control mice from standard cages, the behaviorally induced surge in activin A produced a decline in ventral inhibition, an effect that was absent in slices from dnActRIB mice. Underscoring the essential role of activin in the EE-associated modulation of ventral inhibition, this effect was mimicked by acute application of recombinant activin A in control slices. In summary, both genetic and behavioral manipulations of activin receptor signaling affected the dorsal-ventral difference in synaptic inhibition, suggesting that activin A regulates the strength of GABAergic inhibition in a region-specific fashion.

AB  - Plants have evolved numerous secretory structures that fulfill diverse roles and shape their interactions with other organisms. Rivea ornata (Roxb.) Choisy (Convolvulaceae) is one species that possesses various external secretory organs hypothesized to be ecologically important. This study, therefore, aimed to investigate five secretory structures (nectary disc, petiolar nectaries, calycinal glands, staminal hairs, and foliar glands) using micromorphology, anatomy, histochemistry, and field observations of plant-animal interactions in order to assess the functional contributions of these structures. Results show that the nectary disc and petiolar nectaries are complex working units consisting of at least epidermis and ground tissue, while the other structures are glandular trichomes. Various groups of metabolites (lipids, phenolic compounds, polysaccharides, terpenoids, flavonoids, and alkaloids) were detected in all structures, while starch grains were only found in the nectary disc, petiolar nectaries, and their adjacent tissues. Integrating preliminary observation of animal visitors with micromorphological, anatomical, and histochemical results, two hypotheses are proposed: (I) nectary disc and staminal hairs are important for pollination as they potentially attract and reward floral visitors, and (II) petiolar nectaries, calycinal glands, and foliar glands contribute to plant defense. Specifically, petiolar nectaries and calycinal glands provide protection from herbivores via guard ants, while calycinal and foliar glands may use plant metabolites to help prevent tissue damage from dehydration and insolation.

AB  - Central nervous system infections caused by pathogens crossing the blood-brain barrier are extremely damaging and trigger cellular alterations and neuroinflammation. Bacterial brain infection, in particular, is a major cause of hippocampal neuronal degeneration. Hippocampal neurogenesis, a continuous multistep process occurring throughout life in the adult brain, could compensate for such neuronal loss. However, the high rates of cognitive and other sequelae from bacterial meningitis/encephalitis suggest that endogenous repair mechanisms might be severely affected. In the current study, we used Group B Streptococcus (GBS) strain NEM316, to establish an adult mouse model of brain infection and determine its impact on adult neurogenesis. Experimental encephalitis elicited neurological deficits and death, induced inflammation, and affected neurogenesis in the dentate gyrus of the adult hippocampus by suppressing the proliferation of progenitor cells and the generation of newborn neurons. These effects were specifically associated with hippocampal neurogenesis while subventricular zone neurogenesis was not affected. Overall, our data provide new insights regarding the effect of GBS infection on adult brain neurogenesis.

AB  - Changes in keratin gene expression and spatiotemporal regulation determine the compositional content and cellular localization of wool keratin, thereby affecting wool traits. Therefore, keratin gene family member 32 (KRT32) was selected for a study using RT-qPCR, immunofluorescence, and penta-primer amplification refractory mutation system (PARMS) techniques. The results showed that KRT32 mRNA was highly expressed in the skin and localized to the inner root sheath (IRS), outer root sheath (ORS) and dermal papilla (DP). Sequencing results identified eight SNPs in KRT32, and association analyses revealed that the variations were significantly associated with multiple traits in wool (p < 0.05), including MFD, CF and MFC. The constructed haplotype combination H2H3 has higher CF and smaller MFD than other haplotype combination (p < 0.05). In conclusion, KRT32 can be used as a candidate gene for molecular genetic improvement of wool in Gansu Alpine Fine-wool sheep.

AB  - The gut microbiota plays a key role in the brain function impairment caused by chronic stress, yet its exact mechanism remains unclear. Many studies have revealed the important role of miR-124 in the central nervous system. Meanwhile, previous studies have indicated that miR-124 may be regulated by chronic stress and gut microbiota. Here, we aimed to explore whether miR-124 serves as a mediator for the impacts of gut microbial dysbiosis on brain function in mice subjected to chronic stress. Repeated daily restraint stress for 4 weeks was used to induce chronic stress in mice. Chronic stress resulted in gut microbial dysbiosis, abnormal behaviors, and a decrease in hippocampal miR-124 levels. Treatment with different probiotic mixtures significantly alleviated the effects of chronic stress on hippocampal miR-124 levels and mouse behaviors. Suppression of hippocampal miR-124 expression reversed the beneficial effects of probiotics on cognitive function, neurogenesis, and related molecular markers in chronically stressed mice. Bioinformatics analysis and qPCR suggested that Ptpn11 might be a target gene for miR-124 in mediating the effects of gut microbial dysbiosis on brain function in these mice. These findings suggest that miR-124 is a pivotal regulator that mediates the detrimental effects of gut microbial dysbiosis on brain function and the subsequent cognitive impairment during chronic stress.

AB  - In Pavlovian fear conditioning, contingency awareness provides an indicator of explicit fear learning. A less studied aspect of fear-based psychopathologies and their treatment, awareness of learned fear is a common cause of distress in persons with such conditions and is a focus of their treatment. The present work is a substudy of a broader fear-conditioning fMRI study. Following fear conditioning, we identified a subset of individuals who did not exhibit explicit awareness of the CS-US contingency. This prompted an exploratory analysis of differences in "aware" versus "unaware" individuals after fear conditioning. Self-reported expectancies of the CS-US contingency obtained immediately following fear conditioning were used to differentiate the two groups. Results corrected for multiple comparisons indicated significantly greater BOLD signal in the bilateral dlPFC, right vmPFC, bilateral vlPFC, left insula, left hippocampus, and bilateral amygdala for the CS+>CS- contrast in the aware group compared with the unaware group (all p values <= 0.004). PPI analysis with a left hippocampal seed indicated stronger coupling with the dlPFC and vmPFC in the aware group compared with the unaware group (all p values <= 0.002). Our findings add to our current knowledge of the networks involved in explicit learning and awareness of conditioned fear, with important clinical implications.

AB  - The occurrence of co-infected hosts and questing ticks with more than one tick-borne pathogen-as in the case of Anaplasma phagocytophilum and Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato-is expected in endemic regions. Their synergy-in terms of pathogenesis and disease severity-has been suggested previously in humans. Limited data exist on the clinicopathological alterations in co-infected sheep. In this study, we investigated the impact of A. phagocytophilum and B. burgdorferi s.l. seropositivity, alone and in combination, on the hematological parameters of naturally infected sheep. A complete blood count was performed, and indirect immunofluorescence assays were used to detect IgG antibodies against A. phagocytophilum and IgG and IgM antibodies against B. burgdorferi s.l. Single natural exposure to B. burgdorferi s.l. was characterized by low Packed Cell Volume (PCV) values and platelet (PLT) counts, while single exposure to A. phagocytophilum was characterized by low PCV values, low white blood cell (WBC) counts, and an increased risk for leukopenia and neutropenia. Co-exposure resulted in the most severe blood abnormalities; all the blood parameters decreased, and the sheep presented an increased risk for anemia. Our study showed that natural co-exposure to A. phagocytophilum and B. burgdorferi s.l. in sheep leads to more severe blood abnormalities and enhances the pathogenic processes. More studies are needed to clarify the possible background mechanisms.

AB  - Comparing patterns of performance and kinematics across behavior, development and phylogeny is crucial to understand the evolution of complex musculoskeletal systems such as the feeding apparatus. However, conveying 3D spatial data of muscle orientation throughout a feeding cycle, ontogenetic pathway or phylogenetic lineage is essential to understanding the function and evolution of the skull in vertebrates. Here, we detail the use of ternary plots for displaying and comparing the 3D orientation of muscle data. First, we illustrate changes in 3D jaw muscle resultants during jaw closing taxa the American alligator (Alligator mississippiensis). Second, we show changes in 3D muscle resultants of jaw muscles across an ontogenetic series of alligators. Third, we compare 3D resultants of jaw muscles of avian-line dinosaurs, including extant (Struthio camelus, Gallus gallus, Psittacus erithacus) and extinct (Tyrannosaurus rex) species to outline the reorganization of jaw muscles that occurred along the line to modern birds. Finally, we compare 3D resultants of jaw muscles of the hard-biting species in our sample (A. mississippiensis, T. rex, P. erithacus) to illustrate how disparate jaw muscle resultants are employed in convergent behaviors in archosaurs. Our findings show that these visualizations of 3D components of jaw muscles are immensely helpful towards identifying patterns of cranial performance, growth and diversity. These tools will prove useful for testing other hypotheses in functional morphology, comparative biomechanics, ecomorphology and organismal evolution.

AB  - In recent research, biochar has been proven to reduce the greenhouse gases and promote organic matter during the composting. However, gas degradation may be related to the microstructure of compost. To investigate the mechanism of biochar additive, composting was performed using swine manure, wheat straw and biochar and representative solid compost samples were analyzed to characterize the mixed biochar and compost particles. We focused on the microscale, such as the particle size distributions, surface morphologies, aerobic layer thicknesses and the functional groups. The biochar and compost particle agglomerations gradually became weaker and the predominant particle size in the experiment group was < 200 mu m. The aerobic layer thickness (Lp) was determined by infrared spectroscopy using the wavenumbers 2856 and 1568 cm-1, which was 0-50 mu m increased as composting proceeded in both groups. The biochar increased Lp and facilitated oxygen penetrating the compost particle cores. Besides, in the biochar-swine manure particle interface, the aliphatic compound in the organic components degraded and the content of aromaticity increased with the composting process, which was indicated by the absorption intensity at 2856 cm-1 decreasing trend and the absorption intensity at 1568 cm-1 increasing trend. In summary, biochar performed well in the microscale of compost pile.

AB  - Simple Summary Plant-insect interactions are a significant driver of terrestrial biodiversity. Evolutionary studies of such interactions have been hindered by the lack of reliable host plant records, which have primarily been obtained through field observations. More recently, traditional or next-generation sequencing methods have been used successfully to detect host plant DNA in DNA extracted from plant-feeding insects, but most such studies have focused on chewing insects that ingest plant tissues with large quantities of DNA. In this study, next-generation sequencing data were used to determine the feasibility of detecting plant genes in sap-sucking insects, which may ingest very little plant DNA. Although no plant-specific probes were used to generate the sequence data, multiple plant genes were retrieved in the by-catch data. Our results suggest that next-generation sequencing may present a powerful tool for detecting and characterizing potential host plants using DNA extracted from phytophagous insects, including sap feeders. Reliable host plant records are available for only a small fraction of herbivorous insect species, despite their potential agricultural importance. Most available data on insect-plant associations have been obtained through field observations of occurrences of insects on particular plants. Molecular methods have more recently been used to identify potential host plants using DNA extracted from insects, but most prior studies using these methods have focused on chewing insects that ingest tissues expected to contain large quantities of plant DNA. Screening of Illumina data obtained from sap feeders of the hemipteran family Cicadellidae (leafhoppers) using anchored hybrid enrichment indicates that, despite feeding on plant fluids, these insects often contain detectable quantities of plant DNA. Although inclusion of probes for bacterial 16S in the original anchored hybrid probe kit yielded relatively high detection rates for chloroplast 16S, the Illumina short reads also, in some cases, included DNA for various plant barcode genes as "by-catch". Detection rates were generally only slightly higher for Typhlocybinae, which feed preferentially on parenchyma cell contents, compared to other groups of leafhoppers that feed preferentially on phloem or xylem. These results indicate that next-generation sequencing provides a powerful tool to investigate the specific association between individual insect and plant species.

AB  - (1) Background: Helleborus purpurascens Waldst. & Kit. (hellebore) is a plant species found mainly in Balkans and the Carpathians, and it is traditionally used for a variety of ailments since the time of Hippocrates. The aim of this study was to investigate the immunomodulatory effect of hellebore extracts correlated with relevant chemical compounds and the extraction method. (2) Methods: A methanolic (H1) and a hydroalcoholic extract (H2) were prepared by standard methods. Qualitative (HPTLC) and quantitative (HPLC) chemical analysis were conducted to reveal the ecdysones and polyphenolic compounds. In vitro studies were performed using rat macrophages, murine fibroblasts and immortalized human T-lymphocytes, and their viability was determined by MTS assay. In vivo studies involved a rat immunodepression model. (3) Results: In vitro assays revealed the stronger effect of H2 on cellular proliferation, compared to H1. In the in vivo assay, H2 revealed an immunostimulatory effect in the context of experimentally induced immunosuppression with dexamethasone, a superior effect to levamisole treatment according to the same regimen, in two doses every 24 h. There was no correlation between pharmacological effect and the reference compounds evaluated. (4) Conclusions: The immunomodulatory effect of methanolic and hydroalcoholic hellebore extracts is not due to ecdysones and polyphenolic compounds, but other polar substances, possible steroid glycosides.

AB  - Analysis of piglet suckling behaviour is important for the evaluation of piglet nutrient ingestion, health, welfare, and affinity with the sow. In this study, an action density estimation network (ADEN) was proposed for counting the events of piglet suckling followed by automated analysis of suckling behaviour. ADEN is a two-stream network primarily composed of 1) a network stream that processes video images with a higher frame rate (faster stream) and 2) a network stream that processes video images with a lower frame rate (slower stream). Each stream consists of a ResNet-50 with five convolutional stages. A multi-stage attention connection (MSAC), composed of four Spatial-Temporal-Channel (STC) multi-attention structures, is proposed to bridge Faster Stream and Slower Stream and capture discriminative features. The output attention features from each faster stream stage are laterally fused into the corresponding slower stream stage in a concatenating manner. Following this, the features from the last convolutional stages in the Slow stream and Fast stream are fused using concatenation and are then decoded by using three convolutional layers. The last convolutional layer outputs a heatmap on the action density of piglet suckling behaviour. Finally, the number of suckling events is predicted by integrating all the pixel values in the heatmap. Experimental and comparative tests were conducted to validate the effectiveness of the proposed ADEN with a training dataset and a test dataset from 14 pig pens. The 507 video clips (126,750 images for 7 h) from the 1-9th pens were selected as training datasets. The 143 video clips (35,750 images for 2 h) from the 10-13th pens were selected as short-term test datasets. One untrimmed video (162,000 images for 9 h) from the 14th pen was used to ultimately evaluate the action density estimation performance of the ADEN. ADEN was compared with seven approaches and its superiority was demonstrated with an r = 0.938, an RMSE = 1.080, and a MAE = 0.967 in short video clips and r = 0.982, MAE = 0.161, and RMSE = 0.563 in the untrimmed long video. The ADEN proved it feasible to predict the number of suckling events by using action density estimation.

AB  - Introduction Aphids are phloem sap-sucking insects and are a serious destructive pest of several crop plants. Aphids are categorized as "generalists" or "specialists" depending on their host range. Myzus persicae (Sulz.) is a generalist aphid with a broad host range while Lipaphis erysimi (Kalt.), a specialist aphid, has a narrow host range. Aphid infestation involves several sequential stages including host recognition and selection, overcoming primary plant defence barriers, feeding on phloem sap and detoxification of host defence responses. Information on the molecular basis of variations between generalist and specialist aphids with reference to the above processes is limited.Methods In the current study, we generated transcriptome data of M. persicae and L. erysimi from adult and nymph stages and analysed the differential expression of genes between adults of the generalist and specialist aphid and similarly, between nymphs of the two aphid species. We categorized these differentially expressed genes into nine different categories namely, chemosensation-related, plant cell wall degrading enzymes, detoxification-related, digestive enzymes, peptidases, carbohydrate-, lipid-, amino acid-metabolism and reproduction. We also identified putative effector molecules in both M. persicae and L. erysimi from the transcriptome data,Results and discussion Gene expression analysis identified 7688 and 8194 differentially expressed unigenes at adult and nymph stages, respectively of M. persicae and L. erysimi. M. persicae showed significantly higher levels of expression in a greater number of unigenes (5112 in adults and 5880 in nymphs) in contrast to the specialist, L. erysimi (2576 in adults and 2314 in nymphs) in both developmental stages. In addition, M. persicae displayed a greater number (350 in adults and 331 in nymphs) of upregulated unigenes involved in important processes such as host recognition, plant cell wall degradation, detoxification, digestion and metabolism, which correlate with its dynamic and polyphagous nature in contrast to the specialist (337 in adults and 251 in nymphs). We also observed a greater number of putative effectors in M. persicae (948 in adults and 283 in nymphs) than L. erysimi (797 in adults and 245 in nymphs). Based on our analysis, we conclude that the generalist aphid, M. persicae has a more diversified and stronger arsenal of genes that influence its polyphagous feeding behaviour and effective response to plant defence mechanisms against insect-herbivory. Our study provides a compendium of such candidate genes that would be most useful in studies on aphid biology, evolution and control.

AB  - Developmental exposure to arsenic (As) has been linked to irreversible adverse health outcomes in offspring. However, the underlying molecular mechanisms remain a mystery. Here, maternal mice were exposed to As via drinking water. Subsequently, the hippocampi of their offspring were collected at different developmental stages to explore the dynamic changes during hippocampal maturation and the effects of As. Time-series RNA-seq analysis revealed a significant temporal correlation between As neurodevelopmental toxicity and the mRNA expression profile of the hippocampal region during critical postnatal developmental windows. Further, downregulation of genes associated with neurogenesis and telomere maintenance was observed. Notably, dynamic changes in hippocampal telomeres were observed in response to As exposure, with critically shortened telomeres inhibiting neural stem cells (NSCs) proliferation, impairing neuroblast maturation, and reducing the number and size of neurospheres. Additionally, the populations of BrdU+ and MAP2+ cells were decreased while GFAP+ cells were increased, indicating a decline in NSCs stemness. Furthermore, As exposure significantly impaired dendritic complexity in the hippocampus of mice, altered dendritic spine morphology, and disrupted synaptic ultrastructure, ultimately leading to cognitive impairment. These findings highlight the importance of analyzing telomere dynamics in environmental toxicology and offer insights into the neurotoxic mechanisms of maternal As on offspring development.

AB  - Bacteria were isolated from 250 specimens obtained from patients attending the Plastic Reconstructive and Burn Surgery Hospital in the Sulaymaniyah (Kurdistan region) and the burn and wound care units of the Azadi Teaching Hospital (Kirkuk), Iraq. Gram-negative bacteria were isolated from 100 (40%) of the samples which identified by BD phoenix, 66 isolates (66%) were carbapenem-resistant species, Rapidec (R) Carba NP test and sensitivity tests revealed 17 different genera and species of carbapenem-resistant bacteria. The BD Phoenix system was used to evaluate the susceptibility test of the isolates to 18 different antibiotics. The number of isolates that exhibited resistance to the carbapenem antibiotics, ertapenem, imipenem and meropenem, was 40 (61%), 35 (54%) and 28 (42%) respectively. Meanwhile, the number of isolates resistant to the penicillin antibiotics, ampicillin, amoxicillin-clavulanic acid and piperacillintazobactam, was 61 (92%), 54 (82%) and 24 (36%) respectively. The isolates were also evaluated for their resistance to the cephalosporins, cefazolin, cefuroxime, ceftazidime, ceftriaxone, cefepime, and ceftolozane-tazobactam; the respective number of resistant isolates were 60 (91%), 60 (91%), 39 (59%), 48 (73%), 42 (64%) and 27(41%). In contrast, a fraction of Ziziphus spina-christi leaves that was extracted using ethyl acetate inhibited all of the carbapenem-resistant isolates studied. The zone of inhibition (ZoI) & Oslash; was between 19 and 24 mm. The ZoI & Oslash; of black deer musk was 11-19 mm. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MICs) of ethyl acetate extract of Ziziphus Pseudomonas fluorescens, CR-Escherichia vulneris, CR-Kluyvera ascorbata, CR-Pantoea agglomerans, CR-Pseudomonas putida and CR-Serratia marcescens, was 6.25 mg/mL. Meanwhile, the MIC for Acinetobacter calcoaceticus-baumannii complex, Citrobacter freundii, Enterobacter cloacae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Morganella morganii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia was 12.5 mg/mL. High-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) was used to analyse the components of the ethyl acetateextract of Ziziphus spina-christi leaves. The analysis found gallic acid (760.3 ppm/mL), caffeine (84.0 ppm/mL) and quercetin (2.2 ppm/mL); the total phenolic content was 846.5 ppm/mL. The evidence obtained from this study indicates that leaves of this plant (named sidr in the Middle East) have the potential to be used as a natural antibiotic against carbapenem-resistant Gram-negative bacteria. Thus, the leaves of this tree present an important opportunity in the development of novel therapeutic agents. The study found the MIC of fluorescens, CR-Pseudomonas putida and CR-Serratia marcescens to be 50 mg/mL. In contrast, the MIC of deer musk was 100 mg/mL aeruginosa and CR-Stenotrophomonas maltophilia. The results of the gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) indicate that the primary constituents of musk were1,4,4-tetramethyltetralin, 7-acetyl-6-ethyl-1, diethyl phthalate and tonalid; their contribution to the whole ranged from 12.2% to 19.6%. Black musk exhibits considerable antibacterial activity, able to inhibit seventeen different species of carbapenem-resistant Gram-negative bacteria. The non-natural form of black musk can be used to scent detergent.

AB  - Onion (Allium cepa L.) is a highly cross pollinated crop that needs insect pollination (entomophily) for optimum seed set. In the present study, more than 120 insect species were noted to visit onion flowers, out of which fifty-nine species were collected through in-situ sampling technique and identified up to species level. The Indian bee (Apis cerana indica) was the most abundant insect pollinator visiting onion flowers in the study location. The pollination behaviour and foraging activity of A. c. indica were assessed, and the pollen foragers were observed to be swift flyers visiting a significantly higher number of flowers per minute during the peak flowering period and spending less time per flower (3 seconds) to collect nectar from deep seated nectaries of the flowers. The seed yield enhancement assessed through entomophily and artificial pollination methods showed that the open pollinated flowers recorded the highest yield statistically, followed by A. c. indica and A. mellifera pollinated flowers. However in artificial pollination treatments, sponge puff pollinated flowers recorded significantly high seed yield per hectare and percentage seed set per umbel, followed by camel brush, hand gloves (cloth) and hand gloves (rubber). In conclusion, all the cross pollination treatments were statistically significant on the closed pollination treatment concerning to the entire yield parameters calculated.

AB  - BACKGROUND: When sperm are cryopreserved, reactive oxygen species (ROS) are formed that are detrimental to the sperm. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effects of oleic acid and trehalose added to ram semen extender on sperm parameters, lipid peroxidation (MDA), and superoxide dismutase (SOD) enzyme levels of spermatozoa following the freeze/thawing processes. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Ejaculates were collected from four rams and pooled at 35 degrees C. Pooled ejaculates were diluted with oleic acid at 0 mM and trehalose at 0 mM (O0 T0) as the control. The Tris-based extender was supplemented with either 0.5 (O0.5) or 1 (O1) mM of oleic acid or 25 (T25) or 50 (T50) mM of trehalose alone, and in combination [0.5 mM oleic acid + 25 mM trehalose (O0.5T25), 0.5 mM oleic acid + 50 mM trehalose (O0.5T50), 1 mM oleic acid + 25 mM trehalose (O1T25) and 1 mM oleic acid + 50 mM trehalose (O1T50)]. The semen was frozen by the traditional liquid nitrogen vapour method and stored at -196 degrees C in the liquid nitrogen tank. RESULTS: Semen extender containing O1T25 significantly improved the total motility, when compared with other treatment groups (P < 0.05), except for O1T50. O1T50 had a higher viability rate than any other treatment. The addition of O1T25 and O1T50 increased DNA and membrane integrity of spermatozoa post-thawing compared to other treatments (P<0.05). The level of MDA was significantly (P<0.05) lower in extenders supplemented with O1, O0.5T25, O0.5T50, O1T25 and O1T50 compared to the other treatment groups. In addition, SOD levels were higher in groups treated with O1T25 and O1T50 than the other treatment groups (P<0.05). CONCLUSION: The addition of a combination of oleic acid and trehalose concentrations to Tris-based extender improved the quality of ram semen post-thawing.

AB  - The city of Lhasa is located in the central Tibetan Plateau and is the most densely populated area. As the first continuous monitoring of atmospheric mercury (Hg) species in a city in the Tibetan Plateau, our monitoring in Lhasa showed that the concentrations of gaseous elemental Hg (GEM), gaseous oxidized Hg (GOM), and particle-bound Hg (PBM) during the subsequent Indian summer monsoon (S-ISM) period were 2.73 +/- 1.48 ng m(-3), 38.4 +/- 62.7 pg m(-3), and 59.1 +/- 181.0 pg m(-3), respectively. During the westerly circulation (WEC) period, the GEM, GOM, and PBM concentrations were 2.11 +/- 2.09 ng m(-3), 35.8 +/- 43.3 pg m(-3), and 52.9 +/- 90.1 pg m(-3), respectively. The GOM and PBM concentrations were higher than those of previous monitoring in the Tibetan Plateau and other provincial capitals in China. Typical high-value occurrence processes were studied to investigate random events with high atmospheric Hg concentrations in Lhasa. Combustion events nearby or further away may be the main contributor of the high-concentration events. The lowest GEM concentrations occurred in the afternoon, and persistently high concentrations were observed at night. The changes in GEM concentrations were consistent with the trends of other pollutant concentrations and contradictory to those of the wind speed. The high GEM concentrations at night can be attributed to the lower boundary layer height and lower wind speed. For both GOM and PBM, higher GOM concentrations occurred during the day and PBM during the night. The results of the principal component analysis indicated that local sources and wind speed are important factors influencing atmospheric Hg concentrations in Lhasa. The trajectory simulation showed that the source of the GEM in Lhasa gradually shifted from the south to the west of Lhasa from the S-ISM to the WEC periods, while both the southern and western sources were important in the late WEC period. The concentrations and change patterns of Hg species in Lhasa were significantly different than those at other monitoring sites in the Tibetan Plateau. Monitoring Hg species in Lhasa shows the possible maximum anthropogenic influences in the Tibetan Plateau and demonstrates the dramatic effect of wind on changes in urban atmospheric Hg concentrations.

AB  - Creatine is abundant in maternal plasma and fetal fluids, and enzymes required for metabolism of creatine are expressed in uteri and placentomes throughout gestation in sheep, indicating a role for creatine metabolism in fetal--placental development.
   The placenta requires high levels of adenosine triphosphate to maintain a metabolically active state throughout gestation. The creatine-creatine kinase-phosphocreatine system is known to buffer adenosine triphosphate levels; however, the role(s) creatine-creatine kinase-phosphocreatine system plays in uterine and placental metabolism throughout gestation is poorly understood. In this study, Suffolk ewes were ovariohysterectomized on Days 30, 50, 70, 90, 110 and 125 of gestation (n = 3-5 ewes/per day, except n = 2 on Day 50) and uterine and placental tissues subjected to analyses to measure metabolites, mRNAs, and proteins related to the creatine-creatine kinase-phosphocreatine system. Day of gestation affected concentrations and total amounts of guanidinoacetate and creatine in maternal plasma, amniotic fluid and allantoic fluid (P < 0.05). Expression of mRNAs for arginine:glycine amidinotransferase, guanidinoacetate methyltransferase, creatine kinase B, and solute carrier 16A12 in endometria and for arginine:glycine amidinotransferase and creatine kinase B in placentomes changed significantly across days of gestation (P < 0.05). The arginine:glycine amidinotransferase protein was more abundant in uterine luminal epithelium on Days 90 and 125 compared to Days 30 and 50 (P < 0.01). The chorionic epithelium of placentomes expressed guanidinoacetate methyltransferase and solute carrier 6A13 throughout gestation. Creatine transporter (solute carrier 6A8) was expressed by the uterine luminal epithelium and trophectoderm of placentomes throughout gestation. Creatine kinase (creatine kinase B and CKMT1) proteins were localized primarily to the uterine luminal epithelium and to the placental chorionic epithelium of placentomes throughout gestation. Collectively, these results demonstrate cell-specific and temporal regulation of components of the creatine-creatine kinase-phosphocreatine system that likely influence energy homeostasis for fetal-placental development.

AB  - Simple Summary Data on hepatitis E virus (HEV) strains circulating in carnivores are still limited. However, serological evidence suggests that their exposure to HEV infection is more common than expected. In addition, close relatives of Orthohepevirus C detected in rats and in human patients with persistent hepatitis have been detected in ferrets, minks, and foxes, providing a rationale for investigating the presence of HEV or HEV-like viruses in wild carnivores. Herewith, we report the identification and the nearly full-genome (7212 nucleotides) characterization of an HEV Gt3 strain detected in a faecal specimen collected from a wolf found dead in Northwestern Italy. This finding poses questions concerning the potential role of wolves as HEV mechanical, passive carriers, favouring the introduction and spread of HEV in the environment. Hepatitis E virus (HEV) infection is a major health problem worldwide. In developed countries, zoonotic transmission of HEV genotypes (Gt) 3 and 4 is caused by the ingestion of raw or undercooked meat of infected pigs and wild boars, the main reservoirs of HEV. However, additional animals may harbour HEV or HEV-related strains, including carnivores. In this study, we investigated the molecular epidemiology of orthohepeviruses in wild canids by screening a total of 136 archival faecal samples, collected from wolves (42) and red foxes (94) in Northwestern Italy. Orthohepevirus RNA was identified in a faecal specimen, collected from a wolf carcass in the province of La Spezia (Liguria Region, Italy). The nearly full-length (7212 nucleotides) genome of the strain HEV/81236/Wolf/2019/ITA (GenBank accession no. MZ463196) was determined by combining a sequence-independent single-primer amplification (SISPA) approach with the Oxford Nanopore Technologies sequencing platform. Upon phylogenetic analysis, the HEV detected in wolf was segregated into clade HEV-3.1, displaying the highest nucleotide (nt) identity (89.0-93.3%) to Gt3 strains belonging to subtype c. Interestingly, the wolf faecal sample also contained porcine astrovirus sequences, endorsing the hypothesis of a dietary origin of the HEV strain due to preying habits.

AB  - Mixed cropping systems typically provide better natural pest control compared with monocultures, although the success varies depending on the crop and cultivar combinations. Understanding trait interactions that confer associational resistance (AR) to companion plants is key to optimizing these benefits. The Mesoamerican milpa system, known for its pest resistance, provides a model for studying these interactions. We tested two hypotheses to investigate whether access to extrafloral nectar (EFN) produced by Phaseolus vulgaris (common bean) can protect companion Zea mays (maize): (1) access to EFN enhances the survival and performance of a parasitoid wasp, leading to increased parasitism of fall armyworm (FAW) caterpillars on accompanying maize and reduced herbivory, and (2) bean plants can detect maize herbivore-induced plant volatiles (HIPVs) and respond by increasing EFN secretion. Controlled experiments demonstrated that wasps with access to EFN from bean plants lived longer, had higher fecundity, and parasitized more caterpillars on companion maize, thereby reducing herbivore damage. Additionally, caterpillar-damaged maize primed EFN secretion in companion bean plants via HIPVs. Our findings reveal a potentially important AR mechanism in the milpa, contributing to its reputed pest resistance. This understanding could inform the design of sustainable mixed cropping systems that enhance natural pest control.

AB  - In maize (Zea mays), fungal-elicited immune responses include the accumulation of terpene synthase (TPS) and cytochrome P450 monooxygenases (CYP) enzymes resulting in complex antibiotic arrays of sesquiterpenoids and diterpenoids, including alpha/beta-selinene derivatives, zealexins, kauralexins and dolabralexins. To uncover additional antibiotic families, we conducted metabolic profiling of elicited stem tissues in mapping populations, which included B73 x M162W recombinant inbred lines and the Goodman diversity panel. Five candidate sesquiterpenoids associated with a chromosome 1 locus spanning the location of ZmTPS27 and ZmTPS8. Heterologous enzyme co-expression studies of ZmTPS27 in Nicotiana benthamiana resulted in geraniol production while ZmTPS8 yielded alpha-copaene, delta-cadinene and sesquiterpene alcohols consistent with epi-cubebol, cubebol, copan-3-ol and copaborneol matching the association mapping efforts. ZmTPS8 is an established multiproduct alpha-copaene synthase; however, ZmTPS8-derived sesquiterpene alcohols are rarely encountered in maize tissues. A genome wide association study further linked an unknown sesquiterpene acid to ZmTPS8 and combined ZmTPS8-ZmCYP71Z19 heterologous enzyme co-expression studies yielded the same product. To consider defensive roles for ZmTPS8, in vitro bioassays with cubebol demonstrated significant antifungal activity against both Fusarium graminearum and Aspergillus parasiticus. As a genetically variable biochemical trait, ZmTPS8 contributes to the cocktail of terpenoid antibiotics present following complex interactions between wounding and fungal elicitation.

AB  - The BRI1-EMS-SUPPRESSOR 1 (BES1) family comprises plant-specific transcription factors, which are distinguished by atypical bHLH domains. Over the past two decades, genetic and biochemical studies have established that members of the BRI1-EMS-SUPPRESSOR 1 (BES1) family are crucial for regulating the expression of genes involved in brassinosteroid (BR) response in rapeseed. Due to the significance of the BES1 gene family, extensive research has been conducted to investigate its functional properties. This study presents a comprehensive identification and computational analysis of BES1 genes in 'Tieguanyin' (TGY) tea (Camellia sinensis). A total of 10 BES1 genes were initially identified in the TGY genome. Through phylogenetic tree analysis, this study uniquely revealed that CsBES1.2 and CsBES1.5 cluster with SlBES1.8 from Solanum lycopersicum, indicating their critical roles in fruit growth and development. Synteny analysis identified 20 syntenic genes, suggesting the conservation of their evolutionary functions. Analysis of the promoter regions revealed two types of light-responsive cis-elements, with CsBES1.4 exhibiting the highest number of light-related cis-elements (13), followed by CsBES1.9 and CsBES1.10. Additional validation via qRT-PCR experiments showed that CsBES1.9 and CsBES1.10 were significantly upregulated under light exposure, with CsBES1.10 reaching approximately six times the expression level of the control after 4 h. These results suggest that CsBES1.9 and CsBES1.4 could play crucial roles in responding to abiotic stress. This study offers novel insights into the functional roles of the BES1 gene family in 'Tieguanyin' tea and establishes a significant foundation for future research, especially in exploring the roles of these genes in response to abiotic stresses, such as light exposure.

AB  - Calcium (Ca) and phosphorus (P) homeostasis is maintained by several regulators, including vitamin D and fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23), and their tissue-specific activation and signaling cascades. In this study, the tissue-wide expression of key genes linked to vitamin D metabolism (CYP2R1, CYP27A1, CYP27B1, CYP24A1, GC, VDR) and FGF23 signaling (FGF23, FGFR1-4, KL) were investigated in pigs fed conventional (trial 1) and divergent P diets (trial 2). The tissue set comprised kidney, liver, bone, lung, aorta, and gastrointestinal tract sections. Expression patterns revealed that non-renal tissues and cells (NRTC) express genes to form active vitamin D [1,25(OH)(2)D-3] according to site-specific requirements. A low P diet resulted in higher serum calcitriol and increased CYP24A1 expression in the small intestine, indicating local suppression of vitamin D signaling. A high P diet prompted increased mRNA abundances of CYP27B1 for local vitamin D synthesis, specifically in bone. For FGF23 signaling, analyses revealed ubiquitous expression of FGFR1-4, whereas KL was expressed in a tissue-specific manner. Dietary P supply did not affect skeletal FGF23; however, FGFR4 and KL showed increased expression in bone at high P supply, suggesting regulation to balance mineralization. Specific NRTC responses influence vitamin D metabolism and P homeostasis, which should be considered for a thrifty but healthy P supply.

AB  - Lower termites harbor diverse consortia of symbiotic gut flagellates. Despite numerous evidence for co-cladogenesis, the evolutionary history of these associations remains unclear. Here, we present Retractinymphidae fam. nov., a monogeneric lineage of Trichonymphida from Serritermitidae. Although Retractinympha glossotermitis gen. nov. sp. nov. morphologically resembles members of the genus Pseudotrichonympha, phylogenetic analysis identified it as sister group of the Teranymphidae. We compared morphology and ultrastructure of R. glossotermitis to that of Pseudotrichonympha and other Teranymphidae, including the so-far undescribed Pseudotrichonympha solitaria sp. nov. from Termitogeton planus (Rhinotermitidae). Like all Teranymphidae, R. glossotermitis is a large, elongated flagellate with a bilaterally symmetric rostrum, an anterior, flagella-free operculum, and an internal rostral tube. However, it is readily distinguished by the length of its rostral flagella, which never exceeds that of the postrostral flagella, and its retractable anterior end. Inclusion of the hitherto unstudied Stylotermes halumicus (Stylotermitidae) in our survey of trichonymphid flagellates in Neoisoptera confirmed that the combined presence of Heliconympha and Retractinympha and absence of Pseudotrichonympha is unique to Serritermitidae. The close phylogenetic relatedness of Heliconympha in Serritermitidae to the spirotrichosomid flagellates in Stolotermitidae provides strong support for their acquisition by horizontal transmission.

AB  - Over recent years, Ireland has reported the highest crude incidence rates of Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli (STEC) enteritis in Europe. Unregulated private groundwater sources have emerged as an important potential trans-mission route for STEC, with up to 750,000 Irish residents reliant on these sources for domestic waters. This study aimed to investigate the prevalence and serogroup profile of STEC contamination from domestic private wells in west-ern Ireland. Fifty-two groundwater sources were analysed during two sampling campaigns in the autumn (September/ October) of 2019 (n = 21) and 2021 (n = 31). Untreated groundwater samples (30 L) were collected and analysed using the "CapE" (capture, amplify, extract) method. Extracted DNA was tested using multiplex real-time PCR for Shiga toxin stx1 and/or stx2 and eae genes. STEC positive DNA samples were tested for clinically relevant serogroups by real-time PCR. Data relating to 27 potential groundwater contamination risk factors were geospatially linked to each well and assessed for association with E. coli, stx1 and/or stx2 and eae presence/absence. Overall, 20/52 wells (38.4 %) were positive for E. coli (median concentration 8.5 MPN/100 mL as assessed by Colilert-18 method). Stx1 and/or stx2 was detected in 10/52 (19.2 %) wells overall and 8/20 E. coli positive wells, equating to a STEC to "generic" E. coli detection ratio of 40 %. Six of these wells (30 %) were also positive for eae. One or more serogroup-specific gene targets were identified in all but one stx1 and/or stx2 positive sample, with O145 (n = 6), O157 (n = 5) and O103 (n = 4) most prevalent. STEC presence was significantly associated with decreasing well depth (U = -2.243; p = 0.024) and increasing 30-day mean antecedent rainfall (U = 2.126; p = 0.034). Serogroup O104 was associated with increased sheep density (U = 2.089; p = 0.044) and detection of stx1 and/or stx2 + eae with increased septic tank density (U = 2.246 p = 0.023). Findings indicate high detection rates of clinically relevant STEC in E. coli contaminated groundwater sources in Ireland.

AB  - The present study deals with a new bovid assemblage from Kataphyto, Northeastern Greece, providing additional information concerning this species dispersal and stature in Greece. It consists of 155 teeth and bone remains attributed to the extinct species Bos primigenius Bojanus, 1827. The C-14 dating analysis of the fossils resulted in a Late Pleistocene age, with a median at 23,800 calBP, similar to the age obtained using the U-series geochronology. A brief outline of the evolutionary history, morphology and ecology of the Pleistocene aurochs is reported, with a comprehensive update of the palaeontological and archaeological records of the species in Greece reviewed here. Morphometric data have been investigated in order to provide an evaluation of the species body size variations throught time in Greece. The results show that the populations of aurochs in Greece were small in size during the Middle Pleistocene, increased in size during the end of the Late Pleistocene, followed by a decrease during the Holocene. Moreover, aurochs remains from Greece, compared with those obtained from the Italian Peninsula, contribute to knowledge about body size variation during the Pleistocene and Holocene. This study revealed a different trend compared to other European sites and depict a more complex and articulated framework on aurochs body size variation than previously thought.

AB  - In group-living species, cooperative tactics can offset asymmetries in resource-holding potential between individuals and alter the outcome of intragroup conflicts. Differences in the kinds of competitive pressures that males and females face might influence the benefits they gain from forming intragroup coalitions. We predicted that there would be a female bias in intragroup coalitions because females (1) are more like to live with kin than males are, and (2) compete over resources that are more readily shared than resources males compete over. We tested this main prediction using information about coalition formation across mammalian species and phylogenetic comparative analyses. We found that for nearly all species in which intragroup coalitions occur, members of both sexes participate, making this the typical mammalian pattern. The presence and frequency of female or male coalitions were not strongly associated with key socio-ecological factors like resource defensibility, sexual dimorphism or philopatry. This suggests that once the ability to form intragroup coalitions emerges in one sex, it is likely to emerge in the other sex as well and that there is no strong phylogenetic legacy of sex differences in this form of cooperation.This article is part of the theme issue 'Cooperation among women: evolutionary and cross-cultural perspectives'.

AB  - The Stegodon-Ailuropoda Faunal Complex is representative of Quaternary faunas across southern China. However, it is becoming increasingly clear that a great deal of variation is present within the faunal complex. Here we report a new late Quaternary faunal assemblage from Upper Pubu Cave, Bubing Basin, Guangxi, southern China. Upper Pubu is a good example of the variation in the Stegodon-Ailuropoda Faunal Complex, particularly when situated in the broader Bubing Basin Quaternary faunal sequence. Upper Pubu was excavated two times resulting in the discovery of 2396 mammalian fossils, consisting mostly of isolated teeth from medium- to large-sized animals. Twenty four mammalian taxa were identified, representative of the Stegodon-Ailuropoda Faunal Complex, including Ailuropoda, Stegodon, Pongo, Rhinoceros, Tapirus, and Elephas. Upper Pubu is dated to 210-100 ka by Uranium-series, electron spin resonance (ESR) and optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) methods. The Upper Pubu fossils largely date to Marine Isotope Stage ("MIS") 6. Given the severity of the climate during MIS 6, the reduction in both the number and proportion of primates and carnivores in Upper Pubu may be the result of environmental deterioration and a decrease in forested areas towards the end of the Middle Pleistocene ("Chibanian"). It is reasonable to speculate that a predominantly forested and mosaic-like habitat was present during the end of the Middle Pleistocene in southern China - a good example of environmental change during the Quaternary in the region.

AB  - In some sheep production systems, the ewes are induced to come into oestrus whilst nursing their lambs. After that, mothers and offspring are usually moved into a paddock with sexually active rams leading to a conflict between sexual and maternal motivations. The aim of this study was to determine if a nursing oestrous ewe prefers its lamb or a sexually active ram in a two-choice test with full physical contact. During the breeding season, 23 multiparous Corriedale ewes nursing single lambs were induced to come into oestrus 72 days after parturition. Twenty ewes came into oestrus and were tested in a two-choice test with full physical contact between their single lamb and a sexually active ram. The latency to enter into a contact area surrounding each stimulus (ram or lamb) and the time spent in each area were recorded for 3 min. The number of vocalisations emitted by the lambs and the sexual behaviour displayed by the rams were also recorded. One nursing oestrous ewe did not enter any defined area and was excluded from the analysis, which included 19 tests. Nursing oestrous ewes entered earlier (X2 =8.05; P = 0.005; Survivance test) and stayed longer (Z = -2.74; P = 0.006; Wilcoxon Signed-Rank test) in the ram's contact area than in the lamb's contact area. During the test, rams almost always displayed sexual behaviours when ewes entered their contact area (17/19 tests). The lambs vigorously vocalised during the test (19.7 +/- 2.5 bleats/test), but the number of vocalisations was not related to the time the ewe spent near the lamb or the ram. In conclusion, nursing oestrous ewes strongly prefer sexually active rams over their lambs during the breeding season. This result gives rise to a greater understanding of sexual behaviour in the ewe, which may very well impact the reproductive management of sheep.

AB  - Firefighter occupational exposures were categorized as a class 1 (known) carcinogen by the International Agency for Research on Cancer in 2022. As a result, firefighters have become heavily focused on identifying effective and easy to implement decontamination strategies to reduce their chemical exposures. Skin decontamination using wipes post-exposure is one decontamination strategy that every firefighter has available to them. However, firefighters have expressed concerns over the ingredients in the wipe solution increasing dermal absorption. The goal of this study was to determine if the ingredients in skin decontamination wipe solution had any enhancement effect on the dermal absorption of phenanthrene. To determine any enhancement effects, the additive solution of four skin decontamination wipe products was applied to porcine skin 15 min after chemical dosing. The absorption of phenanthrene was tested in vitro using a flow-through diffusion cell system over eight hours. The wipe solution effects on dermal absorption were determined by measuring multiple absorption characteristics including cumulative absorption (mu g/cm2), absorption efficiency (% dose absorbed), lag time (minutes), flux (mu g/cm2/h), diffusivity (cm2/h), and permeability (cm/h). No penetration enhancement effects were observed in any of the skin decontamination wipe solutions tested; rather, all wipe solutions decreased the absorption of phenanthrene. Slight differences in cumulative absorption among two pairings of skin decontamination wipe solutions, wipes 1 and 3 vs. wipes 2 and 4, were observed, indicating that some ingredients may impact dermal absorption. These findings show that firefighters should continue using skin decontamination wipes to reduce their dermal exposures to fireground contaminants with little concern of increasing the absorption of phenanthrene.

AB  - Major depression disorder (MDD) is one of the most widespread and debilitating psychiatric diseases and may be associated with other mental disorders such as anxiety. Despite advances in neurobiology studies, currently no established mechanism can explain all facets of MDD, and available drugs often show therapeutic delay for clinical effectiveness and response rates in patients are around 50 %. Previous activities of piperazine derivatives on CNS are indicators of its therapeutic potential for treating mental disorders. In this regard, we have previously shown that the piperazine derivative 2,6-di-tert-butyl-4((4-(2-hydroxyethyl)piperazin-1-yl)methyl)phenol (LQFM212) has anxiolytic-like activity which involves serotonergic pathway, nicotinic receptors and BZD-site of GABA(A) receptor, without cognitive impairments. Herein, was evaluated the potential antidepressant-like effect of LQFM212 on forced swimming test (FST) after a single dose of 54 umol/kg and after repeated treatment for 15 days in mice. Pretreatment with WAY-100635, PCPA, prazosin, SCH-23390, sulpiride or AMPT reversed the antidepressant-like effect on FST, suggesting that monoaminergic pathway contributes for effects of LQFM212. Furthermore, repeated treatment with LQFM212 increased hippocampal BDNF levels dosed by ELISA kit. In assessment of possible adverse effects, repeated treatment with LQFM212 did not alter the body weight of the animals, glutathione levels in the liver, and serum levels of AST, ALT, urea, and creatinine. Taken together, the results showed that LQFM212 has an antidepressant-like effect that involves monoaminergic pathway and increased BDNF levels. This compound represents promising candidate for prototype of psychoactive drugs for treatment of anxiety and depression disorders since these pathological conditions may exist in comorbidities.

AB  - The mammalian tongue performs several relevant functions, including food capture and its mechanical and chemical modification, swallowing, taste perception, vocalization, and also thermoregulation. Most of these functions are related to the morphology of the organ. In this work, we described for the first time the morphological, histochemical and lectin-histochemical characteristics of the tongue of the hystricomorph rodent Lagostomus maximus (plains viscacha). The viscacha's tongue was classified as type I and exhibited features typical of herbivorous mammals. Its histological characteristics were similar to those reported for other mammals with comparable diets, showing filiform, fungiform and vallate papillae. Particularly, the number of vallate papillae varied from what has been observed in other hystricomorphs and eutherians, suggesting that this feature may be species-specific. Foliate papillae were absent. Lingual glands consists of serous acini superficially located, and mucous acini which were situated more deeply. These glandular locations also varied among different hystricomorphs. The glycosylation pattern of the acini in the viscacha's tongue resembles those reported in other species; however, since there is currently no available data related to the lectin-histochemical pattern for eutherian species, comparisons were not possible. The glandular secretions may participate in food mastication and breakdown, as well as in the cleaning of certain papillae. Our results contribute to a better understanding of diverse digestive features of this species, including diet and mastication.

AB  - Sexual coral propagation faces a significant bottleneck due to high post-settlement mortality, impeding large-scale reef restoration. This study assessed the effectiveness of co-culturing Diploria labyrinthiformis settlers with the herbivorous gastropod Cerithium lutosum and supplementing their diet with a commercially available food source, Reef-Roids, to enhance settler survival and growth. Settlers were reared for 10 weeks under controlled conditions in one of four treatments: Control (C), Feeding with Reef-Roids (F), Grazing by C. lutosum (G), and combined Feeding + Grazing (FG). Settlers in the Grazing treatment exhibited the highest survival at 87% after 10 weeks, significantly outperforming those in the Control (43%) and Feeding (48%) treatments. The combined feeding and grazing treatment improved survival rates to 74% and resulted in the highest growth rates, with settlers in this group averaging 11.98 +/- 2.38 mm(2), approximately 3.4-fold larger than the control and 2.6-fold larger than the feeding group. The feeding treatment alone did not significantly enhance survival or growth, underscoring the critical role of grazing in mitigating algal competition and promoting settler development. The results highlight the efficacy of grazing by C. lutosum (G and FG) in improving both survival and growth of coral settlers, substantially surpassing the outcomes of ungrazed treatments (F and C). This study highlights the potential of integrating microherbivores, such as C. lutosum, in ex situ coral nurseries. By regulating algal growth, these grazers minimize the need for labor-intensive maintenance, offering a scalable and cost-effective strategy to mitigate the high mortality rates of coral settlers.

AB  - Camellia oleifera Abel is a highly valued woody edible oil tree, which is endemic to China. It has great economic value because C. oleifera seed oil contains a high proportion of polyunsaturated fatty acids. C. oleifera anthracnose caused by Colletotrichum fructicola, poses a serious threat to C. oleifera growth and yield and causes the benefit of the C. oleifera industry to suffer directly. The WRKY transcription factor family members have been widely characterized as vital regulators in plant response to pathogen infection. Until now, the number, type and biological function of C. oleifera WRKY genes are remains unknown. Here, we identified 90 C. oleifera WRKY members, which were distributed across 15 chromosomes. C. oleifera WRKY gene expansion was mainly attributed to segmental duplication. We performed transcriptomic analyses to verify the expression patterns of CoWRKYs between anthracnose-resistant and -susceptible cultivars of C. oleifera. These results demonstrated that multiple candidate CoWRKYs can be induced by anthracnose and provide useful clues for their functional studies. CoWRKY78, an anthracnose-induced WRKY gene, was isolated from C. oleifera. It was significantly down-regulated in anthracnose-resistant cultivars. Overexpression of CoWRKY78 in tobacco markedly reduced resistance to anthracnose than WT plants, as evidenced by more cell death, higher malonaldehyde content and reactive oxygen species (ROS), but lower activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD), peroxidase (POD), as well as phenylalanine ammonia-lyase (PAL). Furthermore, the expression of multiple stress-related genes, which are associated with ROS-homeostasis (NtSOD and NtPOD), pathogen challenge (NtPAL), and pathogen defense (NtPR1, NtNPR1, and NtPDF1.2) were altered in the CoWRKY78-overexpressing plants. These findings increase our understanding of the CoWRKY genes and lay the foundation for the exploration of anthracnose resistance mechanisms and expedite the breeding of anthracnose-resistant C. oleifera cultivars.

AB  - Tea is one of the top industrial crops in China and being consumed all over the world. The quality of green tea can be significantly improved through a tea-Chinese chestnut intercropping system according to the experience of indigenous farmers. However, the molecular mechanism underlying the relation between tea quality and cropping pattern remains mysterious. In order to explore the underlying molecular mechanism, we performed RNA-seq analysis between tea plants collected from the intercropping and monoculture system, respectively. Totally, 1,991 DEGs (differentially expressed genes) were distinguished in answer to the intercropping. There are 26 kinds of genes showed upregulation and downregulation, respectively, in the pathways of phenylpropanoid biosynthesis, circadian rhythm, monoterpenoid biosynthesis, cutin, suberin, and wax biosynthesis as well as sesquiterpenoid and triterpenoid biosynthesis. They were candidates for the regulators and/or executors in response of intercropping. A number of DEGs encoding transcription factors were involved in tea aroma and plant self-defense, and showed significant upregulation under the intercropping system. The results indicated that the intercropping pattern promoted the cross-talk of plant hormones (auxin, salicylic acid, abscisic acid, and ethylene), which could stimulate the response to biotic and abiotic stress, and induce the release of volatile organic compounds in tea plants grown under the intercropping system. These variations of genes and pathways are critical for the viability of tea plants and therefore resulted in a higher quality of green tea products. Our study provides insights to the molecular mechanism of the increase of self-protection and tea aroma through the intercropping system, and also promotes the possibility of future application and popularization of tea-Chinese chestnut intercropping, or even for tea with other tall trees, in the era of increasingly scarce arable land resources.

AB  - Mineral carbonation is one of the known methods for carbon capture, utilization, and storage (CCUS). Slag from the steel industry is studied as a common source of CaCO3 via mineral carbonation owing to its high Ca content. Despite numerous preliminary studies, the optimal factors governing the mineral carbonation of steelmaking slag, such as extraction and carbonation remain unexplored. In this study, we optimized the factors for Ca extraction and carbonation, as CaCO3 produced under these optimized factors possesses commercial value due to its high purity. The extraction and carbonation experiments were performed on two types of slag samples, specifically non-magnetic steelmaking and pig iron slag, utilizing the chosen factors for each procedure. NH4Cl was chosen as the extractant because of its high calcium selectivity and inhibition of gel formation. Precipitates with Ca content >= 98% were obtained by extracting and carbonating them. The crystalline form and particle size of CaCO3 in the precipitates were determined by the pH control. The findings of this study will be used to improve the design of precipitated calcium carbonate (PCC) production processes and increase the economic value of their output.

AB  - Background: Urbanicity refers to the conditions that are particular to urban areas and is a growing environmental challenge that may affect hippocampus and neurocognition. This study aimed to investigate the effects of the average pre-adulthood urbanicity on hippocampal subfield volumes and neurocognitive abilities as well as the sensitive age windows of the urbanicity effects.Participants and methods: We included 5,390 CHIMGEN participants (3,538 females; age: 23.69 +/- 2.26 years, range: 18-30 years). Pre-adulthood urbanicity of each participant was defined as the average value of annual night-time light (NL) or built-up% from age 0-18, which were extracted from remote-sensing satellite data based on annual residential coordinates of the participants. The hippocampal subfield volumes were calculated based on structural MRI and eight neurocognitive measures were assessed. The linear regression was applied to investigate the associations of pre-adulthood NL with hippocampal subfield volumes and neurocognitive abili-ties, mediation models were used to find the underlying pathways among urbanicity, hippocampus and neuro-cognition, and distributed lag models were used to identify sensitive age windows of urbanicity effect.Results: Higher pre-adulthood NL was associated with greater volumes in the left (beta = 0.100, 95%CI: [0.075, 0.125]) and right (0.078, [0.052, 0.103]) fimbria and left subiculum body (0.045, [0.020, 0.070]) and better neurocognitive abilities in information processing speed (-0.212, [-0.240,-0.183]), working memory (0.085, [0.057, 0.114]), episodic memory (0.107, [0.080, 0.135]), and immediate (0.094, [0.065, 0.123]) and delayed (0.087, [0.058, 0.116]) visuospatial recall, and hippocampal subfield volumes and visuospatial memory showed bilateral mediations for the urbanicity effects. Urbanicity effects were greatest on the fimbria in preschool and adolescence, on visuospatial memory and information processing from childhood to adolescence and on working memory after 14 years.Conclusion: These findings improve our understanding of the impact of urbanicity on hippocampus and neuro-cognitive abilities and will benefit for designing more targeted intervention for neurocognitive improvement.

AB  - Traditional herding is an ancient activity that has continued from the beginning of human life on earth until today. Over time, alternative methods have replaced traditional livestock management methods, but in many countries, traditional herding still has a large share in meat and dairy production. Therefore, to improve the efficiency of this system, analysis of energy indicators is important. In this study, the common livestock system in northeastern Iran (Kalat region) and energy efficiency and productivity were evaluated. For this purpose, the identification of important livestock centers and the characteristics of all rangeland in the region were prepared and with a comprehensive and accurate evaluation, the target herd was determined. It monitored all livestock activities over five years, and it summed the input and output energies using the MAFF equation and Nicol coefficients. It also estimated the volume and price of livestock products to obtain real income. By summarizing all the information, energy efficiency and productivity indices were estimated annually. So, it estimated the energy efficiency index in the traditional herding of Kalat at 31% according to the sheep breed (Kurdikhorasani) of the region. The energy productivity index also recorded an almost downward trend during the study period and showed that it fluctuated entirely based on changes in real income. The results showed that energy indices are relatively lower than in other regions, and there is a need to reform the prices of livestock products and improve management methods for the sustainability of traditional herding.

AB  - Traumatic brain injury (TBI) results from mechanical forces applied to the head. Ensuing cascades of complex pathophysiology transition the injury event into a disease process. The enduring constellation of emotional, somatic, and cognitive impairments degrade quality of life for the millions of TBI survivors suffering from longterm neurological symptoms. Rehabilitation strategies have reported mixed results, as most have not focused on specific symptomatology or explored cellular processes. The current experiments evaluated a novel cognitive rehabilitation paradigm for brain-injured and uninjured rats. The arena is a plastic floor with a cartesian grid of holes for plastic dowels to create new environments with the rearrangement of threaded pegs. Rats received either two weeks of Peg Forest rehabilitation (PFR) or open field exposure starting at 7 days post-injury; or one week starting at either day 7 or 14 post-injury; or served as caged controls. Cognitive performance was assessed on a battery of novel object tasks at 28 days post-injury. The results revealed that two weeks of PFR was required to prevent the onset of cognitive impairments, while one week of PFR was insufficient regardless of when rehabilitation was initiated after injury. Further assessment of the task showed that novel daily arrangements of the environment were required to impart the cognitive performance benefits, as exposure to a static arrangement of pegs for PFR each day did not improve cognitive performance. The results indicate that PFR prevents the onset of cognitive disorders following acquired a mild to moderate brain injury, and potentially other neurological conditions.

AB  - Phylogenetic analyses and morphological examination confirmed two new species in the tropical polypore genus Tropicoporus, T. oceanianus and T. zuzaneae, from Australia and tropical Asia, respectively. A phylogenetic analysis based on the two DNA markers including the nuclear ribosomal internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region and the large subunit (nLSU) gene shows that these two new species form two independent lineages nested in the genus Tropicoporus. T. oceanianus is characterized by perennial and ungulate basidiomata, the occasional presence of hymenial setae, a trimitic hyphal structure in the context and a dimitic hyphal system in the trama, and broadly ellipsoid to subglobose basidiospores measuring 5.2-6 x 4-5 mu m. T. zuzaneae is characterized by perennial and resupinate basidiomata with distinct receding margin, glancing pores, very thin to almost lacking subiculum, a dimitic hyphal structure, the absence of any setal elements, broadly ellipsoid to subglobose basidiospores measuring 3.8-4.9 x 3-4.2 mu m. The differences among the new species and their phylogenetically related and morphologically similar species are discussed.

AB  - Due to the low cost of production and the strong evolutionary preference for sweet taste in humans, sugar is added to many food products. This leads to often involuntary overconsumption of high amounts of sugar. Yet, growing evidence indicates that high-sugar diets impact brain function and impair cognitive ability. It may be due to physiological changes in specific regions of the brain or/and maladaptive changes in dopamine signalling similar to those observed in the etiology of addiction. In our study, rats from the experimental group were kept on a feeding protocol involving intermittent access to sucrose solution for eight weeks. Then, the animals underwent a spontaneous exploration test in an experimental arena divided into three zones where stationary and movable objects were placed. Studying the rats' exploratory behaviour allowed us to assess the impact of the sucrose diet on a broad spectrum of behaviours related to the general functioning of the organism in its environment. Analyses showed differences in reaction to novelty between different diet groups which had been placed in different experimental setups. Rats from the sugar-fed group responded to change with more pronounced exploratory behaviours directed at the source of the novel stimuli and the surrounding environment. These results may indicate a lower reward value of novelty resulting from diminished responsiveness of the reward system in the sugar-diet group. We have not found evidence for memory and/or learning impairments in rats on the sugar-rich diet.

AB  - Musk secreted by Chinese forest musk deer (FMD; Moschus berezovskii) is a highly valuable ingredient in the fields of perfumery and medicine, and the main factor affecting the production of musk is the androgen level of male FMD. To clarify whether the musk gland of FMD can synthesize androgen, we compared and analyzed the expression patterns of steroid hormone biosynthesis-related genes in the musk gland and testis of FMD by RNAseq and RT-qPCR. We obtained 33,308 and 38,602 unigenes from the musk gland and testis, respectively, and 26,780 co-expressed unigenes. Analysis of co-expressed genes revealed that 12,647 genes were annotated to 11,484 Gene Ontology terms and 10,941 genes were annotated to 6120 pathways, including several pathways important in metabolic and synthetic activity. Next, 21 steroid hormone synthesis-related genes were screened from the transcriptome of the musk gland of 4-month-old FMD. The expression levels of three key genes of steroid hormone biosynthesis (CYP11A1, CYP17A1, and HSD3B) in the musk gland differed from their expression levels in the testis based on RT-qPCR. Furthermore, immunohistochemistry indicated that CYP11A1, CYP17A1, and HSD3B were localized in the glandular tubular columnar cells of the musk gland. These results suggested that the musk gland of male FMD has the potential to locally synthesize steroid hormone and thus plays a critically important role in musk secretion.

AB  - Mandible and maxillary stylet lengths in adult female thrips were measured in eight species of herbivores, six species of predators, and one species of a fungivore. Species studied live in the Mojave Desert or adjacent habitat in southern Nevada or western Arizona. Lengths of each structure were compared between Terebrantia and Tubulifera and between herbivores and predators in each suborder. Mandibles were longer in Terebrantia and in predators compared with herbivores in the suborder. Mandible length did not differ between diets in Tubulifera. Maxillary stylets were longer in Tubulifera, in herbivores compared with predators in the suborder, and in predators compared with herbivores in Terebrantia. Longer mandibles in the predatory Terebrantia may be related to greater thickness or hardness of arthropod cuticles compared with plant cuticles. Longer stylets in the herbivorous Tubulifera would enable thrips to feed on deeper plant tissues. Stylet length in predators approximated mandible length in four of the species, suggesting the stylets only exceed the arthropod cuticle to withdraw food. The mandible in the fungivorous species was longer than in other Tubulifera, and maxillary stylet length in the species was similar to herbivores in the suborder. Examination of a greater number and diversity of species of thrips may detect similar differences in mouthpart structure between herbivores and predators.

AB  - An adverse maternal environment (AME) predisposes adult offspring toward cognitive impairment in humans and mice. However, the underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood. Epigenetic changes in response to environmental exposure may be critical drivers of this change. Epigenetic regulators, including microRNAs, have been shown to affect cognitive function by altering hippocampal neurogenesis which is regulated in part by brain-derived neurotropic factor (BDNF). We sought to investigate the effects of AME on miR profile and their epigenetic characteristics, as well as neurogenesis and BDNF expression in mouse hippocampus. Using our mouse model of AME which is composed of maternal Western diet and prenatal environmental stress, we found that AME significantly increased hippocampal miR-10b-5p levels. We also found that AME significantly decreased DNA methylation and increased accumulations of active histone marks H3 lysine (K) 4me3, H3K14ac, and -H3K36me3 at miR-10b promoter. Furthermore, AME significantly decreased hippocampal neurogenesis by decreasing cell numbers of Ki67(+) (proliferation marker), NeuroD1(+) (neuronal differentiation marker), and NeuN(+) (mature neuronal marker) in the dentate gyrus (DG) region concurrently with decreased hippocampal BDNF protein levels. We speculate that the changes in epigenetic profile at miR-10b promoter may contribute to upregulation of miR-10b-5p and subsequently lead to decreased BDNF levels in a model of impaired offspring hippocampal neurogenesis and cognition in mice.

AB  - Objective: To evaluate antioxidant effects of Scrophularia (S.) striata ethanol extract, trehalose and cysteine added to diluents on cryopreserved goat epididymal sperms.
   Methods: Motility and standard motion parameters of sperm were assessed by using computer assisted sperm motility analysis system. Sperm viability was evaluated by eosin-nigrosin staining method. Hypo-osmotic swelling test was used to evaluate membrane health. Thiobarbituric acid testing was used to measure malondialdehyde (MDA) concentrations. To assess DNA fragmentation, sperm chromatin dispersion test was used. In Experiment 1, treatments consisting of basal Tris diluent supplemented with 25, 50 or 100 mu g/mL of S. striata ethanol extract gave the best concentration to the freezing diluents. Experiment 2 was carried out to compare the best concentration of S. striata ethanol extract (50 mu g/mL) resulting from the first experiment with 150 mM trehalose and/or 5 mM cysteine alone or in combination.
   Results: S. striata ethanol extract (50 mu g/mL) significantly increased sperm viability, motility and progressive motility and at the same time decreased MDA concentration and DNA fragmentation compared to other treatments (P<0.05). In addition, all treatment groups resulted in viability, membrane health, total motility, progressive motility, curvilinear velocity, straight-line velocity higher and MDA lower compared to the control group (P<0.05). Acrosome integrity was significantly higher in 50 mu g/mL of S. striata ethanol extract combined with cysteine, trehalose, or cysteine+trehalose groups than those in the control, trehalose, cysteine, and 50 mu g/mL of S. striata ethanol extract groups (P<0.05). Regarding DNA, extenders supplemented with 50 mu g/mL of S. striata ethanol extract, 50 mu g/mL of S. striata ethanol extract+trehalose, and 50 mu g/mL of S. striata ethanol extract+trehalose+cysteine were superior to other treatments.
   Conclusions: Adding 50 mu g/mL of S. striata ethanol extract alone or in combination with trehalose and cysteine can improve the quality of cryopreserved epididymal sperms of goats.

AB  - Fatty liver is an abnormal metabolic condition of excess intrahepatic fat. This condition, referred to as hepatic steatosis, is tightly associated with chronic liver disease and systemic metabolic morbidity. The most prevalent form in humans, i.e. non-alcoholic fatty liver, generally develops due to overnutrition and sedentary lifestyle, and has as yet no approved drug therapy. Previously, we have developed a relevant large-animal model in which overnourished sheep raised on a high-calorie carbohydrate-rich diet develop hyperglycemia, hyperinsulinemia, insulin resistance, and hepatic steatosis. Here, we tested the hypothesis that treatment with thiamine (vitamin B1) can counter the development of hepatic steatosis driven by overnutrition. Remarkably, the thiamine-treated animals presented with completely normal levels of intrahepatic fat, despite consuming the same amount of liver-fattening diet. Thiamine treatment also decreased hyperglycemia and increased the glycogen content of the liver, but it did not improve insulin sensitivity, suggesting that steatosis can be addressed independently of targeting insulin resistance. Thiamine increased the catalytic capacity for hepatic oxidation of carbohydrates and fatty acids. However, at gene-expression levels, more-pronounced effects were observe donlipid-droplet formation and lipidation of very-low-density lipoprotein, suggesting that thiamine affects lipid metabolism not only through its known classic coenzyme roles. This discovery of the potent anti-steatotic effect of thiamine may prove clinically useful in managing fatty liver-related disorders.

AB  - In this study, we present new records of the extinct South American proboscidean Notiomastodon platensis from three new fossiliferous sites in the riverbed of Cauca River, in the department of Valle del Cauca, Colombia. The fossil specimens were found in late Pleistocene deposits and include immature to senile Notiomastodon platensis individuals, comprising abundant dental and post-cranial materials. A review of the geographic distribution of the Notiomastodon platensis records in Colombia suggests that this giant mammal used the inter-Andean valleys as migratory corridors, possibly due to the presence of more suitable environmental conditions (lower temperatures and dry-forest) and energy-saving terrains, avoiding more prominent Andean hills. In addition, the Cauca Valley deposits stand out as having palaeontological significance to the comprehension of the late Pleistocene of the western region of South America.

AB  - The objective was to evaluate the intake, digestibility, and feeding behavior of sheep receiving diets based on marandu grass silage (MGS) with different levels of dehydrated brewery residue (DBR) inclusion and different types of concentrates. Sixteen sheep (30 +/- 1.46 kg and 12 months old) were distributed in a randomized block experimental design. The treatments were: MGS containing 10% DBR + concentrate (100% corn); MGS containing 10% DBR + concentrate (50% corn and 50% rice bran); MGS containing 30% DBR + concentrate (100% corn); MGS containing 30% DBR + concentrate (50% corn and 50% rice bran), with 4 replicates per treatment. The experimental period lasted 21 days. Regardless of the concentrate used, diets containing MGS + 30% DBR provided the animals with higher intakes and digestibility of dry matter (DM) and nutrients, water intake, and urinary pH (p < 0.05). Longer feeding and rumination times and periods, and shorter idle times, feeding efficiency of DM, feeding and rumination efficiency of neutral detergent fiber (NDF), and intakes of DM and NDF per meal were shown by sheep-fed diets containing MGS + 10% DBR (p < 0.05). The use of 100% corn concentrate also resulted in lower rumination efficiency of NDF and a higher number of mericic chews associated with MGS + 10% DBR (p < 0.05). Diets containing MGS + 30% DBR and concentrate (50% corn + 50% rice bran) resulted in shorter rumination and total chewing times (in min/kg/NDF) (p < 0.05). The use of MGS ensiled with 30% BR in sheep diets improves dry matter intake and nutrient digestibility.

AB  - Crop pests significantly reduce crop yield and threaten global food security. Conventional pest control relies heavily on insecticides, leading to pesticide resistance and ecological concerns. However, crops and their wild relatives exhibit varied levels of pest resistance, suggesting the potential for breeding pest-resistant varieties. This study integrates deep learning (DL)/machine learning (ML) algorithms, plant phenomics, quantitative genetics, and transcriptomics to conduct genomic selection (GS) of pest resistance in grapevine. Building deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs), we accurately assess pest damage on grape leaves, achieving 95.3% classification accuracy (VGG16) and a 0.94 correlation in regression analysis (DCNN-PDS). The pest damage was phenotyped as binary and continuous traits, and genome resequencing data from 231 grapevine accessions were combined in a Genome-Wide Association Studies, which maps 69 quantitative trait locus (QTLs) and 139 candidate genes involved in pest resistance pathways, including jasmonic acid, salicylic acid, and ethylene. Combining this with transcriptome data, we pinpoint specific pest-resistant genes such as ACA12 and CRK3, which are crucial in herbivore responses. ML-based GS demonstrates a high accuracy (95.7%) and a strong correlation (0.90) in predicting pest resistance as binary and continuous traits in grapevine, respectively. In general, our study highlights the power of DL/ML in plant phenomics and GS, facilitating genomic breeding of pest-resistant grapevine.

AB  - Over the past decades, the significant high environmental impacts of meat consumption have drawn increasing attention around the globe. This study took 2018 meat consumption levels as baselines. It explored the emission implications of the more sustainable counterfactual healthy red meat diet (HRMD), healthy poultry meat diet (HPMD), and world balanced meat diet (WBMD). Meat commodity supply for human consumption data was extracted from the FAOSTAT database. The data were then adjusted for cooking and edible meat yields to obtain the cooked-and-edible meat. Emission factors obtained from published meta-analyses were used to estimate the emission implications of cooked-and-edible meat consumption. Counterfactual HRMD showed that adjusting 18 regions' (10% of the world population) red meat consumption to a serving per day and poultry meat consumption to three servings per week equivalent could reduce the meat-related emission by 4%. The HPMD showed that further reducing red meat consumption in the HRMD to the world average in 21 regions (13% of the world population) and substituting the reductions with poultry meat could reduce the meat-related emission by 12%. WBMD showed aligning all regions' meat consumption to a serving of each bovine, pig, and poultry meat per week, and the ovine meat consumption to the world average could reduce the meat-related emission by 21%. HRMD and HPMD could be the step-by-step transition strategies towards a WBMD to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and simultaneously address malnourishment issues.

AB  - Soils can serve as suitable reservoirs for or barriers against microbial contamination of water resources and plant pro-duce. The magnitude of water or food contamination risks through soil depends on several factors, including the sur-vival potential of microorganisms in the soil. This study assessed and compared the survival/persistence of 14 Salmonella spp. strains in loam and sandy soils at 5, 10, 20, 25, 30, 35, 37 center dot C and under uncontrolled ambient temper-ature conditions in Campinas Sao Paulo. The ambient temperature ranged from 6 center dot C (minimum) to 36 center dot C (maximum). Bacterial population densities were determined by the conventional culture method (plate counts) and monitored for 216 days. Statistical differences among the test parameters were determined by Analysis of Variance, while relation-ships between temperature and soil type were evaluated using Pearson correlation analysis.Similarly, relationships between time and temperature for survival of the various strains were evaluated using Pearson correlation analysis. Results obtained indicate that temperature and soil type influence the survival of Salmonella spp. in soils. All 14 strains survived for up to 216 days in the organic-rich loam soil under at least three of the temperature conditions evaluated. However, comparatively lower survival rates were recorded in sandy soil, especially at lower temperature. The optimum temperature for survival varied among the strains, where some survived best at 5 center dot C and others between 30 and 37 center dot C. Under uncontrolled temperature conditions, the Salmonella strains survived better in loam than in sandy soils. Bacterial growth over post inoculation storage period was overall more impressive in loam soil. In general, the results indicate that temperature and soil type can interact to influence the survival of Salmonella spp. strains in soil. For the survival of some strains, there were significant correlations between soil type and temper-ature, while for some others, no significant relationship between soil and temperature was determined. A similar trend was observed for the correlation between time and temperature.

AB  - Serotonin-releasing fibers depart from the raphe nuclei to profusely innervate the entire central nervous system, displaying in some brain regions high structural plasticity in response to genetically induced abrogation of serotonin synthesis. Chronic fluoxetine treatment used as a tool to model peri-physiological, clinically relevant serotonin elevation is also able to cause structural rearrangements of the serotonergic fibers innervating the hippocampus. Whether this effect is limited to hippocampal-innervating fibers or extends to other populations of axons is not known. Here, we used confocal imaging and three-dimensional (3-D) modeling analysis to expand our morphological investigation of fluoxetine-mediated effects on serotonergic circuitry. We found that chronic treatment with a behaviorally active dose of fluoxetine affects the morphology and reduces the density of serotonergic axons innervating the medial prefrontal cortex, a brain region strongly implicated in the regulation of depressive- and anxiety-like behavior. Axons innervating the somatosensory cortex were unaffected, suggesting differential susceptibility to serotonin changes across cortical areas. Importantly, a 1-month washout period was sufficient to reverse morphological changes in both the medial prefrontal cortex and in the previously characterized hippocampus, as well as to normalize behavior, highlighting an intriguing relationship between axon density and an antidepressant-like effect. Overall, these results further demonstrate the bidirectional plasticity of defined serotonergic axons and provide additional insights into fluoxetine effects on the serotonergic system.

AB  - Mutations of human TBC1D24 are associated with deafness, epilepsy, or DOORS syndrome (deafness, onychodystrophy, osteodystrophy, cognitive disability, and seizures). The causal relationships between TBC1D24 variants and the different clinical phenotypes are not understood. Our hypothesis is that phenotypic heterogeneity of missense mutations of TBC1D24 results, in part, from perturbed binding of different protein partners. To discover novel protein partners of TBC1D24, we conducted yeast two-hybrid (Y2H) screen using mouse fulllength TBC1D24 as bait. Kidney and brain protein (KIBRA), a scaffold protein encoded by Wwc1, , was identified fi ed as a partner of TBC1D24. KIBRA functions in the Hippo signaling pathway and is important for human cognition and memory. The TBC1D24 TLDc domain binds to KIBRA full-length and to its C2 domain, confirmed fi rmed by Y2H assays. No interaction was detected with Y2H assays between the KIBRA C2 domain and TLDc domains of NCOA7, MEAK7, and OXR1. Moreover, the C2 domains of other WWC family proteins do not interact with the TLDc domain of TBC1D24, demonstrating specificity. fi city. The mRNAs encoding TBC1D24 and KIBRA proteins in mouse are coexpressed at least in a subset of hippocampal cells indicating availability to interact in vivo. . As two epilepsy-associated recessive variants (Gly511Arg and Ala515Val) in the TLDc domain of human TBC1D24 disrupt the interaction with the human KIBRA C2 domain, this study reveals a pathogenic mechanism of TBC1D24-associated epilepsy, linking the TBC1D24 and KIBRA pathways. The interaction of TBC1D24KIBRA is physiologically meaningful and necessary to reduce the risk of epilepsy.

AB  - Background: The muscle excess 3 (MEX3C) protein comprises one of two conserved KH hnRNP K homology domains of the Caenorhabditis elegans protein family, a gene involved in the metabolism of key RNAs at posttranscriptional levels during the development of C. elegans, but its function in mammals is unclear.
   Methods and results: In this study, we found that MEX3C plays a key role in learning and cognitive function. The learning and cognitive abilities of MEX3C-knockout (KO) mice were significantly decreased relative to those of wild-type (WT) mice in behavioral experiments, including the shuttle box, Morris water maze, and new object recognition. Nissl staining showed a decrease in the number of Nissl bodies and in the maturation of hippocampal and cortical neurons. A Western blot analysis of the neuron-specific nuclear (NeuN) protein NEUN protein showed that the expression of that protein was decreased, which was consistent with the results of Nissl staining. Of note, the expression of sequestosome I p62 and Parkin BCL-2-associated X (Bax) Bax and B-cell lymphoma-2 (Bcl-2) Bcl-2 proteins also showed a downward trend, suggesting that the MEX3C gene may cause a decrease in the number and maturity of neuronal cells by increasing apoptosis through the inhibition of autophagy. In addition, Golgi staining showed that the complexity of neurons in the hippocampus and cerebral cortex was reduced, and the postsynaptic density protein 95 and growth-associated protein (GAP-43) also showed different degrees of reduction.
   Conclusion: The KO of the MEX3C gene reduces the plasticity of synapses in various regions of the hippocampus, thereby affecting the function of the hippocampus and eventually causing the decline of cognitive function. On the other hand, compared with WT mice, MEX3C-KO mice showed increased anxiety-like behaviors in minefield and elevated plus maze tests.

AB  - The immunity of insects plays a vital role in their survival. Our experiments found that lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and glucono-delta-lactone (GDL) could influence the virulence of Serratia marcescens Bizio (SM1) to Odontotermes formosanus (Shiraki) by affecting the immunity. Gram-negative binding proteins (GNBPs) are an important pattern recognition proteins that play a crucial role in the innate immune system. Therefore, two OfGNBPs were cloned in O. formosanus. The expression of OfGNBPs was significantly changed by LPS,SM1 and GDL, not prick. In addition, the immune-related gene expression, the phenoloxidase activity and antibacterial activity of donor termites and recipient termites were significantly induced by SM1. Furthermore, the knockdown of OfGNBP by RNA interference reduced not only individual immunity but also social immunity in O. formosanus, which increased the virulence of SM1 to O. formosanus. Importantly, dsOfGNBP alone also had good control effect on O. formosanus. In summary, we concluded that dsOfGNBPs are important termite immunosuppressants.

AB  - Simple Summary Heavy metals such as lead and cadmium are pollutants and can be found in different biotopes. Hares, due to their natural habitat, numbers, range and choice of food are good bioindicators of the occurrence of heavy metals. Vojvodina, northern province of Republic of Serbia, has intensive agriculture with about 77.8% of agricultural land. In such agricultural biotope, we discovered that out of the two studied heavy metals in the liver of hare's it seems that the occurrence of lead is more of the importance. In the majority of locations the cadmium concentrations were in the permitted level by Serbian legislative. However, the situation with the occurrence of lead was completely different. Only on the two out of seventeen locations average concentrations were in the permitted level. The aim of this study was to investigate the occurrence of two heavy metals, lead and cadmium, in European hare liver samples, collected in agro biotope of northern Serbian province Vojvodina. Heavy metals such as lead (Pb) and cadmium (Cd) do not have any biological function in the animal body; however, they can be found due to the pollution in the environment. For the purpose of this study, in 196 samples from 17 different locations hare livers were analyzed for the occurrence of lead and cadmium. All samples were taken from hares harvested during the regular hunting season. The average value for lead in all analyzed samples was 884 mu g/kg fresh weight (fw), with the range 59-3700 mu g/kg fw. Only samples from two locations had the average concentration of lead which was within the permitted limit by the Serbian regulation. The average cadmium level in all samples was 243 mu g/kg fw. The range of all samples was from 0 to 1414 mu g/kg fw. Our research indicates that out of two investigated heavy metals, the occurrence of lead is more common and at a higher concentration in the agricultural development region of Vojvodina.

AB  - Liaoning cashmere goats is a dual-purpose breed valued for premium cashmere fiber and meat yields, and there is currently a lack of optimized strategies for meat quality, including skeletal muscle development and lipid partitioning. This investigation systematically examines how melatonin administration modulates gastrointestinal microbiota and antioxidant capacity to concurrently enhance skeletal muscle hypertrophy and redirect lipid deposition patterns, ultimately improving meat quality and carcass traits in Liaoning cashmere goats. Thirty female half-sibling kids were randomized into control and melatonin-treated groups (2 mg/kg live weight with subcutaneous implants). Postmortem analyses at 8 months assessed carcass traits, meat quality, muscle histology, plasma metabolites, and gut microbiota (16S rRNA sequencing). Melatonin supplementation decreased visceral adiposity (perirenal, omental, and mesenteric fat depots with a p < 0.05) while inducing muscle fiber hypertrophy (longissimus thoracis et lumborum (LTL) and biceps femoris (BF) with p < 0.05). The melatonin-treated group demonstrated elevated postmortem pH(24)h values, attenuated muscle drip loss, enhanced intramuscular protein deposition, and improved systemic antioxidant status (characterized by increased catalase and glutathione levels with concomitant reduction in malondialdehyde with p < 0.05). Melatonin reshaped gut microbiota, increasing alpha-diversity (p < 0.05) and enriching beneficial genera (Prevotella, Romboutsia, and Akkermansia), while suppressing lipogenic Desulfovibrio populations, and concomitant with improved intestinal morphology as evidenced by elevated villus height-to-crypt depth ratios. These findings establish that melatonin-mediated gastrointestinal microbiota remodeling drives anabolic muscle protein synthesis while optimizing fat deposition, providing a scientifically grounded strategy to enhance meat quality.

AB  - Early disruption of filial attachment appears to sensitize underlying threat-related processes to produce vulnerability for developing depression when encountering stressors later in life. Evidence indicates neuroinflammatory signaling mediates this effect, though exact mechanisms are poorly understood. In a guinea pig model, early periods of isolation from the mother produce depressive-like behavior and fever, which sensitize with repeated isolation. Because cyclooxygenase inhibitors reduce these effects, the sensitization appears to involve prostaglandins such as PGE-2. We asked if isolation increased central sensitivity to PGE-2, which could underlie the sensitization process. Experiment 1 established that intraventricular (ICV) infusion of 1 or 3 mu g of PGE-2 increased depressive-like behavior in pups. The 3 mu g dose also produced an initial suppression and then a rise in core temperature. In Experiment 2, repeated isolation of pups sensitized depressive-like behavior. Days later (early adolescence), 1 mu g of ICV-PGE-2 increased depressive-like behavior in previously isolated guinea pigs, but not in non-previously isolated controls. Core temperature was unaffected. Thus, early isolation from the mother increased sensitivity of depressive-like behavior, but not fever, to PGE-2. Results suggest that increased sensitivity to PGE-2 could play a role in the enhanced vulnerability to depression in adolescents previously exposed to early attachment disruption.

AB  - We hypothesized isocaloric diets low in protein would decrease the sensitivity of caruncular (CAR) and cotyledonary (COT) arteries compared to placental arteries from ewes receiving adequate metabolizable protein (MP) requirements. Pregnant ewes were fed one of three isocaloric dietary treatments that provided 60% (MP60), 80% (MP80), or 100% (MP100) of the MP requirements. Diets were fed from day 100-130 of gestation. In vitro dose response curves to bradykinin (BK), sodium nitroprusside (SNP), potassium chloride (KCl), and phenylephrine (PE) in CAR and COT arteries were performed. As MP decreased, the sensitivity to a low dose of KCl increased (P = 0.05) in the COT arteries. There was an overall treatment effect in the CAR and COT arteries for the BK dose response curve, where CAR arteries of MP80 ewes were more sensitive (P = 0.05) to BK compared with MP60 and MP100 ewes, and COT arteries of MP60 and MP80 ewes were more sensitive (P = 0.01) to BK compared with MP100 ewes. There were no treatment effects (P > 0.09) on the SNP or PE dose response curves in CAR or COT arteries. The mechanism of the BK induced vasodilation needs to be elucidated. Moreover, MP restriction appears to alter placental vascular function, which could help explain the differences in nutrient flux previously reported.(c) 2022 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Fear conditioning tasks enable us to explore the neural basis of adaptative and maladaptive behaviors related to aversive memories. Recently, we provided the first evidence of the dorsal subiculum (DSub) involvement in contextual fear conditioning (CFC) consolidation by showing that the post-training bilateral NMDA (N-methyl-Daspartate) receptor blockade in DSub impaired the performance of animals in the test session. As the memory consolidation process depends on the coordinated engagement of different brain regions, and the DSub share reciprocal projections with the basolateral amygdala (BLA), which is also involved in CFC, it is possible that the functional interaction between these sites can be relevant for the consolidation of this task. In this sense, the present study aimed to explore the effects of the functional disconnection of the DSub and BLA in the CFC consolidation after NMDA post-training blockade. In addition, to verify if the observed effects were due to spatial representation processes mediated by the DSub, we employed a hippocampal-independent procedure: tone fear conditioning (TFC). Results showed that the functional disconnection of these regions by post-training NMDA blockade impaired CFC consolidation, whereas there was no impairment in TFC. Altogether, the present data suggest that the DSub and BLA would functionally interact through NMDA-related synaptic plasticity to support CFC consolidation probably due to DSub-related spatial processing showing that the TFC consolidation was not disrupted. This work contributes to filling a gap of studies exploring the DSub involvement in fear conditioning by providing a broad framework of the subicular-amygdaloid connection functionality.

AB  - Research has shown the beneficial effects of naringin supplementation to adult rodents, which can ameliorate oxidative stress in disease models. However, evidence has demonstrated that polyphenol supplementation induced detrimental effects when consumed during sensitive periods of development, such as pregnancy. Therefore, we investigated the effect of maternal naringin supplementation during pregnancy on the offspring's cerebral redox status. Pregnant Wistar rats were divided into control and naringin groups and supplemented from gestational day 15 to gestational day 21. On postnatal days 1, 7, and 21, offspring were euthanized, and the prefrontal cortex, hippocampus, striatum, and cerebellum dissected. On postnatal day 1, maternal naringin supplementation positively modulated the pups' brain redox status. On postnatal day 7, a pro-oxidative milieu was observed in the offspring's striatum and cerebellum in a sex-dependent manner, even though the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus were not negatively affected. Besides, the alterations observed on postnatal day 7 did not persist up to weaning. Our findings demonstrated that the effect induced by naringin supplementation in the brain redox status differed according to the period of development in which naringin was consumed since the beneficial effects usually found in the adult rodents became detrimental when the supplementation was applied during pregnancy.

AB  - Wool color is controlled by a variety of genes. Although the gene regulation of some wool colors has been studied in relative depth, there may still be unknown genetic variants and control genes for some colors or different breeds of wool that need to be identified and recognized by whole genome resequencing. Therefore, we used whole genome resequencing data to compare and analyze sheep populations of different breeds by population differentiation index and nucleotide diversity ratios (Fst and theta pi ratio) as well as extended haplotype purity between populations (XP-EHH) to reveal selection signals related to wool coloration in sheep. Screening in the non-white wool color group (G1 vs. G2) yielded 365 candidate genes, among which PDE4B, GMDS, GATA1, RCOR1, MAPK4, SLC36A1, and PPP3CA were associated with the formation of non-white wool; an enrichment analysis of the candidate genes yielded 21 significant GO terms and 49 significant KEGG pathways (p < 0.05), among which 17 GO terms and 21 KEGG pathways were associated with the formation of non-white wool. Screening in the white wool color group (G2 vs. G1) yielded 214 candidate genes, including ABCD4, VSX2, ITCH, NNT, POLA1, IGF1R, HOXA10, and DAO, which were associated with the formation of white wool; an enrichment analysis of the candidate genes revealed 9 significant GO-enriched pathways and 19 significant KEGG pathways (p < 0.05), including 5 GO terms and 12 KEGG pathways associated with the formation of white wool. In addition to furthering our understanding of wool color genetics, this research is important for breeding purposes.

AB  - Groundwater is the most common source of drinking and irrigation in the world. As a result of human activities and natural processes, nitrate levels in most groundwater supplies in arid and semi-arid areas have risen in recent decades. As a result of human activities and natural processes, the levels of fluoride and nitrate in most groundwater supplies in arid and semi-arid areas have increased in recent decades. Thirty groundwater samples were taken from bore wells to learn about the contaminated situations of groundwater fluoride and nitrate in sections of Cuddapah, South India, and to determine the likely harm to the health of adults, children, and infants. In the study villages' wells, flouride concentrations range from 0.1-3.2 mg/L, with 40% of groundwater exceeding fluoride guidelines (1.5 mg/L) and Nitrate concentrations range from 23.2-110.8 mg/L, with 86.6% of groundwater exceeding nitrate guidelines (45 mg/L). 96% of groundwater exceeds the allowable THI values (>1) for adults (0.74-4.02), children (0.75-4.08), and infants (0.57-3.10). According to the PIG categorization, 23% of total groundwater samples fall into the low pollution zone (PIG: 1.38) whereas 47% of samples fall into the moderate pollution zone (1.83) and 30% of groundwater samples fall into the high pollution zone (2.20). Hence, appropriate preventative steps must be adopted to reduce the health risk in this area.

AB  - Background: Aging-induced decline in ciliary muscle function is an important factor in visual accommodative deficits in elderly adults. With this study, we provide an innovative investigation of the interaction between ciliary muscle aging and oxidative stress. Methods: Tricolor guinea pigs were used for the experiments in vivo and primary guinea pig ciliary smooth muscle cells were used for the experiments in vitro. Results: We enriched for genes associated with muscle-aging-lutein relationship using bioinformatics, including Nuclear factor-erythroid 2-related factor-2 (Nrf2), Glutathione Peroxidase (GPx) gene family, Superoxide Dismutase (SOD) gene family, NAD(P)H: Quinone Oxidoreductase 1 (NQO1) and Heme Oxygenase-1 (HO-1). After gavage to aged guinea pigs, lutein reduced Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) and P21 levels in senescent ciliary muscle; lutein decreased refractive error and restored accommodation of the eye. In addition, lutein increased GPx, SOD, and Catalase (CAT) levels in serum; lutein increased GPx and CAT levels in ciliary bodies. Lutein regulated the expression of proteins such as Nrf2, Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1 (Keap1), and downstream proteins in senescent ciliary bodies. Similarly, guinea pig ciliary muscle cell senescence was associated with oxidative stress. In vitro, 100 mu M lutein reversed the damage caused by 800 mu M H2O2; it reduced Senescence-Associated beta-galactosidase (SA-beta-Gal) and ROS activites, cell apoptosis and cell migration. Also, lutein increased the expression of smooth muscle contractile proteins. Lutein also increased the expression of Nrf2, GPx2, NQO1 and HO-1, decreased the expression of Keap1. A reduction in Nrf2 activity led to a reduction in the ability of lutein to activate antioxidant enzymes in the cells, thus reducing its inhibitory effect on cell senescence. Conclusion: lutein improved resistance to oxidative stress in senescent ciliary muscle in vivo and in vitro by regulating the Keap1/Nrf2/Antioxidant Response Element pathway. We have innovatively demonstrated the molecular pharmacological mechanism by which lutein reverse age-related ciliary muscle systolic and diastolic deficits.

AB  - Echolocation is a compelling example of behavioral convergence in mammals and has evolved independently in at least five mammalian lineages. Despite increasing evidence of convergent evolution in protein-coding regions among echolocating mammals, the evolution of gene regulatory activity underlying mammalian echolocation remains undetermined. Here, we systematically investigate chromatin accessibility and transcriptomic data from the hippocampi of echolocating bats and soft-furred tree mice, as the hippocampus plays a crucial role in processing echolocation signals. Our results showed significant evolutionary repeatability in accessible chromatin regions among echolocating mammals compared with their non-echolocating counterparts. An analysis that paired gene expression with chromatin accessibility revealed that echolocating mammals have more complex gene regulatory networks in the hippocampus than non-echolocating mammals. This complexity is primarily attributed to the observed evolutionary repeatability in accessible chromatin regions among echolocating mammals. The shared gene regulations among echolocating mammals are particularly enriched in functional terms related to synaptic function, which is supported by the higher synaptic and mitochondrial densities in soft-furred tree mice than in laboratory mice. These findings demonstrate significant evolutionary repeatability of gene regulatory activity in the hippocampus among echolocating mammalian species, suggesting crucial contributions of gene regulatory activities to convergent phenotypes in mammals.

AB  - Laboratory mice are predominantly used for one experiment only, i.e., new mice are ordered or bred for every new experiment. Moreover, most experiments use relatively young mice in the range of late adolescence to early adulthood. As a consequence, little is known about the day-to-day life of adult and aged laboratory mice. Here we present a long-term data set with three consecutive phases conducted with the same male mice over their lifetime in order to shed light on possible long-term effects of repeated cognitive stimulation. One third of the animals was trained by a variety of learning tasks conducted up to an age of 606 days. The mice were housed in four cages with 12 animals per cage; only four mice per cage had to repeatedly solve cognitive tasks for getting access to water using the IntelliCage system. In addition, these learner mice were tested in standard cognitive tests outside their home-cage. The other eight mice served as two control groups living in the same environment but without having to solve tasks for getting access to water. One control group was additionally placed on the test set-ups without having to learn the tasks. Next to the cognitive tasks, we took physiological measures (body mass, resting metabolic rate) and tested for dominance behavior, and attractivity in a female choice experiment. Overall, the mice were under surveillance until they died a natural death, providing a unique data set over the course of virtually their entire lives. Our data showed treatment differences during the first phase of our lifetime data set. Young learner mice showed a higher activity, less growth and resting metabolic rate, and were less attractive for female mice. These effects, however, were not preserved over the long-term. We also did not find differences in dominance or effects on longevity. However, we generated a unique and valuable set of long-term behavioral and physiological data from a single group of male mice and note that our long-term data contribute to a better understanding of the behavioral and physiological processes in male C57Bl/6J mice.</p>

   The Animal Welfare Assessment Grid is a method for assessing quality of life, originally designed for experimental primates. This study adapts this welfare assessment tool for use in cattle and pigs, by adapting the factors included in welfare assessment for these species and including data which had been collected previously as the standard approach to monitoring these species in a research setting. The main intention is that the results presented will demonstrate how the data collected in a research environment can be improved for welfare assessment and also demonstrate the applicability of this welfare assessment tool to cattle and pigs. This paper emphasises the importance of including behavioural information when assessing welfare and not simply relying on assessment of physical condition. As a tool for assessing quality of life over a lifetime, the Animal Welfare Assessment Grid also demonstrated the potential for aiding the decision-making of when euthanasia should be performed.
   The Animal Welfare Assessment Grid (AWAG) is a method for assessing quality of life, originally designed for experimental primates. This study adapts the AWAG for use in cattle and pigs, by adapting the factors included for these species and including data which had been collected previously as the standard approach to monitoring these species in research. The intention is that the results presented here will allow the future data collected for experimental cattle and pigs to be optimised for inclusion in an AWAG. Data were collected from two vaccine assessment studies at the Pirbright Institute. Factors were scored for every recorded event using retrospective data and CCTV clips. There was a lack of behavioural data recorded in both studies, which limited the accuracy of assessing each animal's welfare. This paper emphasises the importance of including behavioural information when assessing welfare and not simply relying on assessment of physical condition. Scores peaked following an exponential rise as animals reached set humane end points. This demonstrated the potential of using the AWAG to aid the decision-making of when euthanasia should be performed. Our study shows the AWAG to be a useful tool for assessing welfare, which can be used in harm:benefit assessment.

AB  - The mycotoxin deoxynivalenol (DON) is frequently present in cereals at low levels, resulting in its occurrence in food and feed. DON has been proven to alter the immune response and induce inflammation in all species, with pigs exhibiting heightened sensitivity and exposure. However, no study has yet evaluated the effects of exposure to DON at the recommended levels in pig feed. In two separate trials, piglets were subjected to control feed or feed contaminated with a low level of purified DON (0.83 mg/kg feed in trial 1 and 0.85 mg/kg feed in trial 2) for either three weeks (trial 1) or two weeks (trial 2). Additionally, a group of animals exposed to 2.85 mg/kg feed of DON was included as a positive control in Trial 1. The impact of DON on porcine tissues (intestine, liver, and spleen) was evaluated through histological and qPCR analyses of immune-related genes. Additionally, biochemical analyses and acute-phase proteins were examined in plasma samples. Lesions were identified in the intestine (jejunum and ileum), the liver, and the spleen of pigs receiving diets contaminated with low and high concentrations of DON. The low level of DON also resulted in impaired expression of genes associated with intestinal barrier integrity, intestinal immune responses, and liver function. In conclusion, the results of the two trials demonstrate the impact of DON exposure even at doses below the recommended level of 0.9 mg/kg feed set by the European Union. This suggests that the current recommended level should be reconsidered to ensure the optimal health and well-being of pigs.

AB  - Tissues, such as skin, bones, and tendons, exhibit a piezoelectric effect, which may be an important phenomenon in terms of tissue renewal and regeneration as well as the possibility of modifying their mechanical behavior. In this article, we present the design and development of an in-house system for the precise measurement of electrical potentials and mechanical properties of tendons. The system was validated using tendon fascicle bundles derived from positional as well as energy-storing tendons from various adult mammals (porcine, bovine, and deer samples). The presented system is able to capture changes in elastic and viscoelastic properties of tissue as well as its time-voltage response and, thus, may be used in a broad spectrum of future studies to uncover factors influencing piezoelectric phenomena in tendons. This, in turn, will help to optimize current methods used in physiotherapy and postoperative treatment for effective tendon recovery.

AB  - A major proportion of primary production is lost to insect herbivory. Leaf functional traits representing defense costs and palatability explain the intensity of herbivory at local scales. However, whether leaf traits explain herbivory at large scales needs clarification. By combining a leaf herbivory database and the TRY plant-trait database, we compared 190 species from 65 families across 45 sites in nine countries. We hypothesized that defensive and/or nutrient-poor leaves would compromise herbivory less globally. Both the absolute and percentage of maximum leaf-area loss were higher in the tropical zone. Larger leaves lost more disproportionate areas to chewer herbivores whenever phylogenetic signals were considered. Thin leaves with low leaf mass per area (LMA) and short lifespan were compromised more by herbivory based on the leaf trait syndrome. Although thin leaves were rich in nitrogen, phosphorus, and calcium, only leaf nitrogen marginally explained the loss of leaf area. The contribution of leaf area dominated the herbivory intensity among all other morphological and chemical traits. Overall, the benefits of chewers on herbivory were based on leaf area, because the loss of leaf biomass and nitrogen increased proportionally with its loss. Leaf construction costs, but not nutrient content, determined the intensity of herbivory globally. However, the overall percentage of loss in leaf area was not high, demonstrating the importance of elucidating the relationship between leaf functional traits and induced defense in future studies.

AB  - Intestinal epithelial stem cells (ISCs) are responsible for intestinal epithelial barrier renewal; thereby, ISCs play a critical role in intestinal pathophysiology research. While transgenic ISC reporter mice are available, advanced translational studies lack a large animal model. This study validates ISC isolation in a new porcine Leucine Rich Repeat Containing G Protein-Coupled Receptor 5 (LGR5) reporter line and demonstrates the use of these pigs as a novel colorectal cancer (CRC) model. We applied histology, immunofluorescence, fluorescence-activated cell sorting, flow cytometry, gene expression quantification, and 3D organoid cultures to whole tissue and single cells from the duodenum, jejunum, ileum, and colon of LGR5-H2B-GFP and wild-type pigs. Ileum and colon LGR5-H2B-GFP, healthy human, and murine biopsies were compared by mRNA fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH). To model CRC, adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) mutation was induced by CRISPR/Cas9 editing in porcine LGR5-H2B-GFP colonoids. Crypt-base, green fluorescent protein (GFP) expressing cells co-localized with ISC biomarkers. LGR5-H2B-GFP(hi) cells had significantly higher LGR5 expression (p < .01) and enteroid forming efficiency (p < .0001) compared with LGR5-H2B-GFP(med/lo/neg) cells. Using FISH, similar LGR5, OLFM4, HOPX, LYZ, and SOX9 expression was identified between human and LGR5-H2B-GFP pig crypt-base cells. LGR5-H2B-GFP/APC(null) colonoids had cystic growth in WNT/R-spondin-depleted media and significantly upregulated WNT/beta-catenin target gene expression (p < .05). LGR5(+) ISCs are reproducibly isolated in LGR5-H2B-GFP pigs and used to model CRC in an organoid platform. The known anatomical and physiologic similarities between pig and human, and those shown by crypt-base FISH, underscore the significance of this novel LGR5-H2B-GFP pig to translational ISC research.

AB  - Silicon, in its nanoscale form, has shown plant-promoting and insecticidal properties. To date, however, we lack mechanistic evidence for how nanoscale silicon influences the regulation of plant chemical defenses against herbivore attacks. To address this gap, we compared the effect of Si nanodots (NDs) and sodium silicate, a conventional silicate fertilizer, on maize (Zea mays L.) chemical defenses against the oriental armyworm (Mythimna separata, Walker) caterpillars. We found that Si NDs and sodium silicate additions, at the dose of 50 mg/L, significantly inhibited the growth of caterpillars by 53.5% and 34.2%, respectively. This increased plant resistance was associated with a 44.2% increase in the production of chlorogenic acid, as well as the expression of PAL, C4H, 4CL, C3H and HCT, core genes involved in the biosynthesis of chlorogenic acid, by 1.7, 2.4, 1.9, 1.8 and 4.5 folds, respectively. Particularly, in the presence of M. separata, physiological changes in maize plants treated with 50 mg/L Si NDs, including changes in shoot biomass, leaf nutrients (e.g., K, P, Si), and chemical defense compounds (e.g., chlorogenic acid, total phenolics), were higher than those of plants added with equivalent concentrations of conventional silicate fertilizer. Taken together, our findings indicate that Si, in nanoscale form, could replace synthetic pesticides, and be implemented for a more effective and ecologically-sound management of insect pests in maize crop farming.

AB  - Simple Summary Climate change has intensified high environmental temperatures, subjecting farm animals to heat stress conditions. In this study, the thermoregulatory responses of Blackbelly adult ewes and female lambs, during the summer under tropical conditions, in southern Mexico were analyzed. The combination of temperature and relative humidity in summer in tropical conditions causes heat stress in hair ewes, resulting in thermoregulatory problems. To counteract these effects, females modify their physiological constants to avoid reproductive and productive problems under these production conditions. High environmental temperatures cause heat stress in ewes, resulting in thermoregulatory problems. In this study, the thermoregulatory responses of Blackbelly adult ewes (G1, n = 14) and female lambs (G2, n = 7), during the summer under tropical conditions, in southern Mexico were analyzed. Different physiological variables and skin temperatures (ST) of the ewes were recorded. Breathing frequency (BF) values were similar between groups at 116.73 +/- 33.598 bpm (G1) and 113.661 +/- 34.515 bpm (G2) (p > 0.05). In the case of skin elasticity (SE), there were no significant differences between the time of day and the age of the ewes (p > 0.05). Significant differences were observed between groups for BF, rectal temperature (RT), and heart rate (HR) values (p < 0.05). All ST values, for both groups, were significantly higher during the afternoon (p < 0.001). In general, all Blackbelly adult ewes and female lambs during the summer present severe heat stress conditions as a result of an increase in physiological constants and ST. It is concluded that all ewes thermoregulate body temperature by modifying different physiological variables to counteract the effect of heat stress.

While advances in computer vision and artificial intelligence enable non-invasive weight estimation, implementing these techniques in real-world agricultural scenarios still faces the challenge of requiring robust and scalable solutions. We developed a video-based system for non-invasive sheep weight estimation using a Microsoft Kinect V2 sensor. The methodology integrates automated frame selection with the EfficientNetB3 model, segmentation with a U-Net architecture featuring a DenseNet169 backbone, and weight estimation via convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and an ensemble approach to enhance accuracy. The EfficientNetB3 model achieved the highest performance in frame selection, with an F1-score of 95.43%. The segmentation model obtained a Dice coefficient of 96% and a Jaccard index of 92%, ensuring precise animal isolation. Weight estimation using EfficientNetB2 combined with linear regression at a resolution of 1024 x 1024 pixels resulted in a Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of 3.44 kg and a coefficient of determination (R 2) of 0.90. The ensemble approach further improved accuracy, reducing the RMSE to 3.44 kg and increasing the R 2 to 0.90. The proposed system provides a non-invasive, automated, and cost-effective solution for sheep weight monitoring that minimizes human intervention and reduces animal stress. Future research will focus on refining segmentation techniques and optimizing computational efficiency for broader applicability.

AB  - Deep second and third degree burns treatment requires fibroblasts, keratinocytes and other skin cells in order to grow new dermis and epidermis. Cells can proliferate, secrete growth factors and extracellular matrix required to repair the damaged tissue. Radiosterilized human amnion and radiosterilized pig skin have been used as natural origin skin dressings for burned patients. Adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells can differentiate into fibroblasts and keratinocytes and improve wound-healing progress. These cells can stimulate vascular tissue formation, release growth factors, synthetize new extracellular matrix and immunoregulate other cells. In this study, we developed mesenchymal stem cells-cellularized skin substitutes based from radiosterilized human amnion or pig skin. Third-degree burns were induced in mice animal models to evaluate the effect of cellularized skin substitutes on burn wound healing. Mesenchymal phenotype was immunophenotypically confirmed by flow cytometry and cell viability was close to 100%. Skin recovery was evaluated in burned mice after seven and fourteen days post-coverage with cellularized and non-cellularized sustitutes. Histological techniques and immunofluorescence were used to evaluate re-epithelization and type I collagen deposition. We determined that cellularized-human amnion or cellularized-pig skin in combination with mesenchymal stem cells improve extracellular matrix deposition. Both cellularized constructs increase detection of type I collagen in newly formed mouse skin and can be potentially used as skin coverage for further clinical treatment of burned patients.

AB  - Plant roots can be colonized by many symbiotic fungi, whereas it is unclear whether and how symbiotic fungi including arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi and endophytic fungi promote phosphorus (P) uptake in Camellia oleifera plants. The objective of the present study was to analyze the effect of inoculation with a culturable endophytic fungus (Piriformospora indica), three arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (Funneliformis mosseae, Diversispora versiformis, and Rhizophagus intraradices), and mixture of F. mosseae, D. versiformis and R. intraradices on plant growth, root architecture, soil Olsen-P, soil phosphatase activities, leaf and root P concentrations, and phosphate transporter gene expressions, in order to explore the potential and mechanism of these symbiotic fungi on P acquisition. All the symbiotic fungi colonized roots of C. oleifera after 16 weeks, with P. indica showing the best effect on fungal colonization. All the symbiotic fungi significantly increased acid, neutral, and total phosphatase activities in the soil, accompanied with an elevation of soil Olsen-P, of which P. indica presented the best effect. All symbiotic fungal treatments, except D. versiformis, significantly promoted plant growth, coupled with an increase in root total length, area, and volume. Symbiotic fungi almost up-regulated root CoPHO1-3 expressions as well as leaf CoPHO1-1, CoPHO1-3, and CoPHT1;4 expressions. Correlation analysis showed that P concentrations in leaves and roots were significantly positively correlated with root morphological variables (length, volume, and surface area) and soil acid, neutral and total phosphatase activities. It is concluded that symbiotic fungi, especially P. indica, played an important role in P uptake of C. oleifera plants through regulating root architecture, part plant phosphate transporter gene expressions and soil phosphatase activities.

AB  - Simple Summary: Calprotectin (CALP, S100A8/A9) is a calcium and zinc-binding protein involved in inflammation that has a wide range of proinflammatory functions, such as cytokine production and regulation of leukocyte adhesion, migration, and phagocytosis. The objective of this study was to validate a commercially available assay for the measurement of CALP in the saliva of pigs and study the variations of this analyte due to sepsis, non-septic inflammation, and stress. The assay showed adequate precision and accuracy for the measurements of CALP in the saliva of pigs. In addition, this protein showed significant increases in the saliva of pigs with sepsis as well as after a stressful situation in our experimental conditions, being the increase in the stress of lower magnitude than in sepsis. Based on these results, CALP can be measured in the saliva of pigs and could be a potential biomarker of health and welfare in this species.Calprotectin (CALP, S100A8/A9), also named myeloid-related protein 8/14, is a dimer complex of S100A8 and S100A9 that belongs to the S-100 protein family. It is involved in inflammation and has a wide range of proinflammatory functions, such as cytokine production and regulation of leukocyte adhesion, migration, and phagocytosis. In humans, CALP traditionally can be measured in faeces, serum, and saliva as a biomarker of inflammation and sepsis. The objective of this study was to validate an automated assay for CALP measurements in the saliva of pigs, having the advantage of the use of a non-invasive sample that is easy to collect. The assay was precise and accurate. CALP in saliva measured by this assay showed significant changes depending on the hour of the day. It also showed significant increases in the saliva of pigs after the administration of lipopolysaccharide (LPS), and showed a rise, although with increases of lower magnitude, after a stressful stimulus. Further studies should be made to gain knowledge about the possible practical applications of the measurements of CALP in the saliva of pigs as a biomarker to evaluate the animals' health and welfare.

AB  - Simple Summary
   Guinea pigs are popular pets, but there is still a lack of information about their morphology. Variable morphology of the vertebral column can lead to incorrect localization of spinal diseases or the site of surgical intervention. This study aimed to determine the numerical variants of vertebral column and prevalence, localization, and type of congenital anomalies of the vertebral column. Vertebral column radiographs were reviewed in 240 guinea pigs, and nine numerical variants of the vertebral column were noticed. The most common vertebral formula, seven cervical, 13 thoracic, six lumbar, four sacral, and five to seven caudal vertebrae, was found in 75% of guinea pigs. Congenital anomalies were also found as incidental findings in 12.5% of guinea pigs, mostly in the thoracolumbar and lumbosacral regions. The most common congenital anomalies were a variable morphology of the last pair of ribs in the thoracolumbar region and transitional vertebra with a mixed morphological characteristic of lumbar and sacral vertebrae in the lumbosacral region. The cervical region was the least common region for congenital anomalies of the vertebral column. Our results contribute to the knowledge of clinical morphology in guinea pigs applicable in both, research and clinical practice.
   The objectives of this retrospective study of 240 guinea pigs (148 females and 92 males) were to determine the prevalence of different vertebral formulae and the type and anatomical localization of congenital vertebral anomalies (CVA). Radiographs of the cervical (C), thoracic (Th), lumbar (L), sacral (S), and caudal (Cd) part of the vertebral column were reviewed. Morphology and number of vertebrae in each segment of the vertebral column and type and localization of CVA were recorded. In 210/240 guinea pigs (87.50%) with normal vertebral morphology, nine vertebral formulae were found with constant number of C but variable number of Th, L, and S vertebrae: C7/Th13/L6/S4/Cd5-7 (75%), C7/Th13/L6/S3/Cd6-7 (4.17%), C7/Th13/L5/S4/Cd6-7 (2.50%), C7/Th13/L6/S5/Cd5-6 (1.67%), C7/Th12/L6/S4/Cd6 (1.25%), C7/Th13/L7/S4/Cd6 (1.25%), C7/Th13/L7/S3/Cd6-7 (0.83%), C7/Th12/L7/S4/Cd5 (0.42%), C7/Th13/L5/S5/Cd7 (0.42%). CVA were found in 30/240 (12.5%) of guinea pigs, mostly as a transitional vertebra (28/30), which represents 100% of single CVA localised in cervicothoracic (n = 1), thoracolumbar (n = 22) and lumbosacral segments (n = 5). Five morphological variants of thoracolumbar transitional vertebrae (TTV) were identified. Two (2/30) guinea pigs had a combination of CVA: cervical block vertebra and TTV (n = 1) and TTV and lumbosacral transitional vertebra (LTV) (n = 1). These findings suggest that guinea pigs' vertebral column displays more morphological variants with occasional CVA predominantly transitional vertebrae.

AB  - Animal migration (round-trip, predictable movements) takes individuals across space and time, bringing them into contact with new communities of organisms. In particular, migratory movements shape (and are shaped by) the costs and risk of parasite transmission. Unfortunately, our understanding of how migration and parasite infection interact has not proceeded evenly. Although numerous conceptual frameworks (e.g. mathematical models) have been developed, most empirical evidence of migration-parasite interactions are drawn from pre-existing empirical studies that were conducted using other conceptual frameworks, which limits our understanding. Here, we synthesise and analyse existing work, and then provide a roadmap for future (especially empirical) studies. First, we synthesise the conceptual frameworks that have been developed to understand interactions between migration and parasites (e.g. migratory exposure, escape, allopatry, recovery, culling, separation, stalling and relapse). Second, we highlight current challenges to studying migration and parasites empirically, and to integrating empirical and theoretical perspectives, particularly emphasizing the challenge of feedback loops. Finally, we provide a guide to overcoming these challenges in empirical studies, using comparative, observational and experimental approaches. Beyond guiding future empirical work, this review aims to inspire stronger collaboration between empiricists and theorists studying the intersection of migration and parasite infection. Such collaboration will help overcome current limits to our understanding of how migration and parasites interact, and allow us to predict how these critical ecological processes will change in the future.

AB  - The high-osmolarity-sensitive protein Sho1 functions as a key membrane receptor in phytopathogenic fungi, which can sense and respond to external stimuli or stresses, and synergistically regulate diverse fungal biological processes through cellular signaling pathways. In this study, we investigated the biological functions of AaSho1 in Alternaria alternata, the causal agent of pear black spot. Targeted gene deletion revealed that AaSho1 is essential for infection structure differentiation, response to external stresses and synthesis of secondary metabolites. Compared to the wild-type (WT), the Delta AaSho1 mutant strain showed no significant difference in colony growth, morphology, conidial production and biomass accumulation. However, the mutant strain exhibited significantly reduced levels of melanin production, cellulase (CL) and ploygalacturonase (PG) activities, virulence, resistance to various exogenous stresses. Moreover, the appressorium and infection hyphae formation rates of the Delta AaSho1 mutant strain were significantly inhibited. RNA-Seq results showed that there were four branches including pheromone, cell wall stress, high osmolarity and starvation in the Mitogen-activated Protein Kinase (MAPK) cascade pathway. Furthermore, yeast two-hybrid experiments showed that AaSho1 activates the MAPK pathway via AaSte11-AaPbs2-AaHog1. These results suggest that AaSho1 of A. alternata is essential for fungal development, pathogenesis and osmotic stress response by activating the MAPK cascade pathway via Sho1-Ste11Pbs2-Hog1.

AB  - Nontarget effects from mosquito control operations are possible in habitats adjacent to areas targeted by ultra-low-volume (ULV) sprays of permethrin for adult mosquito control. We assessed the risks of permethrin exposure to butterflies, particularly the imperiled Klot's skipper, when exposed to ground-based ULV sprays. Samples of larval host plant leaves (sawgrass) were collected in June (in mosquito season) and January (outside mosquito season) of 2015 from sawgrass marsh habitats of the National Key Deer Wildlife Refuge (Big Pine Key, FL, USA) and analyzed for permethrin. Permethrin detection was higher in June (detected on 70% of samples) than in January (30%), and concentrations were significantly higher in June (geomean = 2.1 ng/g, median = 2.4) relative to January (0.4 ng/g, median = 0.2). Dietary risk for 4th to 5th-instar larvae was low based on the measured residues. The AGricultural DISPersal model (Ver. 8.26) was used to estimate permethrin residues on sawgrass following ULV sprays (deposited residues) to estimate immediate postspray risk. Estimated deposited residues (33-543 ng/g) were much higher than measured residues, which leads to a higher risk likelihood for butterfly larvae immediately after ULV sprays. The difference between estimated and measured residues, and between the two risk estimations, reflects uncertainty in risk estimates based on the measured residues. Research on modeling deposited pesticide residues following ground-based ULV spray is limited. More research on estimating deposited pesticide residues from truck-mounted ULV sprayers could help reduce uncertainty in the risk predictions for nontarget insects like butterflies.

AB  - Episodic memory formation is fundamental to cognition and plays a key role in eating behaviors, indirectly promoting the maintenance and acceleration of weight gain. Impaired episodic memory function is a hallmark of people with overweight/obesity, nevertheless, little research has been conducted to explore the effects of overweight/obesity on neural networks associated with episodic memory. The current study aimed to unravel the behavioral responses and neurocognitive mechanisms underlying the episodic memory for food and non-food cues in females with overweight/obesity. To explore this issue, a group of females with overweight/obesity (n = 26) and a group of age-matched females with healthy weight (n = 28) participated in a functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) event-related episodic memory paradigm, during which pictures of palatable food and pictures of neutral daily necessities were presented. Whole-brain analyses revealed differential engagement in several neural regions between the groups during an episodic memory task. Specifically, compared to the healthy weight controls, females with overweight/obesity exhibited reduced brain activity in the temporal, parietal, and frontal regions during episodic memory encoding and successful retrieval of both food and non-food cues. Additionally, activation patterns in the left hippocampus and right olfactory cortex of females with and without overweight/obesity suggested that item memory changed according to the type of stimuli presented during item memory. Specifically, females with overweight/obesity showed greater engagement of the left hippocampus and right olfactory cortex when processing food cues, but less activation of the left hippocampus and right olfactory cortex when presented with non-food cues. Consistent with the obesity and suboptimal food-related decision theoretical model, these findings provide evidence of dissociation of the neural underpinnings of episodic memory in females with overweight/obesity and underline important effects of overweight/obesity on brain functions related to episodic memory.

AB  - The purpose of this study is to investigate the potential effects of 5-hydroxytryptophan (5-HTP) duodenal perfusion on melatonin (MT) synthesis in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract of sheep. 5-hydroxytryptophan is a precursor in the melatonin synthetic pathway. The results showed that this method significantly increased melatonin production in the mucosa of all segments in GI tract including duodenum, jejunum, ileum, cecum and colon. The highest melatonin level was identified in the colon and this indicates that the microbiota located in the colon may also participate in the melatonin production. In addition, portion of the melatonin generated by the GI tract can pass the liver metabolism and enters the circulation via portal vein. The current study provides further evidence to support that GI tract is the major site for melatonin synthesis and the GI melatonin also contributes to the circulatory melatonin level since plasma melatonin concentrations in 5-HTP treated groups were significantly higher than those in the control group. In conclusion, the results show that 10-50 mg of 5-HTP flowing into the duodenum within 6 h effectively improve the production of melatonin in the GI tract and melatonin concentration in sheep blood circulation during the day.

AB  - Two species of the hepaticolous genus Octosporella (Pyronemataceae, Pezizales) have been recorded from southern Australia on host species that are hitherto unknown as substrates for ascomycetes. Octosporella australis sp. nov. is characterized by large setose ascomata, 3 -or 4-spored asci, large ellipsoidal ascospores, 36-65 x 10-15 mu m, with unthickened spore walls at cell poles and occurring on the terrestrial liverwort Lethocolea pansa (Jungermanniales). Three collections were gathered on Kangaroo Island, South Australia, on seasonally flooded riverbanks. Phylogenetic analyses of the LSU, SSU and EF1-alpha sequences showed that the collections of this new species form a well-supported monophyletic group and clearly differ from all other species of Octosporella. The second species was assigned to O. jungermanniarum agg. which is widely distributed in Europe on several unrelated liverworts. The Australian collection deviates in its somewhat narrower ascospores, but molecular analyses placed the studied specimen among European collections of O. jungermanniarum from various host species. This species infects the liverwort Lophocolea semiteres (Jungermanniales) and was recorded on the Fleurieu Peninsula on mossy rocks. Apart from a single collection of O. nematospora from New Zealand, these Australian collections are the only records of Octosporella species for the whole Southern Hemisphere. Both species have multinucleate ascospores and O. australis, with predominantly 8-nucleate ascospores, has the highest known number of nuclei in ascospores among all studied species of octosporaceous fungi and the whole family Pyronemataceae.

AB  - Ethnopharmacological relevance: Erigeron canadensis has been used in traditional medicine to treat a variety of respiratory diseases, including acute upper and lower respiratory tract infections and cough-related asthma. There is as yet no relevant experimental or clinical study in the scientific literature evaluating the efficacy of plants in these disorders. Aim of the study: To investigate the active ingredients in Erigeron canadensis, a complex isolated from flowering parts of a plant was tested for airway defense reflexes, in particular for cough reflexes and airway reactivity. Both were experimentally induced by a chemical irritant that simulated the inflammatory conditions of their formation. Material and methods: The polyphenolic polysaccharide-protein (PPP) complex was isolated from the flowering parts of Erigeron canadensis by hot alkaline extraction and a multi-stage purification process. The antitussive activity was confirmed as a decrease in the number of citric acid-induced coughs and the bronchodilator effect was verified as a decrease in specific airway resistance (sRaw) in conscious guinea pigs. Results: The dark brown Erigeron complex with a molecular weight of 38,000 g/mol contained phenolics (13.2% wt%), proteins (16.3% wt%), and uronic acids (6.3% wt%). The neutral carbohydrate part of Erigeron consisted mainly of xylose (12.1 wt%), glucose (13.3 wt%), arabinose (24.1 wt%), and galactose (41.0 wt%) residues. Arabinogalactan and 4-OMe-glucuronoxylan have been found to be the major polysaccharides in the Erigeron complex. Using a method of chemically-induced cough reflex and guinea pigs test system the Erigeron complex exhibited statistically significant, the dose-dependent antitussive activity, which was similar to that of the centrally-acting opioid agonist codeine. Conclusion: Pharmacological tests have revealed a new pharmacodynamic effect of the Erigeron complex, namely an antitussive effect. Its activity was most pronounced in comparison with all previously tested compounds from other medicinal plants and approached the effect of codeine, the most potent antitussive used in clinical practice. The results provide the scientific basis for the application of this herb in traditional medicine.

AB  - Automatic body size measurement of livestock using 3D vision technology is one of the current research focuses. Point clouds obtained from freely walking livestock involve a variety of postures. However, measuring livestock body sizes requires their upright and straight standard postures, and non-standard measurement postures such as bending their body or lowering their head lead to inaccuracy in body size estimation. In this paper, we analyze 207 groups of point cloud data collected from 25 landrace pigs, and propose a standard posture classification algorithm. By using the algorithm based on the median skeleton extraction, 22 key points of the pig's skeleton were obtained and all joint point vector eigenvalue sets were calculated. Then Bagging-SVM Posture Classifier was constructed, and by three experts' votes, comparisons were made between the automatic classification results and the manual classification results based on standard and non-standard postures of pigs. According to the automatic calculation of four parameters including body length, body height, body width and abdominal girth in standard and non-standard postures, the experimental data showed that the body size measurement results in standard postures presented high stability and consistency, while the results in non-standard postures fluctuated considerably, which significantly affected the accuracy and stability. The experiment showed that the ratio of standard postures to non-standard postures was 1:3. Finally, based on joint point vectors eigenvalues, the regression models were applied to adjust body length, body height, body width and abdominal girth in nonstandard postures. The linear regression and nonlinear regression methods such as BP regression and SVR support vector regression were used for comparison. The experimental results indicated that various regression methods can significantly improve the accuracy of automatic measurement by correcting the pig's body size measurement results in non-standard postures. Therefore, it is essential to classify and adjust the livestock point cloud postures to improve the accuracy of three-dimensional measurement.

AB  - Stock assessment models often require an external estimate of the natural mortality rate (M) that is usually assumed to be the same for all ages and years in the model. Although the fixed M assumption can be a major oversimplification, model diagnostics (e.g. profile likelihoods) that can help provide an understanding of how the choice of M affects model fit are often not used in practice. In the state-space setting, model diagnostics are especially complicated because of the complex dependencies in the data caused by process errors. To get a better understanding of the effect of broad changes in M across all ages and years on the state-space model fit, we develop new methods that provide profile likelihoods for individual data sources (surveys, landings, age compositions) by decomposing the state-space integrated likelihood. We also use local influence diagnostics to assess the influence of age and year specific changes in M on model fit. We jointly call these methods M diagnostics and apply them to a case study for American plaice (Hippoglossoides platessoides) on the Grand Bank of Newfoundland. The M diagnostics indicate that most input data sources are fit better with a higher M in recent years. We suggest that M diagnostics should be routinely examined when formulating an assessment model.

AB  - Simple Summary Ascodipteron Adensamer, 1896 is a small genus of bat flies distributed in tropical and subtropical areas of the Eastern Hemisphere, with 16 valid species currently known. Ascodipteron has not been taxonomically well-studied in China, where only four species have been reported. Here, a new species, Ascodipteron guoliangi sp. nov. from Fujian Province, is described, based on dealate neosomic females and supported by molecular data from the cytochrome B (Cytb) and cytochrome oxidase subunit I (COI) genes. A new species of the genus Ascodipteron Adensamer, 1896 (Diptera: Hippoboscidae) is described from Fujian, namely A. guoliangi sp. nov. Habitus and diagnostic details, as well as the attachment sites on the host, are documented with photographs. A detailed comparison of the new species with related species is provided and the new species is accommodated in the most recent key to the world species of Ascodipteron.

AB  - BACKGROUND The present study aimed to investigate the effects of low protein diets balanced with four amino acids on growth performance, meat quality and cecal microflora of finishing pigs. Fifty-four healthy hybrid barrows (Duroc x Landrace x Yorkshire) with an average body weight of 70.12 +/- 4.03 kg were randomly assigned to one of the three dietary treatments with six replicate pens per treatment (three barrows per pen). The three dietary treatments included a normal protein diet (NP), a low protein diet (LP) and a very low protein diet (VLP). RESULTS The average daily gain, average daily feed intake and feed conversion ratio of pigs were not significantly changed with the LP and VLP diets compared to the NP diet (P > 0.05). The water holding capacity and shear force of longissimus dorsi muscle were decreased, whereas the intramuscular fat content of the longissimus dorsi muscle was increased (P < 0.05) in pigs fed with the LP and VLP diets compared to the NP diet. The contents of saturated fatty acids in muscle were decreased (P < 0.05), whereas the content of polyunsaturated fatty acids in muscle was increased (P < 0.01) with the VLP diet compared to the NP diet. The contents of histamine, spermidine, spermine and tyramine of muscle were decreased with the VLP diet compared to the NP diet (P < 0.05). The relative abundance of Turicibacter, Terrisporobacter, Clostridium_sensu_stricto_1 and UCG-005 was higher (P < 0.05), whereas the relative abundance of Lactobacillus and Streptococcus was lower (P < 0.05) in pigs fed with the LP and VLP diets compared to the NP diet. Based on the correlation of cecal microbiota and cecal biogenic amine, the contents of tyramine, spermidine and histamine were negatively correlated with the abundance of Terrisporobacter (P < 0.01) and the content of histamine was positively correlated with the abundance of Lactobacillus (P < 0.01). CONCLUSION Balanced with four essential amino acids, the VLP diet with crude protein levels decreased by > 4% increased the intramuscular fat content, changed the fatty acid and amino acid composition of longissimus dorsi muscle and the profile of cecum microbiota, and reduced the content of cecum bioamine, with no negative effect on the growth performance of pigs.

AB  - During the last ten years, the problem of subterranean termites in Alexandria, Egypt has worsened, causing great economic losses. Throughout our study to survey the termite species in Alexandria, a species was found that differed from any of the previously recorded ones in Egypt. The aim of this study was to identify this invasive subterranean species in the region. Samples were collected from infested buildings and trees, and their morphological characteristics along with their DNA barcoding loci (COII, 18S and 28S) were determined. Moreover, phylogenetic comparison with other related species were also considered for the most accurate identification. The analysis of all the previously mentioned parameters proved that it is Coptotermes sp. This genus is identified and recorded for the first time in Egypt and North Africa. This study demonstrates that the combination of molecular and morphological methods is essential for accurate species identification, which aids in the correct control of destructive pests.

AB  - Cucurbita foetidissima and C. radicans are scarcely studied wild pumpkin species that grow in arid and semi-arid areas of Mexico and the United States. This study describes the morphological, proximal composition, metabolic finger-prints and seed protein profiles of C. foetidissima and C. radicans fruits collected in the wild during a one-year period in different locations of central-western Mexico. The results obtained complement the limited information concerning the fruit composition of C. foetidissima and greatly expand information in this respect regarding C. radicans. Morphology and proximal composition of their fruits varied significantly. Different metabolic fingerprints and seed protein profiles were detected between them and also with the chemical composition of domesticated Cucurbita fruits. The neutral lipids in seed, pulp and peels were rich in wax content and in unsaturated compounds, probably carotenoids and tocopherols, in addition to tri-, di- and mono-acylglycerols. The tri- and diacylglycerol profiles of their seed oils were different from commercial seed oils and between each other. They also showed unusual fatty acid compositions. Evidence of a possible alkaloid in the pulp and peel of both species was obtained in addition to several putative cucurbitacins. An abundance of phenolic acids was found in all fruit parts, whereas flavonoids were only detected in the peels. Unlike most cucurbits, globulins were not the main protein fraction in the seeds of C. radicans, whereas the non-structural carbohydrate and raffinose oligosaccharide content in their fruit parts was lower than in other wild cucurbit species. These results emphasize the significantly different chemical composition of these two marginally studied Cucurbita species, which was more discrepant in C. radicans, despite the notion regarding C. foetidissima as an aberrant species with no affinity to any other Cucurbita species.

AB  - BACKGROUNDMethyl salicylate (MeSa), a plant defense elicitor and whitefly deterrent, has been shown to reduce the settlement of the glasshouse whitefly (Trialeurodes vaporariorum) on host plants. This study aimed to evaluate the dispersal effect of MeSa on whiteflies settled on tomato plants and assess the efficacy of yellow sticky traps (YST) and green light-emitting diode (LED)-enhanced YST (green LED trap (GLT)) in recapturing dispersed whiteflies. These findings form the basis for developing a push-pull strategy to enhance whitefly control.RESULTSInitial experiments tested varying MeSa concentrations, revealing that higher concentrations significantly increased whitefly dispersal, with the highest concentration causing nearly four times more dispersal compared to the control. Subsequent scaling-up experiments evaluated the dispersal effect of the most effective MeSa concentration from the first experiment, in presence of a YST or a GLT. Results revealed that MeSa significantly increased whitefly dispersal from plants within just 2 h, with nearly 50% dispersal after 24 h and 95% recapture rate on the traps. The GLT consistently captured more whiteflies than the YST, and both traps showed enhanced catching efficacy in the presence of MeSa compared to the control.CONCLUSIONThese findings highlight the potential of combining MeSa as whitefly dispersal factor (push) with green LED-enhanced traps as attractive factor (pull) in push-pull strategies to improve targeted whitefly control in glasshouse crops, while reducing reliance on pesticides.

AB  - 5-Hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) is an inhibitory neurotransmitter widely distributed in mammalian tissues, exerting its effects through binding to various receptors. It plays a crucial role in the proliferation of granulosa cells (GCs) and the development of follicles in female animals, however, its effect on porcine follicle development is not clear. The aim of this study is to investigate the expression of 5-HT and its receptors in various parts of the pig ovary, as well as the effect of 5-HT on porcine follicular development by using ELISA, quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) and EdU assays. Firstly, we examined the levels of 5-HT and its receptors in porcine ovaries, follicles, and GCs. The findings revealed that the expression of different 5-HT receptors varied among follicles of different sizes. To investigate the relationship between 5-HT and its receptors, we exposed the GCs to 5-HT and found a decrease in 5-HT receptor expression compared to the control group. Subsequently, the treatment of GCs with 0.5 mu M, 5 mu M, and 50 mu M 5-HT showed an increase in the expression of cell cycle-related genes, and EdU results indicated cell proliferation after the 0.5 mu M 5-HT treatment. Additionally, the expression of genes involved in E2 synthesis was examined after the treatment of granulosa cells with 0.5 mu M 5-HT. The results showed that CYP19A1 and HSP17 beta 1 expression was decreased. These results suggest that 5-HT might affect the development of porcine follicle by promoting the proliferation of GCs and inhibiting the synthesis of estrogen. This provides a new finding for exploring the effect of 5-HT on follicular development, and lays a foundation for further research on the mechanism of 5-HT in follicles.

AB  - The results of the literature analysis indicate a wide spectrum of biological activity of 1,2,4-triazole derivatives. Low toxi-city, reactivity, and high biological activity of 1,2,4-triazole derivatives make this class of compounds very attractive. The obtained data determine the relevance of further studies of 1,2,4-triazole derivatives to find new highly effective biologi-cally active substances that can become the basis for new medicines. Our further work aimed to study some toxicity parame-ters of 3-(3-fluorophenyl)-6-(4-methoxyphenyl)-7H-[1,2,4]-triazolo-[3,4-b][1,3,4] thiadiazine when administered subcuta-neously to guinea pigs, which is a necessary condition for further implementation in practice of this compound. In this work,we observed an absence of toxic effects after a single subcutaneous injection to guinea pigs at a dose of 40 mg/kg experimen-tal drug. The results of macro- and microscopic examinations of internal organs 14 days after a single subcutaneous injection of the studied compound at a dose of 20, 40 mg/kg showed the absence of any anatomical and morphological disorders in the tissue structures of guinea pigs. The calculated value indicates a high degree of safety of 3-(3-fluorophenyl)-6-(4-methoxyphenyl)-7H-[1,2,4]-triazolo-[3,4-b][1,3,4] thiadiazine and its prospects for use in veterinary practice as an effective and safe tuberculocidal agent.

AB  - Hearing impairment is a common disease affecting a substantial proportion of the global population. Currently, the most effective clinical treatment for patients with sensorineural deafness is to implant an artificial electronic cochlea. However, the improvements to hearing perception are variable and limited among healthy subjects. Moreover, cochlear implants have disadvantages, such as crosstalk derived from the currents that spread into non-target tissue between the electrodes. Here, in this work, we describe terahertz wave modulation, a new and minimally invasive technology that can enhance hearing perception in animals by reversible modulation of currents in cochlear hair cells. Using single-cell electrophysiology, guinea pig audiometry, and molecular dynamics simulations, we show that THM can reversibly increase mechano-electrical transducer currents (similar to 50% higher) and voltage-gated K+ currents in cochlear hair cells through collective resonance of -C=0 groups. In addition, measurement of auditory brainstem response (ABR) in guinea pigs treated with THM indicated a similar to 10 dB increase in hearing sensitivity. This study thus reports a new method of highly spatially selective hearing enhancement without introducing any exogeneous gene, which has potential applications for treatment of hearing disorders as well as several other areas of neuroscience.

AB  - New neurons are abnormal in the adult hippocampus of Alzheimer's disease (AD) mouse models. The effects of modulating adult neurogenesis on AD pathogenesis differ from study to study. We reported recently that ablation of adult neural stem cells (aNSCs) was associated with improved memory in AD models. Here, we found that long-term potentiation (LTP) was improved in the hippocampus of APP/ PS1 mice after ablation of aNSCs. This effect was confirmed in hAPP-J20 mice, a second AD mouse model. On the other hand, we found that exposure to enriched environment (EE) dramatically increased the number of DCX+ neurons, promoted dendritic growth, and affected the location of newborn neurons in the dentate gyrus of APP/PS1 mice, and EE exposure significantly ameliorated memory deficits in APP/PS1 mice. Together, our data suggest that both inhibiting abnormal adult neurogenesis and enhancing healthy adult neurogenesis could be beneficial for AD, and they are not mutually exclusive.

AB  - Continuous threat from unwanted pests and diseases is a major challenge in crop fields. The implementation of Volatile organic compounds (VOCs) is a potential defense mechanism adopted in sustainable agriculture. VOCs send signals to natural enemies to locate their herbivorous prey (pest). Such beneficial role of natural enemies in plant-pest interaction may be an alternation of chemical pesticides in the cultivated fields. To explore the promising role of VOCs as reinforcement against pests, we propose a Lotka-Volterra type susceptible-infectious model of plant-pest-natural enemies interactions. Throughout the paper, we will explain how to improve plant protection by natural chemical cues and plant fitness. Moreover, we discuss a detailed analysis of complex emerging states to illustrate the underlying mechanism of VOCs-induced plant indirect defense. Analytically, we obtain basic reproduction number to show the stability condition of the endemic and disease-free equilibrium. Furthermore, we show the global stability of endemic equilibrium using high-dimensional Bendixson criterion. We approach bifurcation theory to understand the evolutionary dynamics of the proposed eco-epidemic model. The system experiences transcritical bifurcation which supports the invasibility changes between susceptible and infected plants. Occurrence of Hopf-bifurcation demonstarte the changes of emergent states between stable steady states and cyclic regularities. Numerical simulation depicts the analytical finding for a set of system parameters.

AB  - Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a complex neurodevelopmental condition characterized by a range of symptoms including impaired social interaction and cognitive deficits. Although the exact pathogenesis of ASD is not well established, recent clinical findings suggest a decline in levels of biogenic amine agmatine in autistic patients. The present study was designed to investigate the impact of postnatal propionic acid (PPA) exposure on hippocampal agmatine homeostasis in male rat pups and to explore a new therapeutic intervention for ASD using agmatine as a biological target. PPA is commonly used in experimental models of ASD due to its ability to induce social deficits, cognitive impairments, and stereotyped behaviors, which closely resemble key characteristics of ASD. Male rat pups were administered with PPA via the intrahippocampal route bilaterally (25 mu g/0.25 mu l per side) on PND-21 to simulate the ASD phenotype, and its subsequent effect on the endogenous agmatinergic system. The influence of agmatine treatment and its endogenous modulation on ASD-like phenotypes was also investigated. Behavioral assessments revealed that PPA exposure reduced sociability and social preference, caused learning and memory impairment in the Morris water maze, increased anxiety-like behavior in the elevated plus maze, and reduced exploratory behavior in the hole board test. Neurochemical analyses showed a decrease in agmatine concentration and an increase in its degrading enzyme agmatinase in the hippocampus. PPA treatment altered the content of GABA, glutamate, TNF-alpha, IL-6, BDNF, and also resulted in increased astrogliosis and neurotoxicity within the hippocampus. Chronic agmatine treatment and its endogenous modulation ameliorated the behavioral and biochemical disruptions induced by PPA exposure. This study highlights the critical role of hippocampal agmatinergic pathway in the etiopathogenesis of ASD, positioning agmatine as a promising therapeutic target for its treatment.

AB  - A number of convergent human neuroimaging and animal studies suggest that habenula neurons fire in anticipation of non-rewarding outcomes, and suppress their firing in anticipation of rewarding outcomes. This normative function of the habenula appears disrupted in depression, and may be critical to the anti-depressant effects of ketamine. However, studying habenula functionality in humans using standard 3 T MRI is inherently limited by its small size. We employed ultra-high field (7 T) fMRI to investigate habenular activity in eighteen healthy volunteers during a Monetary Incentive Delay Task, focussing on loss avoidance, monetary loss and neutral events. We assessed neural activation in the field of view (FOV) in addition to ROI-based habenula-specific activity and generalized task-dependent functional connectivity. Whole FOV results indicated substantial neural dif-ferences between monetary loss and neutral outcomes, as well as between loss avoidance and neutral outcomes. Habenula-specific analyses showed bilateral deactivation during loss avoidance, compared to other outcomes. This first investigation into the habenula's role during loss avoidance revealed that the left habenula further differentiated between loss avoidance and monetary loss. Functional connectivity between the right habenula and the ipsilateral hippocampus and subcallosal cingulate (regions implicated in memory and depression pathophysiology) was enhanced when anticipating potential losses compared to anticipating neutral outcomes. Our findings suggest that the human habenula responds most strongly to outcomes of loss avoidance when compared to neutral and monetary losses, suggesting a role for the habenula in both reward and aversive processing. This has critical relevance to understanding the pathophysiology of habenula function in mood and other neuropsychiatric disorders, as well as the mechanism of action of habenula-targeting antidepressants such as ketamine.

AB  - Concentrated pig production is a major source of environmental pollution. Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) show potential for reducing heavy metal pollution. Two zirconium-based octahedral MOFs, UiO-66 and UiO-66-NH2, were prepared by solvothermal method and were characterized by XRD, SEM, FT-IR, and BET. The adsorption capacity, treatability, and reusability of the adsorbents were tested in batch experiments. The optimum adsorbent dosage was 4 g/L, and the maximum removal rates at room temperature of chromium (Cr), manganese (Mn), iron (Fe), nickel (Ni), and Arsenic (As) on UiO-66 were 76.93%, 93.73%, 88.81%, 83.30%, and 86.11%, respectively. In the kinetic experiments, the adsorption process achieved equilibrium within 90 min and generally conformed to the quasi-second kinetics model. The results demonstrated that UiO-66 and UiO-66-NH2 can be used over a wide range of pH for removal of most HMs on a large scale. Meanwhile, the adsorbents maintained excellent adsorption capacity after at least 3 cycles. Overall, UiO-66 and UiO-66-NH2 have a high potential for practical application on the recovery of heavy metals in the complex wastewater from animal farms.

AB  - The present study evaluates the proteome of early antral follicles from Ovis aries. Fifty follicles were collected from ovaries of adult ewes and extracted proteins were trypsin-digested, desalted and analyzed by LC-MS/MS. Genes were screened for potential modulation by miRNAs and protein data, subjected to functional enrichment analysis. Label-free mass spectrometry allowed the identification of 2503 follicle proteins, confirming vimentin, actin, lamin, heat shock proteins and histones as the most abundant ones. In silico analyses indicated that miRNAs modulate the expression of genes coding proteins of the sheep follicles involved in cell cycle, cell differentiation, aging, apoptosis, cell death, adipocyte differentiation, cell division. The most important biological processes associated with the follicle proteins were innate immune response, translation, adaptive immune response and protein folding, while molecular functions linked to the proteome of sheep antral follicles related to metal ion binding, ATP binding, oxygen binding, RNA binding and GTP binding, among others. Upload of 2503 Uniport accession codes through DAVID platform matched 1274 genes, associated with translation, metabolic process, proteolysis involved in cellular protein catabolic process, zona pellucida receptor complex and others. KEEG pathways analysis indicated genes correlated with ovine follicular development, with major pathways listed as carbon metabolism, biosynthesis of amino acids, glutathione metabolism, oxidative phosphorylation, fatty acid degradation and oocyte meiosis. This represents a comprehensive atlas of proteins expressed in sheep early antral follicles and will contribute to future identification of biomarkers for follicular development and oocyte maturation.

AB  - For the first time, we used an in vitro vs. in vivo experimental design to reveal core pathways under nitrogen deficiency (ND) in an evergreen tree crop. These pathways were related to lignin biosynthesis, cell redox homeostasis, the defense response to fungus, the response to Karrikin, amino acid transmembrane transport, the extracellular region, the cellular protein catabolic process, and aspartic-type endopeptidase activity. In addition, the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway and ATP synthase (ATP)-binding cassette transporters were significantly upregulated under nitrogen deficiency in vitro and in vivo. Most of the MAPK downstream genes were related to calcium signaling (818 genes) rather than hormone signaling (157 genes). Moreover, the hormone signaling pathway predominantly contained auxin- and abscisic acid-related genes, indicating the crucial role of these hormones in ND response. Overall, 45 transcription factors were upregulated in both experiments, 5 WRKYs, 3 NACs, 2 MYBs, 2 ERFs, HD-Zip, RLP12, bHLH25, RADIALIS-like, and others, suggesting their ND regulation is independent from the presence of a root system. Gene network reconstruction displayed that these transcription factors participate in response to fungus/chitin, suggesting that nitrogen response and pathogen response have common regulation. The upregulation of lignin biosynthesis genes, cytochrome genes, and strigalactone response genes was much more pronounced under in vitro ND as compared to in vivo ND. Several cell wall-related genes were closely associated with cytochromes, indicating their important role in flavanols biosynthesis in tea plant. These results clarify the signaling mechanisms and regulation of the response to nitrogen deficiency in evergreen tree crops.

AB  - Chlorogenic acid (CGA), as one of the richest polyphenol compounds in nature, has broad applications in many fields due to its various biological properties. However, initial data on the effects of dietary CGA on protein synthesis and related basal metabolic activity has rarely been reported. The current study is aimed at (1) determining whether dietary CGA supplementation improves the growth performance and carcass traits, (2) assessing whether dietary CGA alters the free amino acid profile, and (3) verifying whether dietary CGA promotes muscle protein synthesis in finishing pigs. Thirty-two (Large x White x Landrace) finishing barrows with an average initial body weight of 71.89 +/- 0.92 kg were randomly allotted to 4 groups and fed diets supplemented with 0, 0.02%, 0.04%, and 0.08% CGA, respectively. The results indicated that, compared with the control group, dietary supplementation with 0.04% CGA slightly stimulated the growth performance of pigs, whereas no significant correlation was noted between the dietary CGA levels and animal growth (P > 0.05). Furthermore, the carcass traits of pigs were improved by 0.04% dietary CGA (P < 0.01). In addition, dietary CGA significantly improved the serum free amino acid profiles of pigs (P < 0.01), while 0.04% dietary CGA promoted more amino acids to translocate to skeletal muscles (P < 0.05). The relative mRNA expression levels of SNAT2 in both longissimus dorsi (LD) and biceps femoris (BF) muscles were augmented in the 0.02% and 0.04% groups (P < 0.05), and the LAT1 mRNA expression in the BF muscle was elevated in the 0.02% group (P < 0.05). We also found that dietary CGA supplementation at the levels of 0.04% or 0.08% promoted the expression of p-Akt and activated the mTOR-S6K1-4EBP1 axis in the LD muscle (P < 0.05). Besides, the MAFbx mRNA abundance in the 0.02% and 0.04% groups was significantly lower (P < 0.05). Our results revealed that dietary supplementation with CGA of 0.04% improved the free amino acid profile and enhanced muscle protein biosynthesis in the LD muscle in finishing pigs.

AB  - Meat quality is an important economic trait that influences the development of the pig industry. Skeletal muscle development and glycolytic potential (GP) are two crucial aspects that significantly impact meat quality. It has been reported that abnormal skeletal muscle development and high glycogen content results in low meat quality. However, the genetic mechanisms underlying these factors are still unclear. Compared with intensive pig breeds, Chinese indigenous pig breeds, such as the Jinhua pig, express superior meat quality characteristics. The differences in the meat quality traits between Jinhua and intensive pig breeds make them suitable for uncovering the genetic mechanisms that regulate meat quality traits. In this study, the Jinhua pig breed and five intensive pig breeds, including Duroc, Landrace, Yorkshire, Berkshire, and Pietrain pig breeds, were selected as experimental materials. First, the F-ST and XP-EHH methods were used to screen the selective signatures on the genome in the Jinhua population. Then, combined with RNA-Seq data, the study further confirmed that SOCS3 could be a key candidate gene that influences meat quality by mediating myoblast proliferation and glycometabolism because of the down-regulated expression of SOCS3 in Jinhua pigs compared with Landrace pigs. Finally, through SOCS3 knockout (KO) and overexpression (OE) experiments in mouse C2C12 cells, the results showed that SOCS3 regulated the cell proliferation of myoblasts. Moreover, SOCS3 is involved in regulating glucose uptake by the IRS1/PI3K/AKT signaling pathway. Overall, these findings provide a basis for the genetic improvement of meat quality traits in the pig industry.

AB  - Alternative polyadenylation affects the length and composition of 3'-untranslated region (3'-UTR) and regulates mRNA stability or translational activity to affect important biological processes. However, global 3'-UTR landscape and its relationship with gamete maturation remain less studied. Here, we analysed our previously reported single-cell RNA-seq data of germinal vesicle and metaphase II stage oocytes in pigs to systematically catalogue the 3'-UTR dynamics during oocyte maturation. Two softwares (DaPars and APAtrap) were employed and identified 110 and 228 mRNAs with significantly different 3'-UTRs (adjusted p <= .05), respectively. Gene enrichment analyses found signalling pathways related with biological processes of female gametophyte production, methyltransferase activity and mRNA surveillance (DaPars) and cell cycle process, regulation of ERK1 and ERK2 cascade, regulation of translation, spindle organization, kinetochore, condensed chromosome and progesterone-mediated oocyte maturation (APAtrap), respectively. Moreover, 18 of 110 mRNAs (vertical bar Delta PDUI vertical bar >= 0.25 and vertical bar log(2)PDUI ratio vertical bar >= 0.59) and 15 of 228 mRNAs (Perc. diff. >= 0.5) were with greater difference of 3'-UTR length or abundance, and integrative genomics viewer analysis further identified 4 (Alg10, Hadhb, Hsd17b4 and Sbds) of 18 mRNAs to be with 3'-UTR length differed >= 150 bp and 6 (Gcc1, Hnrnpa2b1, Lsm6, Prpf18, Sfr1 and Ust) of 15 mRNAs to be with 3'-UTR abundance extremely differed. Furthermore, the location, sequences and number of cis-elements were predicted, which were shown to derange cytoplasmic polyadenylation element, poly(A) site and microRNA binding sites within 3'-UTRs of Alg10, Hadhb, Hsd17b4 and Sbds mRNAs. Taken together, global 3'-UTR landscape changes dynamically with oocyte meiotic maturation, potentially involved in regulating oocyte meiotic process in pigs.

AB  - Excessive gaming can impair both mental and physical health, drawing widespread public and clinical attention, especially among young generations. People are now more exposed to gaming-related content on social media than before, and this exposure may have a significant impact on their behavior. However, the neural mechanisms underlying this effect remain unexplored. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), this study aimed to investigate the neural activity induced by gaming-related content on social media among young adults casually playing online games. While being assessed by fMRI, the participants watched gaming-related videos and neutral (nongaming) videos on social media. The gaming-related cues significantly activated several brain areas, including the medial prefrontal cortex, posterior cingulate cortex, hippocampus, thalamus, superior/ middle temporal gyrus, precuneus and occipital regions, compared with the neutral cues. Additionally, the participants' gaming desire levels positively correlated with a gaming-related cue-induced activation in the left orbitofrontal cortex and the right superior temporal gyrus. These findings extend previous studies on gaming cues and provide useful information to elucidate the effects of gaming-related content on social media in young adults. Continued research using real-world gaming cues may help improve our understanding of promoting gaming habits and provide support to individuals vulnerable to gaming addiction.

AB  - Dioxins might be introduced into the food chain through a direct or an indirect pathway. The main source of human exposure to dioxins is food of animal origin, whereas feeds are the main route of exposure of farmed animals to dioxins and polychlorinated biphenyls. The aim of the study was to simulate dioxin passage from feed to tissues on farm animals using transfer models, and, in addition, to assess the risk to consumers of food of animal origin. From over 700 feed samples analyzed over the course of 9 years (2013-2021), those exceeding the maximum permissible levels set down in Commission Regulation No 277/2012/EU were selected. These samples being derived from real cases of dioxin contamination made it possible to present the most realistic picture of the effects these feed materials could have had if they had entered the food chain. Three species of animals were selected (laying hens, dairy cattle and slaughter pigs), for which feed materials with dioxin contents exceeding the maximum permissible level were selected in accordance with the nutritional recommendations. The calcu-lated PCDD/PCDF concentrations in chicken eggs, cow's milk and pork were above the maximum permissible level in most cases.

AB  - The antioxidant properties of crocin are attracting interest, yet the underlying mechanisms by which crocin mitigates oxidative stress-induced intestinal damage have not been determined. This study aimed to elucidate the effects of crocin on oxidative stress, apoptosis, and intestinal epithelial injury in intestinal epithelial cells (IPEC-J2). Using an H2O2-induced oxidative stress model in IPEC-J2 cells, crocin was added to assess its effects. Cell viability and apoptosis were evaluated using methyl thiazolyl tetrazolium assays and flow cytometry. Additionally, oxidative stress markers, such as superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), reactive oxygen species (ROS), and malondialdehyde (MDA), were quantified. We investigated, in which cell oxidation and apoptosis were measured at the gene and protein levels and employed transcriptome analysis to probe the mechanism of action and validate relevant pathways. The results showed that crocin ameliorates H2O2-induced oxidative stress by reducing ROS and MDA levels and by countering the reductions in CAT, total antioxidant capacity, and SOD. Crocin also attenuates the upregulation of key targets in the Nrf2 pathway. Furthermore, it effectively mitigated IPEC-J2 cell apoptosis caused by oxidative stress, as evidenced by changes in cell cycle factor expression, apoptosis rate, mitochondrial membrane potential, and apoptosis pathway activity. In addition, crocin preserves the integrity of the intestinal barrier by protecting tight junction proteins against oxidative stress. Transcriptome sequencing analysis suggested that the mitochondrial pathway may be a crucial mechanism through which crocin exerts its protective effects. In summary, crocin decreases oxidative stress molecule formation, inhibits Nrf2 pathway activity, prevents apoptosis-induced damage, enhances oxidative stress resistance in IPEC-J2 cells, and maintains redox balance in the pig intestine.

   The pig sector represents one of the most economically important farming sectors in the European Union. Farmers and their veterinarians are responsible for ensuring animal health as well as sending healthy animals for slaughter. At slaughter, official veterinarians conduct meat inspections to ensure that only meat fit for human consumption enters the food processing chain. The data collected during meat inspections can provide valuable information about herd health for the farmers, the attending veterinarians and veterinary authorities. The aim of this study was to describe the data and analyse whether these data are suitable to be used as a feedback system for farmers to enable them to improve their herd management. Data used comprised all meat inspection findings in 2016 from 4.6 million pigs originating from 9172 agricultural holdings (farms) and slaughtered in 66 slaughterhouses in Austria. Analysis showed that diseases of the lung (pneumonia, 21.9%) and of the liver (milk spots, 19.9%) were most frequently detected. The agricultural holdings, the slaughterhouses and the time periods (quarter) had an influence on the observed occurrence and composition of the prevalence of post-mortem findings. Furthermore, within the slaughterhouses, the recorded patterns of pathological findings differed, which points towards the need for further harmonisation to provide high-quality feedback to farmers and veterinarians.
   Meat inspection data can provide valuable information about herd health to producers, veterinarians and veterinary authorities and can be used as a feedback system for farmers to improve their herd management. The aim of this study was to analyse the influence of agricultural holdings, slaughterhouses and time periods (quarters) on the occurrence and composition of the prevalence of post-mortem findings of 4 million pigs slaughtered in Austria in 2016, by applying a permutation multivariate analysis of variance. Pneumonia (21.9%) and milk spots (19.9%) were the most frequently recorded conditions. Our analysis indicated a statistically significant influence of all three considered factors (agricultural holdings, slaughterhouses and periods) on the prevalence of post-mortem findings. The observed prevalence could not only be explained by the differences between the farms of origin and slaughterhouses but also by the variability within the slaughterhouses. Much of the explained variance of the prevalence was due to differences between producers (mean R-2 = 0.61), followed by slaughterhouses (mean R-2 = 0.19) and period (mean R-2 = 0.05). To meet the demand for a valid feedback system to farmers and attending veterinarians, a robust and ideally more detailed recording of frequent pathologies, especially those affecting the respiratory tract and the liver, should be developed.

AB  - Humic substances (HSs) can ameliorate soil pollution by mediating electron transfer between microorganisms and contaminants. This capability depends on the redox-active functional structure and electron transfer capacity (ETC) of HS. This study mainly aimed to analyze the effects of different ventilation quantities on the ETC and spectral characteristics of HS (including humic acids (HAs) and fulvic acids (FAs)) during sludge composting. HS was extracted from compost with different ventilation quantities (0.1, 0.2, and 0.3 L kg(-1) dry matter min(-1), denoted as VQ1, VQ2, and VQ3, respectively). The ETC of HS was measured by electrochemical method. Excitation-emission matrix (EEM) spectroscopy, ultraviolet and visible (UV-Vis) spectrophotometry, and Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy were conducted to understand the evolution of HS composition during composting. Results indicated that the ETC of HA and FA increased during composting, and VQ2 had stronger ETC and electron recycling rate than VQ1 and VQ3 at the end of composting. UV-Vis analysis revealed that the humification degree, aromatization degree, and molecular weight of HA and FA increased during composting, while the content of lignin decreased. EEM-PARAFAC results suggested that VQ2 accelerated the degradation of protein-like substances. FT-IR revealed a decrease trend in polysaccharide and aliphatic, and the carboxyl content increased in VQ2 and VQ3 while decreased in VQ1. Correlation analysis was used to study the relationship between HS components and ETC. The results advance our further understanding of the pollution remediation mechanism of HS.

AB  - Schizophrenia is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by a loss of dendritic spines in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC). Multiple subclinical and clinical studies have evidenced the ability of antipsychotics to improve neuroplasticity. In this study, it was evaluated the effect of the atypical antipsychotic aripiprazole (ARI) on the behavioral and mPFC neuronal disturbances of rats with neonatal ventral hippocampus lesion (nVHL), which is a heuristic developmental model relevant to the study of schizophrenia. ARI attenuated open field hyperlocomotion in the rats with nVHL. Also, ARI ameliorated structural neuroplasticity disturbances of the mPFC layer 3 pyramidal cells, but not in the layer 5 neurons. These effects can be associated with the ARI capability of increasing brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) levels. Moreover, in the animals with nVHL, ARI attenuated the immunoreactivity for some oxidative stress-related molecules such as the nitric oxide synthase 2 (NOS-2), 3-nitrotyrosine (3-NT), and cyclooxygenase 2 (COX-2), as well as the reactive astrogliosis in the mPFC. These results contribute to current knowledge about the neurotrophic, anti-inflammatory, and antioxidant properties of antipsychotics which may be contributing to their clinical effects and envision promising therapeutic targets for the treatment of schizophrenia.

AB  - Current models of scene processing in the human brain include three scene-selective areas: the parahippocampal place area (or the temporal place areas), the restrosplenial cortex (or the medial place area), and the transverse occipital sulcus (or the occipital place area). Here, we challenged this model by showing that at least one other scene-selective site can also be detected within the human posterior intraparietal gyrus. Despite the smaller size of this site compared to the other scene-selective areas, the posterior intraparietal gyrus scene-selective (PIGS) site was detected consistently in a large pool of subjects (n = 59; 33 females). The reproducibility of this finding was tested based on multiple criteria, including comparing the results across sessions, utilizing different scanners (3T and 7T) and stimulus sets. Furthermore, we found that this site (but not the other three scene-selective areas) is significantly sensitive to ego-motion in scenes, thus distinguishing the role of PIGS in scene perception relative to other scene-selective areas. These results highlight the importance of including finer scale scene-selective sites in models of scene processing - a crucial step toward a more comprehensive understanding of how scenes are encoded under dynamic conditions.

AB  - Background Heat stress (HS) occurs when body heat accumulation exceeds heat dissipation and is associated with swine seasonal infertility. HS contributes to compromised oocyte integrity and reduced embryo development. Autophagy is a potential mechanism for the oocyte to mitigate the detrimental effects of HS by recycling damaged cellular components. Methods To characterize the effect of HS on autophagy in oocyte maturation, we utilized an in vitro maturation (IVM) system where oocytes underwent thermal neutral (TN) conditions throughout the entire maturation period (TN/TN), HS conditions during the first half of IVM (HS/TN), or HS conditions during the second half of IVM (TN/HS). Results To determine the effect of HS on autophagy induction within the oocyte, we compared the relative abundance and localization of autophagy-related proteins. Heat stress treatment affected the abundance of two well described markers of autophagy induction: autophagy related gene 12 (ATG12) in complex with ATG5 and the cleaved form of microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3 beta (LC3B-II). The HS/TN IVM treatment increased the abundance of the ATG12-ATG5 complex and exacerbated the loss of LC3B-II in oocytes. The B-cell lymphoma 2 like 1 protein (BCL2L1) can inhibit autophagy or apoptosis through its interaction with either beclin1 (BECN1) or BCL2 associated X, apoptosis regulator (BAX), respectively. We detected colocalization of BCL2L1 with BAX but not BCL2L1 with BECN1, suggesting that apoptosis is inhibited under the HS/TN treatment but not autophagy. Interestingly, low doses of the autophagy inducer, rapamycin, increased oocyte maturation. Conclusions Our results here suggest that HS increases autophagy induction in the oocyte during IVM, and that artificial induction of autophagy increases the maturation rate of oocytes during IVM. These data support autophagy as a potential mechanism activated in the oocyte during HS to recycle damaged cellular components and maintain developmental competence.

AB  - Fall armyworm (Spodoptera frugiperda) is a serious pest of various agricultural crops, causing heavy economic losses. Mostly, chemical pesticides are used for its management, but it has developed resistance against pesticides and other commonly used control methods. Studies have shown that the exogenous application of silicon has the potential to make plants more resistant to insect herbivores without causing any negative effects on the efficiency of natural enemies. Therefore, a laboratory experiment was conducted to test the impact of silicon dioxide (SiO2) and potassium silicate (K2SiO3) applied by foliar spray and soil drenching on its accumulation in maize and its impact on demographical traits of S. frugiperda to check its most susceptible age stage. Results of the current study revealed a significant effect of all silicon applications compared to control on survival rate, developmental duration, the reproduction rate of S. frugiperda, and silicon accumulation in maize. Furthermore, results indicated that S. frugiperda fed on the maize plants treated with foliar spray or SiO2 showed a lower intrinsic rate of growth (r), finite rate of growth (lambda), and net reproduction rate (R-0) compared to all other treatments. All the treatments showed a significant effect on the adult pre-oviposition period (APOP), total oviposition period (TPOP), pre-adult survival rate, and oviposition days compared to the control. Age stage-specific life expectancy (e(xj)) and Age stage-specific reproductive values (v(xj)) of S. frugiperda were significantly affected in all silicon treatments. From current results, it is concluded that silicon can be used as an alternate method for the management of this destructive pest.

AB  - Conventional canonical correlation analysis (CCA) measures the association between two datasets and identifies relevant contributors. However, it encounters issues with execution and interpretation when the sample size is smaller than the number of variables or there are more than two datasets. Our motivating example is a stroke-related clinical study on pigs. The data are multimodal and consist of measurements taken at multiple time points and have many more variables than observations. This study aims to uncover important biomarkers and stroke recovery patterns based on physiological changes. To address the issues in the data, we develop two sparse CCA methods for multiple datasets. Various simulated examples are used to illustrate and contrast the performance of the proposed methods with that of the existing methods. In analyzing the pig stroke data, we apply the proposed sparse CCA methods along with dimension reduction techniques, interpret the recovery patterns, and identify influential variables in recovery.

AB  - Simple Summary Collagen is an important component of muscle tissue that maintains muscle structure and also contributes to meat quality. However, the characteristics of intramuscular connective tissue (IMCT) collagen of Wuzhumuqin sheep are unknown. The purpose of this study was to analyze the characteristics of IMCT collagen in Wuzhumuqin sheep at different growth stages and to determine the correlation between them. The results showed that collagen-related genes were highly expressed at 9 and 12 months of age. The amino acid content, solubility, thermal stability, and degree of cross-linking of collagen were altered by collagen type, muscle type, and age. Multiple patterns of correlation between collagen characteristics are essential for the development of IMCT. These findings will contribute to a better understanding of the relationship between the characteristics of collagen, and also provide a theoretical basis for further studies on the impacts of collagen on meat quality. Intramuscular connective tissue (IMCT) collagen is an important factor in meat quality. This study analyzed the characteristics of type I and III collagen in the IMCT of the semitendinosus (SD) and longissimus dorsi (LD) of Wuzhumuqin sheep at different growth stages (6, 9, 12, and 18 months). Utilizing sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), collagen types I and III were successfully isolated and shown to contain an intact triple helix structure. Immunofluorescence revealed that these collagens were located in the endomysium and perimysium. Collagen-related genes were significantly expressed in sheep aged 9 and 12 months. The amino acid content increased with age in type I collagen whereas it decreased in type III collagen. Furthermore, type III collagen contained more hydroxyproline (Hyd) than type I collagen. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) revealed that the thermal stability of collagen increased with age, accompanied by a decrease in solubility. Semitendinosus muscle had more collagen cross-linkages than LD muscle due to the high pyridinoline (Pyr) content in the endomysium. Finally, a correlation analysis highlighted the multiple correlations between characteristics in different types of collagen during sheep growth. In summary, the collagen characteristics in the IMCT of sheep were impacted by collagen type, muscle type, and age. Furthermore, the various correlations between these characteristics may play an important role in the development of IMCT.

AB  - Currently, the mechanism by which light-sensitive albino tea plants respond to light to regulate pigment synthesis has been only partially elucidated. However, few studies have focused on the role of lipid metabolism in the whitening of tea leaves. Therefore, in our study, the leaves of the Baijiguan (BJG) tea tree under shade and light restoration conditions were analyzed by a combination of lipidomics and transcriptomics. The leaf color of BJG was regulated by light intensity and responded to light changes in light by altering the contents and proportions of lipids. According to the correlation analysis, we found three key lipid components that were significantly associated with the chlorophyll SPAD value, namely, MGDG (36:6), DGDG (36:6) and DGDG (34:3). Further weighted gene coexpression network analysis (WGCNA) showed that HY5 TF and GLIP genes may be hub genes involved lipid regulation in albino tea leaves. Our results lay a foundation for further exploration of the color changes in albino tea leaves.

AB  - Major efforts have been made to reduce the use of colistin in livestock since the discovery of the plasmid-borne mobile colistin resistance (mcr) gene in E. coli a decade ago, to curb the burden of its potential transmission to other bacterial species, spread between animals, humans and the environment. This study explored the longitudinal prevalence and characteristics of colistin-resistant and extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing (ESBL) E. coli via in vivo fecal and ex vivo carcass swabs from two batches of conventional indoor and organic outdoor Wallon meat sheep from birth to slaughter in 2020 and 2021. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing via broth microdilution revealed that n = 16/109 (15%) E. coli isolates from conventional meat lamb fecal samples had a reduced colistin sensitivity (MIC = 0.5 mu g/mL) and thereof, n = 9/109 (8%) were multi-drug-resistant E. coli, while no resistant isolates were recovered from their carcasses. Sequencing revealed causative pmrB genes, indicating that the reduced sensitivity to colistin was not plasmid-borne. While the sample size was small (n = 32), no colistin-resistant and ESBL-producing E. coli were isolated from the organic meat sheep and their carcasses, potentially due to the different husbandry conditions. Prudent and judicious antimicrobial use and strict slaughter hygiene remain imperative for effective risk management to protect consumers in a sustainable One Health approach.

AB  - Structural muscle changes, including muscle atrophy and fatty infiltration, follow rotator cuff tendon tear and are associated with a high repair failure rate. Despite extensive research efforts, no pharmacological therapy is available to successfully prevent both muscle atrophy and fatty infiltration after tenotomy of tendomuscular unit without surgical repair. Poly(ADP-ribose) polymerases (PARPs) are identified as a key transcription factors involved in the maintenance of cellular homeostasis. PARP inhibitors have been shown to influence muscle degeneration, including mitochondrial hemostasis, oxidative stress, inflammation and metabolic activity, and reduced degenerative changes in a knockout mouse model. Tenotomized infraspinatus were assessed for muscle degeneration for 16 weeks using a Swiss Alpine sheep model (n = 6). All sheep received daily oral administration of 0.5 mg Talazoparib. Due to animal ethics, the treatment group was compared with three different controls from prior studies of our institution. To mitigate potential batch heterogeneity, PARP-I was evaluated in comparison with three distinct control groups (n = 6 per control group) using the same protocol without treatment. The control sheep were treated with an identical study protocol without Talazoparib treatment. Muscle atrophy and fatty infiltration were evaluated at 0, 6 and 16 weeks post-tenotomy using DIXON-MRI. The controls and PARP-I showed a significant (control p < 0.001, PARP-I p = 0.01) decrease in muscle volume after 6 weeks. However, significantly less (p = 0.01) atrophy was observed in PARP-I after 6 weeks (control 1: 76.6 +/- 8.7%; control 2: 80.3 +/- 9.3%, control 3: 73.8 +/- 6.7% vs. PARP-I: 90.8 +/- 5.1% of the original volume) and 16 weeks (control 1: 75.7 +/- 9.9; control 2: 74.2 +/- 5.6%; control 3: 75.3 +/- 7.4% vs. PARP-I 93.3 +/- 10.6% of the original volume). All experimental groups exhibited a statistically significant (p < 0.001) augmentation in fatty infiltration following a 16-week period when compared to the initial timepoint. However, the PARP-I showed significantly less fatty infiltration (p < 0.003) compared to all controls (control 1: 55.6 +/- 6.7%, control 2: 53.4 +/- 9.4%, control 3: 52.0 +/- 12.8% vs. PARP-I: 33.5 +/- 8.4%). Finally, a significantly (p < 0.04) higher proportion and size of fast myosin heavy chain-II fiber type was observed in the treatment group. This study shows that PARP-inhibition with Talazoparib inhibits the progression of both muscle atrophy and fatty infiltration over 16 weeks in retracted sheep musculotendinous units.

AB  - Simple Summary Fermented Chinese herbs can be used as a natural additive in the diet of weaned pigs, and they can play an important role in regulating microbial flora and intestinal health. This study aimed to investigate fermented Chinese herb supplementation in newly weaned piglets' diets and its effects on intestinal microbial composition and growth performance. Studies have found that dietary supplementation of fermented Chinese herbs can promote intestinal health and improve growth performance of weaned piglets by regulating intestinal flora. To investigate the effects of fermented Chinese herbal medicine on growth performance, diarrhea rate, nutrient digestibility, and intestinal health of weaned piglets, and to provide the theoretical basis for applying fermented Chinese herbal medicines to weaned piglet production, a total of 162 weaned and castrated piglets at 25 days of age (Duroc x Landrace x Yorkshire, half male and half female) with an initial body weight of 7.77 +/- 0.03 kg were randomly divided into the following three groups according to the principle of similar body weight: basal diet (CON) group, basal diet + 3 kg/t fermented Chinese herbal medicine (LFHM) group, and basal diet + 5 g/kg fermented Chinese herbal medicine (HFHM) group. Each group underwent six replicates and there were nine piglets in each replicate. The experiment lasted 24 days, i.e., 3 days for preliminary feeding, and 21 days for the experiment. From Day 1 of the experiment, the piglets were observed and recorded for diarrhea each day. As compared with the CON group, the results indicated: Following the addition of fermented Chinese herbal medicine, the piglets in the LFHM and HFHM groups increased final weight (FW); average daily feed intake (ADFI); average daily gain (ADG) (p < 0.01); apparent digestibility of crude protein (CP) (p < 0.05); as well as chymotrypsin, alpha-amylase, and lipase activities (p < 0.01). In addition, alpha-amylase activity in the LFHM group was higher than that in the HFHM group (p < 0.05); chymotrypsin activity in the LFHM group was lower than that in the HFHM group (p < 0.05); as compared with the CON group, the LFHM and the HFHM increased villus height (VH) and crypt depth (CD) in piglet jejunum; isovaleric acid concentration with the HFHM was higher than those with the CON and the LFHM (p < 0.05), but butyrate concentration with the HFFM was lower than those with the CON and the LFHM (p < 0.05). The high-throughput 16S rRNA sequencing of intestinal microbiota results showed that the LFHM and the HFHM affected the microbial alpha diversity index in weaned piglet colon (p < 0.01). In conclusion, fermented Chinese herbs can improve the growth performance of weaned piglets by promoting the secretion of intestinal digestive enzymes, changing intestinal microbial diversity, regulating the contents of intestinal short chain fatty acids (SCFAs), promoting intestinal health, and improving nutrients digestibility.

AB  - Scarification is the outcome of cutaneous wound healing under normal conditions. Although considerable effort has been expended in this field, scar-less healing has not been achieved satisfactorily. The lack of a good model of scar-free healing has contributed to this undesirable situation. However, the annual regeneration of deer antlers, which starts from regenerative wound healing over the top of the pedicles (permanent bony protuberances), may provide such a model. Therefore, in this study, we investigated the process of pedicle wound healing at the organ, tissue, cell, and molecular levels. Our results convincingly demonstrate that wounds over the pedicle preceded a regenerative healing process including regeneration of skin appendages, such as hair follicles. Compared to the scar healing in rats, regenerative healing of the pedicle wound exhibited a weaker inflammatory response, lack of myofibroblast induction, and higher ratios of Col III/Col I, TGF-beta 3/TGF-beta 1, and MMP/TIMP. Importantly, our periosteal transplantation experiments in vivo revealed that this regenerative healing process was achieved through induction of antler stem cells (ASCs). Further study showed that this effect of ASCs on regenerative healing was not species-specific but more generic and could be applied to other mammalian species, as injection of ASCs stimulated regenerative healing of full-thickness excisional cutaneous wounds in rats. Overall, our findings show that ASCs may have therapeutic potential in enhancing the quality of wound healing and preventing scar formation in clinical settings.

AB  - A novel taxon, Pseudorobillarda camelliae-sinensis (Pseudorobillardaceae) and new host records of pleosporalean taxa viz. Neopyrenochaeta triseptatispora (Neopyrenochaetaceae), Ramusculicola thailandica (Teichosporaceae) and Vaginatispora palmae (Lophiostomataceae) resulted from our investigation of plant-associated microfungi in Alishan and Fenghuang Mountain ranges in Taiwan. These taxa were isolated from dicotyledonous hosts of Bignoniaceae, Caprifoliaceae, Meliaceae and Moraceae. Maximum likelihood and Bayesian inference analyses were performed using combined SSU, LSU, ITS, tef1-alpha and rpb2 sequence data to clarify the phylogenetic affinities of taxa. The newly described taxa of the current study are accompanied by comprehensive descriptions, micrographs and comparisons with similar species. In addition, the importance of exploiting fungi from mountain habitats in Taiwan is discussed.

AB  - Leaf-cutting ants (LCA) try to reduce the risk of contamination in their colonies by avoiding contact with their nest refuse (NR), as it can harbor substances harmful to them and their symbiotic fungi. Here, we tested whether an aqueous extract with 10% (vol/vol) of NR of the leaf-cutting ant Atta opaciceps Borgmeier (Hymenoptera: Formicidae, Attini) causes a deterrent effect. We placed leaves of Hibiscus rosa-sinensis L. (Malvaceae) sprayed with NR extract or distilled water (control) in the foraging areas of 12 colonies - eight colonies of A. opaciceps and four of Atta sexdens (L.) - for 60 min, on three consecutive days. The fresh weight of remaining leaf fragments between treatments was compared using linear-mixed effect models. Leaf consumption was significantly lower in the presence of NR extract for 48 h, indicating that the NR odor impregnated in the leaves may have been the responsible factor for the deterrence. Further studies are needed to establish a deterrent extract with a broad spectrum and lasting effect on plants, and to better understand the mechanisms involved in deterrence.

AB  - Insulin controls both systemic glucose homeostasis and functional brain activity. In type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM2), insulin content and the activity of the insulin signaling system in the brain decreases, causing metabolism disorders, including brain glucose hypometabolism, and cognitive dysfunctions. Brain insulin deficiency can be compensated by intranasal insulin administration (IIA). The effectiveness of IIA in correcting brain functions can be improved by combining it with intranasal administration of substances having neuroprotective properties, e.g., complex glycosphingolipids, gangliosides. This work aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of separate and combined IIA and intranasal ganglioside administration (IGA) in correcting cognitive impairments in Wistar rats with DM2 using the Morris water maze (MWM), as well as the analysis of hippocampal expression of proteins (BDNF, GLUT1, GLUT3, GLUT4, GFAP, PSD95) and activity of protein kinases (Akt, GSK3 beta, ERK1/2) involved in learning and long-term memory formation. Both IIA and IGA improved spatial orientation of DM2 rats in the MWM, with the effects of separate or combined IIA and IGA being similar. Due to combined IIA and IGA, the activity of effector protein kinases Akt and ERK1/2 persisted at the same level as in controls, whereas IIA monotherapy led to a reduced level of their phosphorylation. The combined therapy also increased the level of GSK3 beta phosphorylation at Ser9, which is protective against tauropathy. Thus, combined IIA and IGA improves the functional state of the insulin system's components in the brain of DM2 rats, although not enhancing significantly the effects of IIA on long-term memory.

AB  - Wool quality and yield are two important economic livestock traits. However, there are relatively few molecular studies on lncRNA for improving sheep wool, so these require further exploration. In this study, we examined skin tissue from the upper scapula of Super Merino (SM) and Small-Tailed Han (STH) sheep during the growing period. The apparent difference was verified via histological examination. High-throughput RNA sequencing identified differentially expressed (DE) long non-coding (lncRNAs) and messenger RNAs (mRNAs). The target gene of DE lncRNA and DE genes were enrichment analyzed using Gene Ontology (GO) and the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG). A Reverse Transcription quantitative Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-qPCR) was used to verify randomly selected DE lncRNAs and mRNAs. Finally, the DE, RAC2, WNT11, and FZD2 genes, which were enriched in the Wnt signaling pathway, were detected via immunohistochemistry. The results showed that a total of 20,888 lncRNAs and 31,579 mRNAs were identified in the skin tissues of the two sheep species. Among these, 56 lncRNAs and 616 mRNAs were differentially expressed. Through qRT-PCR, the trends in the randomly selected DE genes' expression were confirmed to be aligned with the RNA-seq results. GO and KEGG enrichment analysis showed that DE lncRNA target genes were enriched in GO terms as represented by epidermal and skin development and keratin filature and in KEGG terms as represented by PI3K-Akt, Ras, MAPK, and Wnt signaling pathways, which were related to hair follicle growth and development. Finally, immunohistochemistry staining results indicated that RAC2, WNT11, and FZD2 were expressed in dermal papilla (DP). The lncRNAs MSTRG.9225.1 and MSTRG.98769.1 may indirectly participate in the regulation of hair follicle growth, development, and fiber traits by regulating their respective target genes, LOC114113396(KRTAP15-1), FGF1, and IGF1. In addition, MSTRG.84658.1 may regulate the Wnt signaling pathway involved in the development of sheep hair follicles by targeting RAC2. This study provides a theoretical reference for improving sheep breeding in the future and lays a foundation for further research on the effects of MSTRG.84658.1 and the target gene RAC2 on dermal papilla cells (DPC).

TI  - Characterization of modeling and experimental data inconsistencies from burst testing for high-burnup commercial fuel rod applications
T2  - JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MATERIALS
LA  - English
AB  - Fuel fragmentation, relocation, and dispersal are some of the largest issues remaining in the nuclear industry before rod-average burnup can be increased beyond 62 GWd/tU. The issue is primarily related to the potential for fuel to be dispersed into the reactor primary system, which may increase public risk. One way to prevent dispersal is to avoid cladding burst. The objective of this work is to support the high burnup safety case by evaluating cladding burst under high-burnup, full-length fuel rods and to identify uncertainties that could improve model predictions. The results of this analysis will evaluate realistic, prototypic loss-of-coolant accident (LOCA) conditions; support future cladding burst test designs; and inform the development of mechanistic material models. Realistic high-burnup operating conditions were implemented in the BISON fuel performance code to simulate steady-state and LOCA transient fuel rod evolution to the point at which cladding burst occurred. Parametric studies are performed to assess code response to changes in rod internal pressures and heating rates. Results were compared with simulated LOCA experiments to identify inconsistencies between commercial fuel rod analysis and experimental validation. The representative full-length fuel rod LOCA simulation results did not agree with cladding burst tests. Cladding burst tests indicated burst occurring well below (100-150 degrees C) those calculated in the full-length fuel rod LOCA analysis. Further investigation indicated that the cladding burst tests do not appear to be representative for full-length fuel rods. The inconsistency investigated in this work showed that the differences between the BISON simulation and the experiment's cladding burst conditions arise from an incomplete characterization of the cladding surface temperature, detailed rodlet characterization, lack of cladding strain measurements, and uncertainty in the cladding creep and failure models.

AB  - The product quality problem of high Al steel is closely related to the agglomeration behavior of inclusions. The present study firstly established the stability diagram of inclusion in the Fe-Al-O-N system, thereby evaluating the formation behavior and control condition of various inclusions can be obtained. Based on that, laboratory-scale experiments with different Al contents were designed to obtain the inclusion evolution process. Furthermore, the calculated agglomeration forces were used to explain the difference of evolution of various inclusions. The cavity bridge force increases with the increase of diameter of inclusions and decrease of distance between inclusions, and the van deer Waals force decreases with the increase of diameter and distance. Due to the cavity bridge force is larger than van deer Waals force, the inclusions firstly approached each other by van deer Waals force and then agglomerated by cavity bridge force. In addition, the cavity bridge force of Al2O3 is larger than that of AlN at the same condition because of the larger contact angle. However, the increase of Al content makes this phenomenon converse. When the Al content is > 3 wt. %, the cavity bridge force of AlN is larger than that of Al2O3 . When the Al content is > 7 wt. %, the cavity bridge force of Al2O3 disappears. The study can provide theoretical support for inclusion control in high Al steel.(c) 2023 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The present study aimed to evaluate the effect of a--tocopherol on viability, lipid peroxidation and the expression of apoptosis, stress and development--related genes in the vitrified sheep secondary follicles. Ovarian secondary follicles (200--300 mu m) were isolated and distributed separately to the vitrification treatment and supplemented with 5 mM, 10 mM, 20 mM and 30 mM of a--tocopherol (while the control fresh group was without vitrification and supplementation of a--tocopherol). After a week, the follicles were thawed and evaluated for follicular viability by trypan blue dye exclusion method, lipid peroxidation and gene expression studies. The results showed that the vitrification with 10 and 20 mM of a--tocopherol positively affected (p <.05) the viability of vitrified follicles in comparison with vitrified ones without a--tocopherol but the higher concentration of a--tocopherol, i.e., 30 mM negatively affected the viability ( p <.05) in comparison with the 10 and 20 mM of a--tocopherol groups. The malondialdehyde (MDA) levels were significantly (p <.05) higher in the vitrified without a--tocopherol group in comparison to the vitrified with 20 mM of a--tocopherol group. The expression of apoptotic--related gene, BCL2L1 was significantly higher in 10 mM a--tocopherol group compared to the control fresh and CASPASE 3, 9 expressions were significantly higher in the vitrified group when compared to the vitrified with 10 mM a--tocopherol group. Expressions of BAX, BAD, BAK, BMP--15 and GDF--9 showed no significant difference among the groups. The mRNA expression of SOD1 was significantly higher in the vitrified without a--tocopherol group when compared to other groups. We conclude that the supplementation of 10 and 20 mM a--tocopherol in vitrification solution was the efficient vitrification procedure for the vitrification of ovine secondary follicles.

AB  - A significant extent of researches in veterinary study have been focused on dental structure; however, there are scanty ones on the orientation and identification of their cusps. Therefore, the present article aimed to spot a light on arrangement pattern of dental cusps in the camel as a folivorous and graminivorous animal. This study was conducted on eight heads of adult, healthy camel of both sexes, collected from slaughter houses. To perform exact orientation of cusps of molar teeth, additional radiological and CT scans were performed on the mandible as a landmark that should facilitate the reading of cusps map. It was evident that, the cusps are arranged in crescentic appearance, seledontal form, with two cusps on each side, paracone and hypocone on the lingual surface and protocone and metacone on the vestibular aspect. Thus, camels cannot wear bite like equines, which would interfere with their constant chewing method. The camels' dental cusps provide some of the finest examples of convergent evolution, which offer insights both into correlates between form and function, and into how the ability of euthomorphic cusps in intrapability and stabilization of food items and its comminution between formidable cusps and occlusal spillway in between. Further studies should be done on the brachydontteeth and tropospheric cusps to fill the functional anatomy gap of teeth, in addition to diversity of cusps form. This study is considered a basic comparative anatomical study for normal healthy dentition and forensic practice, in addition to its importance in detection of local aspects of dental problems in camels.

AB  - Despite two extensive reprogramming events during early embryogenesis and gametogenesis, epigenetic information can be passed to the next generations, which constitutes the transgenerational epigenetic inheritance of phenotypes. Considering its utmost importance, there have been few studies focused on the transgenerational effects of dietary interventions, such as methionine supplementation, in livestock. Using whole-genome bisulfite sequencing, we implemented a single-base resolution differential methylation analysis for the F3 and F4 descendants of control vs. methionine-supplemented F0 twin-pair rams. Based on the results of our previous study on F0, F1, and F2 generations, we compared current results of 2981 and 1726 differentially methylated cytosines (DMCs), as well as 798 and 553 unique differentially methylated genes (DMGs), in F3 and F4, respectively. We identified 41 DMGs that exhibited transgenerational epigenetic inheritance (TEI-DMGs) across four generations and 11 TEI-DMGs across five generations. Finally, we estimated the effect size of F0 diet group on F3 and F4 growth and fertility-related phenotypes, providing evidence for transgenerational effects of diet group accompanying inherited differentially methylated genes. Here, for the first time using gene-level and phenotypic data, we demonstrate that a moderate dietary intervention can exert long-lasting transgenerational effects on offspring phenotypes extending beyond the F2 generation in sheep.

AB  - The aim of this research was to show the effect of the ozonation process on the quality of sea buckthorn (Hippophae rhamnoides L.). The quality of the ozonated berries of sea buckthorn was assessed. Prior to and after the ozone treatment, a number of parameters, including the mechanical properties, moisture content, microbial load, content of bioactive compounds, and composition of volatile compounds, were determined. The influence of the ozonation process on the composition of volatile compounds and mechanical properties was demonstrated. The ozonation had negligible impact on the weight and moisture of the samples immediately following the treatment. Significant differences in water content were recorded after 7 days of storage. It was shown that the highest dose of ozone (concentration and process time) amounting to 100 ppm for 30 min significantly reduced the water loss. The microbiological analyses showed the effect of ozone on the total count of aerobic bacteria, yeast, and mold. The applied process conditions resulted in the reduction of the number of aerobic bacteria colonies by 3 log cfu g(-1) compared to the control (non-ozonated) sample, whereas the number of yeast and mold colonies decreased by 1 log cfu g(-1) after the application of 100 ppm ozone gas for 30 min. As a consequence, ozone treatment enhanced the plant quality and extended plant's storage life.

AB  - Variation in flower color due to transgenerational plasticity could stem directly from abiotic or biotic environmental conditions. Finding a link between biotic ecological interactions across generations and plasticity in flower color would indicate that transgenerational effects of ecological interactions, such as herbivory, might be involved in flower color evolution. We conducted controlled experiments across four generations of wild radish (Raphanus sativus, Brassicaceae) plants to explore whether flower color is influenced by herbivory, and to determine whether flower color is associated with transgenerational chromatin modifications. We found transgenerational effects of herbivory on flower color, partly related to chromatin modifications. Given the presence of herbivory in plant populations worldwide, our results are of broad significance and contribute to our understanding of flower color evolution.

AB  - This study investigated the effect of mixing volatile organic compounds (VOC) emitted by host and non-host plants on the orientation of key pests of Brassicaceae. The study aimed to understand how these mixed VOCs influence pest behaviour, which could help in tailoring pest management strategies. The orientations of flea beetles, Phyllotreta spp., and the diamondback moth (DBM), Plutella xylostella, towards cabbage VOCs mixed with faba bean VOCs were assessed using Y-tube olfactometry. The pests' preferences were measured to determine if the presence of faba bean alongside cabbage altered their olfactory orientation compared to cabbage alone. Flea beetles showed a preference for cabbage VOCs alone over the cabbage-faba bean VOC mix. For DBM, no significant preference was observed between cabbage alone and the cabbage-faba bean mix. Previous findings indicated that faba bean attracts DBM, and in this study the mixture of cabbage and faba bean appeared to be more attractive than cabbage alone. The results indicate that faba bean VOCs can deter flea beetles from cabbage, potentially offering a pest management strategy. However, the effect on DBM was inconclusive, with no clear preference observed. This suggests that while faba bean VOCs may influence pest orientation, their effectiveness varies among different pest species. Additionally, herbivore damage to cabbage leaves did not appear to influence the odour-guided orientation of either pest, irrespective of the presence or absence of faba bean.

AB  - The study combined multiple models to provide a deeper understanding to soil heavy metal contamination and source information, which are essential for controlling pollution and reducing human health risks. In this study, the agricultural soils were collected from the Qingyuan City of China as an example. The multiple models (APCS/MLR, PMF, and GDM) were used to identify and quantitatively apportion the main sources of heavy metal pollution in the area. The results showed that Cu (56.4 %), Ni (70.9 %), B (44.5 %), and Cr (72.8 %) were associated with natural sources, such as soil parent material and soil-forming processes. However, Pb (41.2 %), Zn (61.8 %), Hg (67.0 %), and Cd (69.6 %) were associated with agricultural activities, atmospheric deposition, vehicle exhaust emissions, and vehicle tires, while Mo, Se, and Mn were possibly derived from natural sources, including rock weathering and soil parent materials. Additionally, the network of environmental analysis revealed that soil microbes are far more sensitive to soil heavy metal pollution than herbivores, vegetation, and carnivores. This study can serve as a guideline for reducing the ecological and health risks associated with heavy metals in soil by controlling their preferential sources. Environmental implication Combining multiple models is more effective approach to wide understanding of heavy metal contamination and source information, which is essential for controlling pollution and reducing human health risks. Based on multiple models (APCS/MLR, PMF, and GDM) and network environ analysis, a comprehensive method for apportioning soil heavy metal sources and assessing ecological risk had been provided. Further, the present study can be a guideline for reducing ecological and health risks by heavy metals in soil by controlling preferential sources.

AB  - The present work discusses the development of novel composite sacrificial anodes based on blast furnace pig iron extracted from abundantly available high P (0.9 wt%) scrap with minor Zn addition (1, 2, 3, 5, and 10 wt% Zn). The incorporation of Zn beyond 1 wt% to the pig iron decreases the working potentials to much negative values below-0.811 V vs. saturated calomel electrode (SCE) in 3.5 wt% NaCl and artificial seawater solution. All these composite sacrificial anodes satisfy the protection criterion set by NACE (-0.778 V vs. SCE). The highest negative potential of-0.920 V vs. SCE has been obtained with the 0.9P-5Zn anode, which is close to the working potential of commercially available pure Zn anodes (the open-circuit potential of these anodes is about-1.10 V vs. SCE). The enhanced sacrificial nature of the composite anodes is associated with the formation of Fe3Zn10 intermetallic phase in the iron matrix after sintering. This results in the formation of micro-galvanic cells leading to the partial dissolution of Zn from the Fe3Zn10 intermetallic phase, which shifts the potential towards active values. Successful development would enable us to commercialize these composite sacrificial anodes using proper waste management of the high P pig iron and provides a sustainable solution to corrosion protection. This cost-effective approach is one of its kind where iron would protect iron in undergound and underwater applications.

AB  - Iron is a common and essential element for maintaining life in bacteria, plants and animals and is found in soil, fresh waters and marine waters; however, over exposure is toxic to organisms. Iron is used in electron transport complexes within mitochondria as well as a co-factor in many essential proteins. It is also established that iron accumulation in the central nervous system in mammals is associated with various neurological disorders. Ample studies have investigated the long-term effects of iron overload in the nervous system. However, its acute effects in nervous tissue and additional organ systems warrant further studies. This study investigates the effects of iron overload on development, behavior, survival, cardiac function, and glutamatergic synaptic transmission in the Drosophila melanogaster. Additionally, physiological responses in crayfish were examined following Fe3+ exposure. Fe3+ reduced neuronal excitability in proprioceptive neurons in a crayfish model. Thus, Fe3+ may block stretch activated channels (SACs) as well as voltage-gated Na+ channels. Exposure also rapidly reduces synaptic transmission but does not block ionotropic glutamatergic receptors, suggesting a blockage of pre-synaptic voltage-gated Ca2+ channels in both crustacean and Drosophila models. The effects are partly reversible with acute exposure, indicating the cells are not rapidly damaged. This study is relevant in demonstrating the effects of Fe3+ on various physiological functions in different organisms in order to further understand the acute and long-term consequences of overload.

AB  - Imagining future scenarios involves recombining different elements of past experiences into a coherent event, a process broadly supported by the brain's default network. Prior work suggests that distinct brain regions may contribute to the inclusion of different simulation features. Here we examine how activity in these brain regions relates to the vividness of future simulations. Thirty-four healthy young adults imagined future events with familiar people and locations in a two-part study involving a repetition suppression paradigm. First, participants imagined events while their eyes were tracked during a behavioral session. Immediately after, participants imagined events during MRI scanning. The events to be imagined were manipulated such that some were identical to those imagined in the behavioral session while others involved new locations, new people, or both. In this way, we could examine how self-report ratings and eye movements predict brain activity during simulation along with specific simulation features. Vividness ratings were negatively correlated with eye movements, in contrast to an often-observed positive relationship with past recollection. Moreover, fewer eye movements predicted greater involvement of the hippocampus during simulation, an effect specific to location features. Our findings suggest that eye movements may facilitate scene construction for future thinking, lending support to frameworks that spatial information forms the foundation of episodic simulation.

AB  - The objective of this study was to investigate the antagonistic effects of selenium (Se) on lead (Pb)-induced oxidative stress and apoptosis of sheep Leydig cells and its underlying mechanism. Leydig cells collected from 8-month-old sheep were treated with Pb (40 mmol/L) and/or Se (2 mmol/L), respectively. CCK-8 assay was used to detect cell proliferation and apoptosis after cultured for 48 h. The abundances of pro-apoptosis (BAX, CASPASE 3 and CASPASE 8) and NRF2-related (NRF2, HO-1, NQO1 and gamma-GCS) genes were detected by real-time PCR and western blot analysis, respectively.& nbsp;The results showed that the highest cell viability was observed in the Se group. Compared with the control group, Pb treatment led to the higher ROS level and greater abundances of BAX, CASPASE 3 and CASPASE 8 mRNA transcripts. Treatment with Pb + Se resulted in an increased (P < 0.05) abundances of NRF2, HO-1, NQO1 and gamma-GCS mRNA transcripts and proteins. Compared with the Pb group, the Se + Pb treatment dramatically decreased (P < 0.05) the ROS level and relative abundances of pro-apoptosis genes. The greater (P < 0.05) abundances of pro-apoptosis and NRF2-related mRNA transcripts and proteins were also obtained in the Se + Pb group. The abundances of BAX, CASPASE 3 and CASPASE 8 genes in the SeML385 group were greater (P < 0.05) than in the Se group. Compared with the corresponding groups without ML385, treatment with ML385 decreased (P < 0.05) cell viability and the relative abundances of pro-apoptosis and NRF2-related genes.& nbsp;These results indicate that Pb-induced oxidative stress can inhibit the viability of Leydig cells by modulating pro-apoptosis gene expression. NRF2 pathway could be involved in the antagonistic effect of Se on Pb-induced apoptosis of Leydig cells in sheep. This study is expected to provide some experimental evidences for Se treatment of Pb-induced reproductive disorders. (C)& nbsp;2022 Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Egg parasitoids are important natural enemies of several insect pests. The ability to kill the pest before it can inflict damage to the plant makes egg parasitoids ideal candidates for biological control. Several studies have shown that egg parasitoids exploit oviposition-induced plant volatiles (OIPVs) to locate host eggs laid on plant organs. Yet such studies have often overlooked that, in nature, plants frequently suffer concurrent attack by insect herbivores and phytopathogens. These dual attacks can modify the emission of induced plant volatiles, which may potentially interfere with the host location abilities of egg parasitoids. We investigated this research question using the following study organisms: the broad bean Vicia faba, the plant pathogen Stemphylium sp., the southern green stink bug Nezara viridula and its associated egg parasitoid Trissolcus basalis. We showed that T. basalis is able to exploit OPIVs in order to locate N. viridula egg masses even when V. faba plants were previously infected by Stemphylium sp. Chemical analyses indicate that the egg parasitoid ability to exploit OIPVs persists despite significant alterations of the volatile blends emitted by plants suffering multiple biotic stresses. This study highlights the importance of incorporating the complexity of multiple biotic stresses when studying parasitoid foraging behavior, in order to comprehend how to enhance the effectiveness of natural enemies in crop protection.

AB  - Background: Seizure frequency and cognitive function are common parameters in assessing epilepsy surgery outcomes. However, psychobehavioral outcomes, such as symptoms of depression and quality of life (QOL), have not found equal attention yet. Objective: To assess the effect of seizure frequency, the extent of resection, and cognitive function on the psychobehavioral outcome of patients after temporal lobe surgery for pharmacoresistant epilepsy. Methods: We retrospectively reviewed all consecutive patients who underwent surgery for intractable temporal lobe epilepsy between 09/2015 and 07/2019. We examined seizure outcome, surgical plan, resection volume, cognitive functions, and psychobehavioral outcome. Results: This study included 77 patients (31 males, 46 females) who underwent temporal lobe surgery. One year after surgery, 53 patients (68.8 %) were completely seizure-free (Engel IA) and 92.2 % of patients showed a worthwhile improvement in seizure frequency (Engel I-III). Resection volume was significantly negatively correlated with QOL (r =- 0.284, p = 0.041). However, after controlling for the effect of seizure outcome, no significant correlation remained. Patients with a worthwhile improvement in seizure frequency showed significantly fewer symptoms of depression (p = 0.024) and a significantly higher QOL (p = 0.012) one year after surgery. The differences in symptoms of depression (p = 0.044) and QOL (p = 0.030) between patients with and without improvements in seizure frequency remained significant after controlling for the effect of resection volume. After procedures sparing the amygdala and hippocampus (neocortical resection), patients presented significantly fewer symptoms of depression (p = 0.044) and significantly better QOL (p p = 0.008) than patients after procedures involving mesial-temporal structures, independent of the resection volume, and after controlling for the side of the procedure (dominant vs. non-dominant). After also controlling for seizure outcome, the difference remained for QOL (p = 0.014) but not for symptoms of depression. Conclusions: A patient's emotional well-being one year after surgery for pharmacoresistant temporal lobe epilepsy strongly depends on their seizure outcome. As an individual factor, the extent of neocortical resection negatively affects postsurgical emotional well-being, but a favorable seizure outcome outweighs this effect, independent of the resection volume. A favorable seizure outcome even outweighs the negative effects of procedures involving mesial-temporal structures on symptoms of depression.

AB  - The basolateral amygdala (BLA) mediates the effects of stress and fear on rapid eye movement sleep (REM) and on REM-related theta (theta) oscillatory activity in the electroencephalograph (EEG), which is implicated in fear memory consolidation. We used optogenetics to assess the potential role of BLA glutamate neurons (BLA(Glu)) in regulating behavioral, stress and sleep indices of fear memory, and their relationship to altered theta. An excitatory optogenetic construct targeting glutamatergic cells (AAV-CaMKII alpha-hChR2-eYFP) was injected into the BLA of mice. Telemetry was used for real-time monitoring of EEG, activity, and body temperature to determine sleep states and stress-induced hyperthermia (SIH). For 3 h following shock training (ST: 20 footshocks, 0.5 mA, 0.5 s, 1 min interval), BLA was optogenetically stimulated only during REM (REM + L) or NREM (NREM + L). Mice were then re-exposed to the fear context at 24 h, 48 h, and 1 week after ST and assessed for behavior, SIH, sleep and theta activity. Control mice were infected with a construct without ChR2 (eYFP) and studied under the same conditions. REM + L significantly reduced freezing and facilitated immediate recovery of REM tested at 24 h and 48 h post-ST during contextual re-exposures, whereas NREM + L had no significant effect. REM + L significantly reduced post-ST REM-theta, but attenuated REM-theta reductions at 24 h compared to those found in NREM + L and control mice. Fear-conditioned SIH persisted regardless of treatment. The results demonstrate that BLA(Glu) activity during post-ST REM mediates the integration of behavioral and sleep indices of fear memory by processes that are associated with theta oscillations within the amygdalo-hippocampal pathway. They also demonstrate that fear memories can remain stressful (as indicated by SIH) even when fear conditioned behavior (freezing) and changes in sleep are attenuated.

AB  - N-(naphthalen-1-yl) phenazine-1-carboxamide (NNPCN) is a novel phenazine derivative that can inhibit Rhizoctonia solani. However, the molecular target of NNPCN is unclear. We constructed a fluorescent marker and a polyclonal antibody for NNPCN and used fluorescent labeling, immune fluorescence, and an immune colloidal gold technique to conduct subcellular localization of the target of NNPCN on R. solani. The results showed that NNPCN could be synthesized from N-(6-aminonaphthalen-1-yl) phenazine-1-carboxamide (NNPCN-NH2) and N-(6-(3-(3 ',6'-Dihydroxy-3-oxo-3 h-spiro [Isobenzofuran-1,9 '-Xanthen]-5-yl) thioureido) naphthalen-1-yl) phenazine-1-carboxamide (NNPPCN-NF), with respective molecular formulas and molecular weights of C23H16N4O, 365, and C44H27N5O6S, 753. The best solvent for NNPPCN-NF was acetone. The maximum excitation wavelength was 457.8 nm, and the emission wavelength was 557.8 nm. NNPCN-NF had an inhibitory effect on rice sheath blight; its median effect concentration (EC50) value of 15.71 mu g/mL was similar to that of the control agent. NNPCN-NF demonstrated specific binding within cells. Fluorescence labeling showed that NNPPCN-NF coincided with the fluorescence images from Mitro tracker red CmxRos; the Pearson's correlation coefficient (PCC) was 0.89, indicating that the compound acted on the mitochondria. A highly valent NNPCN polyclonal antibody was successfully prepared by immunizing rabbits. Immunofluorescence localization showed that Alexa fluor 488 tagged-goat anti-rabbit IgG coincided with the Mito tracker red CMXRos fluorescence images, and the PCC was 0.79, indicating that the target was the mitochondrion. Immunocolloidal gold co-localization showed that NNPCN-NF also acted on the cell wall. The results indicate that the targets of NNPCN in R. solani are the mitochondria and cell walls.

AB  - Simple Summary The present study was constructed to determine the effects of short-term intravenous sodium butyrate (SB) administration on metabolism through transcriptomic responses in muscle and adipose tissue of pigs. We found that systemic butyrate displayed a discriminative metabolic regulation in muscle and adipose tissue. Intravenous SB infusion decreased amino acid metabolism pathways both in muscle and adipose tissues. Intravenous SB infusion increased glucose catabolism in muscle tissue and decreased glucose utilization in adipose tissue. Moreover, intravenous SB infusion decreased lipolysis in muscle tissue but increased lipolysis in adipose tissue. These findings support the direct role of the SCFA butyrate in the regulation of the metabolism. Butyrate has a central function in the regulation of energy metabolism as a metabolite of bacterial fermentation. This study evaluated the effects of intravenous sodium butyrate (SB) administration on the transcriptome of muscle and adipose tissue of pigs. Twelve crossbred barrows (Duroc x Landrace x Large White) were fitted with a medical polyethylene cannula via the internal jugular vein and were daily infused with 10 mL SB (200 mmol/L) or the same volume of physiological saline. Muscle transcriptome showed 11 DEGs related to carbohydrate metabolism, 28 DEGs related to lipid metabolism, and 10 DEGs related to amino acid metabolism. Among these, carbohydrate catabolic process-related genes (PPP1R3B, PRPS2, ALDOC), fatty acid synthase (FASN), and lipolysis-related genes (PLIN1) were upregulated, while the carbohydrate biosynthetic process-related genes (PCK1) and most amino acid metabolism-related genes were downregulated. Adipose transcriptome showed 12 DEGs related to carbohydrate metabolism, 27 DEGs related to lipid metabolism, and 10 DEGs related to amino acid metabolism. Among these, carbohydrate metabolism-related genes (IGF1, LEP, SLC2A4) and lipolysis-related genes (LPL) were upregulated, while lipolysis-related genes (ANGPTL4) and most amino acid metabolism-related genes were downregulated. The results suggest that short-term intravenous SB infusion could modulate the muscle and adipose tissue metabolism at the transcriptional level by decreasing amino acid metabolism pathways. Additionally, intravenous SB increased the glucose catabolism in muscle tissue and decreased the glucose utilization in adipose tissue. Intravenous SB increased the fatty acid synthesis, decreased the lipolysis in muscle tissue, and increased the lipolysis in adipose tissue. This suggests that systemic butyrate may display discriminative metabolic regulation in different tissues of barrows.

AB  - Wood degradation by termites is a major concern for researchers, builders of timber-frame houses and stored wood products. This study aimed to determine the wood-degrading Isopterofauna in the cities of Yaound & eacute; and Douala, Cameroon. Woods deposits and joineries workshops in the two cities were investigated monthly over 12 months, and termites were collected from wood species identified by their vernacular names. A total of 44 samples of wood-attacking termites were collected, grouped into two families (Rhinotermitidae, Termitidae), six subfamilies (Rhinotermitinae, Apicotermitinae, Coptotermitinae, Macrotermitinae, Nasutermitinae and Termitinae) and nine species. The species Nasutitermes arborum (14 samples) and Schedorhinotermes putorius (12 samples) were the most common in the city of Yaound & eacute;. Only three species were found in Douala, mainly Coptotermes sp. (three samples). Of the 21 wood species examined in the two cities, Entandrophragma cylindricum hosted the highest termite species richness (six species). These findings are a milestone in the study of termites on lumber in storage and could be used by researchers and agents in the timber industry to make decisions regarding the application of pesticides on wood.

AB  - This study aimed to compare the effects of hydrolyzed copra meal (HCM) inclusion at 1% on its in vitro digestibility and the microbiota and cecum fermentation using the gut microbiota of weaned swine, targeting microbial community and short-chain fatty acids (SCF). For this reason, three treatments were considered: control (no copra meal), 1% non-hydrolyzed copra meal (CM), and 1% HCM. Non-defatted copra meal was hydrolyzed and analyzed (reducing sugars and total carbohydrates) in our laboratory. For digestion, microbiota identification, and fermentation assays, fresh fecal samples from two weaned pigs (1 month old) were used. Three replicates of each treatment were employed. HCM was more digestible, with approximately 0.68 g of hydrolysate recovered after simulated digestion compared to 0.82 g of hydrolysate recovered from CM. This was shown by Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) images. Also, the three swine shared the majority of microbial species identified at the phylum and family levels. There were no differences (p > 0.05) between treatments in the microbial community and SCFA during fermentation. However, higher Chao-1 and Shannon indexes were observed in CM and HCM treatments. HCM was also found to be capable of preserving Actinobacterota and Proteobacteria at the phylum level, while at the family level, both treatments may help Lactobacillaceae, Peptostreptococcaceae, Lachnospiraceae, and Ruminococcaceae survive in the long term. Also, there was a potential trend of increasing acetic acid and butyric acid in the CM and HCM treatments. While HCM shows promise in potentially modulating the gut microbiota of weaned swine, additional research is required to investigate the effects of higher doses of HCM on swine performance parameters.

AB  - Heat stroke is a severe systemic inflammatory response disease caused by high fever, mainly with nervous system damage. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are currently believed to have anti-inflammation and immunomodulatory effects. Therefore, we aimed to explore the protective effect and mechanism of MSCs on heat stroke induced excessive inflammation and neurological dysfunction. We established a heat stroke model in rats under conditions of continuous high temperature and high humidity. After modeling, rats were randomly divided into heat stroke model group, MSCs treatment group and normal temperature control group without any treatment. We performed survival analysis, neurological deficit score, histological staining of hippocampus and cerebellum, immunofluorescence staining of microglia, detection of inflammatory and chemokine levels in the hippocampus and cerebellum in each group. We found that MSCs treatment not only significantly reduced early (day 3) and late (day 28) mortality, but also prominently reduced nerve injury in heat stroke rats, and improved pathology and neuronal cell damage in the hippocampus and cerebellum. In addition, MSCs treatment can significantly inhibit the over-activation of hippocampal microglia in heat stroke rats and the levels of pro inflammatory factors and chemokines in the hippocampus. Early treatment of MSCs can greatly promote the activation of cerebellar microglia in heat stroke rats. Meanwhile, MSCs treatment has an inhibitory effect on the level of chemokine in the cerebellum of rats in the early stage of heat stroke. In conclusion, the application of MSCs in the treatment of heat stroke in rats can significantly reduce mortality and neurological deficits and improve hippocampal damage, possibly by inhibiting the excessive activation of hippocampal microglia in heat stroke rats.

AB  - Simple Summary The consumption of pork meat is responsible for a significant number of outbreaks of salmonellosis in people. Surveillance in pig herds is constrained by the cost-effectiveness and efficiency of sampling methods. The last decade has seen significant advances in the routine use of pool samples, including oral fluids (OFs). This study aimed to investigate the OF collected passively via chewed sampling ropes as a potential sample type for assessing anti-Salmonella antibodies in two Salmonella-vaccinated (V) and two non-vaccinated (NV) farrow-to-finish pig farms, comparing the results with the Salmonella shedding of tested animals. Sows in the V farms were vaccinated prior to farrowing. Pooled faecal and OF samples were collected from sows and their offspring. Salmonella was isolated with direct bacteriological methods. A commercial ELISA assay was adapted to detect IgG and IgA antibodies in OF. Overall, a higher Salmonella prevalence was observed in the NV farm and in the offspring (76.3%) compared to sows (36.4%). The protocol used to test anti-Salmonella IgA in pig OF samples was found to lack sensitivity and specificity. At herd level, IgG is the most reliable isotype for monitoring Salmonella specific antibody via OF. Oral fluid (OF) can be a simple, cheap and non-invasive alternative to serum or meat juice for the diagnosis and surveillance of important pathogens in pigs. This study was conducted on four Salmonella Typhimurium-positive farrow-to-finish pig farms: two Salmonella-vaccinated (V) and two non-vaccinated (NV). Gilts and sows in the V farms were vaccinated with a live, attenuated vaccine prior to farrowing. Pooled faecal and OF samples were collected from the sows and their offspring. Salmonella was isolated according to ISO6579-1:2017. In parallel, IgG and IgA levels were assessed in OF samples using a commercial ELISA assay. Salmonella was detected in 90.9% of the pooled faecal samples from the NV farms and in 35.1% of the pooled faecal samples from the V farms. Overall, a higher prevalence was observed in the pooled faecal samples from the offspring (76.3%) compared to the sows (36.4%). IgG antibodies measured in V farms are likely to be related to vaccination, as well as exposure to Salmonella field strains. The detection of IgA antibodies in OF was unreliable with the method used. The results of this study show that IgG is the most reliable isotype for monitoring Salmonella-specific antibody immunity in vaccinated/infected animals via OF.

AB  - Hair follicles regenerate spontaneously through a cycle of anagen, catagen, and telogen, and this cycle is driven by hair follicle stem cells (HFSCs). Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) have previously been implicated in hair follicle cycling processes. According to the previous lncRNA sequencing results of cashmere goats, an annotated lncRNA XR_310056.1, referred to as lnc056, was found to be differentially expressed during the hair follicle cycle. Here, the purpose of this study was to determine whether lnc056 affects the proliferation of HFSCs by regulating thyroid hormone receptor interactor 6 (TRIP6) expression in combination with the transcription factor HNRNPUL1. The expression of lnc056 in HFSCs was detected by RT-qPCR. HFSCs were then treated with lnc056 and TRIP6 overexpressing adenovirus, si-HNRNPUL1, and si-TRIP6 to detect cell viability and proliferation. In addition, we investigated the binding between lnc056 and HNRNPUL1 or HNRNPUL1 and TRIP6. Finally, the biological function of lnc056 through the HNRNPUL1/TRIP6 axis was verified by target gene recovery experiments. Lnc056 was expressed in the nuclei of HFSCs, and its overexpression promoted the proliferation of cells. Moreover, lnc056 was found to bind to the transcription factor HNRNPUL1 and promoted TRIP6 expression. Furthermore, recovery assays demonstrated that lnc056 promoted the proliferation of HFSCs via the HNRNPUL1/TRIP6 axis. In summary, the results of this study suggested that lnc056 up-regulated the expression of TRIP6 by binding to the transcription factor HNRNPUL1, thereby accelerating the proliferation of HFSCs. This study enriches the molecular mechanism of lncRNA in the hair follicle cycle and provides a potential therapeutic target for hair loss.

AB  - Despite multiple ecological and evolutionary hypotheses that predict patterns of phenotypic relationships between plant growth, reproduction and constitutive and/or induced resistance to herbivores, these hypotheses do not make any predictions about the underlying molecular genetic mechanisms that mediate these relationships. We investigated how divergent plant life-history strategies in the yellow monkeyflower and a life-history altering locus, DIV1, influence plasticity of phytochemical herbivory resistance traits in response to attack by two herbivore species with different diet breadth. Life-history strategy (annual vs. perennial) and the DIV1 locus significantly influenced levels of constitutive herbivory resistance, as well as resistance induction following both generalist and specialist herbivory. Perennial plants had higher total levels of univariate constitutive and induced defence than annuals, regardless of herbivore type. Annuals induced less in response to generalist herbivory than did perennials, while induction response was equivalent across the ecotypes for specialist herbivory. The effects of the DIV1 locus on levels of constitutive and induced defence were dependent on genetic background, the annual versus perennial haplotype of DIV1 and herbivore identity. The patterns of univariate induction due to DIV1 were non-additive and did not always match expectations based on patterns of divergence for annual/perennial parents. For example, perennial plants had higher levels of constitutive and induced defence than did annuals, but when the annual DIV1 was present in the perennial genetic background induction response to herbivory was higher than for the perennial parent lines. Patterns for multivariate defence arsenals generally echoed those of univariate, with annual and perennial monkeyflowers and those with alternative versions of DIV1 differing significantly in constitutive and induced resistance. Like univariate resistance, induced multivariate defence arsenals were affected by herbivore identity. Our results highlight the complexity of the genetic mechanisms underlying plastic response to herbivory. While a genetic locus underlying substantial phenotypic variation in life-history strategy and constitutive defence also influences defence plasticity, the induction response also depends on genetic background. This result demonstrates the potential for some degree of evolutionary independence between constitutive and induced defence, or induced defence and life-history strategy, in monkeyflowers.Read the free Plain Language Summary for this article on the Journal blog.

AB  - Based on the results of previously performed clinical studies, cathelicidin-1 has been proposed as a potential biomarker for the early diagnosis of mastitis in ewes. It has been hypothesized that the detection of unique peptides (defined as a peptide, irrespective of its length, that exists in only one protein of a proteome of interest) and core unique peptides (CUPs) (representing the shortest peptide that is unique) of cathelicidin-1 may potentially improve its identification and consequently the diagnosis of sheep mastitis. Peptides of sizes larger than those of the size of CUPs, which include consecutive or over-lapping CUPs, have been defined as 'composite core unique peptides' (CCUPs). The primary objective of the present study was the investigation of the sequence of cathelicidin-1 detected in ewes' milk in order to identify its unique peptides and core unique peptides, which would reveal potential targets for accurate detection of the protein. An additional objective was the detection of unique sequences among the tryptic digest peptides of cathelicidin-1, which would improve accuracy of identification of the protein when performing targeted MS-based proteomics. The potential uniqueness of each peptide of cathelicidin-1 was investigated using a bioinformatics tool built on a big data algorithm. A set of CUPs was created and CCUPs were also searched. Further, the unique sequences in the tryptic digest peptides of cathelicidin-1 were also detected. Finally, the 3D structure of the protein was analyzed from predicted models of proteins. In total, 59 CUPs and four CCUPs were detected in cathelicidin-1 of sheep origin. Among tryptic digest peptides, there were six peptides that were unique in that protein. After 3D structure analysis of the protein, 35 CUPs were found on the core of cathelicidin-1 of sheep origin and among them, 29 were located on amino acids in regions of the protein with 'very high' or 'confident' estimates of confidence of the structure. Ultimately, the following six CUPs: QLNEQ, NEQS, EQSSE, QSSEP, EDPD, DPDS, are proposed as potential antigenic targets for cathelicidin-1 of sheep. Moreover, another six unique peptides were detected in tryptic digests and offer novel mass tags to facilitate the detection of cathelicidin-1 during MS-based diagnostics.

AB  - Endometrial receptivity is one of the main factors underlying a successful pregnancy, with reports substantiating the fact that suboptimal endometrial receptivity accounts for two-thirds of early implantation event failures. The association between circRNAs and endometrial receptivity in the goat remains unclear. This study aims to identify potential circRNAs and regulatory mechanisms related to goat endometrial receptivity. Therefore, the endometrial samples on day 16 of pregnancy and day 16 of the estrous cycle were analyzed using high-throughput RNA-seq and bioinformatics. The results show that 4666 circRNAs were identified, including 7 downregulated and 11 upregulated differentially expressed circRNAs (DE-circRNAs). Back-splicing and RNase R resistance verified the identified circRNAs. We predicted the competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) regulatory mechanism and potential target genes of DE-circRNAs. Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analyses of these predicted target genes suggest that DE-circRNAs were significantly involved in establishing endometrial receptivity. Furthermore, Sanger sequencing, qPCR, correlation analysis and Fluorescence in Situ Hybridization (FISH) show that circ_MYRF derived from the host gene myelin regulatory factor (MYRF) might regulate the expression of interferon stimulating gene 15 (ISG15), thereby promoting the formation of endometrial receptivity. These novel findings may contribute to a better understanding of the molecular mechanisms regulating endometrial receptivity and promoting the maternal recognition of pregnancy (MRP).

AB  - a2 agonists are frequently used in horses with colic, even though they have been shown to inhibit gastrointestinal motility. The aim of this study was to determine the effect of dexmedetomidine on small intestinal in vitro contractility during different phases of ischaemia. Experimental segmental jejunal ischaemia was induced in 12 horses under general anaesthesia, and intestinal samples were taken pre-ischaemia and following ischaemia and reperfusion. Spontaneous and electrically evoked contractile activity of the circular and longitudinal smooth muscles were determined in each sample with and without the addition of dexmedetomidine. During a second experiment, tetrodotoxin was added to determine if the effect was neurogenic. We found that the circular smooth muscle (CSM) contractility was not affected by ischaemia, whereas the longitudinal smooth muscle (LSM) showed an increase in both spontaneous and induced contractile activity. The addition of dexmedetomidine caused a decrease in the spontaneous contractile activity of CSM, but an increase in that of LSM, which was not mediated by the enteric nervous system. During ischaemia, dexmedetomidine also mildly increased the electrically induced contractile activity in LSM. These results may indicate a stimulatory effect of dexmedetomidine on small intestinal contractility. However, the influence of dexmedetomidine administration on intestinal motility in vivo needs to be further investigated.

AB  - This study evaluated the effect of reduced water intake on survival, apoptosis and immunoexpression of leptin in sheep preantral follicles, activation of primordial follicles, serum levels of leptin, estradiol (E2) and progesterone (P4), and in vitro maturation (IVM) of oocytes antral follicles, as well evaluated the effects of leptin on in vitro culture of secondary follicles isolated these animals. Ewes (n = 32) were divided into four groups: water ad libitum (Control - 100%), 80%; 60% and 40% of ad libitum intake. Blood was collected to determine, leptin, E2 and P4, before and after experiment. After the slaughter, ovarian cortex was used to histological and immunohistochemistry analysis and oocytes IVM. Moreover, isolated secondary follicles were cultured in vitro for 12 days in control medium (& alpha;-MEM+) or & alpha;-MEM+ with 10 or 25 ng/mL leptin. The reduction of water intake caused a linear decreasing effect on the percentages of normal preantral follicles, especially of primordial (P < 0.05), increased the apoptosis (P < 0.05) and decreased leptin expression in preantral follicles. The treatment with 60% of water intake showed greater total growth rate of isolated secondary follicles cultured with 25 ng/L leptin (P < 0.05), compared to those cultured in & alpha;-MEM+ . In conclusion, reduced water intake impaired the number of normal sheep preantral follicles, especially of primordial follicles, increased apoptosis and decreased leptin expression in preantral follicles. Moreover, secondary follicles from of ewes

AB  - Intelligent pipeline inspection is necessary to operate submarine pipelines safely. At present, speed excursion and blockage are the challenges in the inspection of low-pressure gas pipelines. Accordingly, this study proposes a novel pneumo-electric hybrid-driven scheme to improve the traveling stability of inspection robots. To adapt to different working conditions, building blocks and CFD numerical simulation methods are used to study the throttling pressure control flow field of the robot. The results proved that the flow clearance had the most evident effect. The flow clearance was reduced from 30 to 5 mm, and the differential pressure of the prototype increased from 0.3 to 17 kPa. The skeleton diameter has a small effect on the differential pressure. The differential pressure increases as the gas velocity increases. By analyzing the prototype in different positions, it was found that the differential pressure of the prototype while passing the elbow decreased by 45% at 45 degrees, which quantified the fluid-driven force gap of the prototype while passing through the elbow. Finally, by comparing the speed of prototype with that of fluid-driven pig, it is demonstrated that a pneumo-electric hybrid-driven scheme is an effective solution to the problem of unstable inspection operation of low-pressure gas pipelines.

AB  - Northern elephant seals experience prolonged fasting while breeding, molting and undergoing postnatal development. Fasting elephant seals adjust neuroendocrine function and gene expression to cope with potentially detrimental effects associated with extended fasting. DNA methylation alters gene expression by modulating accessibility to regions necessary to initiate transcription. The effect of fasting and glucocorticoids on DNA methylation in elephant seals is understudied. We evaluated whether fasting alters global blood DNA methylation, the potential correlation between increased glucocorticoids and methylation, and the effects of glucocorticoids on DNA methylation in cultured northern elephant seal muscle cells. We found that fasting transiently increases blood DNA methylation and that blood DNA methylation levels correlate with plasma cortisol. We then conducted bioinformatic analyses to identify regions in the northern elephant seal glucocorticoid receptor (GR) promoter that influence gene transcription through methylation (CpG islands). We identified one CpG island within the putative GR promoter. Methylation in this region, however, was unaffected by prolonged fasting. We then investigated whether exogenous glucocorticoids alter DNA methylation and gene expression profiles in seal muscle cells in primary culture (myotubes). Exposure to glucocorticoids for 12 or 48 h decreased DNA methylation while upregulating pro-survival gene expression in northern elephant seal muscle cells. Our results show that whereas prolonged fasting transiently increases DNA methylation in northern elephant seal blood, sustained exposure to exogenous glucocorticoids decreases DNA methylation and activates a pro-survival transcriptional program in seal muscle cells. Therefore, our results suggest that DNA methylation is a plastic, potentially cell type-specific response that regulates gene expression in fasting northern elephant seals.

AB  - Recognition of mates from others is crucial for monogamous species to maintain their long-term pair bonds. The seahorse is widely recognized as a monogamous species, and its mate recognition cue is still not well understood. In the present study, we used the lined seahorse (Hippocampus erectus) as an experimental animal and investigated the effect of blocking olfactory, visual or behavioral (i.e., greeting) cues on mate recognition. Our results show that as long as the female seahorse can smell her mate, she will remain faithful to her mate and persistently select her mate as her next mating partner, regardless of whether the visual and/or behavioral cues between her and her mate are blocked. This finding implies that olfaction is a critical cue for a female seahorse to recognize her mate.

AB  - Improving cognitive health for older adults requires understanding the neurobiology of age-related cognitive decline and the mechanisms underlying preserved cognition in old age. During spatial learning tasks, aged humans and rodents shift navigation preferences in favor of a stimulus-response learning strategy. This has been hypothesized to result from competitive interactions of the caudate nucleus/dorsal striatum (DS) memory system with the hippocampus (HPC)-dependent spatial/allocentric memory system. In support of this hypothesis, a recent study reported that inactivation of the DS in aged rodents rescued HPC-dependent spatial learning on a T-maze (Gardner, Gold, & Korol, 2020). Currently, it is unclear whether a shift from HPC-dependent to DS-dependent behavior also contributes to age-related cognitive decline outside of spatial learning and memory. To test the hypothesis that inactivation of the DS can restore age-related cognitive function outside of spatial behavior, the present study bilaterally inactivated the DS of young (n = 8) and aged (n = 7) rats during visuospatial paired associates learning (PAL). This study found that inactivation of the DS did not alter PAL performance in young or aged rats, but did alter a positive control, DS-dependent spatial navigation task. This observation suggests that elevated DS activity does not play a role in the decline of HPC-dependent PAL performance in aged male rats. Given the persistent tendencies of aged rodents toward DS-dependent learning, it will be worthwhile to explore further the coordination dynamics between the HPC and DS that may contribute to age-related cognitive decline.

AB  - Introduction The cotton aphid (Aphis gossypii Glover) is a major global agricultural pest that damages cotton and numerous other economically significant crops through feeding and virus transmission. It possesses high adaptability and rapid reproduction rates, contributing to widespread resistance to chemical insecticides and thereby reducing the effectiveness of such control methods. It should be noted that plants have developed advanced chemical defense mechanisms over long periods of synergistic evolution, allowing them to synthesize volatile compounds. These compounds not only defend against herbivorous insects but also crucially reduce the development of pest resistance. Consequently, this study strives to explore plant-emitted volatiles as a potential eco-friendly alternative for aphid management.Methods In this study, we first tested the behavioral responses of A. gossypii to the volatile blends of fifteen native plant species in Xinjiang, China, using a Y-tube olfactometer and cage experiments. We identified six out of fifteen plant species that were repellent to A. gossypii. We then collected the volatile compounds of repellent plants using a headspace collection method and used gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) to identify the key components. The antennal responses of winged A. gossypii to the compounds were evaluated with an antennal potential test. Finally, further testing using a Y-tube olfactometer and Petri dish experiments.Results We identified six out of fifteen plant species (i.e. Anethum graveolens L., Juglans regia L., Rhaponticum repens L., Karelinia caspia Pall., Launaea polydichotoma Ostenf., and Brassica rapa L.) that were repellent to A. gossypii. We collected the volatile compounds of these six repellent plants and identified thirty-one key components. Our electroantennogram (EAG) tests revealed that sixteen of the thirty-one compounds caused significant antennal responses in winged A. gossypii. Further testing using a Y-tube olfactometer and Petri dish experiments confirmed fourteen compounds that repelled intact, winged cotton aphids.Discussion Our study report that the volatiles of four plant species - R. repens, K.caspia, L. polydichotoma, and B. rapa - present a significant repellent effect on winged cotton aphids, suggesting that these compounds might be useful for eco-friendly cotton aphid pest management. These results provide essential theoretical foundations and practical knowledge for the application of plantderived repellent volatiles.

AB  - Mutation or disruption of the Shank/ProSAP family of genes is a high risk factor for autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) and intellectual disability. N-methyl-D-aspartate glutamate receptor (NMDAR) dysfunction contributes to the development of autism-like behaviors. However, the molecular mechanism of Shank-mediated NMDAR modulation is still not clear. Here, we show that the scaffold protein plenty of SH3s (POSH) directly interacts with two other scaffold proteins, PSD95 and SHANK2/3, at excitatory synapses. In POSH conditional knockout (cKO) mice, normal synaptic clustering of NMDAR/PSD-95/SHANK complex is disrupted, accompanied by abnormal dendritic spine development and glutamatergic transmission in hippocampal neurons. POSH cKO mice display profound autism-like behaviors, including impairments in social interactions, social communication, repetitive behaviors, and deficits in learning and memory. Thus, POSH clusters at the postsynaptic density (PSD) with PSD-95 and SHANK2/3 and plays important roles in the signaling mechanisms of the NMDAR/PSD-95/POSH/SHANK complex as well as in spine development and brain function.

AB  - Hemicelluloses (HC) are polysaccharides constituents of the cell walls of plants. They are fermented in the gut to produce volatile fatty acids (VFA). The present study investigated the effects of decreasing HC level in a sow's lactation diet on sow performances, offspring development and milk composition. From 110 days (d) of gestation until weaning (26 +/- 0.4 d post-farrowing), 40 Swiss Large White sows were assigned to one of the four dietary treatments: (1) T13 (HC: 127 g/kg), (2) T11 (HC: 114 g/kg), (3) T9 (HC: 94 g/kg) and (4) T8 (HC: 80 g/kg). Milk was collected at 3 and 17d of lactation. At birth, piglets were divided into two groups according to their birthweight (BtW): normal (N-BtW; BtW >1.20 kg) or low (L-BtW; BtW <= 1.20 kg). Decreased HC levels in the maternal diet linearly increased (p <= .05) the body weight of L-BtW piglets at two weeks post-weaning and linearly decreased (p <= .05) diarrhoea incidence and duration in this category. The concentrations of copper, threonine and VFA, as well as the proportion of butyrate, in milk linearly increased (p <= .05), whereas lactose content linearly decreased (p <= .05) with decreased HC in the maternal diet. The present study provides evidence that decreasing HC level in a sow's lactation diet can positively affect the composition and VFA profile of milk and ultimately favour the growth and health of L-BtW piglets.

AB  - Although pathogenic variants in PSEN1 leading to autosomal-dominant Alzheimer disease (ADAD) are highly penetrant, substantial interindividual variability in the rates of cognitive decline and biomarker change are observed in ADAD. We hypothesized that this interindividual variability may be associated with the location of the pathogenic variant within PSEN1. PSEN1 pathogenic variant carriers participating in the Dominantly Inherited Alzheimer Network (DIAN) observational study were grouped based on whether the underlying variant affects a transmembrane (TM) or cytoplasmic (CY) protein domain within PSEN1. CY and TM carriers and variant non-carriers (NC) who completed clinical evaluation, multimodal neuroimaging, and lumbar puncture for collection of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) as part of their participation in DIAN were included in this study. Linear mixed effects models were used to determine differences in clinical, cognitive, and biomarker measures between the NC, TM, and CY groups. While both the CY and TM groups were found to have similarly elevated A beta compared to NC, TM carriers had greater cognitive impairment, smaller hippocampal volume, and elevated phosphorylated tau levels across the spectrum of pre-symptomatic and symptomatic phases of disease as compared to CY, using both cross-sectional and longitudinal data. As distinct portions of PSEN1 are differentially involved in APP processing by gamma-secretase and the generation of toxic beta-amyloid species, these results have important implications for understanding the pathobiology of ADAD and accounting for a substantial portion of the interindividual heterogeneity in ongoing ADAD clinical trials.

AB  - In rural environments, the sources of fecal contamination in freshwater environments are often diffuse and a mix of fresh and aged fecal sources. It is important for water monitoring purposes, therefore, to understand the impacts of weathering on detection of the fecal source markers available for mobilization from livestock sources. This study targets the impacts of rainfall events on the mobilization of fecal source tracking (FST) markers from simulated cowpats decomposing in situ for five-and-a-half-months. The FST markers analysed were Escherichia coli, microbial source tracking (MST) markers, fecal steroids and a fecal ageing ratio based on the ratio between counts of river microflora and total coliforms. There was a substantial concentration of E. coli (104/100 mL) released from the ageing cowpats suggesting a long-term reservoir of E. coli in the cowpat. Mobilization of fecal markers from rainfall-impacted cowpats, however, was markedly reduced compared with fecal markers in the cowpat. Overall, the Bacteroidales bovine-associated MST markers were less persistent than E. coli in the cowpat and rainfall runoff. The ten fecal steroids, including the major herbivore steroid, 24-ethylcoprostanol, are shown to be stable markers of bovine pollution due to statistically similar degradation rates among all steroids. The mobilizable fraction for each FST marker in the rainfall runoff allowed generation of mobilization decline curves and the derived decline rate constants can be incorporated into source attribution models for agricultural contaminants. Findings from this study of aged bovine pollution sources will enable water managers to improve attribution of elevated E. coli to the appropriate fecal source in rural environments.

AB  - Sewage sludge derived biochar has great potential for agricultural application, whereas the risk of heavy metals in sewage sludge is a key challenge for utilization. This study investigated the synergetic effect of co-pyrolysis and ZnCl2 impregnation treatment on the surface characteristics and potential ecological risk of heavy metals in sewage sludge derived biochar. It was concluded that ZnCl2 impregnation led to an increase in biochar yield, O and S content, but decrease the ash content and pH. Additionally, the thermal stability of ZnCl2-added biochar was decreased. Semi-quantitive specific functional groups analysis suggested that ZnCl2 impregnation had a negative effect on the content of C = O and C-O, while promoted the formation of aromatic C = C. And the functional group of C = O was retained in biochar by co-pyrolysis with Camellia oleifera shell due to its high content of potassium. For heavy metal passivation, ZnCl2 impregnation decreased total content of heavy metals by chlorination, while the oxidizable fraction (F3) of heavy metals showed an increasing tendency. Results of potential ecological risk assessment indicated that combining ZnCl2 impregnation and co-pyrolysis had great potential to reduce the ecological risk of heavy metals in sewage sludge derived biochar.

AB  - The use of pig slurry as organic fertilizer in intensive horticulture could be possible after hygienization to avoid contamination of products. This research aimed to evaluate a mixture of a tomato waste and rice husk as biofilter media to reduce NH3, N2O, CO2, and CH4 losses from a simple and low-cost solution for slurry hygienization by pH modification. The experiment was made in a system of laboratory scale biofilters connected to jars filled with raw slurry as control and three treatment methods: acidified slurry, alkalinized slurry, and neutralized slurry. The gas concentrations were measured for 35 days, and the composition of slurries and biofilters were determined. The results of this study showed that the mixture of biofiltering media, composed of tomato waste and rice husk, has the potential to retain NH3 and greenhouse gases (GHG) from a simple and low-cost solution for slurry hygienization by pH modification. Compared to the treatment raw slurry biofilter, the treatment neutralized slurry biofilter, subjected to a combined treatment by alkalinization/neutralization, retained 19% NH3, 4% CO2, and 83% CH4 losses and had no impact on N2O and global warming potential. Thus, the use of tomato waste biofilter during alkalinization did not increase the loss of NH3 and reduced GHG compared to raw slurry, avoiding the subsequent neutralization of slurry for environmental reasons, and could be used as an organic fertilizer in horticulture. However, using the combined alkalinization/neutralization treatment will improve the fertilizer value of the slurry by adjusting the pH from 9.5 to 7.5.

AB  - Poplar trees are significant for both economic and ecological purposes, and the fall webworm (Hyphantria cunea Drury) poses a major threat to their plantation in China. The preliminary resistance assessment in the previous research indicated that there were differences in resistance to the insect among these varieties, with '2KEN8' being more resistant and 'Nankang' being more susceptible. The present study analyzed the dynamic changes in the defensive enzymes and metabolic profiles of '2KEN8' and 'Nankang' at 24 hours post-infestation (hpi), 48 hpi, and 96 hpi. The results demonstrated that at the same time points, compared to susceptible 'Nankang', the leaf consumption by H. cunea in '2KEN8' was smaller, and the larval weight gain was slower, exhibiting clear resistance to the insect. Biochemical analysis revealed that the increased activity of the defensive enzymes in '2KEN8' triggered by the feeding of H. cunea was significantly higher than that of 'Nankang'. Metabolomics analysis indicated that '2KEN8' initiated an earlier and more intense reprogramming of the metabolic profile post-infestation. In the early stages of infestation, the differential metabolites induced in '2KEN8' primarily included phenolic compounds, flavonoids, and unsaturated fatty acids, which are related to the biosynthesis pathways of phenylpropanoids, flavonoids, unsaturated fatty acids, and jasmonates. The present study is helpful for identifying the metabolic biomarkers for inductive resistance to H. cunea and lays a foundation for the further elucidation of the chemical resistance mechanism of poplar trees against this insect.

AB  - The regenerative potential of Muller glia (MG) is extraordinary in fish, poor in chick and terrible in mammals. In the chick model, MG readily reprogram into proliferating Muller glia-derived progenitor cells (MGPCs), but neuronal differentiation is very limited. The factors that suppress the neurogenic potential of MGPCs in the chick are slowly being revealed. Isoforms of Nuclear Factor I (NFI) are cell-intrinsic factors that limit neurogenic potential; these factors are required for the formation of MG in the developing mouse retina and deletion of these factors reprograms MG into neuron-like cells in mature mouse retina. Accordingly, we sought to characterize the patterns of expression of NFIs in the developing, mature and damaged chick retina. In addition, we characterized patterns of expression of NFIs in the retinas of large mammals, pigs and monkeys. Using a combination of single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) and immunolabeling, we probed for patterns of expression. In embryonic chick, levels of NFIs are very low in early E5 (embryonic day 5) retinal progenitor cells (RPCs), upregulated in E8 RPCs, further upregulated in differentiating MG at E12 and E15. NFIs are maintained in mature resting MG, microglia and neurons. Levels of NFIs are reduced in activated MG in retinas treated with NMDA and/or insulin+FGF2, and further downregulated in proliferating MGPCs. However, levels of NFIs in MGPCs were significantly higher than those seen in RPCs. Immunolabeling for NFIA and NFIB closely matched patterns of expression revealed in different types of retinal neurons and glia, consistent with findings from scRNA-seq. In addition, we find expression of NFIA and NFIB through progenitors in the circumferential marginal zone at the far periphery of the retina. We find similar patterns of expression for NFIs in scRNA-seq databases for pig and monkey retinas. Patterns of expression of NFIA and NFIB were validated with immunofluorescence in pig and monkey retinas wherein these factors were predominantly detected in MG and a few types of inner retinal neurons. In summary, NFIA and NFIB are prominently expressed in developing chick retina and by mature neurons and glia in the retinas of chicks, pigs and monkeys. Although levels of NFIs are decreased in chick, in MGPCs these levels remain higher than those seen in neurogenic RPCs. We propose that the neurogenic potential of MGPCs in the chick retina is suppressed by NFIs.

AB  - The proliferation and migration of porcine trophectoderm (pTr) cells are crucial processes during the early stages of embryo implantation in sows. The effects of deoxynivalenol (DON) and chlorogenic acid (CGA), a plant-derived compound, on pTr cells are currently unclear. In this study, pTr cells were treated with DON at different times (24, 48, and 72 h) and different concentrations (0.5, 1, and 2 mu g/mL) to construct a pathological model of DON-induced pTr cells by detecting the expression levels of genes related to cell proliferation, migration, and oxidative stress, as well as the cell viability and the cell migration ability. Subsequently, CGA intervention experiments revealed that CGA could promote the proliferation, migration, and antioxidant ability of pTr cells and alleviate the damage induced by DON in pTr cells. Finally, RNA-seq technology combined with experiments illustrated that CGA might alleviate the damage of DON-induced pTr cells by regulating the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway. In conclusion, this study explored the toxicological effect of DON and the alleviation effect of CGA on DON at the pTr cells level, which provided new insights and an experimental basis for using CGA to alleviate the reproductive toxicity induced by DON.

AB  - BackgroundRegeneration is the preferred approach to restore the structure and function after tissue damage. Rapid proliferation of cells over the site of damage is integral to the process of regeneration. However, even subtle mutations in proliferating cells may cause detrimental effects by eliciting abnormal differentiation. Interestingly deer antlers, arguably the fastest regenerating mammalian tissue, have not been reported, thus far, to grow malignant tumors. They provide a mammalian model to understand the possible mechanism by which rapid regeneration is achieved while avoiding the development of malignancies. Antler regeneration is based on the proliferation and differentiation of antler stem cells (AnSCs).ResultsWe identified 39 hub genes which may function in regulating the balance between rapid proliferation and genomic stability in the AnSCs during antler regeneration. Among these 39 genes, the tumor suppressor gene, BRCA1, was found to be more sensitive to DNA damage in the AnSCs compared to that in the deer somatic cells, and BRCA1 deletion in the AnSCs via CRISPR/Cas9 resulted in significantly higher levels of DNA damage. Lack of BRCA1 promoted cell apoptosis and cell senescence and inhibited cell proliferation and cell self-renewal. RNA-seq results showed that in the absence of BRCA1, the p53 signaling pathway was significantly up-regulated. Associated with this change, the cell apoptosis and cell senescence-relevant-genes, CDKN1A, CDKN2A and Fas were over expressed, but the expression of cell-cycle-progression-related genes was inhibited. In addition, BRCA1 expression levels were found to be more sensitive to endoplasmic reticulum stress (ERS) in the AnSCs compared to the somatic cells. Deletion of BRCA1 gene aggravated ERS and ERS-induced cell apoptosis.ConclusionsOur results revealed that BRCA1 is involved in sustaining rapid antler growth possibly via promotion of DNA damage repair that acts to maintain genome stability while protecting cells from p53/ERS-induced cell death. Understanding the mechanisms underlying the role played by BRCA1 in the process of antler regeneration is of great significance not only for regenerative medicine, but also for the understanding of cancer development.

AB  - Simple Summary Auditory environmental enrichment may be used to relieve animal stress and has been reported to have positive behavioral effects in pigs, considering it aims to improve restrictive living conditions associated with intensive production systems. This research aimed to assess the effects of auditory environmental enrichment on sows in mixed housing (caged until 35 days after insemination and then collective pens) or collective housing (caged until 72 h after insemination and then collective pens). The collective reproductive management did not demonstrate losses in the productive performance of swine, which may be an interesting management alternative as it reduces the time spent in individual facilities, improving the welfare of sows. These findings may be used to confront conservative protocols that indicate log periods in individual facilities to prevent gestational loses. The auditory environment enrichment also had positive influences on sows' welfare, which was reflected in the performance of piglets; calm sows had heavier weaned litters, which may be considered another interesting finding for swine production.The research aimed to assess the effects of auditory environmental enrichment on sows in mixed housing (caged until 35 days after insemination and then collective pens) or collective housing (caged until 72 h after insemination and then collective pens). Reproductive performance, body surface and eye temperature (ET) were evaluated as sows' welfare indicators. A sample of 56 sows between 2nd and 6th parity was submitted to the treatments from artificial insemination to weaning. The sows were assigned in a randomized block design with a 2 x 2 factorial scheme of treatments: mixed housing-control (MH-C), collective housing-control (CH-C), mixed housing-music (MH-M) and collective housing-music (CH-M). Auditory enrichment consisted of exposing sows daily throughout gestation and lactation to 6 h of classical music divided into 2 h periods. The ET of pregnant sows in collective housing was lower than that of sows in mixed housing (33.77 ? vs. 34.91 ?). Pregnant and lactating sows exposed to auditory environmental enrichment exhibited lower ET compared to those that had no access to the stimulus (pregnant 33.36 ? vs. 34.32 ? and lactating 34.21 ? vs. 34.83 ?). No housing type effect was found on the reproductive performance parameter; however, piglets from sows submitted to auditory environmental enrichment, regardless of the type of housing during gestation, were heavier at weaning (6.32 kg vs. 5.57 kg). Collective or mixed housing does not affect sows' reproductive performance; perhaps, auditory environmental enrichment reduced stress in the gestation and lactation phases and provided greater piglet weight gain at weaning.

AB  - IntroductionSecondary metabolites in plants play a crucial role in defense mechanisms against insects, pests, and pathogens. These metabolites exhibit varying distributions within and among plant parts under different biotic and abiotic conditions. Understanding the intricate relationships between secondary metabolites and insect populations can be helpful for elucidating plant defense mechanisms and enhancing agricultural managing efficiencies.ObjectiveTo investigate the influence of the glucosinolate profile in the leaves of three cabbage (Brassica oleracea var. capitata L.) varieties on insect loads.MethodsGlucosinolate profiles across different leaf positions (such as bottom, middle, and center) and leaf shapes (such as curly and non-curly leaf) of three cabbage varieties (Xiagan [XGA], Xiaguang [XGU], and Qiangxia [QIX]) were analyzed by using high-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS). The insect loads were recorded by visually inspecting the upper and lower layers of each target leaf.ResultsIncreasing concentrations of four glucosinolates, namely, glucoiberin, progoitrin, glucoraphanin, and glucobrassicin, were positively related to insect loads. While increasing concentrations of the other four glucosinolates, such as neoglucobrassicin, 4-methoxyglucobrassicin, sinigrin, and gluconapin, were negatively related to insect loads. Furthermore, both glucosinolate synthesis and insect loads were significantly higher in the curly-shaped and middle-position leaves than in the non-curly-shaped and bottom- and central-position leaves across the cabbage varieties.ConclusionDifferences in glucosinolate profiles across leaf positions and shapes strongly influenced the insect loads of the three Brassica varieties. This link may further extend our understanding of the real defense power of a particular variety against herbivore damage.
   This study reveals that specific glucosinolates in three cabbage varieties correlate with insect loads. Higher insect loads were linked to glucoiberin, progoitrin, glucoraphanin, and glucobrassicin, while neoglucobrassicin, 4-methoxyglucobrassicin, sinigrin, and gluconapin showed negative correlations. Curly-shaped and middle-position leaves had higher glucosinolate levels and insect loads. These findings highlight the importance of leaf position and shape in plant defense mechanisms.

AB  - Within One Health framework, the dissemination of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) and pathogenic bacteria by wild birds has attracted increasing attention. In this study, gut samples of wild birds opportunistically collected in Tianjin, China, situated along the East Asian-Australasian Flyway, were used to ascertain the realistic distribution of bacteria and ARGs in their intestinal tracts. These birds have different dietary habits (herbivore, carnivore, and omnivore) and residency statuses (resident and migratory birds). Using 16S rRNA gene sequencing and qPCR, we analyzed microbial communities and the abundance of high-risk ARGs and mobile genetic elements (MGEs). Birds with distinct ecological traits exhibited significant variations in gut bacterial composition, yet similar microbial diversity. Shigella sp. emerged as the core intestinal pathogen, with a mean relative abundance 2.57 to 1466 times higher than that of other pathogenic bacteria, and its concentration correlated with the host's trophic level as indicated by the delta 15N 15 N values. The distribution of ARGs and MGEs also varied with bird ecological traits. All 10 targeted high-risk ARGs were detected in carnivores or passage migrants, while migratory birds carried significantly greater abundance of intI1 than residents (p p < 0.05). The potential of migratory birds to harbor and disseminate pathogenic bacteria and ARGs cannot be ignored. Network analysis revealed bla TEM-1 presence in multiple core microorganisms, positively associated with Clostridioides difficile, , emphasizing its risk potential. Positive dfrA12-intI1 correlation across trophic levels suggests potential for intI1-- mediated transmission. Our study underscores the high potential risk posed by wild birds in carrying ARGs and pathogenic microorganisms, emphasizing the importance of further research and surveillance in this field.

AB  - The mechanism of neurodevelopmental toxicity of decabromodiphenyl ether (BDE209) remains unclear. Recent evidence suggests that neurosteroids disorders play a vital role in BDE209 induced-neurodevelopmental toxicity. To explore the mechanism of it, pregnant ICR mice were orally gavaged with 0, 225, and 900 mg kg-1 BDE209 for about 42 days. Spatial learning and memory abilities of offspring were tested on postnatal day (PND) 21. Offspring were euthanized at PND26, the neuronal structure, neurosteroids level, and related proteins including neurosteroids synthase, ionotropic receptors and cAMP-response element binding protein (CREB) pathway were evaluated, as well as Ca2+ concentration and the mitochondrial membrane potential (Mmp). Our results showed that BDE209 impaired learning and memory abilities and disrupted neuronal structure. Meanwhile, BDE209 decreased the pregnenolone (PREG), dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), progesterone (PROG) and allopregnanolone (ALLO) levels in the serum and brain, as well as the mRNA and protein levels of cholesterol-side-chain cleavage enzyme (P450scc), steroid 17 alpha-hy-droxylase (P450C17), 3 beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (3 beta-HSD) and steroid 5 alpha-reductase of type I (5 alpha-R) in the hippocampi. Also, BDE209 suppressed mRNA and protein levels of NR1, NR2A and NR2B subunits of the N-methyl-D-aspartic acid receptor (NMDAR) and alpha 1 subunit of the Gamma-amino butyric acid A receptor (GABAAR), but increased the levels of beta 2 and gamma 2 subunits of the GABAAR in the hippocampi. Moreover, BDE209 increased the Ca2+ concentration and phosphorylation extracellular regulated protein kinases (P-ERK) 1/2 level, but decreased the P-CREB and Mmp level in the hippocampi. These results indicate that BDE209 exposure during pregnancy and lactation is possible to affect learning and memory formation of offspring by the neurosteroid-mediated ionotropic receptors dysfunction.

AB  - The objective of this study was to determine the optimal timing, sperm concentration, and body condition score (BCS) for laparoscopic artificial insemination (LAI) in the subtropical Lohi sheep breed. In Experiment 1, Lohi ewes (n = 80) were synchronised through progestin-sponges (day 0-day 11), administering PGF2(alpha) (d-cloprostenol 75 mu g/mL; i.m. @ 75 mu g /ewe) on day 09 and eCG (i.m. @ 300 IU/ewe) on day 11. Ewes were divided equally into four groups (n = 20 each) and then LAI was performed at 48 (T48), 60 (T60), 72 (T72) and 96 (T96) hours post-sponge removal using 200 million sperm/insemination. In Experiment 2, ewes (n = 81) were synchronised as in Experiment I. Following synchronisation ewes were divided into four groups, each subjected to LAI employing varying sperm concentrations: 10 (S10; n = 21), 20 (S20; n = 20), 50 (S50; n = 20), or 100 (S100; n = 20) million per insemination. Inseminations were performed within a time window of 48-60 h post-sponge removal, based on the findings from Experiment 1. In both experiments ewes were categorised according to BCS, that is, medium 3 and high > 3. Results of Experiment 1 revealed a quadratic response that ewes inseminated at 60-h post-sponge removal exhibited significantly higher pregnancy and twinning rates (p = 0.02). The results of Experiment 2 revealed that sperm concentration had a quadratic effect, 50 million sperm per insemination resulted in maximal pregnancy rates (p = 0.01). Additionally, ewes with medium BCS (<= 3) had higher pregnancy rates than high BCS (> 3) ewes. In conclusion, ewes with medium BCS (<= 3) are ideal candidate for LAI and can be inseminated at 60 h with minimal sperm 50 x 10(6)/dose post-sponge removal to achieve a maximum pregnancy rate.

AB  - Simple Summary Weaning is a period when young animals are exposed to a number of stressors caused by the separation from the sow, transport and handling, different food sources, a new social hierarchy, and different physical environments. This situation contributes to the generation of free radicals that cause oxidative stress. In weaned piglets, the most prominent disorders occur in the intestines, and their increased permeability can compromise liver function as metabolites migrate to the liver. Oxidative stress can lead to liver necrosis. Astaxanthin (AST) is a powerful carotenoid and antioxidant that can scavenge free radicals and protect cells from oxidative damage. Findings show that AST has a protective effect on the liver, reducing inflammation, lipid accumulation and markers of liver damage. It also inhibits insulin resistance and lipotoxicity-induced steatohepatitis and regulates fatty acid metabolism pathways. This study investigated the liver-protective properties of AST in weaned piglets. The study showed that AST reduces collagen content in liver tissue and affects the expression of specific genes related to liver function. Expression of CREB, NOTCH1 and NR1H3 genes decreased, while expression of the CYP7A1 gene increased. These findings underscore the beneficial effects of AST on liver health and suggest its potential as a protective agent against liver damage.Abstract During the weaning period, piglets are exposed to high levels of stress, which often causes problems with the digestive system. This stress also promotes the production of free radicals, resulting in oxidative stress. Astaxanthin (AST) stands out as one of the most potent antioxidants. Its resistance to light and heat makes it particularly valuable in compound feed production. This study was to determine the effect of AST impact on liver histology and gene expression in piglets. For our experiment, we used 16 weaned piglets of the PL breed, which we divided into two groups: Group I (control group with no AST supplementation) and Group II (supplemented with AST at 0.025 g/kg). Both feed mixtures were iso-proteins and iso-energetic, meeting the nutritional requirements of the piglets. The experiment lasted from day 35 to day 70 of the piglets' age, during which they had ad libitum access. The results indicate that the addition of AST prevents liver fibrosis due to reduced collagen deposition in the tissue. Analysis of gene expression supported these results. In the AST-supplemented group, we noted a decrease in NR1H3 expression, an increase in CYP7A1 expression, and reductions in the expression of NOTCH1 and CREB genes.

AB  - Stimulator of interferon gene (STING), an adaptor molecule in the immune system, is involved in mediating the response to viral and bacterial infections, anti-tumor immunity, autoimmune diseases, and lipid metabolism. There have been reports on the cloning and function of STING in humans, pigs, chickens, and cats; however, STING has not been characterized in non-human primates or monkeys to date. Therefore, in this study, the rhesus macaque (Macaca mulata) STING gene was cloned, and we performed preliminary functional tests to examine its role in the interferon (IFN) pathway. The M. mulatta STING complementary DNA was 1140 bp in length and encoded 380 amino acid residues. Phylogenetic analysis showed that Homo sapiens and M. mulatta STING are closely related and clustered on the same branch. M. mulatta STING was confirmed to increase the promoter activities of IFN-beta, nuclear factor-xB, and interferon-sensitive response element, and STING overexpression increased the mRNA levels of IFN-alpha, IFN-beta, and interferon regulatory factor 3. Infection of Marc-145 cells with porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus activated STING, and its expression increased along with increases in viral multiplicity of infection titer and time. Moreover, STING expression was time-and dose-dependently up-regulated by poly (I:C) and poly (dA:dT) treatments in Marc-145 cells. In summary, these re-sults highlight STING as a vital immune system signal protein in the IFN pathway. This study provides a basis for understanding the immune characteristics of M. mulatta, and may have important implications for both monkey and human diseases.

Previous studies have demonstrated trilobatin (TLB), as a natural food additive, can extend the life of Caenorhabditis elegans and exhibit neuroprotection in Alzheimer's disease mice. However, the possible significance of TLB in anti-aging remains elusive. Purpose: This study aimed to delve into the physiological mechanism by which TLB ameliorated aging-induced cognitive impairment in senescence-accelerated mouse prone 8 (SAMP8) mice. Methods: 6-month-old SAMP8 mice were administrated with TLB (5, 10, 20 mg/kg/day, i.g.) for 3 months. The therapeutic effect of TLB on aging-induced cognitive impairment was assessed in mice using behavioral tests and aging score. The gut microbiota composition in fecal samples was analyzed by metagenomic analysis. The protective effects of TLB on blood-brain barrier (BBB) and intestinal barrier were detected by transmission electron microscope, H&E staining and western blot (WB) assay. The inhibitive effects of TLB on inflammation in brain and intestine were assessed using immunofluorescence, WB and ELISA assay. Molecular docking and surface plasma resonance (SPR) assay were utilized to investigate interaction between TLB and sirtuin 2 (SIRT2). Results: Herein, the findings exhibited TLB mitigated aging-induced cognitive impairment, neuron injury and neuroinflammation in hippocampus of aged SAMP8 mice. Moreover, TLB treatment repaired imbalance of gut microbiota in aged SAMP8 mice. Furthermore, TLB alleviated the damage to BBB and intestinal barrier, concomitant with reducing the expression of SIRT2, phosphorylated levels of c -Jun NH2 terminal kinases (JNK) and c -Jun, and expression of MMP9 protein in aged SAMP8 mice. Molecular docking and SPR unveiled TLB combined with SIRT2 and down-regulated SIRT2 protein expression. Mechanistically, the potential mechanism of SIRT2 in TLB that exerted anti-aging effect was validated in vitro. As expected, SIRT2 deficiency attenuated phosphorylated level of JNK in HT22 cells treated with D-galactose. Conclusion: These findings reveal, for the first time, SIRT2-mediated brain-gut barriers contribute to aging and aging-related diseases, and TLB can rescue aging-induced cognitive impairment by targeting SIRT2 and restoring gut microbiota disturbance to mediate the brain-gut axis. Overall, this work extends the potential application of TLB as a natural food additive in aging-related diseases.

AB  - IntroductionToxoplasmosis is one of the most important health-threatening diseases with worldwide distribution and global impact. It is caused by Toxoplasma gondii (T. gondii), an intracellular apicomplexan parasite that can evade the host immune responses and establish a chronic infection. The available treatments are not efficient against this stage and have many adverse effects. There are no available effective vaccines, apart from Toxovax((R)), which is used in sheep to prevent abortion. Studies documented that prolactin (PRL) had in vivo and in vitro anti-Toxoplasma effects. Detailed research was recommended about the mechanisms of such inhibitory effects.AimThis study was designed to assess the possible protective role of the recombinant prolactin (rPRL) against T. gondii.Materials and MethodsSixty experimentally infected mice with T. gondii were used. The treated mice received rPRL for five days before infection. Serum prolactin levels were measured; survival rate was monitored; number, size, and DNA of T. gondii cysts in the brain were measured; and histopathological and immunological studies were done.ResultsThere was a significant increase in the survival rate of the rPRL-treated mice, a significant decrease in the number, size, and DNA amount of T. gondii cysts in the brain with a noticeable improvement of histopathological lesions in the brain and liver tissues when compared to the infected untreated group. These effects seem to be achieved through stimulating humoral and cell-mediated immune responses that were evident by the significant rise in serum levels of anti-Toxoplasma IgM, IFN-gamma, and TNF-alpha .ConclusionThe rPRL elicited robust immune responses, which provided efficient protection against murine T. gondii infection.

AB  - Here, we propose a model of remote memory (BaconREM), which is an extension of a previously published Bayesian model of context fear learning (BACON) that accounts for many aspects of recently learned context fear. BaconREM simulates most known phenomenology of remote context fear as studied in rodents and makes new predictions. In particular, it predicts the well-known observation that fear that was conditioned to a recently encoded context becomes hippocampus-independent and shows much-enhanced generalization ("hyper-generalization") when systems consolidation occurs (i.e., when memory becomes remote). However, the model also predicts that there should be circumstances under which the generalizability of remote fear may not increase or even decrease. It also predicts the established finding that a "reminder" exposure to a feared context can abolish hyper-generalization while at the same time making remote fear again hippocampus-dependent. This observation has in the past been taken to suggest that reminders facilitate access to detail memory that remains permanently in the hippocampus even after systems consolidation is complete. However, the present model simulates this result even though it totally moves all the contextual memory that it retains to the neo-cortex when context fear becomes remote.

AB  - Introduction: The Mnemonic Similarity Task (MST) has become a popular test of memory and, in particular, of hippocampal function. It has been heavily used in research settings and is currently included as an alternate outcome measure on a number of clinical trials. However, as it typically requires similar to 15 min to administer and benefits substantially from an experienced test administrator to ensure the instructions are well-understood, its use in trials and in other settings is somewhat restricted. Several different variants of the MST are in common use that alter the task format (study-test vs. continuous) and the response prompt given to participants (old/similar/new vs. old/new).
   Methods: In eight online experiments, we sought to address three main goals: (1) To determine whether a robust version of the task could be created that could be conducted in half the traditional time; (2) To determine whether the test format or response prompt choice significantly impacted the MST's results; and (3) To determine how robust the MST is to repeat testing. In Experiments 1-7, participants received both the traditional and alternate forms of the MST to determine how well the alternate version captured the traditional task's performance. In Experiment 8, participants were given the MST four times over approximately 4 weeks.
   Results: In Experiments 1-7, we found that test format had no effect on the reliability of the MST, but that shifting to the two-choice response format significantly reduced its ability to reflect the traditional MST's score. We also found that the full running time could be cut it half or less without appreciable reduction in reliability. We confirmed the efficacy of this reduced task in older adults as well. Here, and in Experiment 8, we found that while there often are no effects of repeat-testing, small effects are possible, but appear limited to the initial testing session.
   Discussion: The optimized version of the task developed here (oMST) is freely available for web-based experiment delivery and provides an accurate estimate of the same memory ability as the classic MST in less than half the time.

AB  - Background: Major depressive disorders (MDD) is one of the most common mental illness in the world. Recently, brain m6A /m (fat mass- and obesity-associated gene Fto) was found that exerted an important role in regulating gene expression involved in stress related depression. However, the potential mechanism of Fto on depression still remains elusive. This study investigated the role of Fto and its downstream signaling pathway in hippocampus on chronic restraint stress induced depressive-like behaviors.
   Methods: C57BL/6 mice weighing 20-22 g were randomly divided into 4 groups (Control, Control + Fto-ov, Stress, Stress + Fto-ov). Mice were exposed to chronic restraint stress for 3 consecutive weeks to induce depression model. Mice in the Fto-ov groups were stereotaxic injected with Recombinant Adeno-associated Virus lentivirus (Fto) in hippocampus followed by stress procedure. Depressive-like behaviors were detected after stress procedure. Western blot was used to test hippocampal Fto, p-CaMKII and p-CREB expression. Post synaptic density protein 95 (PSD95) and synaptophysin levels were detected by PCR. Golgi-Cox staining was used to appraise dendritic spine density and branches. Synaptic morphology in hippocampus was determined by electron microscopy.
   Results: We demonstrated that chronic restraint stress induced depressive-like behaviors, decreased protein expression of Fto, p-CaMKII and p-CREB, reduced levels of synaptic plasticity markers (synaptophysin and PSD95) in hippocampus. Moreover, chronic restraint stress led to synaptic morphology alterations (reduced dendritic spine density and number of branches; thinned postsynaptic density). However, these molecules changes and morphology alterations were reversed by stereotaxic injected recombinant adeno-associated Ftooverexpression virus in hippocampus.
   Conclusions: This study found that the modulation of Fto on CaMKII/CREB signaling pathway plays a key role in hippocampal synaptic plasticity, and then ameliorated chronic restraint stress induced depressive-like behaviors.

AB  - The psyllid Bactericera gobica is a serious pest in goji berry orchards. The current primary psyllid control methods involve chemical pesticides, which pose potential risks to human health and the environment. The implementation and promotion of biological control agents should receive increased attention as an alternative approach to safeguarding goji berry orchards. To compare the predatory performance of three potential biocontrol agents of psyllids, including Harmonia axyridis, Coccinella septempunctata and Hippodamia variegata, the functional response and intraspecific interactions of adult ladybirds were studied under laboratory conditions. We observed a significantly higher searching efficiency (0.84 +/- 0.09) in H. axyridis when preying on psyllids compared to H. variegata (0.55 +/- 0.05), whereas the handling time for psyllids was considerably longer in H. axyridis (7.33 +/- 0.83 min) than in H. variegata (5.67 +/- 0.97 min). The impact of intraspecific interactions on H. variegata (0.44 +/- 0.04) was significantly greater than that on C. septempunctata (0.29 +/- 0.03), whereas the maximum consumption by C. septempunctata (223.35 +/- 41.3) significantly exceeded that of H. variegata (133.4 +/- 26.9). Our study suggests that each of these three ladybird species possesses distinct advantages as a potential predator of psyllids. However, further field studies are required to determine the most promising ladybird species for rapid impact through inundative biological control, taking into consideration the specific environmental adaptability of each ladybird species. The present study is expected to provide evidence that supports the potential of incorporating promising ladybird species as an effective biological control agent in goji berry orchard management programs.

AB  - Simple Summary Genetic improvement is one of the most important keys to overcoming the shortcomings of beef production. Identifying molecular markers related to growth characteristics and meat quality is significant in improving beef cattle breeds. Studies have shown that KAT2B, a transcriptional co-activator regulating the acetylation modification of histones, may be involved in the development and metabolism of muscle and adipose. However, there are no reports on investigating KAT2B genetic variation in Chinese native cattle. Firstly, this manuscript reports the initial bioinformatics analysis of KAT2B, finding that KAT2B protein is highly conserved among ruminants. The KAT2B gene expression profile in Qinchuan cattle was characterized, showing the spatiotemporal specificity of KAT2B gene expression in tissues such as adipose and liver during fetal and adult periods. Then, the investigation of KAT2B gene polymorphisms was carried out. Three SNPs of the KAT2B gene were identified and were found to be correlated with multiple body measurements in Fu, Qinchuan, Yak, and Chaidam cattle. These findings suggest that these three SNPs of KAT2B can serve as the molecular markers to select individuals for beef cattle breed improvement. Identifying molecular markers related to growth characteristics or meat quality is significant for improving beef cattle breeds. K(lysine) acetyltransferase 2B (KAT2B) is a transcriptional co-activator regulating the acetylation modification of histones, which may be involved in the development and metabolism of muscle and adipose. However, investigations of KAT2B genetic variations in Chinese native cattle are still limited. This study aimed to identify crucial single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) influencing the body measurements of Chinese native cattle. Biological evolution and conservation analysis showed that KAT2B was highly conserved among the ruminants. By qPCR assay, KAT2B gene expression was found to be spatiotemporally specific in bovine tissues such as adipose and liver. By the RFLP-PCR method, three SNPs of KAT2B (g.T61908C, g.T62131C, and g.C73406T) were identified in 827 individuals of four Chinese cattle breeds, including Qinchuan (n = 658), Fu (n = 52), Yak (n = 48), and Chaidam (n = 69) cattle. Association analysis between these KAT2B polymorphisms and the body measurements of Chinese native cattle revealed significant observations. The genetic effects of g.T61908C, g.T62131C, and g.C73406T on the associated phenotypes were illustrated in each breed. In Qinchuan cattle, g.T62131C was significantly associated with better body height, chest width, hip width, and withers height, for which TC and/or TT were the advantageous genotype. In Fu cattle, TT genotype of g.T61908C was associated to better body length, while individuals with TT or CC of g.T62131C showed higher circumference of cannon bone than those with TC genotype. In Yak, individuals with TT genotype of g.C73406T had heavier body weight. In Chaidam cattle, TC genotype of g.C73406T was associated to superior body weight, while CC genotype of g.C73406T was associated to superior chest girth and circumference of cannon bone. These findings suggest that KAT2B gene polymorphisms can be used as the molecular markers for the early molecular marker-assisted selection in beef cattle breeding programs.

AB  - Incubation with estrous sheep serum (ESS) is required to induce in vitro capacitation of spermatozoa during in vitro fertilization of small ruminants. However, the effect of adding different serum concentrations in the fertilization media on the quality of resulting blastocysts has not yet been studied. Here, 298 sheep oocytes were co-incubated with capacitated spermatozoa with either 10% or 2% ESS. There were no differences between treatments in cleavage (10% ESS: 63.81 +/- 5.87% and 2% ESS: 45.31 +/- 5.87%) and blastocyst rates (10% ESS: 20.83 +/- 2.12% and 2% ESS: 15.93 +/- 2.12%). Nonetheless, in vitro-produced blastocysts from the 10% ESS treatment showed a higher transcript abundance of mRNAs involved in apoptosis (ITM2B and BCL2), antioxidant defence (GPX1) and growth-related imprinting (IGF2R). Our data suggest that ESS supplementation during in vitro fertilization can influence the quality of sheep embryos at later stages of development by increasing the transcription of developmentally important genes.

AB  - Consumer demand for natural and healthier products has led to an increasing interest in the bioactive and therapeutic properties of plant extracts. In this study, we evaluated the phenolic compounds profile, bioactivities, and toxicities of plant extracts from eight European flora species, including Calendula officinalis L., Calluna vulgaris (L.) Hull, Hippophae rhamnoides L., Juglans regia L., Mentha cervina L., Rubus idaeus L., Sambucus nigra L., and Vitis vinifera L. The aim was to identify potential preservatives of natural origin. Phenolic compounds were identified by HPLC-DAD-ESI-MS. Caffeic acid derivatives, ellagitannins, flavonols, and flavones were the major phenolic compounds identified. The total phenolic content varied from 16.0 & PLUSMN; 0.2 (V. vinifera) to 123 & PLUSMN; 2 mg/g (H. rhamnoides) of dry extract. All extracts showed antioxidant potential and exhibited activity against some of the microorganisms tested. S. nigra showed the highest activity in the inhibition of oxidative hemolysis (OxHLIA) assay and H. rhamnoides, notably, had the lowest IC50 values in TBARS and DPPH assays, as well as the lowest minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) values. Regarding in vitro cytotoxicity, in tumor and non-tumor cell lines, although some extracts revealed toxicity against normal cells, it was found that the samples C. vulgaris, V. vinifera and R. idaeus might be used against tumor cells since the active concentration is much lower than the one causing toxicity. In vivo acute toxicity tests using Artemia franciscana suggest low toxicity for most extracts, with LC50 > 400 mg/L. These results showed the potential of the studied extracts as natural preservatives, given their richness in compounds with bioactive properties, highlight their potential value to the production chain.

AB  - Anxiety-like behavior and social withdrawal induced by obesity and oxidative stress are significant health concerns in contemporary society. Our previously study found that Bacillus amyloliquefaciens SC06 (SC06) decreased the body weight of high-fat diet (HFD)-fed male mice and protected porcine intestinal epithelial cells against oxidative stress. The present study further investigated the effect of SC06 on HFD-induced obesity, anxiety-like behavior and social withdrawal of male mice and explored its mechanism. Results showed that SC06 significantly decreased HFD-induced obesity as evidenced by the decreased body weight, weight of liver and epididymal fat. Meanwhile, SC06 attenuated the anxiety-like behavior of HFD-fed male mice as illustrated by the more exploration time in both the open arms of elevated plus maze and the central area of open field and the reversed their social withdrawal tested in the three-chamber social choice task. SC06 also reduced reactive oxygen species (ROS) concentration and normalized the mitochondrial morphology in the hippocampus. SC06 reduced the systemic inflammation and increased the expression of intestinal tight junctions (ZO-1 and Claudin1). Furthermore, SC06 also altered the microbial diversity and composition, and decreased Firmicutes to Bacteroidetes ratio of HFD-fed male mice. These findings suggest SC06 attenuate HFD-induced anxiety-like behavior and social withdrawal of male mice by attenuating hippocampal oxidation stress, systemic inflammation, dysbiosis and improving intestinal barrier function.

AB  - Data on the diets of Afro-Palearctic migratory birds outside their breeding grounds are scarce, despite the importance of feeding during the migratory journey. Here, we report on anecdotal findings from a study in which we used diet metabarcoding to analyse the composition of faecal samples from three Woodchat Shrikes Lanius senator collected during their spring migration stopover in Morocco. Metabarcoding revealed that the prey items most commonly consumed by the shrikes were camel ticks Hyalomma dromedarii. Additionally, in one sample we detected DNA from dromedary Camelus dromedarius, the presumed host of the ticks. Thus, metabarcoding can reveal novel information on the diet of migrating birds using non-invasive methods, as well as insights into secondary consumption by prey taxa.

AB  - While the effect of unitization on associative memory has been established, its effect on item memory remains debated. This study aimed to investigate the influence of unitization on item memory using Chinese characters to manipulate unitization and recording scalp EEG to elucidate the underlying neural mechanisms. In the learning phase, participants were asked to determine whether the character pairs presented could form a Chinese compound character. In the subsequent testing phase, participants performed item recognition and associative recognition tasks. Behavioral results revealed that unitization not only improved associative memory but also facilitated item memory. Event-related potential analysis indicated there were FN400 effect (related to familiarity) and LPC effect (related to recollection) during associative recognition after unitization, however, only the LPC effect was observed for the item recognition. More importantly, time-frequency analysis demonstrated stronger theta oscillations (associated with recollection) in the unitized condition compared to the non-unitized condition, which further partially mediated the reduction in RT during the item recognition. These results suggest that unitization enhances item memory through recollection, thereby leading to more confident recognition judgments, and that unitization does not impair item processing within an association but rather enables more precise and accurate processing.

AB  - This study investigated the effects of multiple treatments of estradiol benzoate (EB) prior to the induction of luteal regression on the efficiency of artificial lactation induction and milk yield in pseudopregnant sows. Pseudopregnant females induced by treatment with 30 mg estradiol dipropionate (EDP) were administered 2 mg (Group EB 2 mg, n = 5) or 3 mg (Group EB 3 mg, n = 6) EB on Days-10, -7, and -4 (Day 0 = the day of prostaglandin F2 alpha [PGF2 alpha] treatment). Six pseudopregnant sows (Group EDP) received 5 mg EDP on Day -10.5 +/- 1.6. The induction efficiency of artificial lactation, collected milk volume and immunoglobulin concentrations in the milk obtained from sows after PGF2 alpha treatment were analysed. The dosage of EB treatment before PGF2 alpha administration had no significant effect on either the induction rate of artificial lactation or the milk yield during the experimental period. Harvested milk volumes from EB-treated pseudopregnant sows were higher than those in Group EDP. The immunoglobulin levels in harvested milk from artificial lactating sows did not differ between the EB-treated groups. In conclusion, multiple EB treatments prior to PGF2 alpha administration increased milk production in pseudopregnant sows but did not affect the efficiency of artificial lactation induction.

AB  - This study aimed to evaluate the use of green microalgae as a nutritional supplement for oocyte and embryo production in goats. Two experiments were performed on adult goats to obtain oo-cytes (EVO; n = 14) and in vivo embryos (IVD; n = 14). In both, the donors were divided into control (n = 7) and Chlorella (n = 7) groups. All goats received a base diet, and donors were orally supplemented with Chlorella pyrenoidosa (CH) in the Chlorella groups. For EVO, donors received 10 g CH for 14 days, and for IVD, 20 g CH was given for six days before embryo recovery. In EVO and IVD, food intake in the CH group was comparatively low, and it showed relatively high subcutaneous adipose deposition. In addition, the CH group exhibited an increase in triglyceride, cholesterol, and plasma glucose levels. In IVD, a significant increase in peripheral glutathione peroxidase levels was noticed. In EVO, the CH group showed relatively large follicular size and an increase in intrafollicular levels of triglycerides, glucose, and glutathione peroxidase. No differ-ences were observed in the oocyte collected, and CH oocytes showed a low intensity of Mito-Tracker fluorescence (MT). In IVD, the CH group had a high proportion of transferable embryos, and these structures exhibited high fluorescence intensities for MT and H2DCFDA probes. We concluded that under these conditions, CH did not enhance the quality of the recovered oocytes. However, a daily dose of 20 g CH improved the quality of embryos and stimulated their mito-chondrial functionality.

AB  - Accurate monitoring of the live weight of pigs provides important information about the health state, the daily gain, and the time point for marketing. However, manual weight determination is time-consuming and stressful for both stockman and pig. In order to overcome these problems, non-invasive weighing mechanisms have to be established. In this study, we present an approach for live weight determination based on convolutional neuronal networks applied solely on the depth images of pigs, without further feature extraction. Our data basis consists of >400 pigs, recorded at four weighing time points, ending up with a weight range between 20 and 133 kg. Training and testing on this data, we achieved a coefficient of determination R2 > 0.97. Our results reveal that providing solely the images and the related weight to the ConvNets is sufficient to reach an accurate weight prediction. Therefore, our study can be viewed as a preliminary work that confirms the ability of using a ConvNets for accurate weight determination at different life stages. With the aim of using them under usual housing conditions for pigs, we increase animal welfare by precise animal monitoring in the sense of precision livestock farming.

AB  - Inflammatory diseases of the intestinal tract in piglets severely impair the economic performance of pig farms. Pig milk exosomes can encapsulate miRNAs which can then enter the piglet intestine to play an immunomodulatory role. Previously, we comparatively analyzed and identified exosomal miRNAs in the colostrum and mature milk of Bamei and Landrace pigs, and we screened for ssc-miR-22-3p, which is associated with inflammation and immune response; however, the role played by ssc-miR-22-3p in the immune response in IPEC-J2 cells is not yet clear. In this study, we first constructed a pig intestinal inflammatory response model using Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and Polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid (Poly (I:C)), and we investigated the role of ssc-miR-22-3p targeting MAPK14 in the regulation of LPS and Poly (I:C)-induced inflammatory injury in IPEC-J2 cells by RT-qPCR, cell counting kit-8 (CCK-8), EdU staining, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) activity assay, and dual luciferase reporter gene assay. We successfully established LPS and Poly (I:C)-induced cell damage models in IPEC-J2 cells. The immune response of IPEC-J2 cells was stimulated by induction of IPEC-J2 cells at 10 mu g/mL LPS and 20 mu g/mL Poly (I:C) for 24 h. Overexpression of ssc-miR-22-3p decreased cytokine expression and promoted cell viability and proliferation. The functional enrichment analysis revealed that ssc-miR-22-3p targets genes enriched in the pathways of negative regulation of inflammatory response and bacterial invasion of epithelial cells. The validity of the binding site of ssc-miR-22-3p to MAPK14 was tested by a dual luciferase reporter gene. Pig milk exosome ssc-miR-22-3p promotes cell viability and proliferation by targeting MAPK14, and it alleviates LPS and Poly (I:C)-induced inflammatory responses in IPEC-J2 cells.

AB  - When collecting marker-based motion capture data from clinical populations, speed of collection and comfort for the participant is a priority. This could be achieved by attaching markers to motion capture Velcro suits, as opposed to the skin. This study aimed to ascertain the reliability of sagittal-plane gait parameters estimated using Plug-in Gait (PiG) and Conventional Gait Model 2 (CGM2) marker sets from data collected in Suited and Non-suited (markers placed onto skin) conditions. For ten participants, markers were placed based on PiG and CGM2 models and data captured during a 2-min treadmill walk. Trials were repeated in suited and non-suited conditions. PiG ankle flexion/extension measurements had poor/moderate reliability (Non-suited ICC = 0.531, Suited ICC = 0.435). CGM2 ankle flexion/extension measurements had good/excellent reliability (Non-suited ICC = 0.916, Suited ICC = 0.900). There were significant differences in minimal detectable change (MDC) between conditions at the ankle for PiG (Non-suited MDC = 2.32 degrees, Suited MDC = 18.90 degrees), but not for CGM2 (Non-suited MDC = 0.63 degrees, Suited MDC = 0.95 degrees). When using CGM2, knee (Non-suited ICC = 0.878, Suited ICC = 0.855) and hip (Non-suited ICC = 0.897, Suited ICC = 0.948) showed good/excellent reliability in both conditions. A motion capture suit is not a reliable solution when collecting joint angle data using the PiG model but is reliable enough to consider when using the CGM2 model.

AB  - Among the standard multi-phase multi-component phase-field (PF) methods, the Kim-Kim-Suzuki (KKS) method has the advantage of decoupling interfacial energy from bulk energy and solving concentration as the conserved variable. There are two approaches to numerically solving a KKS method: the global solution approach (GSA) solves all variables in a global system simultaneously, and the local solution approach (LSA) solves phase concentrations locally using a Newton solver. This work compares the performance of LSA and GSA for solving four KKS models of increasing complexity with the finite element method using the MOOSE framework. The solution accuracy, degrees of freedom (DOFs), memory usage, and computational efficiency are compared. We find that GSA and LSA generate similar solutions, with a maximum difference of only 0.34%. For each model, LSA has a lower number of DOFs, utilizes less memory, and less wall time. The savings of memory and wall time in LSA increase with increasing mesh density of the same model and are more pronounced in models with higher dimensionality and more nodes. However, GSA is easier to implement in existing codes and can better solve highly nonlinear systems by utilizing sophisticated solvers.

AB  - Thirty Merino rams were used to determine the effect of four management systems of rams on semen quality during the anoestrous season. Animals were divided into four groups: Artificial-Photoperiod group (AP; n = 8), which were isolated from females and exposed to artificial long days (16 hr/d) from 1 Feb to 15 Mar; Natural-Photoperiod (NP; n = 8), isolated from females and exposed to the natural photoperiod throughout the experiment; Oestrous-Ewe group (EE; n = 7), housed in a pen adjacent to another pen that housed three ewes in oestrus, and Anestric-Ewe group (AE; n = 7), housed adjacent to another pen that housed three ovariectomized ewes. From 20 Mar to the end of May (10 weeks), semen samples were collected weekly, and blood samples were collected to determine plasma testosterone concentrations. Mean plasma testosterone concentrations, ejaculate volume and reaction time were not affected either by treatment or week. There was a significant effect (p < .01) of ram treatment on sperm concentration, and both TM y PM, and their interaction, were significantly affected by group and week (p < .001). Rams exposed to ewes in oestrus presented the largest sperm concentration (p < .05) compared with the other three groups, although they had the lowest total and progressive motilities (p < .01). In conclusion, management strategy in spring affects semen quality of rams, with the presence of ewes in oestrus being the best plan to increase sperm concentration.

AB  - Mammals respond to amino acid (AA) deficiency by initiating an AA response pathway (AAR) that involves the activation of general control nonderepressible 2 (GCN2), phosphorylation of eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2 alpha (eIF2 alpha), and activation of transcription factor 4 (ATF4). In this study, the effects of protein (N) and/or phosphorus (P) restriction on the GCN2/eIF2 alpha/ATF4 pathway in the liver and the induction of fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21) in young goats were investigated. An N-reduced diet resulted in a decrease in circulating essential AA (EAA) and an increase in non-essential AA (NEAA), as well as an increase in hepatic mRNA expression of GCN2 and ATF4 and protein expression of GCN2. Dietary N restriction robustly increased both hepatic FGF21 mRNA expression and circulating FGF21 levels. Accordingly, numerous significant correlations demonstrated the effects of the AA profile on the AAR pathway and confirmed an association. Furthermore, activation of the AAR pathway depended on the sufficient availability of P. When dietary P was restricted, the GCN2/eIF2 alpha/ATF4 pathway was not initiated, and no increase in FGF21 was observed. These results illustrate how the AAR pathway responds to N- and/or P-reduced diets in ruminants, thus demonstrating the complexity of dietary component changes.

AB  - Juvenile quality has become a crucial factor for determining the commercial culture success of the lined sea -horse, Hippocampus erectus. There is an urgent need for developing techniques to improve the survival of the low -quality juveniles. The present study investigated the effects of green water and light intensity (200-500 lx and 700-1000 lx) on the survival and growth of low-quality juveniles of the lined seahorse over 35 days. Juveniles of H. erectus reared in green water had superior survival rate compared to the juveniles reared in clear water. Generally, the growth of juveniles in green water was also better than in the clear water. At light intensities of 200-500 lx, the survival rate of low-quality juveniles was significantly improved as well. Generally, the growth of juveniles under low light intensity was better than under high light intensity. Based on the findings of the present study, culturing low-quality juveniles of the lined seahorse in green water or under lower light intensities (200-500 lx) is recommended.

AB  - The nutritional components and protein quality of genetically modified maize expressing phytase gene (GM) were analyzed and evaluated in this study. The nutritional components were analyzed by Chinese national standard methods. The ileostomy Bama miniature pigs were utilized to analyze the true digestibility of protein and amino acids. The digestible indispensable amino acid score (DIAAS) was adopted to evaluate the protein quality of GM, its parental maize (PM) and commercial available maize Zhengdan 958 (ZD). Meanwhile, the widely used protein digestibility corrected amino acid score (PDCAAS) was also calculated and compared with DIAAS. The content of protein, fat, vitamins, and minerals of all the strains of maize are in the normal ranges of OECD and/or ILSI. The DIAAS of GM, PM, and ZD were 54.57, 31.75, and 33.91, respectively, and the first limiting amino acid for GM, PM, and ZD was lysine. In conclusion, the introduction of phyA2 gene in GM maize does not disturb the digestion of protein/amino acid, but has the ability to promote the digestion of amino acids.

AB  - The aim of this study was to identify genetic variants and pathways associated with the total number of piglets born and to investigate the potential negative consequences of the intensive selection for reproductive traits, particularly the formation of bumps on the legs of pigs. We used genome-wide association analysis and methods for identifying selection signatures. As a result, 47 SNPs were identified, localized in genes that play a significant role during sow pregnancy. These genes are involved in follicle growth and development (SGC), early embryonic development (CCDC3, LRRC8C, LRFN3, TNFRSF19), endometrial receptivity and implantation (NEBL), placentation, and embryonic development (ESRRG, GHRHR, TUSC3, NBAS). Several genes are associated with disorders of the nervous system and brain development (BCL11B, CDNF, ULK4, CC2D2A, KCNK2). Additionally, six SNPs are associated with the formation of bumps on the legs of pigs. These variants include intronic variants in the CCDC3, ULK4, and MINDY4 genes, as well as intergenic variants, regulatory region variants, and variants in the exons of non-coding transcripts. The results suggest important biological pathways and genetic variants associated with sow fertility and highlight the potential negative impacts on the health and physical condition of pigs.

AB  - Lab animals, such as Guinea pigs (Cavia porcellus), are crucial for scientific development, as they play an important role in the development and quality control chain of vaccines and drugs distributed by the Brazilian public health system. Investigating their biological and physiological parameters is fundamental to raise and keep these animals, so the handling of the facilities that hold them can be updated whenever new information comes up, with the well-being of the animals and alignment with the 3 Rs in mind. In the search for understanding reproductive aspects of Guinea pigs, the present study had the main goal of studying puberty by means of estrous cycle analysis in short-haired Guinea pigs. Guinea pigs have a vaginal occlusive membrane that covers the vaginal orifice. Its rupture takes place gradually and naturally, moments before labor and during estrus. The present study followed 42 females as for the presentation of the vaginal occlusive membrane. Once the membranes ruptured spontaneously, a swab was collected to study vaginal cytology. Membrane rupture was observed in 39 females; six females showed membrane rupture with less than 21 days of age (17 to 21 days). Twenty-three females were characterized as being in estrus due to cytology showing a prevalence of anucleated superficial cells. One of these females was younger than 21 days old. The opening of the vaginal occlusive membrane took place most frequently in intervals between 17 and 18 days, and the membrane remained open between one and three consecutive days. It was possible to follow three cycles of membrane opening on six females. The present study showed the need to adapt handling guidelines for C. porcellus kept in research animal facilities. The early age of puberty imposes the need of separate the female daughters from their fathers at 16 days old.

AB  - Recent years have provided more and more evidence confirming the important role of Wnt/beta-catenin signaling in the pathophysiology of mental illnesses, including cocaine use disorder. High relapse rates, which is a hallmark of drug addiction, prompt the study of changes in Wnt signaling elements (Wnt5a, Wnt7b, and Ctnnb1) in the motivational aspects of cocaine use and early drug-free period (3 days after the last exposure to cocaine). For this purpose, an animal model of intravenous cocaine self-administration and two types of drug-free period (extinction training and abstinence in the home cage) were used. The studies showed that chronic cocaine self-administration mainly disturbs the expression of Wnt5a and Ctnnb1 (the gene encoding beta-catenin) in the examined brain structures (striatum and hippocampus), and the examined types of early abstinence are characterized by a different pattern of changes in the expression of these genes. At the same time, in cocaine self-administrated animals, there were no changes in the level of Wnt5a and beta-catenin proteins at the tested time points. Moreover, exposure to cocaine induces a significant reduction in the striatal and hippocampal expression of miR-374 and miR-544, which can regulate Wnt5a levels post-transcriptionally. In summary, previous observations from experimenter-administered cocaine have not been fully validated in the cocaine self-administration model. Yoked cocaine administration appears to disrupt Wnt signaling more than cocaine self-administration. The condition of the cocaine-free period, the routes of drug administration, and the motivational aspect of drug administration play an important role in the type of drug-induced molecular changes observed. Furthermore, in-depth research involving additional brain regions is needed to determine the exact role of Wnt signaling in short-term and long-lasting plasticity as well as in the motivational aspects of cocaine use, and thus to assess its potential as a target for new drug therapy for cocaine use disorder.

AB  - The levels of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH) dehydrogenase [ubiquinone] iron-sulfur protein 2 (NDUFS2, a subunit of NADH dehydrogenase) decrease in aged tissues, and these reductions may be partly associated with age-related conditions such as Parkinson's disease. Aging leads to many mitochondrial defects, such as biogenesis disruption, dysfunction, defects in the mitochondrial membrane potential, and production of reactive oxygen species, that may be highly related to NDUFS2 expression. The relationship between NDUFS2 and postovulatory oocyte aging in pigs remains unknown. In this study, we investigated changes in NDUFS2 expression during postovulatory aging (POA). Furthermore, NDUFS2 was knocked down via dsRNA microinjection at the MII stage to evaluate the effects on mitochondrial-related processes during POA. The mRNA expression of NDUFS2 decreased significantly after 48-h aging compared with that in fresh oocytes. NDUFS2 knockdown (KD) significantly impaired the maintenance of oocyte morphology and blastocyst development of embryos after POA. The levels of PGC1 alpha (mitochondrial biogenesis-related proteins) decreased significantly after NDUFS2 KD, while the level of GSNOR, a protein denitrosylase, was reduced by NDUFS2 KD after 48 h of aging. These data suggest that NDUFS2 is vital for maintaining the oocyte quality during POA in pigs.

AB  - Bioactive triterpenes feature complex fused-ring structures, primarily shaped by the first-committed enzyme, 2,3-oxidosqualene cyclases (OSCs) in plant triterpene biosynthesis. Triterpenes with B,C-ring-opened skeletons are extremely rare with unknown formation mechanisms, harbouring unchartered chemistry and biology.Here, through mining the genome of Chenopodium quinoa followed by functional characterization, we identified a stress-responsive and neofunctionalized OSC capable of generating B,C-ring-opened triterpenes, including camelliol A and B and the novel (-)-quinoxide A as wax components of the specialized epidermal bladder cells, namely the quinoxide synthase (CqQS).Protein structure analysis followed by site-directed mutagenesis identified key variable amino acid sites underlying functional interconversion between pentacyclic beta-amyrin synthase (CqbAS1) and B,C-ring-opened triterpene synthase CqQS. Mutation of one key residue (N612K) in even evolutionarily distant Arabidopsis beta-amyrin synthase could generate quinoxides, indicating a conserved mechanism for B,C-ring-opened triterpene formation in plants. Quantum computation combined with docking experiments further suggests that conformations of conserved W613 and F413 of CqQS might be key to selectively stabilizing intermediate carbocations towards B,C-ring-opened triterpene formation.Our findings shed light on quinoa triterpene skeletal diversity and mechanisms underlying B,C-ring-opened triterpene biosynthesis, opening avenues towards accessing their chemistry and biology and paving the way for quinoa trait engineering and quality improvement.

AB  - Depression is a common psychiatric disorder affecting around 300 million people worldwide. Serum cortisol and glucocorticoid levels in humans are reportedly higher in patients with depression compared to controls. Furthermore, rodents repeatedly treated with exogenous corticosterone (CORT), a glucocorticoid in rodents, exhibit deficits in emotional behaviors. To confirm the availability of mice with chronic CORT treatment as an animal model of depression, we investigated the effect of chronic CORT treatment on depression-like behavioral and neuropathological phenotypes in C57BL/6N male mice. Behavioral studies showed depression-and anxiety-like behaviors in mice treated with CORT compared with control mice in the forced-swim and elevated-plus maze tests. Additionally, treated mice represented anhedonia and social behavior impairments in the sucrose prefer-ence and social interaction tests, respectively. Brains of depression patients have altered expression of reelin, an extracellular matrix protein involved in neuronal development and function. Likewise, in the present study, mice with chronic CORT treatment also exhibited reelin downregulation in cells of the hippocampus. Hence, we investigated therapeutic effects of reelin supplementation on CORT-induced behavioral abnormalities in mice. Microinjections of recombinant reelin protein into the hippocampus did not rescue behavioral deficits in mice with chronic CORT treatment. These results suggest that C57BL/6N male mice chronically treated with CORT are a suitable animal depression model, in which depressive behaviors may occur independently of the alternation of hippocampal Reelin expression.

AB  - Theta oscillations support memory formation, but their exact contribution to the communication between prefrontal cortex (PFC) and the hippocampus is unknown. We tested the functional relevance of theta oscillations as a communication link between both areas for memory formation using transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS). Healthy, young participants learned two lists of Dutch-German word pairs and retrieved them immediately and with a 30-min delay. In the encoding group (N = 30), tACS was applied during the encoding of list 1. List 2 was used to test stimulation aftereffects. In the retrieval group (N = 23), we stimulated during the delayed recall. In both groups, we applied tACS bilaterally at prefrontal and tempo-parietal sites, using either individualized theta frequency or 15 Hz (as control), according to a within-subject design. Stimulation with theta-tACS did not alter overall learning performance. An exploratory analysis revealed that immediate recall improved when word-pairs were learned after theta-tACS (list 2). Applying theta-tACS during retrieval had detrimental effects on memory. No changes in the power of the respective frequency bands were observed. Our results do not support the notion that impacting the communication between PFC and the hippocampus during a task by bilateral tACS improves memory. However, we do find evidence that direct stimulation had a trend for negatively interfering effects during immediate and delayed recall. Hints for beneficial effects on memory only occurred with aftereffects of the stimulation. Future studies need to further examine the effects during and after stimulation on memory formation.

AB  - While swimming exercise has been shown to positively affect the development of the nervous system, it still remains unclear whether it reduces the vulnerability to stress. In this study, male C57BL/6 mice were exposed to swimming training for 5 weeks, and then subjected to chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS) for 4 weeks. We found that swimming exercise prevented anxiety-like and depressive phenotypes induced by CUMS, including increased anxiety-like behavior in the open field test (OFT) and elevated plus-maze (EPM) test and increased despair behavior in the tail suspension test (TST). Moreover, the control+stress group showed reduced expression of phosphorylated AKT kinase (p-AKT), phosphorylated glycogen synthase kinase-313 (p-GSK313), and tubulin-tyrosine ligase (Tyr-tubulin) and increased protein expression of phosphorylated collapsin response mediator protein 2 (p-CRMP-2); the control+control, swim+control, and swim+stress groups exhibited higher expression of these proteins than the control+stress group. This study confirmed that swimming exercise could reduce the vulnerability of individuals to stress and that it contributes to the AKT/GSK-313/CRMP-2 pathway and microtubule dynamics mediated protective effects on neuroplasticity. The AKT/GSK-313/CRMP-2 pathway and microtubule dynamics may be involved in resilience to stress.

AB  - The vascular arrangement of fern and fern-allies has been a source of great fascination for botanists since the nineteenth century to modern times. The study of stipe anatomy has been accepted to be of great taxonomical value and the patterns of organization and vasculature in ferns is a great point for comparative study. The morpho-anatomical traits of fern stipes provide essential insights into fern systematics and phylogenetics. This study explores the morpho-anatomy of stipes in 24 species of Pteridaceae span under four subfamilies, Pteridoideae, Vittarioideae, Cryptogrammoideae, and Cheilanthoideae, collected from the eastern Himalayan region. The morphological traits such as stipe length, colour, surface texture, and scale characteristics were systematically examined. Concurrently, anatomical investigations revealed variations in stipe outlines, vascular bundle shapes, and xylem strand configurations. The study highlights significant interspecific variability, with vascular bundle ranging from U to inverted Omega shaped, and xylem strands adopting diverse morphologies such as V, U, and hippocampus-shaped configurations. These anatomical traits show potential taxonomic and phylogenetic value, aiding in species delineation, particularly in cases where morphological features overlap due to convergent evolution. Additionally, the study confirms the presence of consistent sclerenchymatous epidermal layers across species, reinforcing the adaptive role of these structures in their ecological niches. The findings emphasize the importance of stipe anatomy as a reliable tool for taxonomic delineation, enhancing the understanding of evolutionary relationships within Pteridaceae.

AB  - Background Depression is one of the most common mental illnesses worldwide. Nitric oxide (NO) is involved in the pathophysiology of depression. Auraptene (a coumarin derivative) has been shown to possess pharmacological effects on neurological diseases. Purpose The present study aimed to investigate the possible role of the NO pathway in Auraptene antidepressant effects in male mice. Methods Behavioral tests were used to assess depression-like behaviors. The mice received Auraptene at 10, 30, and 100 mg/kg, the combination of the sub-effective (ineffective) dose of Auraptene (10 mg/kg) and L-NAME, and the combination of the effective dose of Auraptene (30 mg/kg) and L-arginine. Finally, OFT, TST, FST, brain, serum MDA level, antioxidant capacity, hippocampus, and serum NO level were measured. Results The data analysis showed that Auraptene (30 mg/kg) improved depression-like behaviors. Auraptene (30 mg/kg) also significantly reduced serum NO levels (P < 0.05) and significantly increased serum MDA (10 mg/kg, P < 0.05). Auraptene at 30 mg/kg also increased serum antioxidant capacity (P < 0.01). Co-administration of L-NAME and the sub-effective dose of Auraptene enhanced the effects of Auraptene. However, co-administration of the effective dose of Auraptene and L-arginine reduced the impacts of Auraptene. Conclusions The results showed that Auraptene causes antidepressant effects in a dose-dependent manner and acts as a prooxidant at 100 mg/kg, and exacerbates oxidative stress. The antidepressant effects of this active molecule are exerted by reducing the NO level in the hippocampus and serum, increasing the antioxidant capacity, and reducing the MDA level in the serum.

AB  - Leucine-rich repeat receptor-like kinases (LRR-RLKs) have emerged as key regulators of herbivory perception and subsequent defense initiation. While their functions in grass plants have been gradually elucidated, the roles of herbivory-related LRR-RLKs in woody plants remain largely unknown. In this study, we mined the genomic and transcriptomic data of tea plants (Camellia sinensis) and identified a total of 307 CsLRR-RLK members. Phylogenetic analysis grouped these CsLRR-RLKs into 14 subgroups along with their Arabidopsis homologs. Gene structure and conserved domain analyses revealed notable similarities among subgroup members. Among the identified CsLRR-RLKs, we focused on two plasma membrane-localized LRR-RLKs, CsLRR-RLK44, and CsLRR-RLK239, which do not form homodimers or heterodimers with each other. Both respond strongly to herbivory, and their expression patterns significantly correlate with herbivore resistance phenotypes across different tea accessions. CsLRR-RLK44 and CsLRR-RLK239 act upstream of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MPK) cascades and modulate the expression of defense-related MPKs and WRKY transcription factors. Additionally, silencing CsLRR-RLK44 or CsLRR-RLK239 reduced the levels of herbivory-induced jasmonates, thereby weakening the plant resistance to tea geometrid larvae (Ectropis obliqua). Our work is the first to demonstrate that in woody plants, LRR-RLKs are essential for enhancing herbivore resistance through the activation of the canonical signaling, including MPKs, WRKYs, and jasmonates. Furthermore, our study extends mechanistic insights into how LRR-RLKs initiate plant defenses from grasses to economically important tree species.

AB  - The Carpathian Basin witnessed several migration events throughout its history. The plains between the Danube and Tisza Rivers, and those stretching east from the Tisza gave home to groups under the umbrella demonym 'Sarmatian' from as early as the first century AD. It has been hypothesised that the subsistence strategy of these populations was influenced by their traditions and the knowledge of the conquered indigenous peoples. This paper presents the archaeobotanical and the archaeozoological results of a fourth-fifth century Sarmatian settlement, and delineates a complex view of its subsistence strategies. The results show that the main vegetable pillar of subsistence was cereals. However, cereal consumption did not seem to be uniform across Sarmatian sites, with differences in the cereal crops identified. The appearance of grapevine might be considered as evidence of Roman influences. Despite the diverse environmental setting, gathered wild plants were not a significant part of everyday diet. The local subsistence strategy was also characterised by the dominance of cattle, followed by other small ruminants and pigs. The presence of wild terrestrial and aquatic species - collected or hunted - in the close proximity of the village could also be proved, suggesting intensive exploitation of the quite diverse environment.

AB  - For centuries, various species from the genus Cirsium have been utilized in traditional medicine worldwide. A number of ethnopharmacological reports have pointed out that Cirsium plants can be applied to diminish digestive problems. Among them, Cirsium palustre (L.) Scop. (Asteraceae) stands out as a promising herbal drug candidate because its constituents exhibit antimicrobial and antioxidant potential, as evidenced by ethnopharmacological reports. As a result, the species is particularly intriguing as an adjunctive therapy for functional gastrointestinal and motility disorders. Our research goal was to verify how the extracts, fractions, and main flavonoids of C. palustre affect colon contractility under ex vivo conditions. An alternative model with porcine-isolated colon specimens was used to identify the effects of C. palustre preparations and their primary flavonoids. LC-ESI-MS was utilized to evaluate the impacts of methanol (CP1), methanolic 50% (CP2), and aqueous (CP3) extracts as well as diethyl ether (CP4), ethyl acetate (CP5), and n-butanol (CP6) fractions. Additionally, the impacts of four flavonoids, apigenin (API), luteolin (LUT), apigenin 7-O-glucuronide (A7GLC), and chrysoeriol (CHRY), on spontaneous and acetylcholine-induced motility were assessed under isometric conditions. The results showed that C. palustre extracts, fractions, and their flavonoids exhibit potent motility-regulating effects on colonic smooth muscle. The motility-regulating effect was observed on spontaneous and acetylcholine-induced contractility. All extracts and fractions exhibited an enhancement of the spontaneous contractility of colonic smooth muscle. For acetylcholine-induced activity, CP1, CP2, and CP4 caused a spasmolytic effect, and CP5 and CP6 had a spasmodic effect. LUT and CHRY showed a spasmolytic effect in the case of spontaneous and acetylcholine-induced activity. In contrast, API and A7GLC showed a contractile effect in the case of spontaneous and pharmacologically induced activity. Considering the results obtained from the study, C. palustre could potentially provide benefits in the treatment of functional gastrointestinal disorders characterized by hypomotility and hypermotility.

AB  - The red panda (Ailurus), a rare and endangered mammal native to the Himalayan-Hengduan Mountains, has a specialized bamboo diet. Combining morphological and genomic evidence, red pandas have been classified as Ailurus fulgens and Ailurus styani. However, previous studies focused on ecological aspects such as foraging behaviors, habitat use and threats within specific distributions; hence, there is still a gap in quantitative comparative studies on the trophic niches of these two species. In this study, we calculated and compared the isotopic trophic niche widths of A. styani and A. fulgens by measuring carbon and nitrogen stable isotopes in hair keratin of 102 red pandas, then conducting a fecal analysis to explore the diet of a population. The results showed that (1) there was no significant difference in delta 13C values between A. styani (-24.73 +/- 1.26 parts per thousand, N = 86) and A. fulgens (-24.43 +/- 1.20 parts per thousand, N = 16); however, A. styani had 1.4 parts per thousand higher average delta 15N value than that of A. fulgens, and the isotopic niche widths converted by Bayesian ellipse model were A. styani SEAC = 4.40 parts per thousand 2, A. fulgens SEAC = 4.70 parts per thousand 2, which might be caused by their lower and narrower altitude distribution. (2) Niche widths of three genetic populations in A. styani were XXL-LS (5.16 parts per thousand 2), EH-GLG (3.40 parts per thousand 2), QL (2.31 parts per thousand 2), and the comparison of the fecal composition suggested their diet diversity, which might imply a degree of competitive pressure with sympatric animals. (3) Sichuan red pandas occupied a lower trophic position compared to other herbivores but higher than giant pandas in the same ecosystem, and the niche width of red pandas was two times larger than that of sympatric giant pandas, which was related to the foraging strategies and microhabitat selection of the giant and red panda. This research provides basic stable isotopic data for red pandas, offers scientific support for the differentiated and refined conservation and management of the red panda and its habitat, and develops the application of stable isotope analysis in the ecological studies of endangered species.

AB  - Calcium signalling plays a fundamental role in fungal intracellular signalling. Previous approaches (fluorescent dyes, bioluminescent aequorin, genetically encoded cameleon probes) with imaging rapid subcellular changes in cytosolic free calcium ([Ca2+]c) in fungal cells have produced inconsistent results. Recent data obtained with new fluorescent, genetically encoded GCaMP probes, that are very bright, have resolved this problem. Here, exposing conidia or conidial germlings to high external Ca2+, as an example of an external stressor, induced very dramatic, rapid and dynamic [Ca2+]c changes with localized [Ca2+]c transients and waves. Considerable heterogeneity in the timing of Ca2+ responses of different spores/germlings within the cell population was observed.

AB  - Simple Summary: Bacterial endosymbionts play important roles in the life history of herbivorous insects, including supplying nutrients allowing exploitation of unbalanced diets, increasing the survivorship and fecundity of hosts, protecting hosts against entomopathogenic fungi and parasitoid wasps, ameliorating the detrimental effects of heat, and broadening the range of suitable food plants. The important function of bacterial endosymbionts is that they can manipulate the reproduction of their hosts. However, all functions of endosymbionts must rely on vertical transmission to spread within the population, such as Wolbachia, Rickettsia, and Cardinium. So, we studied the spatial and temporal distribution of Wolbachia and Rickettsia in Asia II 1 Bemisia tabaci. The results showed that the titers of Wolbachia and Rickettsia in the 3-120 h old eggs changed in a "w" pattern, and the location of Wolbachia and Rickettsia in the egg changed from egg stalk to egg base, and then from the egg base to egg posterior, and finally back to the middle of egg in a Rickettsia and Wolbachia coinfected whitefly host. Our study helps to explain the vertical transmission mechanism of bacterial endosymbionts and the distribution of bacterial endosymbionts in different tissues in the host.
   Wolbachia and Rickettsia are bacterial endosymbionts that can induce a number of reproductive abnormalities in their arthropod hosts. We screened and established the co-infection of Wolbachia and Rickettsia in Bemisia tabaci and compared the spatial and temporal distribution of Wolbachia and Rickettsia in eggs (3-120 h after spawning), nymphs, and adults of B. tabaci by qPCR quantification and fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH). The results show that the titer of Wolbachia and Rickettsia in the 3-120 h old eggs showed a "w" patterned fluctuation, while the titers of Wolbachia and Rickettsia had a "descending-ascending descending-ascending" change process. The titers of Rickettsia and Wolbachia nymphal and the adult life stages of Asia II1 B. tabaci generally increased with the development of whiteflies. However, the location of Wolbachia and Rickettsia in the egg changed from egg stalk to egg base, and then from egg base to egg posterior, and finally back to the middle of the egg. These results will provide basic information on the quantity and localization of Wolbachia and Rickettsia within different life stages of B. tabaci. These findings help to understand the dynamics of the vertical transmission of symbiotic bacteria.

AB  - The multicapsid nucleopolyhedrovirus of Lymantria dispar (Lepidoptera: Lymantriidae) (LdMNPV) is a baculovirus capable of causing viral epizootics. LdMNPV must disintegrate in the alkaline midgut, releasing virions that pass through the peritrophic matrix and infect midgut columnar cells. Ingested material has the potential to influence early stages of infection. Host plant induced resistence lead to the increase of phenolic acid and may influence the activity of LdMNPV. In order to evaluate the lethal and sublethal effects of phenolic acids on the spongy moth larvae infected with LdMNPV, artificial diets containing or not containing chlorogenic acid (CH), tannic acid (TA), salicylic acid (SA) and syringic acid (SY) were used to rear the spongy moth larvae inoculated with 92 OBs/mu L LdMNPV. The results turned out the lethal effect caused by SYV (SY + LdMNPV) was high. SY played a synergistic effect on LdMNPV against spongy moth larvae assessed by CTF (co-toxicity factor). SA and TA showed an antagonistic effect and CH showed additive effects. Larvae treated by CH, CHV, TA or TAV suffered long duration of the 3rd and the 4th instar and no one survive to the 5th instar stage, inferring that CH and TA inhibited the development of spongy moth larvae. SY, SA, SYV and SAV caused remarkable sublethal effect on spongy moth survivor. Fecundity of the survivor decresed and egg hatching rates were significantly reduced. The hatching rate of SYV was only 46.4 %, about half of CK. Assessing from both the lethal and sublethal effect, SY may be a potential synergist of LdMNPV against spongy moth larvae, improving prevention and control effectiveness of LdMNPV in spongy moth management.

AB  - Simple Summary Allium mongolicum Regel, a typical herb of the Allium family, is rich in a variety of active ingredients, such as flavonoids, essential oils, and polysaccharides. Our previous studies have reported that the dietary supplementation of lambs' diets with flavonoids from A. mongolicum Regel could promote growth performance and improve the meat quality and mutton flavor of lambs. However, the flavonoid extraction process is complicated, time-consuming, and costly, making it difficult to apply in practical production. A. mongolicum Regel ethanol extract (AME) is easier to obtain and less expensive than flavonoids. AME also contains many bioactive compounds. In the present study, we investigated the effects of AME on the serum index and muscle physicochemical characteristics, as well as the amino acid and fatty acid composition in Small-tailed Han sheep. The results indicated that AME could regulate lipid metabolism and promote the deposition of free amino acids and unsaturated fatty acids in the longissimus dorsi muscle of lambs. These findings suggested that AME could be used instead of flavonoids to improve the body health and meat quality of lambs in practical production. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of Allium mongolicum Regel ethanol extract (AME) on the serum index and meat quality of lambs. A total of 30 male Small-tailed Han sheep (3 months old) with an average weight of 33.60 +/- 1.23 kg were divided randomly into one of two groups: the control group (CON) was offered a basal diet, and the AME group was offered a basal diet with supplementation 2.8 g center dot lamb(-1)center dot day(-1) AME. The trial lasted for 75 days. AME supplementation significantly decreased the concentration of triglyceride and total cholesterol (p < 0.05), and tended to lower the concentration of non-esterified fatty acids (0.05 < p < 0.1), but significantly increased the concentration of high-density lipoprotein, leptin, and insulin (p < 0.05) in the serum of lambs. AME also decreased cooking losses and shear force and increased the content of intramuscular fat in the longissimus dorsi (LD) muscle of lambs (p < 0.05). In addition, there was no difference in the composition of hydrolyzed protein amino acids in the LD muscle among treatments (p > 0.05). However, AME changed the composition of free amino acids and promoted MUFA and PUFA deposition in the LD muscle of the lambs. These findings indicate that a diet supplemented with AME may improve the lipid metabolic capacity and meat quality of lambs.

AB  - Dietary supplementation with a multi-species direct-fed microbial (DFM) (Bacillus subtilis and cell wall-deficient (L-form) Lactobacillus spp.) for multiparous sows at 21 days of gestation (G 21) to lactation (L 21) enhanced reproduction, farrowing, and litter performance and nutrient digestion. Better litter size, weight at weaning, pre-weaning mortality (PWM), colostrum immunoglobulin G (IgG), milk protein, and lactose were linearly improved, while the parity affected pigs born from DFM-fed sows with extended longevity. There was a synergistic interaction in the fifth parity of DFM sows which had the highest litter weight (LW) at weaning. Moreover, contrast results may help forecast future productivity. The experiment was conducted to determine the interaction effects of parity and DFM supplementation from early gestation (G 21) to lactation (L 21) on reproductive performance, apparent total tract digestibility (ATTD), colostrum IgA and IgG, and mature milk composition. Three hundred pregnant sows were blocked by parity (2, 3, 4, 5, and 6-9) and randomly assigned to two experimental diets in a randomized complete block design, with a control (CON, n = 150) group and direct-fed microbial (DFM, n = 150) group. The DFM contained 5 x 10(7) cfu/g of Bacillus subtilis and 2 x 10(6) cfu/g of Lactobacillus spp. Reproductive traits recorded included total born (TB), born alive (BA), litter weight (LW), piglets born dead (PBD) weaning weight (WW), number of weaning pig (NWP), and PWM. Two separate 14 d ATTD trials were conducted on G86 to G100 and L7 to L21. Colostrum samples were collected at 0, 3, 6, 12, and 24 h post-partum and mature milks were collected at L7 and L14 for Ig and composition analysis, respectively. Total Ig concentrations were measured by an ELISA. The interaction between diet and parity was found on LW, colostrum IgG, milk lactose, and protein (p < 0.05). Regardless of parity, sows fed DFM had greater reproductive performance with higher BA, LS, LW, and lower in PWM (p < 0.05). DFM also improved the ATTD of organic matter (OM), crude protein (CP), and ether extracts (EE) (p < 0.05) at G100 and gross energy (GE), CP, and EE (p < 0.05) at L21. Entire IgG and 3 h post-partum IgA in colostrum were higher in DFM than in the CON diet (p < 0.05). Parity effects were seen on NWP, LW, CP, and EE, colostrum Ig at 12 and 24 post-partum, milk protein, and lactose at L7 (p < 0.05). Moreover, the parity showed linear effect on TB, BA, LW, litter size (LS), WW, total PWM, the ATTD of OM and EE, colostrum IgG at 12 h and IgA at 12 and 24 h post-partum, milk fat at L7 and L21, and milk lactose at L14 (p < 0.05). Stepwise prediction for average colostrum IgG (mg/mL) by using nutrient digestibility = -112.97 + 0.706GE(%) + 0.518CP(%) + 0.267EE(%) (n = 267, R-2 = 0.38, RSD = 6.7, p < 0.001). In summary, supplementing dietary DFM during early gestation through weaning had positive effects on production, the lifetime of sows, and better nutrient utilization, resulting in better milk quality and better piglet growth.

AB  - In this study, a novel optical thermometer based on a phosphor-in-glass (PiG) composite was designed, incorporating 9 mol% Nd3+:Yb2W3O12 and 0.5 mol% Ho3+:Yb2W3O12 phosphors into a silicate glass matrix. Upon excitation at 980 nm, the 9 mol% Nd3+:Yb2W3O12 phosphor exhibited a thermal enhancement in the nearinfrared anti-Stokes emissions of Nd3+ with an increase in temperature, whereas the up-conversion luminescence of Ho3+ in the 0.5 mol% Ho3+:Yb2W3O12 phosphor decreased. Utilizing the luminescence intensity ratio of Nd3+ to Ho3+ (I720-920 nm/I520-580 nm), a maximal relative sensing sensitivity of approximately 4.86 %K-1 was achieved. Moreover, the glass matrix effectively prevented the invasion of water molecules, thereby mitigating the deleterious effects of the hygroscopicity of Yb2W3O12. This work provides useful information for developing novel high-performance ratiometric luminescence thermometers.

AB  - Simple Summary Simple Summary: Supplementation with rumen-protected choline (RPC) can reduce dietary metabolizable energy (ME) while maintaining optimum performance, thus contributing to reducing production costs by saving grain which is the primary source of energy in the diet. Previous papers have reported on the interaction effects of ME level and RPC supplementation on production outcomes in dairy cattle and growing goats. The objective of this study was to examine the effects of ME level and RPC supplementation on the growth performance, carcass characteristics, meat quality, serum energy, lipid, and protein profiles of Karayaka lambs. In conclusion, the supplementation of RPC at 0 and 5 g/kg did not affect lamb growth performance and carcass characteristics. Given the lack of significant improvements in performance metrics, RPC supplementation would not result in net cost savings. However, it may play a role in modulating nitrogen metabolism under different dietary energy conditions, as indicated by the significant reduction in serum urea-N levels. The results of the current study indicate that there is no benefit to be gained from the supplementation of RPC in the low-energy diet of fattening lambs.Abstract This study aimed to examine the effects of metabolizable energy (ME) level and rumen-protected choline (RPC) supplementation on the growth performance, carcass characteristics, meat quality, serum energy, lipid, and protein profiles of Karayaka lambs. Twenty-eight Karayaka lambs, with an initial body weight (BW) of 26.85 +/- 0.26 kg, were randomly assigned (2 x 2 factorial design) to one of four dietary treatments with two levels of ME (optimum: 2750 or low: 2500 kcal ME/kg dry matter) and two levels of RPC (0 or 4 g/d/lamb). Lambs of each group were housed in individual pens. The experiment lasted 66 d, with the first 10 d consisting of acclimation and the next 56 d of the formal experimental period. The data on BW, dietary matter intake (DMI), and serum glucose concentrations confirm that our model successfully induced low energy using 250 kcal/kg less energy than the optimum level. RPC supplementation did not significantly affect average daily DMI, total average daily gain (ADG), or feed conversion ratio (FCR) at any energy level. Additionally, there was no substantial effect on carcass characteristics, meat quality, serum lipids, energy metabolism indicators, and liver function parameters. There was also no interaction effect of RPC x ME on the parameters tested. However, at 56 d into the experiment, the interaction effect of RPC x ME on serum urea-N was highly significant, and RPC supplementation led to lower serum urea-N levels (p = 0.001). These results suggest that while RPC supplementation did not enhance overall performance and carcass characteristics in Karayaka lambs, it may play a role in modulating nitrogen metabolism, as indicated by the significant reduction in serum urea-N levels.

AB  - Introduction: Declining spatial working memory (WM) is an early hallmark of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Sleep disturbance exacerbates spatial WM and increases AD risk. The GABAergic system, crucial for sleep regulation, may mediate this link. We thus investigate the relationship between spatial WM and hippocampal GABAergic signaling during rapid eye movement sleep deprivation (REM-SD) in AD model mice. Methods: We assessed spatial and non-spatial WM, locomotor activity, and anxiety-like behavior in 6-month-old triple transgenic (3xTg) AD mice and wild-type (WT) controls, with and without REM-SD (5 days, 4 h/day). We then used immunofluorescence to quantify GABA(A)alpha 1, GABA(B)R1, GAD67, and GABA levels in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and hippocampus and analyze the correlations with behavioral outcomes. Results: REM-SD increased locomotor activity, reduced anxiety-like behavior, and improved non-spatial WM in 3xTg-AD mice. Conversely, REM-SD impaired spatial WM in WT mice, which was also demonstrated in 3xTg-AD mice. Increased hippocampal GABA levels are correlated with improved non-spatial WM in 3xTg+SD mice. In contrast, impaired spatial WM in WT+SD mice was associated with elevated hippocampal GABA and GABA(B)R1, decreased hippocampal GAD67, and reduced PFC GABA levels. Notably, spatial WM in 3xTg+SD and 3xTg control mice related to increased GABA(A)alpha 1 in the PFC and hippocampus and GAD67 in hippocampal CA1, along with decreased GABABR1 and GAD67 in the dentate gyrus. Conclusion: REM-SD-induced alterations in WM performance are linked to GABAergic signaling changes in the PFC and hippocampus, with distinct patterns in WT and 3xTg-AD mice. This study provides insight into AD pathologies and potential therapeutic targets for sleep-related cognitive impairments.

AB  - Sorghum (Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench) is an important crop originated in Africa that shows susceptibility to herbivores. In this study, we identified two sorghum genotypes with highly contrasting levels of stem damage caused by the caterpillars of Asian stem borer (Ostrinia furnacalis Guenee). Recombinant inbred lines (RILs) from genetic cross between resistant (BTx623) and susceptible (NOG) sorghum were used to perform a quantitative trait locus (QTL) analysis in the field. Two major QTLs responsible for higher NOG infestation by stem borer in three independent field seasons were detected on chromosomes 7 and 9, interestingly in positions that overlapped with two major QTLs for plant height. As plant height and stem borer damage were highly correlated, we propose that sorghum height-associated morphological or physiological traits could be important for stem borer establishment and/or damage in sorghum.

Sixty pregnant multiparous goats (G0), each with at least three parturitions, were assigned during the last trimester of pregnancy to either herbal methionine (H-MET-G0; 1% Optimethione (R); n = 30) or a control group (CTL-G0; n = 30). Only female offspring (G1 doelings) were studied (H-MET-G1:19; CTL-G1:25) from weaning (45 days old) to 10 months (first breeding). G1 doelings were weighed and monitored weekly for metabolites, IGF-1, insulin, and progesterone. Ovulation of the G1 doelings was induced using vasectomized bucks, followed by breeding with intact bucks. Postweaning growth, age at puberty (H-MET-G1:216 vs. CTL-G1:229 days), and live weight at puberty (H-MET-G1:20.5 vs. CTL-G1:21.0 kg) did not significantly differ (p > 0.05). Age at puberty and conception were negatively correlated with live weight (p < 0.001). First-cycle conception rates were 81% in CTL-G1 and 66% in H-MET-G1, with similar days to conception (p > 0.05). The number of pregnant doelings and the number of kids in utero did not significantly differ (p > 0.05) between treatments. Plasma IGF-1 and insulin levels were significantly higher (p < 0.001) in H-MET-G1 doelings, whereas plasma metabolites related to nutrition showed no differences between groups (p > 0.05). Prenatal herbal methionine supplementation had no carry-over effect on growth, puberty onset, or reproductive efficiency. Age at puberty and conception were negatively correlated with live weight and positively correlated with IGF-1 and insulin levels.

AB  - Propofol is a widely used general anesthetic, yet the understanding of its cellular effects is fragmentary. General anesthetics are not as innocuous as once believed and have a wide range of molecular targets that include kinesin motors. Propofol, ketamine, and etomidate reduce the distances that Kinesin-1 KIF5 and Kinesin-2 KIF3 travel along microtubules in vitro. These transport kinesins are highly expressed in the CNS, and their dysfunction leads to a range of human pathologies including neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative diseases. While in vitro data suggest that general anesthetics may disrupt kinesin transport in neurons, this hypothesis remains untested. Here we find that propofol treatment of hippocampal neurons decreased vesicle transport mediated by Kinesin-1 KIF5 and Kinesin-3 KIF1A similar to 25-60%. Propofol treatment delayed delivery of the KIF5 cargo NgCAM to the distal axon. Because KIF1A participates in axonal transport of presynaptic vesicles, we tested whether prolonged propofol treatment affects synaptic vesicle fusion mediated by VAMP2. The data show that propofol-induced transport delay causes a significant decrease in vesicle fusion in distal axons. These results are the first to link a propofol-induced delay in neuronal trafficking to a decrease in axonal vesicle fusion, which may alter physiological function during and after anesthesia.

AB  - Background/Objectives: This study investigated the effects of chestnut tannic acid (TA) on the growth performance, the expression of tight junction proteins and the composition of the gut microbiota of weaned piglets, which could provide novel insights into the application of TA in swine production. Methods: In a 42-day trial, 180 healthy, 21-day-old Duroc x Landrace x Yorkshire piglets were randomly assigned to a Control group and four treatment groups (TA1-4), fed commercial diets supplemented with 0, 0.06%, 0.12%, 0.18% or 0.24% TA. Each group had six replicates of six pigs each. Results: The average daily gain in all TA groups, the jejunal and ileal villus height and the villus height-to-crypt depth ratio in the TA3 and TA4 groups were markedly increased (p < 0.05). The mRNA levels of MUC2 and ZO-1 were upregulated in the TA3 group, as were those of MUC4 in the jejunum and ileum and claudin in the duodenum and ileum; glutathione peroxidase and total antioxidant capacity were upregulated in the duodenum and jejunum in the TA3 group, and total superoxide dismutase was increased in all the TA2 groups (p < 0.05). Conversely, the malondialdehyde significantly decreased in all the TA groups (p < 0.05). TA supplementation improved the alpha diversity of the intestinal microflora and augmented probiotic abundance while reducing that of pathogenic bacteria. The contents of acetic, isobutyric, valeric, isovaleric, hexanoic and propionic acids, as well as total short-chain fatty acids (SCFA), were higher in the TA2 and TA3 groups (p < 0.05). Conclusions: TA inclusion in piglet diets improved the intestinal environment by upregulating the antioxidant enzymes, improving intestinal morphology and promoting probiotic growth and SCFA production while reducing pathogenic bacterial abundance, consequently enhancing the gut barrier and the growth of weaned piglets.

AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by the accumulation of soluble amyloid-beta oligomers (A beta Os) in the brain, which disrupt synaptic function and promote cognitive decline. Here, we investigated the effects of A beta Os on excitatory and inhibitory synaptic transmission and plasticity by performing stereotaxic injections of A beta Os directly into the hippocampal CA1 region, followed by hippocampal slice isolation for electrophysiological measurements. A beta Os injections altered basal excitatory synaptic transmission, reducing field excitatory postsynaptic potentials (fEPSPs) and impairing excitatory long-term potentiation (LTP). Additionally, A beta Os injections significantly increased basal inhibitory synaptic transmission, as evidenced by the increased amplitude of field inhibitory postsynaptic potentials (fIPSPs), but impaired the induction and maintenance of inhibitory long-term potentiation (iLTP). Accordingly, we propose that A beta Os injections induce the saturation of the GABAergic system and thus disrupt the hippocampal excitatory-inhibitory balance. These findings highlight the dual impact of A beta Os on both excitatory and inhibitory synapses, generating synaptic dysregulation and possibly worsening cognitive decline in AD. Understanding these mechanisms could provide new insights for developing therapies to restore synaptic balance and hippocampal function in AD.

AB  - Parasitic nasal mites have been surveyed in a range of vertebrate hosts, but only two species of Rhinonyssidae have been described from procellariiform seabirds. We here describe Rhinonyssus nenecoi sp. nov., from Cape petrels, Daption capense (Procellariidae), collected in Rio Grande do Sul State, southern Brazil. The new species is morphologically most similar to R. procellaricus and R. pluvialis differing mainly by a strongly sclerotised podosomal shield with four pairs of setae, covering more than half of the idiosoma; a podosomal shield with a V-shaped posteromedial projection; an irregularly-shaped sternal shield; and a ventral opisthosoma with 3-4 pairs of setae.

AB  - Cardiac excitation-contraction coupling can be different between regions of the heart. Little is known at the atria level, specifically in different regions of the left atrium. This is important given the role of cardiac myocytes from the pulmonary vein sleeves, which are responsible for ectopic activity during atrial fibrillation. In this study, we present a new method to isolate atrial cardiac myocytes from four different regions of the left atrium of a large animal model, sheep, highly relevant to humans. Using collagenase/protease we obtained calcium-tolerant atrial cardiac myocytes from the epicardium, endocardium, free wall and pulmonary vein regions. Calcium transients were slower (time to peak and time to decay) in free wall and pulmonary vein myocytes compared to the epicardium and endocardium. This is associated with lower t-tubule density. Overall, these results suggest regional differences in calcium transient and t-tubule density across left atria, which may play a major role in the genesis of atrial fibrillation.

AB  - Phosphors-in-glass (PiGs) regarded as a promising phosphor-converter for white light emitting diodes (WLEDs) is being researched widely. However, there are few reports on the effect of changing the shape of PiGs on the color rendering index (CRI) and heat dissipation of WLEDs. In this paper, gel casting with Isobam was first attempted in preparing special-shaped PiGs successfully. It exhibited that 76 wt.% was the optimum solid content based on the rheological properties of slurry and the shrinkage of green bodies. The sintering rate should be kept at a low speed and glass transition temperature (Tg) of glass powders must be higher than sublimation temperatures (Ts) of APS and Isobam. The CRI of PiGs was increased by about 27% after changing the shape of PiGs from cylinder to dome. Most importantly, operating temperature also reduced effectively the increase of the surface area of PiGs. Therefore, changing the shape of PiGs by gel casting with Isobam is a creative way for high-power WLEDs lighting.

AB  - Astrocytes form an integral component of the neurovascular unit, ensheathing brain blood vessels with endfeet high in aquaporin-4 (AQP4) expression. These AQP4-rich endfeet facilitate interaction between the vascular endothelium, astrocytes, and neurons, and help stabilize vascular morphology. Studies using preclinical models of psychological stress and post-mortem tissue from patients with major depressive disorder (MDD) have reported reductions in AQP4, loss of astrocytic structures, and vascular impairment in the prefrontal cortex (PFC). Though compelling, the role of AQP4 in mediating stress-induced alterations in neurovascular function and behavior remains unclear. Here, we address this, alongside potential sex differences in chronic unpredictable stress (CUS) effects on astrocyte phenotype, blood-brain barrier integrity, and behavior. CUS led to more pronounced shifts in stress-coping behavior and working memory deficits in male- as compared to female mice. Following behavioral testing, astrocytes from the frontal cortex were isolated for gene expression analyses. We found that CUS increased transcripts associated with blood vessel maintenance in males, but either had no effect on- or decreased- these transcripts in females. Furthermore, CUS caused a reduction in vascular-localized AQP4 and elevated extravasation of a small fluorescent reporter (Dextran) in the PFC in males but not females. Studies showed that knockdown of AQP4 in the PFC is sufficient to disrupt astrocyte phenotype and increase behavioral susceptibility to a sub-chronic stressor in males yet has little effect on stress susceptibility in females. Our findings provide evidence that sex-specific alterations in astrocyte phenotype and neurovascular integrity in the PFC contribute to cognitive-behavioral consequences following stress.

AB  - Simple Summary Mineral deficiencies are very widespread among small ruminant herds throughout the world and play a big role in small ruminant herd health management. This paper describes the occurrence of a primary molybdenosis causing secondary copper deficiency, combined with ovine white liver disease (cobalt deficiency) and white muscle disease (selenium deficiency) in a group of pastured ram lambs in Northern Germany. To the authors' knowledge, this is the first proven report of multiple trace element deficiencies in sheep in Germany for decades. To the author's knowledge this paper describes the first proven report of a combined primary molybdenosis, secondary copper (Cu) deficiency, Ovine White Liver Disease-Cobalt (Co) deficiency, and selenium (Se) deficiency in a small pedigree herd of White Horned Heath sheep in Germany (8 ewes, 2 rams, 3 yearling ewes, 17 lambs) for decades. Clinical signs associated with these mineral deficiencies in a group of pastured ram lambs included emaciation, conjunctivitis, anaemia, growth retardation, discolouration of the wool and photodermatitis. Morbidities and mortalities arose in 4-6-month-old lambs despite intensive veterinary treatment in the summer of 2014 and 2015 (n = 13, 23% died). Se (3/5), Cu (4/7), and Co (3/3) deficiencies in combination with elevated values for Molybdenum (Mo, 2/2) were found. Hamburg is a large industrial city and an input of heavy metals from surrounding industries and coal-fired power stations in combination with a sandy, non-fertilised soil and monoculture grass species might offer a potential explanation for the severity of mineral deficiencies observed in this herd.

AB  - Ectoparasites are diverse organisms that exploit animal hosts using various strategies. One such group represents the louse flies (Hippoboscidae) from the subfamily Ornithomyinae, which are permanent, highly specialised, hematophagous ectoparasites of poultry and wild birds found worldwide. The main objective of this research is to examine the mean abundance, prevalence, and diver-sity of ornithophilic louse flies in Serbia. They have been detected through visual inspection or fumigation of caught birds. In total, 79 louse flies belonging to four genera and six species were collected from 62 individuals within 26 host species. A single louse fly infested the bulk of captured birds, while hippoboscid females were statistically dominant within the overall sample. Most detected louse flies belonged to the genus Ornithomya, with Ornithomya avicularia and Ornithomya fringillina being the most abundant at the species level. The prevalence was relatively low, along with the mean intensity and abundance. This study contributes to a better understanding of louse flies and their parasite-host associations in Serbia. It also fills a gap in the knowledge of their diversity and distribution in South-eastern Europe.

AB  - Seahorses and their relatives (syngnathids) exhibit remarkable diversity in morphology and function, characterized by their distinctive body shapes and specialized feeding mechanisms. Despite recent advances in uncovering the genetic basis of some traits, the genotype-phenotype map in syngnathids remains incomplete. In this study, we employed forward-genomic approaches and developed a method to enrich for human disease amino acid loci at a genomic scale. Our aim was to identify genetic loci associated with fin size reduction, tooth loss, and spinal curvature in syngnathids. Intriguingly, we identified a convergent amino acid change in the lat4a gene shared by syngnathids and some flying fishes, with in vitro analysis confirming its role in fin size evolution in both lineages. While genes critical for tooth development are conserved in syngnathids, the absence of key regulatory elements, such as pitx2, likely contributes to tooth loss. Additionally, we implicated col6a3 in spinal curvature development in seadragons. These findings reveal novel genetic signatures and developmental constraints underlying syngnathid diversity, demonstrating the utility of comparative genomics and targeted gene enrichment in exploring vertebrate evolution.

AB  - This study was designed to assess the suppressive effects of various anaerobically digested slurries (ADSs), and the microorganisms inhabiting them, against Fusarium wilt in spinach. We used five different ADSs from a range of source materials (dairy cow manure, sewage sludge, food garbage, pig manure, night soil sludge), combined in different proportions. All five raw ADSs suppressed the growth of Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. spinaciae (Fos) on agar plates using a co-culture test. In contrast, filtrate ADSs did not suppress the growth of Fos. In total, 32 bacterial strains were isolated from five ADSs, and eight isolates showed antagonistic activities against Fos. Based on 16S rDNA sequences, the strain AD-3 isolated from ADS from dairy cow manure belonged to Bacillus velezensis. Genome analysis revealed that AD-3 had two kinds of genes related to the production of the non-ribosomal lipopeptides, fengycin/plipastatin (pps genes), and surfactin (srf genes). In pot assays, inoculation of AD-3 (1.0 x 10(6) CFU.g(-1) dry soil) into Fos-infected soil (1.0 x 10(5) bud-cells.g(-1) dry soil) significantly reduced the severity of Fusarium wilt disease at 28 d after seedling. The percentage reductions in disease severity in two replicates were 64.3% and 44.3%, respectively. Thus, bacterial strain AD-3 could be applied to reduce Fusarium wilt in spinach.

AB  - Elephant Riding (ER) in zoos has become a matter of public interest, raising debates among experts regarding animal ethics, elephants' welfare, and human safety. Through the submission of the Middle Hypothesis that ER tends to enhance human knowledge about conservation, this study's aim is to provide strategies to help zoo managements in their works based on the basic principles of wildlife conservation and protection, especially Sumatran elephants. The participants' knowledge was measured using questionnaires distributed to two groups of respondents: people who have and people who have not utilized ER services. Meanwhile, the strategy was recommended through the Analytical Hierarchy Process of 17 expert respondents. According to the independent sample t-test performed with 95% confidence level, human knowledge of elephant conservation increased significantly through ER. Furthermore, experts with consistency ratios (CR) <= 0.1 selected a strategy where environmental quality was prioritized as a recommended strategy in ER management. This strategy is to put forward the principles guaranteeing the elephants' welfare, which has a criterion weight of 0.40717. The other recommended strategies include conducting conservation education (0.23973), ensuring the safety of visitors (0.22972), and improving the welfare of the community around zoo (0.12338).

AB  - Background: Myiasis is the infestation of humans or other animals with the larvae of flies that occurs in the tropical and subtropical regions, worldwide. The objectives of the present study were to evaluate knowledge, attitude, and practice of the population at risk about myiasis and to infer potential risk areas of human myiasis due to the environmental suitability for Oestrus ovis in the Ilam province of Iran.
   Methods: This study was conducted from April to June 2020 among the myiasis-infested shepherds in Ilam province. The data were collected by a questionnaire. Maximum Entropy (Maxent) niche modeling was used to predict the environmental suitability for O. ovis.
   Results: The level of awareness of the people of Ilam province on myiasis was generally good, while a small percentage of them had poor information about this disease (1.62%). Mean Diurnal range and isothermality revealed the highest and lowest share on the MaxEnt model, respectively. The elevation variable had the most permutation in the model for predicting the environmental suitability for O. ovis. The best ecological niches for this fly were in the northern parts of the study area.
   Conclusion: It can be concluded that due to background knowledge of the involved people in exposure to oral myiasis agent, O. ovis, conducting some preventive measures based on improving their knowledge, attitude, and practices could be useful for reducing the risk of the disease in the area. On the other hand, the suitable areas for the establishment of O. ovis which has been clarified with the model could be used for focusing on the preventive measures in the area.

AB  - Globally, human-wildlife conflict (HWC) is a burning issue, which the conservationists have attempted to address through various conservation strategies. One of the widely adopted strategies is the provision of compensation for the loss caused by wildlife. The existing mechanism of compensation in Nepal is time-consuming and insufficient. This study, therefore, attempts to assess the feasibility of a community-based insurance scheme (CBIS), which is expected to be time-efficient with no additional burden to farmers. The CBIS scheme is an insurance mechanism to be operated by a locally elected committee and provides compensation to the premium paying farmers only. The study was carried out in the Jhapa District of Nepal, one of the most affected districts by wild elephants. We conducted a household survey using a questionnaire for 509 respondents from the five most affected villages. We chose a choice experiment to determine the preferences of respondents for CBIS. Four activities including compensation for crop damage, and human casualties (serious injuries and death), and fence management were selected under the CBIS. The regression analysis revealed that only the compensation for crop damage was statistically significant. The estimated annual crop damage caused by elephants was worth USD 1.49 million. The estimated premium exceeded the expected insurance payout, indicating the suitability of the scheme. The estimated premium was USD 0.38 per hectare for a 1% increase in damage payout. The total annual premium would be USD 0.136 million for a 25% payment of the damage, while the expected annual insurance payout would be USD 77,788. The annual premium can be lower if the government allocates the budget for the CBIS, out of the existing relief distribution program. The engagement of local municipalities in the CBIS management can make the scheme more viable.

AB  - BackgroundThe pig is a promising donor candidate for xenotransplantation. Understanding the differences between human and swine immune systems is critical for addressing xenotransplant rejection and hematopoietic reconstitution. The gene transcriptional profile differences between human and pig immune cell subpopulations have not been studied. To assess the similarities and differences between pigs and humans at the levels of gene transcriptional profiles or cell subpopulations are important for better understanding the cross-species similarity of humans and pigs, and it would help establish the fundamental principles necessary to genetically engineer donor pigs and improve xenotransplantation.ObjectiveTo assess the gene transcriptional similarities and differences between pigs and humans.MethodsTwo pigs and two healthy humans' PBMCs were sorted for 10 x genomics single-cell sequence. We generated integrated human-pig scRNA-seq data from human and pig PBMCs and defined the overall gene expression landscape of pig peripheral blood immune cell subpopulations by updating the set of human-porcine homologous genes. The subsets of immune cells were detected by flow cytometry.ResultsThere were significantly less T cells, NK cells and monocytes but more B cells in pig peripheral blood than those in human peripheral blood. High oxidative phosphorylation, HIF-1, glycolysis, and lysosome-related gene expressions in pig CD14+ monocytes were observed, whereas pig CD14+ monocytes exhibited lower levels of cytokine receptors and JAK-STAT-related genes. Pig activated CD4+T cells decreased cell adhesion and inflammation, while enriched for migration and activation processes. Porcine GNLY+CD8+T cells reduced cytotoxicity and increased proliferation compared with human GNLY+CD8+T cells. Pig CD2+CD8+gamma delta T cells were functionally homologous to human CD2+CD4+ gamma delta T cells. Pig CD2-CD8-gamma delta T cells expressed genes with quiescent and precursor characteristics, while CD2-CD8+gamma delta T cells expressed migration and memory-related molecules. Pig CD24+ and CD5+B cells are associated with inflammatory responses.ConclusionOur research with integrated scRNA-seq assays identified the different distribution of pig immune cell subpopulations and the different transcriptional profiles of human and pig immune cells. This study enables a deeper understanding of the development and function of porcine immune cells.

AB  - Wildlife managers and the public have expressed considerable interest in the use of contraception to help manage the populations of wild horses and burros (Equus caballus and E. asinus). Field testing has shown that two preparations of the porcine zona pellucida (PZP) vaccine, a simple emulsion (ZonaStat-H) and PZP-22 (which supplements ZonaStat-H with a controlled-release component) effectively prevent pregnancy in individual mares and can substantially reduce population foaling rates. To determine whether some PZP preparations might have secondary effects that harm treated mares or their foals, we examined the effects of PZP-22 vaccinations and the follow-up boosters of either PZP-22 or ZonaStat-H on adult female body condition, foaling season, and foal mortality in two wild horse herds in the western USA, Cedar Mountains Herd Management Area, Utah (CM; 2008-2015), and Sand Wash Basin Herd Management Area, Colorado (SWB; 2008-2014). At both sites in every study year, summer body condition scores improved faster in mares without foals than mares with foals (p < 0.001; CM, n = 234; SWB, n = 172), but PZP treatments did not affect mare body condition apart from their contraceptive effects. Births to mares treated with PZP within the previous three years were delayed and spread out over the foaling season, but foal mortality rates through the first and second year were low, unrelated to date of birth, and virtually identical for the foals of PZP-treated and untreated mothers (all comparisons n.s.; CM, n = 775, SWB, n = 640). Thus, in these two populations, we found no evidence that changes in reproductive timing associated with PZP treatments were harmful to either mares or foals.

AB  - Simple Summary The dietary habits of animals that inhabit the same region can reveal valuable information about their food composition, nutritional strategies, and competition for resources. Analysis of their dietary habits can provide insight into differences in food consumption, thus identifying the potential overlap and competition for resources. In this study, we used DNA metabarcoding to investigate the winter dietary habits of Tibetan macaques and grey snub-nosed monkeys through an analysis of 40 fecal samples. The results showed that Tibetan macaques consumed plants from 117 families and 184 genera, while grey snub-nosed monkeys consumed plants from 109 families and 165 genera. The aim of the research was to assess the winter dietary habits of both monkey species living in the same area, to increase our knowledge of their food preferences and its composition, and to reveal the possible relationship between the overlap of their food niche and interspecific relations, providing useful information for the conservation of the resources in their natural habitat. Assessing the trophic niche and interspecific relationships between related species and determining how the species maintain differences in nutritional niches while coexisting in the same area are important topics in ecological research. Therefore, exploring the mechanism of food resource utilization, competition and coexistence among species distributed in the same region is important. In this study, we used fecal samples and metagenome sequencing technology to study the plant feeding habits and coexistence mechanisms of Tibetan macaques (Macaca thibetana) and grey snub-nosed monkeys (Rhinopithecus brelichi) within the same area. In the winter of 2020, we collected a total of 40 fecal samples from Tibetan macaques and grey snub-nosed monkeys; of those, 29 samples were considered valid and were analyzed using DNA metabarcoding. The results showed that in winter, Tibetan macaques consumed plants from 117 families and 184 genera, whereas grey snub-nosed monkeys consumed plants from 109 families and 165 genera. Diversity analysis revealed that there was a significant difference in the food composition of Tibetan macaques and grey snub-nosed monkeys. Tibetan macaques had a broader food niche width than grey snub-nosed monkeys at the family and genus levels. In winter, the food niches of Tibetan macaques and grey snub-nosed monkeys almost entirely overlapped (0.99). Our research provides detailed dietary data for Tibetan macaques and grey snub-nosed monkeys and valuable information that can aid in conservation efforts targeting these species.

AB  - Phytoprotease inhibitors (PI) are important defence compounds produced by plants against microbes and insect herbivory. Oryzacystatins (OCs) are a group of protease inhibitors from Oryza sativa L. that are specific against cysteine protease enzymes. This study revealed the evolutionary relationship of eleven different oryzacystatins from rice and their interaction with cysteine protease enzymes from brown planthopper (BPH) and striped stem borer (SSB). Three-dimensional structure of eleven different oryzacystatins and six cysteine protease enzymes were homologically modelled, and their interaction was analysed to explore the sequence heterogeneity, structural variability and functional significance. OC XI and OC V showed higher docking score and hydrogen bond interaction with all the six tested cysteine protease enzymes. N terminal glycine residue, central conserved QVVXG, C terminal AVVXXXPW regions are involved in interacting with the active site residue of protease enzymes. Substitution of N terminal glycine by any other residue in OC VI significantly reduced the interaction efficiency with cysteine proteases. In OC XI, glutamine in the fourth position of QVVXG showed higher interaction efficiency with all cysteine proteases than serine at the fourth amino acid position. N terminal glycine plays a vital role in OC XI for interacting with active sites of cysteine protease enzymes whereas, in the OC V central conserved region QVVSG and C terminal PW region plays a major part in the interaction. However, either N terminal or C terminal region along with the central conserved region of oryzacystatin is involved in mediating an efficient interaction with the active site residues of cysteine proteases. Molecular dynamic (MD) simulation study revealed the stability of the OC X1 - cathepsin O2 like and OC V - cathepsin F like complexes during a simulation for 20 ns. In silico results of the present study predict the potential of oryzacystatins interaction with cysteine protease enzymes of insects.

AB  - The application of manure (M) and straw (S) will increase the Olsen P and phosphorus activation coefficient (PAC) in soil. Clarifying the increasing trend of Olsen P and PAC is crucial for rational fertilization. This study fitted the equation between the accumulated P surplus, Olsen P, and PAC in four treatments for 28 years and analyzed the changes and rates of P fractions. The results showed Olsen P and PAC increase linearly with NPK and NPKS treatments; for every 100 kg ha(-1) of P surplus, Olsen P increased by 5.9 and 6.7 mg kg(-1), and PAC increased by 0.52% and 0.50%. With M and MNPK treatments, the sigmoid curve equation was the best fitting method. The equilibrium values were 167 and 164 mg kg(-1) for Olsen P, and 10.4 and 10.2 mg kg(-1) for PAC. There was a correlation between Al-P, Ca-2-P, Resin-P, NaOH-P-i, C/N, SOC, and pH, which had the highest interpretation rates for Olsen P and PAC. Manure is significantly better than straw in improving Olsen P in red soil. It is recommended to reduce the amount of manure applied for a long time to avoid a zero increase in Olsen P.

AB  - As the fifth most common cancer in the world, gastric cancer (GC) ranks as the third major cause of cancer-related death globally. Although surgical resection and chemotherapy still remains the mainstay of potentially curative treatment for GC, chemotherapy resistance and adverse side effects limit their clinical applications. Thus, further investigation of the mechanisms of carcinogenesis in GC and discovery of novel biomarkers is of great concern. We herein report that the elevated expression of GPR137 is correlated with GC. Overexpression of GPR137 potentiates human gastric cancer AGS cell malignancy, including proliferation, migration, invasion, colony formation and xenograft growth in nude mice in vivo, whereas knockout of GPR137 by CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing exerts the opposite effects. Mechanistically, GPR137 could bind to MST, the upstream kinases in Hippo pathway, which disrupts the association of MST with LATS, subsequently activating the transcriptional co-activators, YAP and TAZ, and thereby triggering the target transcription and the alterations in GC cell biological actions consequently. Therefore, our findings may provide with the evidence of developing a potentially novel treatment method with specific target for GC.

AB  - This study deals with the evaluation of the bioaccessibility and antioxidant properties of phenolic compounds from heat-treated skim goat-milk powder fortified with grape-pomace-seed extract, after in vitro gastrointestinal digestion. Ultra-high performance liquid chromatography coupled to diode array detection and mass spectrometry (UHPLC-DAD MS/MS) analysis confirmed the abundant presence of phenolic acids and flavan-3-ols in the grape-pomace-seed extract (SE) and heat-treated skim goat-milk/seed-extract powder (TME). After in vitro digestion of TME powder and recovery of total quantified phenolics, flavan-3-ols and phenolic acids were 18.11%, 24.54%, and 1.17%, respectively. Low recovery of grape-pomace-seed phenolics indicated strong milk protein-phenolic interactions. Electrophoretic analysis of a soluble fraction of digested heat-treated skim goat milk (TM) and TME samples showed the absence of bands originating from milk proteins, indicating their hydrolysis during in vitro gastrointestinal digestion. The digested TME sample had better antioxidant properties in comparison to the digested TM sample (except for the ferrous ion-chelating capacity, FCC), due to the presence of bioaccessible phenolics. Taking into account the contribution of the digestive cocktail, digested TME sample had lower values of total phenolic content (TPC), in vitro phosphomolybdenum reducing capacity (TAC) and ferric reducing power (FRP), compared to the undigested TME sample. These results could be attributed to low recovery of phenolic compounds. TME powder could be a good carrier of phenolics to the colon; thus, TME powder could be a promising ingredient in the formulation of functional food.

AB  - This study presents the first draft genome of Siganus fuscescens, and thereby establishes the first whole-genome sequence for a species in the Siganidae family. Leveraging both long and short read sequencing technologies, i.e., Oxford Nanopore and Illumina sequencing, we successfully assembled a mitogenome spanning 16.494 Kb and a first haploid genome encompassing 498 Mb. The assembled genome accounted for a 99.6% of the estimated genome size and was organized into 164 contigs with an N50 of 7.2 Mb. This genome assembly showed a GC content of 42.9% and a high Benchmarking Universal Single-Copy Orthologue (BUSCO) completeness score of 99.5% using actinopterygii_odb10 lineage, thereby meeting stringent quality standards. In addition to its structural aspects, our study also examined the functional genomics of this species, including the intricate capacity to biosynthesize long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (LC-PUFAs) and secrete venom. Notably, our analyses revealed various repeats elements, which collectively constituted 17.43% of the genome. Moreover, annotation of 28,351 genes uncovered both shared genetic signatures and those that are unique to S. fuscescens. Our assembled genome also displayed a moderate prevalence of gene duplication compared to other fish species, which suggests that this species has a distinctive evolutionary trajectory and potentially unique functional constraints. Taken altogether, this genomic resource establishes a robust foundation for future research on the biology, evolution, and the aquaculture potential of S. fuscescens.

AB  - In mammals, skeletal muscles (SkMs) and adipose tissues regulate energy homeostasis and share developmental origins. Notably, the perirenal adipose tissue (PRAT) depot has been reported to display adipocyte heterogeneity: while some originated from Myogenic factor 5 (Myf-5) expressing progenitors, others did not. Our study examines the expression and distribution of Myf-5 using immunohistochemical staining and western blotting of PRAT, gastrocnemius, and trapezius from goat at various developmental stages. Contrary to earlier beliefs, functionally divergent SkM gastrocnemius and trapezius showed similar Myf-5 expressional pattern. SkM abundantly expresses Myf-5 in developing myocytes which gradually becomes limited to the nucleus of myogenic stem cells and is retained only in a few differentiated postnatal fibers. During the same period, PRAT displays a unique brown-to-white transition. PRAT exhibited an elevated expression of Myf-5 during prenatal periods, which declines thereafter and becomes negligible during adulthood where it gets fully enriched white adipocytes. The reduction of Myf-5 during the neonatal period was common to all three tissues. However, Myf-5 expression was retained in some of the differentiated myofibers while it was undetectable in adult PRAT. These observations suggest a possible developmental interplay between adipose tissue and SkM where Myf-5 might be a major regulator.

AB  - Adipose tissues represent an important energy storage organ in animals and are the largest endocrine organ. It plays an important regulatory role in the pathogenesis of insulin resistance, cardiovascular disease, and metabolic syndrome. Adipose development is a complex biological process involving multiple key genes, signaling pathways, and non-coding RNAs, including microRNAs and circular RNAs. In this study, we characterized circITGB1 and named its host gene ITGB1, which is differentially expressed in sheep of different months based on sequencing data. We collated and analyzed the sequencing data to select miRNA-23a with strong binding to ARRB1. We found that miRNA-23a regulates the development and differentiation of sheep adipocytes by targeting ARRB1. As a competing endogenous RNA, circITGB1 overexpression effectively alleviated the inhibitory effect of miR-23a on ARRB1. Conclusively, we provide evidence that circITGB1 regulates the proliferation and differentiation of sheep adipocytes via the miR-23a/ARRB1 pathway. This study provides a scientific basis for further studies on adipose tissue development at the circRNA level.

AB  - Gan-Mai-Da-Zao (GMDZ) is a well-known product in Chinese traditional medicine and includes three major plants: blighted wheat (Fu Mai), licorice (Gan Cao), and jujube (Da Zao). GMDZ is widely used as an efficacious and well-tolerated prescription for depression in clinics. The present study was designed to investigate the main plant of GMDZ for its antidepressant-like effect using the unpredictable chronic mild stress (UCMS) model on rats who received an injection with p-chlorophenylalanine (PCPA) to produce the chemical model. In rats subjected to the UCMS model, forced swim tests, open field tests, and sucrose preference tests were applied to estimate the chronic effect of GMDZ. We found that the oral administration of GMDZ for 21 days significantly alleviated the behavior in rats with depression induced by either UCMS or PCPA. The expression levels of the serotonin transporter (5-HTT) and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) in the hippocampus of the rats with depression were markedly increased by GMDZ. Additionally, rats that received the herbal mixture without licorice showed a markedly lower response than GMDZ. These results suggest that GMDZ may alleviate the depressive-like behaviors in depressive rats, possibly via licorice (Gan Cao), to increase 5-HTT and BDNF signals in the hippocampus. The present study confirmed the antidepressant-like effects of GMDZ. Additionally, licorice (Gan Cao) may play a key role in the effectiveness of GMDZ.

AB  - The redhead cichlid (Vieja melanura) is a neotropical Heroini species from Central America, which is currently an emerging species in the ornamental trade, but it is also a promising fish in terms of aquaculture production. So far, research shows that this species is herbivorous or omnivorous; however, larvae and young juveniles mostly feed on zooplankton. A 3-week experimental rearing was carried out (in triplicates of tanks) using either natural food (Artemia sp., group Art) or one of three commercial fish diets (groups D1-D3), from inception of exogenous feeding (5 days post hatching). No differences in survival occurred (all groups above 95%), but the mean body weight in the Art group was 3.0-7.1 times higher when compared with the D1-D3 groups (p < 0.05). Histological measurements showed that mucosal fold length in Art group was the highest in both the anterior and posterior intestine, while in D3 it was the lowest. Furthermore, abnormal fatty degeneration was found in the livers and pancreas of fish in D1-D3. The experiment showed that using commercial feeds available on the market to rear newly hatched redhead cichlids is not advisable, because they negatively impact both its growth and overall condition.

AB  - 1-Ethoxy-2,3-difluoro-4-(trans-4-propylcyclohexyl)benzene (EDPrB) is a typical fluorinated liquid-crystal monomer (LCM). LCMs contaminants are becoming increasingly concerning due to their potential persistence, bioaccumulation, toxicity, and broad prevalence in environmental and human samples. However, LCM metabolism is poorly understood. Herein, by introducing selected EDPrB into the appropriate liver microsomes in vitro, we examined the metabolic path-ways of LCM in humans, rats, pigs, Cyprinus carpio, crucian carp, and Channa argus. A total of 20 species-dependent metabolites were identified and structurally elucidated by gas and liquid chromatography-high resolution mass spec-trometry for the first time. Dealkylation, H-abstraction, and hydroxylation reactions are the primary metabolic path-ways. Half of these in vitro metabolites were found in the urine, serum, and fecal samples of Sprague-Dawley rats exposed to EDPrB. Toxicity predictions indicate that 17 metabolites can be classified as toxic. According to the Ecolog-ical Structure Activity Relationships (ECOSAR), a number of metabolites exhibit equivalent or greater aquatic toxicity to that of EDPrB. Toxicity Estimation Software Tool (T.E.S.T.) predicts that some metabolites exhibit developmental toxicity and mutagenicity in rats. These findings suggest that biotransformation should be particularly emphasized, and more toxicological and monitoring studies should be performed to assess the ecological and human safety of LCMs.

AB  - We recently reported that artificial light at night (ALAN), at ecologically relevant intensities (1.5, 5 lux), increases cell proliferation in the ventricular zone and recruitment of new neurons in several forebrain regions of female zebra finches (Taeniopygia guttata), along with a decrease of total neuronal densities in some of these regions (indicating possible neuronal death). In the present study, we exposed male zebra finches to the same ALAN intensities, treated them with 5'-bromo-2'deoxyuridine, quantified cell proliferation and neuronal recruitment in several forebrain regions, and compared them to controls that were kept under dark nights. ALAN increased cell proliferation in the ventricular zone, similar to our previous findings in females. We also found, for the first time, that ALAN increased new neuronal recruitment in HVC and Area X, which are part of the song system in the brain and are male-specific. In other brain regions, such as the medial striatum, nidopallium caudale, and hippocampus, we recorded an increased neuronal recruitment only in the medial striatum (unlike our previous findings in females), and relative to the controls this increase was less prominent than in females. Moreover, the effect of ALAN duration on total neuronal densities in the studied regions varied between the sexes, supporting the suggestion that males are more resilient to ALAN than females. Suppression of nocturnal melatonin levels after ALAN exhibited a light intensity-dependent decrease in males in contrast to females, another indication that males might be less affected by ALAN. Taken together, our study emphasizes the importance of studying both sexes when considering ALAN effects on brain plasticity.

AB  - In nature, plant-insect interactions occur in complex settings involving multiple trophic levels, often with multiple species at each level.(1) Herbivore attack of a host plant typically dramatically alters the plant's odor emission in terms of concentration and composition.(2,3) Therefore, a well-adapted herbivore should be able to predict whether a plant is still suitable as a host by judging these changes in the emitted bouquet Although studies have demonstrated that oviposition preferences of successive insects were affected by previous infestations,(4,5) the underlying molecular and olfactory mechanisms remain unknown. Here, we report that tobacco hawkmoths (Manduca sexta) preferentially oviposit on Jimson weed (Datura wrightii) that is already infested by a specialist, the three-lined potato beetle (Lema daturaphila). Interestingly, the moths' offspring do not benefit directly, as larvae develop more slowly when feeding together with Lema beetles. However, one of M. sexta's main enemies, the parasitoid wasp Cotesia congregata, prefers the headspace of M. sexta-infested plants to that of plants infested by both herbivores. Hence, we conclude that female M. sexta ignore the interspecific competition with beetles and oviposit deliberately on beetle-infested plants to provide their offspring with an enemy-reduced space, thus providing a trade-off that generates a net benefit to the survival and fitness of the subsequent generation. We identify that alpha-co-paene, emitted by beetle-infested Datura, plays a role in this preference. By performing heterologous expression and single-sensillum recordings, we show that odorant receptor (Or35) is involved in fx-copaene detection.

AB  - Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) is an essential component of the cellular envelope of Gram-negative bacteria and contributes to antibiotic resistance and pathogenesis. Proper localization of LPS at the outer membrane is facilitated via seven distinct LPS transport (Lpt) proteins that bridge the inner and outer membranes. Mature LPS diffuses into the membrane cavity of the inner membrane ABC transporter LptB(2)FGC through a lateral gate formed by the LptF and LptG transmembrane (TM) helices. The TM helix of LptC intercalates within the LPS entry point and has been shown to regulate the ATPase activity of LptB(2)FG and contribute to thermal stability. Determination of the LptB(2)FGC open state structure revealed the location of the LptC TM helix within the membrane complex. However, in the closed state structure, the LptC TM helix is unresolved, suggesting the helix may be displaced from the lateral gate prior to or upon closure of the cavity. To determine the conformational states of the LptC TM helix in the open and closed LptB(2)FGC conformations, we utilized site-directed spin labeling in combination with both continuous wave electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) and double electron electron resonance (DEER) spectroscopies to investigate the LptC TM helix and linker region. These data indicate that the LptC TM helix undergoes a rigid body movement away from the central LptB(2)FG cavity upon cavity closure. The findings presented here will support structure-based drug design optimization of recently discovered antibiotics that bind LptB(2)FG and occlude the LptC TM helix from the lateral gate.

AB  - Growing evidence has indicated a potential association between maternal consumption of caffeine and impaired cognition and behavior in rodent offspring. However, potential sex differences, as well as caffeine-related effects in subsequent generations are still poorly investigated. We aimed to investigate the impact of pre-and/or neonatal exposition to caffeine on the neurodevelopment of male and female mice offspring. Adult female Swiss mice were randomly divided into four experimental groups, which received, via gavage, water or caffeine (120 mg/day). Control/control (CC) received water during pregnancy and lactation; treated/control (TC): received caffeine during pregnancy and water during lactation; control/treated (CT): received water during pregnancy and caffeine during lactation; treated/treated (TT): received caffeine during pregnancy and lactation. Dams were euthanized at gestational day 17.5 and fetal brains were collected. Adult mice of F1 and F2 generations were submitted to behavioral analysis and their pre-frontal cortex and hippocampi were dissected to measure the levels of BDNF and CX3CL1. Caffeine induced reduction of CX3CL1 levels in female fetuses compared with controls. Maternal intake of caffeine was associated with anxiety- and compulsive-like behavior in both F1 and F2 female mice offspring. Interestingly, only F2 female mice exhibited caffeine-induced impairment of work memory. Hippocampal levels of CX3CL1 and BDNF were decreased in female F1TT and F2TT groups; while among males exposed to caffeine, only F1 offspring had reduced hippocampal CX3CL1 levels. Our results suggest that both pre- and neonatal exposition to caffeine lead to long-term behavioral and neurochemical impairments in a sex-dependent manner, adversely affecting the subsequent female generation.

AB  - Modernity imposes a toll on the sleep time of young population, with concomitant increase in symptoms of anxiety and depression. Whether there is a causal relationship between these events are only now being experimentally tested in humans and rodents. In a previous study, we showed that chronic sleep deprivation in juvenile-adolescent male rats led to increased anxiety-like behaviour and changes in noradrenaline and serotonin in the amygdala and hippocampus. In the present study we investigated whether early chronic sleep restriction affects emotional behaviour, stress response and neurochemistry in adulthood. From 21 to 42 days of age, Wistar male rats were submitted to sleep restriction by the multiple platform method or allowed to sleep freely. Forty-five days after this period, rats were tested in the elevated plus maze (EPM) and blood samples were collected from non-tested rats or 30 and 60 min after the EPM for determination of plasma corticosterone levels. Levels of monoamines were determined in the frontal cortex, hippocampus, amygdala and hypothalamus 60 min after the EPM. Sleep restriction resulted in increased anxiety-like behaviour, decreased noradrenaline levels in the amygdala and dopamine levels in the ventral hippocampus. Anxiety index was positively correlated with increased serotonin metabolism in the frontal cortex and greater dopamine metabolism in the ventral hippocampus, and negatively correlated with dopamine levels in the ventral hippocampus. These results suggest that sleep restriction in juvenility and adolescence induces persistent changes in emotional behaviour in adult male rats and that levels of anxiety are correlated with increased serotonin and dopamine metabolism in specific brain areas.

AB  - The CRISPR/Cas9 system has shown great potential for treating human genetic diseases through gene therapy. However, there are concerns about the safety of this system, specifically related to the use of guide-free Cas9. Previous studies have shown that guide-free Cas9 can induce genomic instability in vitro. However, the in vivo safety risks associated with guide-free Cas9 have not been evaluated, which is necessary for the development of gene therapy in clinical settings. In this study, we used doxycycline-inducible Cas9-expressing pigs to evaluate the safety risks of guide-free Cas9 in vivo. Our findings demonstrated that expression of guide-free Cas9 could induce genomic damages and transcriptome changes in vivo. The severity of the genomic damages and transcriptome changes were correlate with the expression levels of Cas9 protein. Moreover, prolonged expression of Cas9 in pigs led to abnormal phenotypes, including a significant decrease in body weight, which may be attributable to genomic damage-induced nutritional absorption and metabolic dysfunction. Furthermore, we observed an increase in whole-genome and tumor driver gene mutations in pigs with long-term Cas9 expression, raising the risk of tumor occurrence. Our in vivo evaluation of guide-free Cas9 in pigs highlights the necessity of considering and monitoring the detrimental effects of Cas9 alone as genome editing via the CRISPR/Cas9 system is implemented in clinical gene therapy. This research emphasizes the importance of further study and implementation of safety measures to ensure the successful and safe application of the CRISPR/Cas9 system in clinical practice.

AB  - Simple Summary
   Nutritional strategies during pregnancy in swine production are considered essential to increase the number of piglets born alive and improve their survival and development. Amino acids, such as glutamine, are among the best compound to introduce in commercial farms after obtaining positive results in trials carried out in selected swine breeds. However, several critical productive factors have to be assessed before translating these strategies to the farm level to ensure the best balance between benefits and investments. The current study focused on the effects of prenatal L-glutamine supplementation on the offspring of Iberian gilts and sows under farm conditions. It is the first trial of amino acid supplementation during pregnancy carried out in traditional swine breeds. These non-selected swine breeds show productive or physiological differences that could affect the supplementation effect. Indeed, although there were changes at the molecular and tissue level, these effects did not turn into advantageous effects for the offspring of traditional breeds. The present study shows the importance of pre-testing nutritional strategies under the final conditions and breeds of implementation and the need to deepen at the molecular level to improve the biological interpretation of findings.
   The use of amino acids during pregnancy, such as glutamine (Gln), seems to be a promising strategy in selected swine breeds to improve the offspring prenatal development. The main goal of the current study was to assess the development of the offspring from parity 1-3 sows of a traditional breed, which were supplemented with 1% glutamine after Day 35 of gestation, under farm conditions. A total of 486 (288 treated) piglets from 78 (46 treated) Iberian sows were used. At birth and slaughterhouse, fatty acid composition, metabolism, and mTOR pathway gene expression were analyzed. At birth, treated newborns showed greater amounts of specific amino acids in plasma, such as glutamine, asparagine, or alanine, and sigma n-3 fatty acids in cellular membranes than control newborns. The expression of genes belonging to mTOR Complex 1 was also higher in treated piglets with normal birth-weight. However, these findings did not improve productive traits at birth or following periods in litters from supplemented gilts (parity 1) or sows (parities 2-3). Thus, further research is needed to properly understand the effects of prenatal glutamine supplementation, particularly in traditional swine breeds.

AB  - Inflammation responses and oxidative stress adversely affect testicular function, reducing fertility. Melatonin exhibits anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties. However, the molecular mechanism by which melatonin alleviates inflammation and oxidative stress in Leydig cells of the Min pig testis remains unclear. To investigate this, primary Leydig cells were isolated from 7-day-ld Min pigs' testes and treated with LPS, H2O2 and melatonin, respectively. The results showed that co-treatment with melatonin and LPS significantly decreased the expression of TLR4, NF-kappa B, IL-6 and IL-1 beta compared to LPS group. Co-treatment with melatonin and H2O2 significantly mitigated reactive oxygen species and malondialdehyde levels. Melatonin also enhanced glutathione and superoxide dismutase levels and upregulated the mRNA expression levels of Nrf2, Keap1, HO-1 and NQO1. In the co-treatment group of melatonin, LPS, and SIRT1 inhibitor, the secretion of IL-6 and IL-1 beta and the mRNA expression levels of TLR4 and NF-kappa B were elevated significantly compared to the control group and the melatonin-LPS co-treatment group. In the combined treatment group of melatonin, H2O2 and a SIRT1 inhibitor, ROS levels increased significantly, while the expression of Nrf2, Keap1, HO-1 and NQO1 were decreased significantly compared to the control group and the melatonin-H2O2 co-treatment group. Furthermore, mRNA expression levels of testosterone synthesis-related genes StAR, CYP11A1, 3 beta-HSD, CYP17A1 and 17 beta-HSD significantly decreased following H2O2 treatment, which was alleviated by co-treatment with H2O2 and melatonin, but not by the addition of SIRT1 inhibitor. In conclusion, melatonin exhibits the capability to ameliorate inflammatory responses, oxidative stress and testosterone secretion in Leydig cells via the SIRT1 pathway.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The discrepancy between the endogenous antioxidants concentrations and free radicals results in oxidative stress and cellular injury. OBJECTIVE: To appraise the usefulness of Rosemarinus officinalis (RO) aqueous extract in protecting buffalo spermatozoa during freezing / thawing process. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Qualifying ejaculates from four well-restrained bulls were evaluated initially and then diluted in a freezing medium supplemented with RO-0.00, RO-0.50%, RO-1.00%, RO-2.00%, and RO-4.00%, cooled to 4 degrees C in 2 h, equilibrated for 4 h at 4 degrees C, packed in straws, and cryopreserved, and thawed at 37 degrees C for 30 s followed by evaluation. RESULTS: We found that freezing medium supplemented with RO-2.00% improves progressive motility (%) compared to the control. Similarly, a lower rate of apoptosis-like changes (%) was recorded with RO4.00% than the control, RO-0.50% and RO-1.00%. This response was accompanied by an increment in viable spermatozoa. Semen samples supplemented with RO-2.00% and RO-4.00% displayed higher TAC (total antioxidant capacity, mu M/L) and ATP (nmol/million) content than the control. In addition, semen samples supplemented with RO-2.00% displayed lower concentrations of ROS (reactive oxygen species, 10(4) RLU/20 min/25 million) than the control and RO-0.05%. Also LPO (lipid peroxidation, mu M/L) with RO-2.00% and RO-4.00% was lower than the control. CONCLUSION: The inclusion of rosemary aqueous extract ameliorates motility features, structural and functional parameters, viability, TAC and ATP content of bull sperm. Conversely, the inclusion of rosemary aqueous extract alleviates apoptosis-like changes, ROS and LPO in comparison to the control. Further studies are required to determine the mechanism of action of rosemary aqueous extract in ameliorating semen quality and fertility of buffalo spermatozoa.

AB  - Bromodomain PHD finger transcription factor (BPTF), a core subunit of nucleosome-remodeling factor (NURF) complex, plays an important role in chromatin remodeling. However, few information of BPTF is available in pig, especially in mammalian follicular granulosa cells (GCs). The present study firstly confirmed that BPTF in porcine was relative close to human and mouse. The expression of BPTF could be detected in ovary, testes, lung, kidney, large intestine, and small intestine. And a relative high expression of BPTF was observed in ovarian follicles and GCs. When BPTF was knocked down (BPTF-siRNA), the viability of GCs was affected. And the expression level of CDK1, cyclin B1, CDK4 and CDK2 was higher than the control, which might indicate that the cell cycle of GCs was inhibited from S to G2/M phase. Although the apoptosis level was induced in the BPTFsiRNA GCs, the reduced level of H3K4 methylation was detected with the down regulation of SMYD3, EHMT2 and DPY30. Thereby, results in the present might provide the primary knowledge of BPTF in GCs and the follicular development in pig.

AB  - Both absolute and relative brain sizes vary greatly among and within the major vertebrate lineages. Scientists have long debated how larger brains in primates and hominins translate into greater cognitive performance, and in particular how to control for the relationship between the noncognitive functions of the brain and body size. One solution to this problem is to establish the slope of cognitive equivalence, i.e., the line connecting organisms with an identical bauplan but different body sizes. The original approach to estimate this slope through intraspecific regressions was abandoned after it became clear that it generated slopes that were too low by an unknown margin due to estimation error. Here, we revisit this method. We control for the error problem by focusing on highly dimorphic primate species with large sample sizes and fitting a line through the mean values for adult females and males. We obtain the best estimate for the slope of circa 0.27, a value much lower than those constructed using all mammal species and close to the value expected based on the genetic correlation between brain size and body size. We also find that the estimate of cognitive brain size based on cognitive equivalence fits empirical cognitive studies better than the encephalization quotient, which should therefore be avoided in future studies on primates and presumably mammals and birds in general. The use of residuals from the line of cognitive equivalence may change conclusions concerning the cognitive abilities of extant and extinct primate species, including hominins.

AB  - Tail fat weight is a key economic trait in fat-tailed sheep; reducing tail fat deposition is of significant importance for improving the economic efficiency of sheep farming. In this article, we measured the live weight before slaughter, tail fat weight, and carcass weight of Hu male sheep at 6 months of age and performed the descriptive statistical analysis. The results indicated the coefficient of variation of tail fat-related-traits ranged from 25% to 50%. Simultaneously, we selected IGFBP3 and TUSC5 as candidate genes based on their close association with fat deposition. Target regions were amplified using gene-specific primers in PCR, followed by Sanger sequencing of PCR products to identify genetic variants. Polymorphisms were subsequently validated using the KASPar genotyping assay. Finally, quantitative reverse transcription PCR (qRT-PCR) was performed to determine the expression levels of IGFBP3 and TUSC5. Our findings revealed a missense mutation (g.83695349 C>T) in exon 1 of the IGFBP3 gene and a synonymous mutation (g.41771645 C>T) in exon 2 of the TUSC5 gene. Association analysis showed that these mutations were significantly correlated (p < 0.05) with tail fat weight traits. Moreover, the tail fat weight of the mutant genotypes (CT and TT) was significantly reduced compared with that of the CC genotype, suggesting that the gene may exert a negative regulatory effect on this trait, thereby leading to the reduction of tail fat weight. Furthermore, the genotype combinations showed a significant relationship with tail fat traits. Moreover, qRT-PCR results showed that TUSC5 and IGFBP3 genes were expressed in all experimental tissues of Hu sheep, and the highest expression was observed in tail fat compared with other tissues (heart, liver, spleen, lung, kidney, rumen, duodenum, muscle, and lymph). Notably, their expression levels were significantly lower in the large-tail fat group than in the small-tail fat group. Overall, these results will provide novel candidate variation for reducing tail fat deposition in sheep breeding practice.

AB  - Entomopathogenic fungi (EPFs) can influence plant-insect interactions through complex molecular and chemical mechanisms. This study investigates how EPF treatment of tomato plants modulates volatile organic compound (VOC) emissions and subsequent trophic interactions between tomato plants, the herbivorous pest Phthorimaea absoluta, and the parasitic wasp, Trichogramma chilonis. Our results demonstrate that EPF-treated plants exhibited reduced attractiveness to adult P. absoluta moths, which were actively repelled by EPF-induced VOCs. Conversely, these same plants showed enhanced recruitment of the parasitoid T. chilonis, which demonstrated positive chemotaxis toward the modified VOC profile. Chemical analysis revealed significantly elevated emissions of key VOCs in EPF-treated plants, particularly (E)-beta-Caryophyllene, beta-phellandrene, and alpha-Phellandrene. This increase is correlated with enhanced production of defense-related phytohormones, including JA, SA, and JA-Ile, which may regulate VOC biosynthesis pathways. Behavioral response studies using synthetic VOCs and electroantennogram (EAG) measurements confirmed that these EPF-induced VOCs elicited strong olfactory responses in both insect species. To summarize, EPF treatment reshapes multitrophic interactions by strategically modulating plant VOC emissions and activating defense signaling pathways in tomato plants, providing new insights for potential applications in sustainable pest management strategies.

AB  - In the currently prevailing pig husbandry systems, the vitamin D status is almost exclusively dependent on dietary supply. Additional endogenous vitamin D production after exposure to ultraviolet-B (UVB) light might allow the animals to utilize minerals in a more efficient manner, as well as enable the production of functional vitamin D-enriched meat for human consumption. In this study, growing pigs (n = 16) were subjected to a control group or to a daily narrowband UVB exposure of 1 standard erythema dose (SED) for a period of 9 weeks until slaughter at a body weight of 105 kg. Transcriptomic profiling of liver with emphasis on the associated effects on vitamin D metabolism due to UVB exposure were evaluated via RNA sequencing. Serum was analyzed for vitamin D status and health parameters such as minerals and biochemical markers. The serum concentration of calcidiol, but not calcitriol, was significantly elevated in response to UVB exposure after 17 days on trial. No effects of UVB exposure were observed on growth performance and blood test results. At slaughter, the RNA sequencing analyses following daily UVB exposure revealed 703 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in liver tissue (adjusted p-value < 0.01). Results showed that molecular pathways for vitamin D synthesis (CYP2R1) rather than cholesterol synthesis (DHCR7) were preferentially initiated in liver. Gene enrichment (p < 0.05) was observed for reduced cholesterol/steroid biosynthesis, SNARE interactions in vesicular transport, and CDC42 signaling. Taken together, dietary vitamin D supply can be complemented via endogenous production after UVB exposure in pig husbandry, which could be considered in the development of functional foods.

AB  - Reduced defense against large herbivores has been suggested to be part of the "island syndrome" in plants. However, empirical evidence for this pattern is mixed. In this paper, we present two studies that compare putative physical and chemical defense traits from plants on the California Channel Islands and nearby mainland based on sampling of both field and common garden plants. In the first study, we focus on five pairs of woody shrubs from three island and three mainland locations and find evidence for increased leaf area, decreased marginal leaf spines, and decreased concentrations of cyanogenic glycosides in island plants. We observed similar increases in leaf area and decreases in defense traits when comparing island and mainland genotypes grown together in botanic gardens, suggesting that trait differences are not solely driven by abiotic differences between island and mainland sites. In the second study, we conducted a common garden experiment with a perennial herb-Stachys bullata (Lamiaceae)-collected from two island and four mainland locations. Compared to their mainland relatives, island genotypes show highly reduced glandular trichomes and a nearly 100-fold reduction in mono- and sesquiterpene compounds from leaf surfaces. Island genotypes also had significantly higher specific leaf area, somewhat lower rates of gas exchange, and greater aboveground biomass than mainland genotypes across two years of study, potentially reflecting a broader shift in growth habit. Together, our results provide evidence for reduced expression of putative defense traits in island plants, though these results may reflect adaptation to both biotic (i.e., the historical absence of large herbivores) and climatic conditions on islands.

AB  - The current global population is approximately 8 billion. So from a socio-economic point of view, governmental policies are intended to secure at least a minimum of the natural resources like food to the global population to minimize their uneven distribution. However, in the case of plants, the scenario seems different where an uneven distribution of resources seems to be required for the optimized growth. Therefore, a better understanding of this uneven distribution in plants is needed to generate stress-resilient plants with improved yield. It is known that all necessary functions in plants are governed by the efflux and influx of molecules/chemical species and their distribution make plants capable of performing crucial physiological processes as well as acclimating under stress conditions. In this review, we have discussed the role of uneven distribution of different molecules/chemical species in sustaining plant life in the surrounding environment with a few examples of physiological processes.

AB  - Aeromonas hydrophila, a Gram-negative zoonotic bacterium, causes high mortality in fish farming and immunocompromised patients. This study aimed to extract methyl gallate (MG) from the flowers of Camellia nitidissima Chi and evaluate its potential as a quorum sensing inhibitor (QSI) against Aeromonas hydrophila SHAe 115. MG reduced QS-associated virulence factors, including hemolysis, protease, and lipase, while impairing swimming motility and biofilm formation. Additionally, MG down-regulated positive regulatory genes (ahyR, fleQ) and up-regulated negative regulators (litR, fleN). This highlights MG's promise as a potent QSI for A. hydrophila SHAe 115, advancing strategies against infections in aquaculture and human health.

AB  - Seabuckthorn (Hippophae rhamnoides Linn.) is a commonly utilized medicinal crop with various applications in the treatment of different diseases. Two particularly noteworthy nutrients in seabuckthorn fruit are seabuckthorn oil and flavonoids. In recent years, seabuckthorn oil has attracted considerable attention due to its perceived benefits for beauty and healthcare. Consequently, there is a clear need for further research into seabuckthorn oil. While numerous studies have been conducted on the regulation of oil by the FAD2 gene family, there is a paucity of literature examining the molecular mechanism of FAD2 gene involvement in seabuckthorn oil regulation. Accordingly, two FAD2 genes have been identified in seabuckthorn, which are classified differently and perform distinct functions. Both genes are located in the endoplasmic reticulum. Following transient expression in seabuckthorn fruits, it was observed that HrFAD2-1 and HrFAD2-3 were capable of influencing the synthesis of alpha-linolenic acid, with HrFAD2-1 additionally demonstrated to facilitate the synthesis of lysophosphatidic acid. All of the aforementioned genes have been observed to promote jasmonic acid (JA) synthesis. The heterologous transformation of Linum usitatissimum demonstrates that both HrFAD2-1 and HrFAD2-3 are capable of promoting plant growth. The HrFAD2-1 gene was observed to significantly increase the content of major fatty acids in Linum usitatissimum Linn seeds, whereas the HrFAD2-3 gene appeared to be primarily involved in the regulation of plant growth and development. In conclusion, a preliminary investigation into the functions of the HrFAD2-1 and HrFAD2-3 genes in fatty acid synthesis was conducted. This revealed that HrFAD2-1 is closely associated with oleic acid synthesis and acts as a negative regulator. Furthermore, our findings will provide a foundation for subsequent investigations into the fatty acid synthesis pathway in Hippophae rhamnoides oil, offering a theoretical basis for subsequent studies at the molecular level.

AB  - The iron and steel industries are major players in economic development, however, pose a challenge to the environment due to the huge emission of greenhouse gases. Further, the depletion of fossil fuels makes a way for renewable energy sources. In this direction, biomass sources including agricultural wastes appear to be one of the alternatives to address the above challenges of fossil fuel scarcity and greenhouse gases. The lignocellulose biomasses are rich in carbon contents (39-57%). The agricultural wastes are being converted to biochar, bio-oil and syngas through thermochemical conversion to enhance heating values and fuel properties and applied to different plants in the iron and steel industries. The present review systematically focuses on smart technologies based on renewable energy concepts and waste heat recovery. The potential and scope of renewable biomasses to be utilized in the iron and steel making industries are deliberated. The characteristics of biomasses and their thermochemical conversion into value-added fuels are described. The concepts of waste heat recovery from the different sections of steelmaking processes for this conversion are outlined. The thermochemical conversion of biomass occurs at a temperature below 1000 degrees C while the steelmaking takes place above 1200 degrees C, which indicates the feasibility of efficient waste heat recovery. The recent developments toward the partial or complete substitution of fossil fuels with biomass-based renewable fuels in different steelmaking processes are discussed. Charcoal is a suitable replacement in the oxygen route of steel making, while biomass, charcoal and syngas are potential alternatives in the electric route. The implications of renewable sources as fuels towards emissions of greenhouse gases are emphasized. The replacement of fossil fuels with renewable biomass reduces CO2 emissions by 20-80%. The effective utilization of agricultural wastes also positively contributes to the local economy.

AB  - The ability to identify sex is necessary in population biology for a proper understanding of the dynamics of a population. In Atlantic halibut, phenotypic sex identification is not possible due to the lack of significant external morphological differences. We developed an Illumina SNP panel for Atlantic halibut with 4000 SNPs spread evenly throughout the genome with a minor allele frequency MAF & GE; 0.4, except for N = 249 SNPs located in a sex-determining region on chromosome 12, N = 176 of these SNPs were selected to genetically identify male and female individuals using a DAPC analysis. The genomic identification of sex allows for non-lethal sex determination and validation of sex identification in the field. The SNP panel is a new genomic resource for Atlantic halibut that will make it possible to generate the genotypic data for the large number of individuals needed to estimate population abundance using genomics and the Close Kin Mark Recapture (CKMR) approach, an emerging component of fisheries management and stock monitoring.

AB  - Copper (Cu), a hazardous heavy metal, can lead to toxic effects on host physiology. Recently, specific mitochondria-localized miRNAs (mitomiRs) were shown to modulate mitochondrial function, but the underlying mechanisms remain undefined. Here, we identified mitomiR-1285 as an important molecule regulating mitochondrial dysfunction and mitophagy in jejunal epithelial cells under Cu exposure. Mitochondrial dysfunction and mitophagy were the important mechanisms of Cu-induced pathological damage in jejunal epithelial cells, which were accompanied by significant increase of mitomiR-1285 in vivo and in vitro. Knockdown of mitomiR1285 significantly attenuated Cu-induced mitochondrial respiratory dysfunction, ATP deficiency, mitochondrial membrane potential reduction, mitochondrial reactive oxygen species accumulation, and mitophagy. Subsequently, bioinformatics analysis and luciferase reporter assay demonstrated that IDH2 was a direct target of mitomiR-1285. RNA interference of IDH2 dramatically reversed the effect that mitomiR-1285 knockdown relieved mitochondrial dysfunction and mitophagy induced by Cu, and the opposite effect was shown by overexpression of IDH2. Therefore, our results suggested that mitomiR-1285 aggravated Cu-induced mitochondrial dysfunction and mitophagy via suppressing IDH2 expression. These findings identified the important mechanistic connection between mitomiRs and mitochondrial metabolism under Cu exposure, providing a new insight into Cu toxicology.

AB  - Stress is a common seizure trigger that has been implicated in worsening epilepsy outcomes, which encompasses psychiatric and cognitive comorbidities and sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP) risk. The neuroendocrine response to stress is mediated by the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis and HPA axis dysfunction worsens epilepsy outcomes, increasing seizure burden, behavioral comorbidities, and risk for SUDEP in mice. Early life stress (ELS) reprograms the HPA axis into adulthood, impacting both the basal and stressinduced activity. Thus, we propose that ELS may influence epilepsy outcomes by influencing the function of the HPA axis. To test this hypothesis, we utilized the maternal separation paradigm and examined the impact on seizure susceptibility. We show that ELS exerts a sex dependent effect on seizure susceptibility in response to acute administration of the chemoconvulsant, kainic acid, which is associated with an altered relationship between seizure activity and HPA axis function. To further examine the impact of ELS on epilepsy outcomes, we utilized the intrahippocampal kainic acid model of chronic epilepsy in mice previously exposed to maternal separation. We find that the relationship between corticosterone levels and the extent of epileptiform activity is altered in mice subjected to ELS. We demonstrate that ELS impacts behavioral outcomes associated with chronic epilepsy in a sex-dependent manner, with females being more affected. We also observe reduced mortality (presumed SUDEP) in female mice subjected to ELS, consistent with previous findings suggesting a role for HPA axis dysfunction in SUDEP risk. These data demonstrate for the first time that ELS influences epilepsy outcomes and suggest that previous life experiences may impact the trajectory of epilepsy.

AB  - The convergent lady beetle (Hippodamia convergens) is a generalist natural enemy that is utilized extensively in augmentative biological control across the United States. Recent studies have pointed to both genetic and phenotypic differences in Western (California) versus Eastern (Kansas) populations of the species. Here we investigate (1) genetic population structure, and (2) phenotypic differences in the utilization of pea aphids at temperatures that resemble the Western United States in (a) Eastern versus Western populations, (b) F1 Eastern X Western hybrids versus their progenitor populations, and investigate the effects of competition between (c) Eastern and Western populations. We found no differences in final pupal weight, or the net weight gain ratio through larval development from the third instar to pupal stage, despite genetic population structure. Our study points towards plastic response and effectiveness in feeding phenotypes of Eastern and Western populations of H. convergens, and the absence of hybrid vigor and heterozygote advantages in hybrids.

AB  - Many CFD simulation studies substitute Animal Occupied Zone (AOZ) as porous media to reduce computation time and resources. With the improved computational capacity, it is now possible to include realistic geometric models of individual animals and partition walls. This study presents a CFD model of a large commercial-sized, hybrid ventilated pig building with 1,360 animals. It compares the developed full-scale model (that includes pigs and partition walls) with a simplified model that substitutes AOZ with a porous media approximation. We find that the simplified model with porous media approximation predicts the airflow rates and overall flow characteristics in the building as good as the full-scale model. Full-scale simulations with animals and partition walls give a snapshot of a particular situation in the building and the environmental conditions in the AOZ level; for example, we found that even in a well-ventilated pig building temperatures in the AOZ were, on average, 3 degrees C - 5 degrees C higher than at a height 0.5 m above the AOZ. Including the realistic shape of animals and the partition walls is overkill if the aim is to study ventilation configurations' effects. However, porous media models are not good enough to describe the conditions in the AOZ.

AB  - Little is known about the contamination of terrestrial food webs by microplastics. We conducted community-level assessments of invertebrates at 51 sites in England, sampling four trophic levels and six taxonomic groups. We hypothesized that plastic contamination would be most common in herbivores and detritivores, owing to the accumulation of microplastics in soil and plant material. A total of 581 samples, comprising pooled individuals from the same site and species, were digested using hydrogen peroxide and subsequently examined by micro-Fourier transform infrared microscopy. Plastic was found in 11.8% (95% CI 9.3%, 14.6%) of the samples, including all tested taxonomic groups and trophic levels, regardless of life history traits or dietary habits. The highest prevalence of plastic-positive samples was in Opisthopora (earthworms; 29.4%) and Stylommatophora (snails and slugs; 24.1%). Herbivores and detritivores were the trophic groups with the highest proportion of plastic-positive samples (15.4% and 10.2%, respectively). Although the prevalence was lower in carnivores, these animals ingested significantly larger microplastics when compared with other trophic levels. The most abundant polymers were polyester, polyethylene, polypropylene, nylon, and polyacrylamide. Polyester was present across all taxonomic groups and trophic levels, along with varying amounts of other polymers. The lack of correspondence between soil samples and invertebrate samples highlights the requirement to survey a range of invertebrates as well as soil to gain a full insight of the level of contamination in each site to ensure that the correct conclusions are drawn.

AB  - The waste generated during metal mining activities contains mixtures of heavy metals (HM) that are not biodegradable and can accumulate in the surrounding biota, increasing risk to human and environmental health. Plant species with the capacity to grow and develop on mine tailings can be used as a model system in phytoremediation studies. Dodonaea viscosa (L.) Jacq. is a shrub with wide geographical distribution and the ability to establish itself in mine tailings. The Sierra de Huautla Biosphere Reserve in Mexico contains a metallurgic district where mining activities have generated 780 million kg of waste with large concentrations of toxic heavy metals, mainly cadmium and lead. The present study evaluated the phytoremediation potential of D. viscosa in in situ conditions on soils contaminated with HMs (exposed) and reference sites (non-exposed) for one year. Also, the effects of cadmium (Cd) and lead (Pb) exposure in D. viscosa were analyzed via DNA damage (comet assay) morphological and physiological characters in exposed vs non-exposed individuals. The concentration of Cd and Pb was measured through atomic absorption spectrophotometry in the roots and leaves of plants. In total, 120 D. viscosa individuals were established, 60 growing in exposed and 60 in non-exposed soils. Exposed individuals of D. viscosa hyperaccumulated Cd and Pb in roots and leaves. At the end of the experiment, eight out of twelve characters under evaluation decreased significantly in HM-exposed plants in relation to individuals growing in non-exposed soils, except for stomatal index, stomatal coverage, and fresh leaf biomass. The micro-morphological and physiological traits of D. viscosa were not influenced by Cd and Pb bioaccumulation. In contrast, the bioaccumulation of Cd and Pb significantly influenced the macro-morphological characters and genetic damage; this last biomarker was 3.2 times higher in plants growing in exposed sites. The bioconcentration factor (BCF) of Cd and Pb in root and leaf tissue increased significantly over time. The mean BCF in root and leaf tissue was higher for Pb (877.58 and 798.77) than for Cd (50.86 and 23.02). After 12 months of exposure, D. viscosa individuals growing on mine tailing substrate showed that the total HM phytoextraction capacity was 7.56 kg center dot ha-1 for Pb and 0.307 kg center dot ha-1 for Cd. D. viscosa shows potential for phytoremediation of soils contaminated with Cd and Pb, given its capacity for establishing and developing naturally in contaminated soils with HM. Along with its bioaccumulation, biomass production, abundance, and high levels of bioconcentration factors, but without affecting plant development and not registering associated herbivores, it may incorporate HM into the trophic chain.

AB  - Luminescent technology based on the luciferin-luciferase reaction has been extensively employed across various disciplines as a quantitative imaging modality. Owing to its non-invasive imaging capacity, it has evolved as a valuable in vivo bioimaging tool, particularly in small animal models in fields such as gene and cell therapies. We have previously successfully generated rats with a systemic expression of the luciferase gene at the Rosa26 locus. In this study, we transplanted bone marrow from these rats into micro-mini pigs and used in vivo imaging to non-invasively analyze the dynamics of the transplanted cells. In addition, we established that the rat-to-pig transplantation system is a discordant system, similar to the pig-to-human transplantation system. Thus, rat-to-pig transplantation may provide a clinically appropriate large animal model for pig-to-human xenotransplantation.

AB  - Environmental enrichment is an animal husbandry principle that seeks to provide the stimuli necessary for the optimal physiological and psychological well-being of animals. Due to primates having highly developed visual systems, there have been limited attempts to quantify the benefit of olfactory enrichment on captive primate populations. We aim to investigate how a range of odors may influence the behaviors of two captive New World primate species that have varying reliance on olfactory pathways, black-capped capuchin (Sapajus apella) and common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus), at the National Zoo and Aquarium, Canberra, Australia. We presented three odors (rosemary oil, Salvia rosmarinus, banana essence and white-tailed deer urine, Odocoileus virginianus) four different times to the two species following a 12-week randomized schedule. Using instantaneous scan sampling we collected behavioral and direct cloth interaction (DCI) data on 40 days. We then calculated activity budgets. Results show both species significantly respond to different olfactory conditions. S. apella responded to banana by decreasing inactivity (df = 4, F = 6.600, p = .007), and increasing DCI frequencies (df = 3, F = 116.196, p < .0001) whereas C. jacchus was influenced by rosemary and deer urine-also reducing inactivity levels (df= 4, F = 15.938, p < .0001), but not changing DCI frequencies. We also tested habituation however it is not significant for either species over the course of the study. This comparative investigation is one of the first of its kind and uncovers the possibility for olfactory stimulus to be successfully used as a type of beneficial environmental enrichment for captive primates, supporting the constructive and ongoing development of enrichment programs at captive facilities.

AB  - The system of gulcosinoalte sulfatase-sulfatase-modifying factors (Sumfs) in herbivorous insects fulfils an essential function in defending host plant glucosinolates (GLSs)-the compounds of cruciferous plants-by swiftly desulfurising them. Previously, eight HaSulfs and one HaSumf1 were identified in Helicoverpa armigera. GLSs have a significant impact on the growth and development of H. armigera larvae. They can induce the expression of HaSulf in the midgut of H. armigera at both gene and protein levels. In the present study, we utilised RNAi technology to silence the HaSumf1 gene and explored its potential impact on the growth, development, and adaptation of GLSs. The sequence analysis has indicated that the HaSumf1 gene in H. armigera shares a high degree of sequence identity with other insect genes and is expressed at its highest level in the fifth-instar phase. Additionally, the qRT-PCR results reveal that the expression of HaSumf1 was upregulated by 1.26 and 0.07 times in third-instar and 1.65 and 0.19 times in fifth-instar when fed with 0.004% and 0.04% GLS, respectively. The effectiveness of dsSumf1 silencing was observed in both third- and fifth-instar stages, with silencing rates of 65.5%-88.9% and 61.3%-74.6%, respectively (p < 0.05). The findings of the bioassay indicate that H. armigera's body weight at fifth-instar significantly increased after treatment with 0.004% GLS and 0.04% GLS, while the larval survival rate, pupation rate, and pupa weight decreased. Notably, when feeding dsRNA-encapsulated carbon quantum dots (CQD-dsRNA), this trend was significantly strengthened (p < 0.05). Taken together, these findings provide evidence supporting HaSumf1's conservation involvement in the adaptation of host plant GLSs during lepidopteran insect evolution. Therefore, it plays a critical role in the growth and development of H. armigera, offering molecular targets for developing novel pesticides and targeted control measures against this vital pest.

AB  - A herd of 15 Chinese elephants attracted international attention during their 2021 northward trek, motivating the government to propose establishment of an Asian elephant national park. However, planning is hampered by a lack of genetic information on the remaining populations in China. We collected DNA from 497 dung samples from all 5 populations encompassing the entire range of elephants in China and used mitochondrial and microsatellite markers to investigate their genetic and demographic structure. We identified 237 unique genotypes (153 females, 84 males), representing 81% of the known population. However, the effective population size was small (28, range 25-32). Historic demographic contraction appeared to account for low haplotype diversity (H-d = 0.235), but moderate nucleotide and nuclear diversity (pi = 0.6%, H-e = 0.55) was attributable to post-bottleneck recovery involving recent population expansion plus historical gene exchange with elephants in Myanmar, Lao PDR, and Vietnam. The 5 populations fell into 3 clusters, with Nangunhe elephants differing consistently from the other 4 populations (F-ST = 0.23); elephants from Mengyang, Simao, and Jiangcheng belonged to a single population (henceforth, MSJ), and differed from the Shangyong population (F-ST = 0.11). Interpopulation genetic variation reflected isolation by distance and female-biased dispersal. Chinese elephants should be managed as 2 distinct units: Nangunhe and another combining Shangyong and MSJ; their long-term viability will require restoring gene flow between Shangyong and MSJ, and between elephants in China and neighboring countries. Our results have the potential to inform conservation planning for an iconic megafaunal species.

AB  - Schreiber's bent-winged bat Miniopterus schreibersii and the greater horseshoe bat Rhinolophus ferrumequinum are widespread and common cavernicolous species across southern Europe that host numerous specialized ectoparasite species. The objective of this study was to characterize the species assemblage, genetic diversity, and host specificity of bat flies (Nycteribiidae, Diptera) and wing mites (Spinturnicidae, Acari) found on these bat hosts in Serbia and Bosnia and Herzegovina. Notably, while bat flies lay puparia on the cave walls and can thus be transmitted indirectly, wing mites require direct body contact for transmission. Morphological identification and sequencing of a 710-bp fragment of cytochrome oxidase I gene of 207 bat flies yielded 4 species, 3 on M. schreibersii and 1 on R. ferrumequinum. Sequencing of a 460-bp small subunit ribosomal RNA fragment, in all 190 collected wing mites revealed 2 species, 1 per host. In no case was a parasite associated with 1 host found on the other host. Species and genetic diversity of flies were higher in M. schreibersii, likely reflecting their host's larger colony sizes and migratory potential. Mite species of both hosts showed similarly low diversity, likely due to their faster life history and lower winter survival. Our findings highlight a remarkably high host-specificity and segregation of ectoparasite species despite direct contact among their hosts in the roost, suggesting a defined host preference in the investigated ectoparasite species. Furthermore, the differences in ectoparasite genetic diversity exemplify the interplay between host and parasite life histories in shaping parasite population genetic structure.

AB  - Maternal hyperhomocysteinemia causes the disruption of placental blood flow and can lead to serious disturbances in the formation of the offspring's brain. In the present study, the effects of prenatal hyperhomocysteinemia (PHHC) on the neuronal migration, neural tissue maturation, and the expression of signaling molecules in the rat fetal brain were described. Maternal hyperhomocysteinemia was induced in female rats by per os administration of 0.15% aqueous methionine solution in the period of days 4-21 of pregnancy. Behavioral tests revealed a delay in PHHC male pups maturing. Ultrastructure of both cortical and hippocampus tissue demonstrated the features of the developmental delay. PHHC was shown to disturb both generation and radial migration of neuroblasts into the cortical plate. Elevated Bdnf expression, together with changes in proBDNF/mBDNF balance, might affect neuronal cell viability, positioning, and maturation in PHHC pups. Reduced Kdr gene expression and the content of SEMA3E might lead to impaired brain development. In the brain tissue of E20 PHHC fetuses, the content of the procaspase-8 was decreased, and the activity level of the caspase-3 was increased; this may indicate the development of apoptosis. PHHC disturbs the mechanisms of early brain development leading to a delay in brain tissue maturation and formation of the motor reaction of pups.

AB  - Simple Summary Is our ability to discriminate speech in noise an innate and fixed ability, or can it be increased by a perceptual learning task? And if this is the case, can we find neural correlates of this improved perceptual ability? To address this question, we trained adult mice to discriminate between acoustically similar calls from guinea pigs, first in quiet, then in two types of masking noise at three different signal-to-noise ratios. The mice performance was excellent in quiet and decreased when the signal-to-noise became negative. After three months of training, we recorded the auditory responses in auditory brainstem neurons (inferior colliculus) and found that their responses tended to be stronger and more discriminative than those of passively exposed mice and, more surprisingly, sometimes stronger and more discriminative than those of guinea pigs. These results exemplify the fact that extensive practice in a perceptual learning task can improve the way auditory neurons process speech-like sounds in noise.Abstract Humans and animals maintain accurate discrimination between communication sounds in the presence of loud sources of background noise. In previous studies performed in anesthetized guinea pigs, we showed that, in the auditory pathway, the highest discriminative abilities between conspecific vocalizations were found in the inferior colliculus. Here, we trained CBA/J mice in a Go/No-Go task to discriminate between two similar guinea pig whistles, first in quiet conditions, then in two types of noise, a stationary noise and a chorus noise at three SNRs. Control mice were passively exposed to the same number of whistles as trained mice. After three months of extensive training, inferior colliculus (IC) neurons were recorded under anesthesia and the responses were quantified as in our previous studies. In quiet, the mean values of the firing rate, the temporal reliability and mutual information obtained from trained mice were higher than from the exposed mice and the guinea pigs. In stationary and chorus noise, there were only a few differences between the trained mice and the guinea pigs; and the lowest mean values of the parameters were found in the exposed mice. These results suggest that behavioral training can trigger plasticity in IC that allows mice neurons to reach guinea pig-like discrimination abilities.

AB  - Roadsides are targeted for restoration of pollinator-friendly plants. Yet, roads are sources of macronutrient, micronutrient and heavy metal pollution that may contaminate roadside plants. Adjacent landscape features such as railroads and agriculture provide additional macronutrient and heavy metal pollution that may exacerbate traffic effects. However, we lack perspective on how roads combine with rural landscape features to influence nutrition of roadside plants, which could have implications for pollinator health.We surveyed roadsides across Minnesota, USA and measured foliar levels of dietary macronutrients (nitrogen, phosphorous and potassium), a micronutrient (sodium) and metals (iron, zinc, copper, chromium, nickel, lead, aluminium and cadmium) in six abundant roadside forb species used by insect pollinators: Asclepias syriaca, Dalea purpurea, Monarda fistulosa, Ratibida pinnata, Solidago spp. and Trifolium pratense. We aimed to determine (1) how road variables (traffic volume and distance from road) combine with adjacent land use (railroad and agriculture) to influence element content of roadside forbs and (2) whether some forb species show consistent differences in their accumulation of potentially toxic heavy metals, which could inform selection of species to plant along roadsides.We found that foliar concentrations of nine elements increased with greater traffic volume (nitrogen, phosphorous, iron, zinc, copper, chromium, nickel, lead and aluminium), and concentrations of six elements declined with distance from the road (nitrogen, phosphorous, potassium, iron, zinc and copper). Leaves collected adjacent to railroad had less phosphorous, potassium, iron, nickel and aluminium than leaves collected from sites not adjacent to railroad. Additionally, leaves collected from sites adjacent to agriculture had lower copper levels than leaves from sites without adjacent agriculture. We found no evidence that particular ford species along roadsides consistently rank higher than other species in their accumulation of heavy metals.Our results show that traffic alters more elements in roadside plants than does adjacent landscape context, alleviating concerns that landscape features exacerbate pollutant levels in roadside pollinator habitat. However, nutrient contamination of most roadside plants is unlikely to reach toxic levels for insect pollinators. This work is consistent with the positive conservation potential of low to moderate traffic roadsides for pollinators.

AB  - A new locality in Central Europe (Krosinko, Poland) yields a rich fossil material of great taxonomical variety. Its location in the Warsaw-Berlin ice-marginal valley, where it forms a 1-m horizon at a the depth of 6-8 m, is suited to a taphonomic analysis aimed at reconstructing the paleoevents and depositional history of the late Pleistocene (MIS 3-2).Our analysis revealed that the material accumulated as the result of high-energy fluvial transport. This transport disturbed the original bone associations, as indicated by the lack of articulation, low refitting, and bone surface modification. During water movement, the bones were polished, abraded, pitted, and fragmented. Prior to that, however, taphonomic signatures were left behind by predators, humans, and plant roots. This is the first time that unquestionable burning marks have been found on woolly rhino remains from Poland.The secondary context of the faunal assemblage was confirmed by neodymium isotope studies of the faunal fragments and sediment. Given the results of sedimentological analysis from previous studies, these sediments can be associated with a high-energy braided river. The remains were moved along with paleobotanical material and flints in a westerly direction; this is suggested by the direction of water flows in the valley and the river waters supplying it. The deposition occurred within a single geologic event around 26 ka BP, as indicated by the youngest radiocarbon date of the remains, or ca. 19 ka BP, considering the geochronological constraints for the local LGM ice margin position in central and eastern Poland -22-18 ka, and the specified accumulation time of the sediments in which they were found. Secondary mineralization of manganese and iron on the bones was the final taphonomical process that impacted the remains. The combined taphonomic, palaeozoological, isotopic and geological results show for the first time for a Polish paleontological site how data integration improves interpretation and highlights the advantages of a multiproxy approach.

AB  - In the hippocampus, episodic memories are thought to be encoded by the formation of ensembles of synaptically coupled CA3 pyramidal cells driven by sparse but powerful mossy fiber inputs from dentate gyrus granule cells. The neuromodulators acetylcholine and noradrenaline are separately proposed as saliency signals that dictate memory encoding but it is not known if they represent distinct signals with separate mechanisms. Here, we show experimentally that acetylcholine, and to a lesser extent noradrenaline, suppress feed-forward inhibition and enhance excitatory-inhibitory ratio in the mossy fiber pathway but CA3 recurrent network properties are only altered by acetylcholine. We explore the implications of these findings on CA3 ensemble formation using a hierarchy of models. In reconstructions of CA3 pyramidal cells, mossy fiber pathway disinhibition facilitates postsynaptic dendritic depolarization known to be required for synaptic plasticity at CA3-CA3 recurrent synapses. We further show in a spiking neural network model of CA3 how acetylcholine-specific network alterations can drive rapid overlapping ensemble formation. Thus, through these distinct sets of mechanisms, acetylcholine and noradrenaline facilitate the formation of neuronal ensembles in CA3 that encode salient episodic memories in the hippocampus but acetylcholine selectively enhances the density of memory storage.
   Author summary
   How the brain decides which experiences to encode to memory and which to discard is a fundamental question in neuroscience. The neuromodulators acetylcholine and noradrenaline are believed to separately play a central role in determining what is encoded but the mechanisms by which they act are mostly unknown and there have been no direct comparisons made between these two critical neuromodulators. In this study, we investigate the effects of acetylcholine and noradrenaline on a key circuit responsible for the encoding of memories, namely, the dentate gyrus-CA3 microcircuit in the hippocampus. Using slice electrophysiology, we measure the effects of acetylcholine and noradrenaline on key synaptic and cellular nodes within this neuronal network. We then explore the network level implications of these findings on neuronal ensemble formation using a hierarchy of computational models. Based on the observed physiological effects of acetylcholine and noradrenaline, our models predict that acetylcholine facilitates efficient formation of ensembles within CA3 with a high degree of overlap whereas noradrenaline has more limited effects and no impact on the efficiency or overlap of ensemble formation.

AB  - Chronic pain affects approximately 20% of the world's population, exerting a substantial burden on the affected individual, their families, and healthcare systems globally. Deficits in autobiographical memory have been identified among individuals living with chronic pain, and even found to pose a risk for the transition to chronicity. Recent neuroimaging studies have simultaneously implicated common brain regions central to autobiographical memory processing in the maintenance of and susceptibility to chronic pain. The present review proposes a novel neurocognitive framework for chronic pain explained by mechanisms underlying the autobiographical memory system. Here, we 1) summarize the current literature on autobiographical memory in pain, 2) discuss the role of the hippocampus and cortical brain regions including the ventromedial prefrontal cortex, anterior temporal lobe, and amygdala in relation to autobiographical memory, memory schemas, emotional processing, and pain, 3) synthesize these findings in a neurocognitive framework that explains these relationships and their implications for patients' pain outcomes, and 4) propose translational directions for the prevention, management, and treatment of chronic pain.

AB  - Environmental enrichment (EE) improves memory, particularly the ability to discriminate similar past experiences. 1-6 The hippocampus supports this ability via pattern separation, the encoding of similar events using dissimilar memory representations. 7 This is carried out in the dentate gyrus (DG) and CA3 subfields. 8-12 Upregulation of adult neurogenesis in the DG improves memory through enhanced pattern separation. 1-6,11,13-16 Adult -born granule cells (abGCs) in DG are suggested to contribute to pattern separation by driving inhibition in regions such as CA3, 13-18 leading to sparser, nonoverlapping representations of similar events (although a role for abGCs in driving excitation in the hippocampus has also been reported 16 ). Place cells in the hippocampus contribute to pattern separation by remapping to spatial and contextual alterations to the environment. 19-27 How spatial responses in CA3 are affected by EE and input from increased numbers of abGCs in DG is, however, unknown. Here, we investigate the neural mechanisms facilitating improved memory following EE using associative recognition memory tasks that model the automatic and integrative nature of episodic memory. We find that EE -dependent improvements in difficult discriminations are related to increased neurogenesis and sparser memory representations across the hippocampus. Additionally, we report for the first time that EE changes how CA3 place cells discriminate similar contexts. CA3 place cells of enriched rats show greater spatial tuning, increased firing rates, and enhanced remapping to contextual changes. These findings point to more precise and flexible CA3 memory representations in enriched rats, which provides a putative mechanism for EE -dependent improvements in fine memory discrimination.

AB  - Miniature energy storage devices simultaneously combining high energy output and bioavailability could greatly promote the practicability of green, safe, and nontoxic in vivo detection, such as for noninvasive monitoring or treatment in the gastrointestinal tract, which is still challenging. Herein, we report ingestible and nutritive zinc-ion-based hybrid micro-supercapacitors (ZMSCs) consisting of an edible active carbon microcathode and zinc microanode, which can be inserted into a standard-sized capsule and ingested in a pig stomach. With features including flexibility, light weight, and shape adaptability, a single micro device displays a high energy density of 215.1 mu Wh cm(-2), superior to that of state-of-the-art biocompatible SCs/MSCs and even traditional ZMSCs reported previously. It also delivers an areal capacitance of 605 mF cm-2 and a high working voltage of 1.8 V, exceeding that of miniaturized commercial button batteries (1.55 V, RENATA 337). Comprehensive studies in vivo and in vitro demonstrate that the ZMSCs with high biocompatibility and safety not only power electronic equipment in the porcine stomach without a voltage booster but also act as a nutritional supplement of trace element zinc within the dose range, as well as the ability of potent antibacterial activity against bacterium Escherichia coli during the discharging process. This work provides an example for the design and fabrication of edible energy storage devices with high performance.

AB  - Simple Summary The translocation of elephants is a management tool developed in the 1980s during the culling operations at the Kruger National Park, South Africa, to remove "surplus" elephants from fenced properties. Elephants live in large social networks and form strong social bonds within their family units. In particular, the mother-offspring bond is crucial to the learning and development of social skills and social and environmental competence of the calves. The leadership role and experience of the matriarch appear to be an important factor in providing the necessary knowledge to optimise social and environmental skills and competence. The translocation of smaller groups of elephants results in the social disruption of these networks. This paper looks at the social and ecological aspects of such disruption and what it implies for elephants. A herd of Orphans and a translocated herd consisting of two families were observed over several years. The Orphans demonstrated marked effects of social disruption by splitting more frequently and for longer periods than the family herd and experiencing accelerated reproduction. Social disruption may therefore reduce learning opportunities with implications for elephant society as well as for conservation. African elephants (Loxodonta africana) exhibit a long developmental period during which they acquire complex social and ecological knowledge through social networks. Central to this is that matriarchs and older individuals play an important role as repositories of information gained through experience. Anthropogenic interventions-including poaching, culling, translocation, and hunting-can disrupt elephants' social networks, with implications for individual fitness and potential long-term population viability. Here, we draw on a unique long-running, individual-based dataset to examine the impacts of translocation on a population of elephants in South Africa, taking into consideration demographic rates, social dynamics, and ecological decision-making. Specifically, we compared two translocated groups: a group of unrelated culling Orphans and a family herd. We found that the Orphan group experienced accelerated reproductive rates when compared with the family herd. The Orphan group also fissioned more frequently and for longer periods of time, suggesting lower cohesiveness, and were less decisive in their large-scale movement decisions. These results add to the growing body of literature on the downstream impacts of social disruption for elephants. Whilst the translocation of culling Orphans is no longer practised in South Africa, we encourage careful consideration of any elephant translocation and the resulting social disruption.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Dissolved oxygen (DO) in semen dilutor may lead to the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and buffalo sperm may become more prone to deleterious effects of ROS due to the presence of high amounts of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) in their membranes. OBJECTIVE: To study the correlation between dissolved oxygen level, antioxidants and oxidants in semen diluted with partially deoxygenated extender at various stages of cryopreservation. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Each semen sample was split into two aliquots viz., Aliquot I [diluted with Extender I (control: without deoxygenation)] and Aliquot II [diluted with Extender II: partially deoxygenated by liquid nitrogen (LN) flushing], which were diluted, filled in straws, cryopreserved and evaluated post-thaw. RESULTS: The DO levels (P < 0.05) decreased significantly after LN flushing of the extender and they increased significantly (P < 0.05) in post-thaw semen. The progressive motility, viability, hypo-osmotic swelling response, acrosomal integrity, glutathione peroxidase (GPx), total antioxidant capacity (TAC) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) decreased significantly (P < 0.05) in both control and treated semen after thawing. SOD and TAC were positively correlated in semen treated with normal extender at the pre-freeze stage; however, in semen treated with partially deoxygenated extender, no correlation was found between SOD and TAC at the pre-freeze stage. ROS and total TAC were negatively correlated in semen treated with partially deoxygenated extender at the pre-freeze stage; however, no correlation was found between ROS and TAC in control semen. CONCLUSION: The partial deoxygenation of extender affects the correlation between sperm quality parameters, antioxidants, and oxidants during different stages of semen cryopreservation.

AB  - Decreased cognitive performance is a hallmark of brain aging, but the underlying mechanisms and potential therapeutic avenues remain poorly understood. Recent studies have revealed health-protective and lifespan-extending effects of dietary spermidine, a natural autophagy-promoting polyamine. Here, we show that dietary spermidine passes the blood-brain barrier in mice and increases hippocampal eIF5A hypusination and mitochondrial function. Spermidine feeding in aged mice affects behavior in homecage environment tasks, improves spatial learning, and increases hippocampal respiratory competence. In a Drosophila aging model, spermidine boosts mitochondrial respiratory capacity, an effect that requires the autophagy regulator Atg7 and the mitophagy mediators Parkin and Pink1. Neuron-specific Pink1 knockdown abolishes spermidine-induced improvement of olfactory associative learning. This suggests that the maintenance of mitochondrial and autophagic function is essential for enhanced cognition by spermidine feeding. Finally, we show large-scale prospective data linking higher dietary spermidine intake with a reduced risk for cognitive impairment in humans.

AB  - Simple Summary Due to gene pool insufficiency, it is clear to use the best breeds of sheep for meat. Multiple Ovulation and Embryotransfer Technology (MOET) is applied to improve the genetic and production performance of high-value ewes. This article presents cryoresistance data for Charollais sheep embryos, considering the stage of embryo development and the freezing method. No significant differences in survival rate and morphological structure between cryopreserved and fresh embryos were found. But, cryoresistance largely depended on embryonic development stages. Thus, cryopreservation of embryos at the 6 days after insemination was more effective than freezing 2-3-day embryos after insemination. The data obtained is believed to make assisted reproductive technologies (ART) more effective and cheaper. This article will be interesting for farm producers, breeders and researchers. This article presents data from experiments to determine the cryoresistance of Charollais sheep embryos, depending on the stage of embryo development and the method of freezing, as well as the results of embryo transfer. The study design consisted of a study on the cryopreservation of ewe embryos at different developmental stages (early, 2-8 blastomeric and late, at the morula/blastocyst stage), two cryopreservation protocols (slow freezing and ultra-fast vitrification), and embryo transfer of cryo- and fresh embryos. Embryos from Charollais sheep donors (n = 12) were recovered after induction of superovulation. The embryos were recovered surgically (laparotomy) on days 2 and 6 after insemination. Before there was transfer to recipients, part of embryos was cryopreserved using standard slow freezing and ultra-fast vitrification methods. The average ovarian response was 7.54 ovulations per donor, and 5.83 embryos per donor were collected. No effect of the cryopreservation method and embryo development stage on the preservation of the morphological structure of embryos was found. There were no significant differences in the survival rate of cryoembryos at different development stages, frozen using different techniques, and after transfer to recipients. Differences in cryoresistance between embryonic developmental stages in favor of the morula/blastocyst stage were found (survival after thawing 86.4% vs. 75.0% in early embryos). At different stages of development, the survival rate of fresh embryos (45.8%) compared to cryopreserved ones (30.2%) was significantly higher (p < 0.05), while among fresh ones, the best survival rate (50.0%) was observed after the transfer of morules and blastocysts.

AB  - Cities in which the synurbization of some important predators began simultaneously with or earlier than the synurbization of prey species are a precious tool for studying the specificity of predator-prey interactions in urban landscapes. The city of Moscow is an excellent example. The following bird species can be considered synurbic in the city: Tadorna ferruginea (introduced), Bucephala clangula (a successfully introduced species, but the breeding population has declined dramatically since 2010), Anas platyrhynchos (reintroduced), Accipiter gentilis, Falco subbuteo, F. tinnunculus, Corvus cornix, Turdus pilaris, Parus major, and Cyanistes caeruleus. Accipiter nisus, Gallinula chloropus, Asio otus, Motacilla alba, Lanius collurio, Sturnus vulgaris, Hippolais icterina, Sylvia atricapilla, Muscicapa striata, Erithacus rubecula, Luscinia luscinia, Turdus philomelos, T. merula, Fringilla coelebs, Carduelis chloris, and C. carduelis are also successful inhabitants of the city, although their maximum breeding densities in urban green spaces are not obviously higher than those in rural/natural landscapes. A huge and dense population of Corvus cornix, an important nest predator, was formed in the Moscow City during the 1960's and early 1970's. The urban population of Accipiter gentilis varying during the last decades around 35-40 pairs yearly was developed between the late 1970's and early 1990's. Currently, some areas within the city support comparatively diverse predator assemblages. For example, the 1.7-km2 initial area of the Lomonosov Moscow State University at Vorobyovy Gory contains at least 18 predatory species of mammals and birds in the breeding season, including Falco peregrinus, F. subbuteo, F. tinnunculus, Accipiter nisus, Asio otus, Garrulus glandarius, etc. At the same time, some important predators like most mustelids are lacking or rare in Moscow. The order and approximate timing of the establishment of urban populations of different species indicate that a number of avian prey species have reached or been able to support high breeding densities in urban green spaces simultaneously with and/or after the synurbization of important predators. In several prey species studied at some localities of the city over the last decades, the proportion of depredated nests was, on average, relatively moderate for a given species (in Turdus philomelos) or sufficiently low (in Parus major, Cyanistes caeruleus, Turdus pilaris). In general, these conclusions are supported by published data on the same or other prey species from some other cities located in the European part of Russia (Kaliningrad, Ryazan', Voronezh). Even in the presence of numerous predators, urban environments are more or less successfully occupied by substantial numbers of avian prey species from distant taxa and different ecological groups. Among them, there are many open-nesters which clutches and nestlings are highly vulnerable to such predators as corvids and owls. To conclude, a negative answer, although with some reservations, must be given to the question: are predators a difficult barrier for the synurbization of avian prey species?

AB  - The spread of invasive pests can exacerbate the threat of pest stress to agricultural production. Screening natural antifeedants from the secondary metabolites of plants may provide efficient alternative control methods for the integrated management of invasive pests. Therefore, in this study, the three phenolic substances were evenly mixed with the artificial diet at mass ratios of 1:200 and 1:40, respectively. The treatment groups were labeled as follows: vanillic acid (Va1: 1:200, Va2: 1:40), sinapic acid (Si1: 1:200, Si2: 1:40), and syringic acid (Sy1: 1:200, Sy2: 1:40). Subsequently, the feed intake, body weight, protein content, and digestive enzyme activity of the S. frugiperda feeding were measured. This research was extended to the pupal and adult stages, focusing on pupation rate, pupal weight, adult emergence rate, and adult longevity. The results showed that the food intake and body weight of the 4th-6th instars of S. frugiperda decreased significantly after feeding on the different ratios of phenolic substances. Although the protein accumulation of the 4th-5th-instar larvae was inhibited, the protein content of the 6th-instar larvae showed significant accumulation, with that of the Va2 and Sy1 treatment groups being 124.84% and 165.07% of that of the control, respectively. At the same time, the trypsin activity of the 4th-6th-instar larvae in different treatment groups significantly increased, while the activities of pepsin and alpha-amylase fluctuated but overall showed an increasing trend. The interference of vanillic acid, sinapic acid, and syringic acid on the digestion and absorption of the larvae limited the pupation rate but did not have a significant effect on the pupal weight. All three phenolic substances reduced the adult emergence rate, but unlike the sinapic acid and syringic acid treatments, vanillic acid also had a negative impact on adult longevity. These results can provide material reserves for the development of antifeedants for S. frugiperda, and can also provide optimal plans for its ecofriendly prevention and control.

TI  - Study on the Application of Straw Carbon as Reductant in the Recovery of Iron from High-Iron Red Mud
T2  - JOM
LA  - English
AB  - The recovery of iron from high-iron red mud is an important method for the large-scale utilization of red mud. Traditional fossil energy sources such as coking coal are usually used as reducing agents in the smelt reduction process of high-iron red mud, but they are not conducive to the early achievement of carbon neutrality in China. Straw carbon is a clean energy source with over 65% carbon content. Thus, the feasibility of straw carbon as a reducing agent to recover iron from high-iron red mud was investigated. Pig iron was obtained under the optimal reduction conditions of experimental temperature of 1400 degrees C, alkalinity of 0.8, reduction duration of 20 min, M-CaF2/M-CaO of 4%, and carbon matching ratio of 1.1. More than 99% of the iron was recovered, and the results showed that straw carbon, which could effectively replace coking coal, achieved good results in the recovery of iron from high-iron red mud.

AB  - Pig epiblast-derived pluripotent stem cells are considered to have great potential and broad prospects for human therapeutic model development and livestock breeding. Despite ongoing attempts since the 1990s, no stably defined pig epiblast-derived stem cell line has been established. Here, guided by insights from a large-scale single-cell transcriptome analysis of pig embryos from embryonic day (E) 0 to E14, specifically, the tracing of pluripotency changes during epiblast development, we developed an in vitro culture medium for establishing and maintaining stable pluripotent stem cell lines from pig E10 pregastrulation epiblasts (pgEpiSCs). Enabled by chemical inhibition of WNT-related signaling in combination with growth factors in the FGF/ERK, JAK/STAT3, and Activin/Nodal pathways, pgEpiSCs maintain their pluripotency transcriptome features, similar to those of E10 epiblast cells, and normal karyotypes after more than 240 passages and have the potential to differentiate into three germ layers. Strikingly, ultradeep in situ Hi-C analysis revealed functional impacts of chromatin 3D-spatial associations on the transcriptional regulation of pluripotency marker genes in pgEpiSCs. In practice, we confirmed that pgEpiSCs readily tolerate at least three rounds of successive gene editing and generated cloned gene-edited live piglets. Our findings deliver on the long-anticipated promise of pig pluripotent stem cells and open new avenues for biological research, animal husbandry, and regenerative biomedicine.

AB  - Bisphenol AP (BPAP), a structural analog of bisphenol A (BPA), has been widely detected in environment and biota. BPAP was reported to interfere with hormone and metabolism, while limited data were available about its effects on neurobehavior, especially exposure to it during early-life time. A mouse model of early-life BPAP exposure was established to evaluate the long-term neurobehaviors in offspring. Collectively, early-life BPAP exposure caused anxiety-like behaviors and impaired learning and memory in adult offspring. Through brain bulk RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq), we found differential expressed genes were enriched in pathways related to behaviors and neurodevelopment, which were consistent with the observed phenotype. Besides, single-nucleus RNA-sequencing (snRNA-seq) showed BPAP exposure altered the transcriptome of microglia in hippocampus. Mechanistically, BPAP exposure induced inflammations in hippocampus through upregulating Iba-1 and acti-vating the microglia. In addition, we observed that BPAP exposure could activate peripheral immunity and promote proportion of macrophages and activation of dendritic cells in the offspring. In conclusion, early-life exposure to BPAP impaired neurobehaviors in adult offspring accompanied with excessive activation of hippo-campal microglia. Our findings provide new clues to the underlying mechanisms of BPAP's neurotoxic effects and therefore more cautions should be taken about BPAP.

AB  - Establishing a payment for environmental services scheme is an effective way to promote the process of cleaner production in livestock husbandry, and the determination of payment for environmental services standards is the key to constructing the scheme for cleaner production in livestock husbandry. Based on 1,629 survey data from 9 provinces of Hunan, Henan, Shandong, Hebei, Hubei, Jiangxi, Liaoning, Anhui and Heilongjiang, this paper uses the Heckman-ISM model to analyze the impact of pig farm households' willingness to accept payment for cleaner production and the influencing factors of anticipated payment level. The study found that the size of the farmer, the operator, experience, perceptions about the payment for environmental services policy, the degree of specialization and the household structure can influence the level of compensation of the policy to some extent. In the influence mechanism of the anticipated level compensation, the awareness of the ecological value of cleaner production and cleaner production policy is the direct factors at the surface; the degree of specialization, government officials and non-local markets county are intermediate indirect factors, while gender, education level and urban residence are deep root factors. Based on these findings, this paper puts forward policy suggestions such as vigorously publicizing payment for environmental services for cleaner production in livestock husbandry.

AB  - The nasal mucosa is a crucial filtering organ to prevent attachment and invasion of pathogens. To assess nasal health in relation to lung health, transverse cross sections of the nasal turbinates of 121 pigs suffering from respiratory disease and sent for diagnostic necropsy were scored visually and by an artificial intelligence (AI) medical diagnostic application (AI DIAGNOS), resulting in a high correlation of both scores (p < 0.001). Nasal samples of the diseased pigs were examined only for Bordetella (B.) bronchiseptica (PCR and bacteriological culture) and Pasteurella (P.) multocida (bacteriological culture). All pigs showed various degrees of inflammatory lung tissue alterations, and 35.5% of the pigs had atrophy of the nasal turbinates with no relation to detection rates of B. bronchiseptica (54.5%) and P. multocida (29.0%) in the nose. All P. multocida strains from nose samples were negative for the toxA gene so non-progressive atrophic rhinitis was diagnosed. Pigs positive for B. bronchiseptica in the nose were more often positive for B. bronchiseptica in the lung (p < 0.001) and for other bacterial species in the lower respiratory tract (p = 0.005). The new diagnostic application for scoring cross sections of nasal turbinates is a valuable tool for a fast and reproducible diagnostic.

AB  - In Switzerland, reindeer are exclusively kept in captivity. The aim of the present work was to evaluate and summarize management and feeding practices, and to examine the prevalence of endoparasite infections in Swiss reindeer. A total of 67 animals from eight different farms and zoos were evaluated. On two visits to the farms and zoos, a standardized questionnaire was completed by the breeders and/or animal husbandry managers, the animals were weighed, and fecal samples were collected. All reindeer were fed roughage ad libitum and supplementary feed for reindeer or other browsers, with different compositions in each herd. The prevalence of gastrointestinal strongyles was 68.6%, with reindeer in zoos having a lower prevalence than reindeer from private farms. This study presents an overview on husbandry, feeding, and endoparasite prevalence in captive reindeer in Switzerland and provides basic data for breeders and veterinarians dealing with this deer species.The aim of the present work was to provide an overview of management and feeding practices, and the prevalence of endoparasite infections in captive Swiss reindeer. On two visits to eight farms or zoos, a standardized questionnaire was completed. A total of 67 reindeer were weighed, and fecal samples were collected. The primary management concerns voiced by owners/managers were feeding and successful breeding. All reindeer were fed roughage ad libitum and supplementary feed for reindeer or other browsers, with different compositions in each herd. Males over two years of age weighed from 60 kg up to 127.5 kg, whereas females had a body weight from 53.5 kg to 86.5 kg. The prevalence of gastrointestinal strongyles was 68.6% (46/67), with reindeer in zoos having a lower prevalence (36%; 9/25) than reindeer from private farms (88%; 37/42). Capillaria sp., Strongyloides sp., and Trichuris sp. were detected in lower prevalences (<24%) and were also more frequent in private farms. Intestinal protozoa, as well as fluke and tapeworms, were not detected in any herd. This study provides an overview on husbandry, feeding, and endoparasite prevalence in reindeer in Switzerland and should be of help for breeders and veterinarians dealing with this animal species.

AB  - Foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) is a contagious transboundary animal disease that causes economic loss and obstacles to international trade. Frequent FMD outbreaks in Cambodia negatively impact farmers' and smallholders' incomes. This study aimed to estimate the seroprevalence of FMD Non-Structural Protein (NSP) antibodies, which are an indicator of FMD antibodies raised during a natural infection rather than those produced following vaccination, that were detected using a commercial enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Sample collection from cattle and pigs (n = 2238) was performed at ten abattoirs in seven provinces between October 2019 and December 2020. Overall seroprevalence in cattle and pigs was 43.2% (363/839; 95% CI 39.8-46.7), and 0.6% (9/1399; 95% CI 0.2-1.2), respectively. Only the cattle dataset was included in the risk factor analysis, as the prevalence of sero-reactors was too low in the pig dataset to be analyzed. Significant risk factors identified by the logistic regression model included the province of origin (p = 0.02), body condition score (BCS) (p = 0.0002) and sex (p = 0.0007). Odds ratios of the significant risk factors were 7.05 (95% CI 1.43-34.67; p = 0.02) for cattle that originated from Kampong Thom, 1.41 (95% CI 1.05-1.89; p = 0.02) for female cattle, and 3.28 (95% CI 1.06-10.12; p = 0.04) for animals with BCS of 3/5. The study revealed that the seroprevalence of FMD NSP in cattle presented at the abattoirs was high, while the FMD NSP seroprevalence in abattoir pigs was very low. Further investigation is required to map the disease distribution in Cambodia, especially the serotypes and strains causing clinical disease. These findings call for the extension of work on effective disease prevention measures.

AB  - The oviduct is a dynamic reproductive organ for mammalian reproduction and is required for gamete storage, maturation, fertilization, and early embryonic development, and it directly affects fecundity. However, the molecular regulation of prolificacy occurring in estrous periods remain poorly understood. This study aims to gain a better understanding of the genes involved in regulating goat fecundity in the proteome and transcriptome levels of the oviducts. Twenty female Yunshang black goats (between 2 and 3 years old, weight 52.22 +/- 0.43 kg) were divided into high- and low-fecundity groups in the follicular (FH and FL, five individuals per group) and luteal (LH and LL, five individuals per group) phases, respectively. The DIA-based high-resolution mass spectrometry (MS) method was used to quantify proteins in twenty oviducts. A total of 5409 proteins were quantified, and Weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) determined that the tan module was highly associated with the high-fecundity trait in the luteal phase, and identified NUP107, ANXA11, COX2, AKP13, and ITF140 as hub proteins. Subsequently, 98 and 167 differentially abundant proteins (DAPs) were identified in the FH vs. FL and LH vs. LL comparison groups, respectively. Parallel reaction monitoring (PRM) was used to validate the results of the proteomics data, and the hub proteins were analyzed with Western blot (WB). In addition, biological adhesion and transporter activity processes were associated with oviductal function, and several proteins that play roles in oviductal communication with gametes or embryos were identified, including CAMSAP3, ITGAM, SYVN1, EMG1, ND5, RING1, CBS, PES1, ELP3, SEC24C, SPP1, and HSPA8. Correlation analysis of proteomics and transcriptomic revealed that the DAPs and differentially expressed genes (DEGs) are commonly involved in the metabolic processes at the follicular phase; they may prepare the oviductal microenvironment for gamete reception; and the MAP kinase activity, estrogen receptor binding, and angiotensin receptor binding terms were enriched in the luteal phase, which may be actively involved in reproductive processes. By generating the proteome data of the oviduct at two critical phases and integrating transcriptome analysis, we uncovered novel aspects of oviductal gene regulation of fecundity and provided a reference for other mammals.

AB  - Delayed muscle development and impaired tissue repair are common occurrences in sheep reared for mutton. Therefore, understanding the regulatory mechanisms involved in muscle growth and development is critical for animal production. Skeletal muscle satellite cells (SMSCs) can simulate the proliferation and differentiation of muscle cells and could be induced to differentiate into myoblasts. beta-hydroxy-beta-methylbutyric acid (HMB) is an additive commonly used in animal production. This study examined the effect of HMB on myoblast injury repair using flow cytometry, EdU assay, RNA sequencing, Western blot, and ELISA. Our results showed that HMB could inhibit IL-17 expression and, in turn, inhibit NF-kappa B signaling. By acting on the downstream genes of NF-kappa B pathway IL-6, TNF-alpha and IL-1 beta, HMB inhibits the apoptosis and promotes the proliferation of myoblasts. The findings of this study provide insight into the mechanism by which HMB mediates myoblast injury repair in sheep.

AB  - The flea beetle Longitarsus jacobaeae (Coleoptera: Chrysomelidae) is a well-tested biocontrol agent for the poisonous biennial pasture weed Jacobaea vulgaris (syn. Senecio jacobaea, Asteraceae). Knowledge on L. jacobaeae's specific requirements in the native range can help to biologically regulate J. vulgaris in and also outside the plant's native range. In this work, we studied the effects of abiotic (soil type, precipitation, and temperature) and biotic (abundance of J. vulgaris) factors on the occurrence and abundance of L. jacobaeae in Schleswig-Holstein, Germany. To this end, we assessed the presence and abundance of adult L. jacobaeae in twelve J. vulgaris mass stands using pitfall traps followed by morphological species determination. Subsequently, we successfully verified our results using genetic barcoding of the cytochrome c oxidase subunit 1 (COI) marker to allow for a fast and cost-effective system that simplifies species determination. Longitarsus jacobaeae was ubiquitous in the study area from mid-June to at least early September and its phenology in Northern Germany appears to be intermediate between the populations in the Netherlands and in Great Britain. Using a general regression model, we identified temperature sums and precipitation as main drivers for high L. jacobaeae abundances, followed by the availability of rosettes and generatives of J. vulgaris, whereby all three factors correlated positively with L. jacobaeae abundances. In addition, we found a negative correlation between L. jacobaeae abundances and the number of J. vulgaris seedlings that might be caused by a time lag in the colonization of early successional sites by specialist herbivores and the disturbance of the soil. Higher numbers of L. jacobaeae in sites with higher temperature sums and precipitation indicate that the beetle's potential to control J. vulgaris may differ among regions with different climatic conditions even at small spatial scales

AB  - Sleep deprivation critically disrupts physiological homeostasis, impairing development, metabolic balance, and immune regulation, with excessive neutrophil activation being a hallmark consequence. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying sleep deprivation-induced neutrophilic inflammation remain elusive. Here, it is shown that acute sleep deprivation in mice triggers neutrophil hyperactivation, resulting in aberrant peripheral accumulation and a systemic cytokine storm. Mechanistically, this pathology is driven by metabolic dysregulation, specifically, increased glycolytic flux, which elevates tissue lactate levels and enhances histone H3K18 lactylation. Through H3K18 lactylation-specific CUT&Tag profiling, pronounced lactylation enrichment is identified at the promoter of the Ror alpha gene, directly activating its transcription. Genetic ablation of Ror alpha or pharmacological inhibition of glycolysis attenuate neutrophil recruitment and mitigated inflammation in sleep-deprived zebrafish. Strikingly, this metabolic-epigenetic axis is evolutionarily conserved, as demonstrated by the recapitulation of key findings in diurnal zebrafish and pigs. The study reveals a lactate-H3K18 lactylation-Ror alpha signaling cascade that links sleep deprivation to immune dysregulation, suggesting actionable targets for combating sleep-related inflammatory disorders.

AB  - Previously, we found that a greater dissimilarity in swine leukocyte antigen (SLA) class I and class II alleles between mating partners resulted in increased farrowing rates in a highly inbred population of Microminipigs (MMPs). In this follow-up study, we have analyzed the effects of dissimilarity in SLA alleles between mating partners for seven different reproductive traits, including litter size and the number of stillborn and live or dead weaned piglets. We determined the relationships among reproductive traits within each mating event and the amino acid distances of SLA alleles as markers of diversity between mating partners. Our results indicate that mating partners with greater amino acid pairwise genetic distances in the SLA-1 class I gene or DQB1 class II gene alleles were associated with significantly larger litter sizes and higher numbers of live piglets at birth and weaning. Also, partners with greater pairwise distances in the SLA-2 class I gene alleles exhibited fewer pre-weaning deaths. These findings suggest that the dissimilarity in SLA class I and class II alleles between mating partners may affect not only farrowing rates but also other key reproductive traits such as litter size and improved piglet survival rates. Consequently, SLA alleles could serve as valuable genetic markers for selecting mating partners in breeding programs and for conducting epistatic studies on various reproductive traits in MMPs.

AB  - Background Mechanical stress and pathological signaling trigger the activation of fibroblasts to myofibroblasts, which impacts extracellular matrix composition, disrupts normal wound healing, and can generate deleterious fibrosis. Myocardial fibrosis independently promotes cardiac arrhythmias, sudden cardiac arrest, and contributes to the severity of heart failure. Fibrosis can also alter cell-to-cell communication and increase myocardial stiffness which eventually may lead to lusitropic and inotropic cardiac dysfunction. Human induced pluripotent stem cell derived cardiac fibroblasts (hiPSC-CFs) have the potential to enhance clinical relevance in precision disease modeling by facilitating the study of patient-specific phenotypes. However, it is unclear whether hiPSC-CFs can be activated to become myofibroblasts akin to primary cells, and the key signaling mechanisms in this process remain unidentified.Objective We aim to explore the notable changes in fibroblast phenotype upon passage-mediated activation of hiPSC-CFs with increased mitochondrial metabolism, like primary cardiac fibroblasts.Methods We activated the hiPSC-CFs with serial passaging from passage 0 to 3 (P0 to P3) and treatment of P0 with TGF beta 1.Results Passage-mediated activation of hiPSC-CFs was associated with a gradual induction of genes to initiate the activation of these cells to myofibroblasts, including collagen, periostin, fibronectin, and collagen fiber processing enzymes with concomitant downregulation of cellular proliferation markers. Most importantly, canonical TGF beta 1 and Hippo signaling component genes including TAZ were influenced by passaging hiPSC-CFs. Seahorse assay revealed that passaging and TGF beta 1 treatment increased mitochondrial respiration, consistent with fibroblast activation requiring increased energy production, whereas treatment with the glutaminolysis inhibitor BPTES completely attenuated this process.Conclusion Our study highlights that the hiPSC-CF passaging enhanced fibroblast activation, activated fibrotic signaling pathways, and enhanced mitochondrial metabolism approximating what has been reported in primary cardiac fibroblasts. Thus, hiPSC-CFs may provide an accurate in vitro preclinical model for the cardiac fibrotic condition, which may facilitate the identification of putative anti-fibrotic therapies, including patient-specific approaches.

AB  - The endogenous mu-opioid receptor (MOR) system modulates a multitude of social and reward-related functions, and exogenous opiates also influence sex drive in humans and animals. Sex drive shows substantial variation across humans, and it is possible that individual differences in MOR availability underlie interindividual of variation in human sex drive. We measured healthy male subjects' (n = 52) brain's MOR availability with positron emission tomography (PET) using an agonist radioligand, [C-11]carfentanil, that has high affinity for MORs. Sex drive was measured using self-reports of engaging in sexual behaviour (sex with partner and masturbating). Bayesian hierarchical regression analysis revealed that sex drive was positively associated with MOR availability in cortical and subcortical areas, notably in caudate nucleus, hippocampus, and cingulate cortices. These results were replicated in full-volume GLM analysis. These widespread effects are in line with high spatial autocorrelation in MOR expression in human brain. Complementary voxel-based morphometry analysis (n = 108) of anatomical MR images provided limited evidence for positive association between sex drive and cortical density in the midcingulate cortex. We conclude that endogenous MOR tone is associated with individual differences in sex drive in human males.

AB  - Anxiety commonly co-occurs with and exacerbates pain, but the interaction between pain progression and anxiety, and its underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Inhibitory interneurons play a crucial role in maintaining normal central nervous system function and are suggested to be involved in pain-induced anxiety. This study aimed to elucidate the time-dependent effects of neuropathic pain on the developmental anxiety-like behaviors and related inhibitory interneurons; parvalbumin (PV)-and cholecystokinin (CCK)-positive neurons in corticolimbic regions. Using an 8-week-old male Wistar rat model with partial sciatic nerve ligation (pSNL), anxiety-like behaviors were biweekly assessed postsurgery through open field (OF) and elevated plus maze (EPM) tests. From 4 weeks post-surgery, pSNL rats exhibited reduced OF center time, rearing, and initial activity, along with diminished EPM open-arm activities (time spent, head dips, movement, and rearing), which corre-lated with the paw withdrawal threshold. These effects were absent at 2 weeks post-surgery. At 8 weeks post -surgery, specific behaviors (decreased total rearing and increased inactive time in EPM) were observed in the pSNL group. Immunohistochemistry revealed changes in PV-and CCK-positive neurons in specific corticolimbic subregions of pSNL rats at 8 weeks post-surgery. Notably, PV-positive neuron densities in the basolateral amygdaloid complex (BLC) and hippocampal cornu ammonis areas 1 and 2 correlated with anxiety-like behavioral parameters. PV-positive neurons in the BLC of pSNL rats were predominantly changed in large-cell subtypes and were less activated. These findings indicate that anxiety-like behaviors emerge in the late phase of neuropathic pain and relate to PV-positive neurons in corticolimbic regions of pSNL rats.

AB  - In the present research, two studies were performed to determine the effects of specific botanical compounds (BCs) on the innate feed preference and feed intake of piglets, as follows: Exp. 1 studied the innate feed preferences of post-weaning piglets using a double-choice feeding test. A total of 828 weaned piglets were distributed into 36 pens (23 pigs/pen) and assigned to three dietary pair choice feeding options (n = 12): unsupplemented prestarter diets (reference) versus reference plus D-limonene, trans-anethole, or eucalyptol. Piglets showed a preference for diets with D-limonene (53.8%) and trans-anethole (54.5%), and an aversion to eucalyptol (41.6%) (p < 0.05). Exp. 2 studied whether the prenatal and perinatal exposure to D-limonene, trans-anethole, and eucalyptol influences the feed intake and growth of newly-weaned piglets. Twenty-eight gestating and lactating sows were distributed into two dietary treatments (n = 14): unsupplemented Control diets or Control plus a blend of BCs (BBC; containing D-limonene, trans-anethole, and eucalyptol). D-limonene, trans-anethole, and eucalyptol were transferred into the placental fluid, and D-limonene and trans-anethole into the milk (p < 0.05). Furthermore, weanling piglets (n = 200; Control) and (n = 203; BBC) received the same treatment as their mothers in prestarter diets. The early response after weaning showed that piglets' post-weaning BW gain was higher in the Control (p < 0.05) group than in those exposed to BBC. In conclusion, prenatal exposure to preferred D-limonene and trans-anethole, or familiarity to eucalyptol did not help to overcome the innate aversion to eucalyptol and its negative effect on weanling piglets' BW.

AB  - Depression pathology remains elusive. The monoamine hypothesis has placed much focus on serotonin, but due to the variable clinical efficacy of monoamine reuptake inhibitors, the community is looking for alternative therapies such as ketamine (neurogenesis theory of antidepressant action). There is evidence that different classes of antidepressants may affect serotonin levels; a notion we test here. We measure hippocampal serotonin in mice with voltammetry and study the effects of acute challenges of escitalopram, fluoxetine, reboxetine, and ketamine. We find that pseudo-equivalent doses of these drugs similarly raise ambient serotonin levels, despite their differing pharmacodynamics because of differences in Uptake 1 and 2, rapid SERT trafficking, and modulation of serotonin by histamine. These antidepressants have different pharmacodynamics but have strikingly similar effects on extracellular serotonin. Our findings suggest that serotonin is a common thread that links clinically effective antidepressants, synergizing different theories of depression (synaptic plasticity, neurogenesis, and the monoamine hypothesis).

AB  - Simple Summary Farm animals are daily subjected to a wide range of abiotic stressors. Shearing, one practice of routine management procedures, is applied periodically to harvest sheep's wool. During shearing, short-term acute stress is likely to occur. This study aimed to evaluate the change in hematological parameters, serum cortisol concentration and serum protein electrophoretic pattern in Comisana sheep following shearing procedures. The findings obtained in the current study suggest a linkage between the endocrine and immune systems and an acute phase response during the shearing procedure. The current study aimed to investigate the influence of acute stress by shearing procedures on hematological parameters, serum cortisol concentration and serum protein electrophoretic pattern in Comisana sheep. A total of 20 not pregnant and not lactating adult ewes, aged 3-4 years old and with a mean bodyweight of 55.50 +/- 3.50 kg, were enrolled in the study. From each animal, blood samples were collected before shearing (T-PRE) and 5 (T-POST5) and 60 (T-POST60) minutes after the end of the shearing procedure in order to assess the values of hematological parameters, serum cortisol, total proteins and protein fractions, including albumin, alpha-, beta 1-, beta 2- and gamma-globulins. According to statistical analysis results, albumin values were lower at T-POST60 than T-POST5 (p < 0.01), whereas alpha- and beta 2-globulins and the A/G ratio were higher at T-POST60 with respect to T-PRE (p < 0.01) and T-POST5 (p < 0.01). A higher serum concentration of cortisol was found at T-POST5 and T-POST60 than T-PRE (p < 0.01), and at T-POST60 than T-POST5 (p < 0.01). The serum cortisol values were negatively correlated with the serum values of albumin, beta 1-globulins and A/G ratio at T-POST60, and positively correlated with alpha- and beta 2-globulins at T-POST5 and T-POST60. The decrease in the albumin concentration and the increase in the alpha- and beta 2-globulins observed in ewes after shearing with respect to the baseline values suggests an acute phase response in shorn ewes. Additionally, the correlation found between the serum cortisol concentration and the serum protein fractions confirmed the immunomodulatory effect of this hormone, emphasizing the linkage between the endocrine and immune systems during an acute stress condition.

AB  - (1) Background: Oenothein B, a cyclic dimeric ellagitannin present in various medicinal plants, has been reported to exert diverse effects that are beneficial for the treatment and prevention of diseases, including cancer and infections. We recently showed that oenothein B also functions in the brain because its oral administration to systemic inflammatory model mice reduced inflammatory responses in the brain and suppressed abnormal behavior. (2) Results: The present in vivo results demonstrated that oenothein B activated extracellular signal-regulated kinase 2 and cAMP response element-binding protein in the brain, both of which play important roles in synaptic transmission and learning/memory in the central nervous system (CNS). (3) Conclusions: These results suggest that oenothein B exerts neuroprotective effects on the CNS by not only its anti-inflammatory activity but also by enhancing neuronal signaling pathways.

AB  - Botanical based-insecticides are presently recognized to interfere behavioral and physiological performances of herbivorous insects. In the current study, the insecticidal properties of Pimpinella anisum, Foeniculum vulgare and Heracleum persicum essential oils (EOs), and their main component, trans-anethole, were studied on a destructive pest of mulberry leaves, Glyphodes pyloalis Walker. The effect of essential oils (EOs) on the larval feeding was evaluated by the leaf-dipping method and demonstrated the highest insecticidal and antifeedant activities of F. vulgare and H. persicum. Apart from negative effects on feeding indices, feeding treatment with the EOs significantly inhibited the activities of digestive enzymes and acetylcholinesterase (AChE). At nearly, all the tested compounds increased the activities of detoxifying and antioxidant enzymes. Thus, these EOs demonstrate potential as new control products to combat G. pyloalis, and they may function as an insecticide, antifeedant, or inhibitor of physiological performance.

AB  - In the past decade, it has become clear that omnivory, feeding on more than one trophic level, is important in natural and agricultural systems. Large mammalian herbivores (LMH) frequently encounter plant-dwelling arthropods (PDA) on their food plants. Yet, ingestion of PDA by LMH is only rarely addressed and the extent of this direct trophic interaction, especially at the PDA community level, remains unknown. Using a DNA-metabarcoding analysis on feces of free-ranging cattle from a replicated field experiment of heavily and moderately grazed paddocks, we reveal that feeding cattle (incidentally) ingest an entire food chain of PDA including herbivores, predators and parasites. Overall, 25 families of insects and four families of arachnids were ingested, a pattern that varied over the season, but not with grazing intensity. We identified the functional groups of PDA vulnerable to ingestion, such as sessile species and immature life stages. Most of the fecal samples (76%) contained sequences belonging to PDA, indicating that direct interactions are frequent. This study highlights the complex trophic connections between LMH and PDA. It may even be appropriate to consider LMH as omnivorous enemies of PDA.

AB  - Background Caffeic acid O-methyltransferase (COMT) is a key enzyme that regulates melatonin synthesis and is involved in regulating the growth, development, and response to abiotic stress in plants. Tea plant is a popular beverage consumed worldwide, has been used for centuries for its medicinal properties, including its ability to reduce inflammation, improve digestion, and boost immune function. By analyzing genetic variation within the COMT family, while helping tea plants resist adversity, it is also possible to gain a deeper understanding of how different tea varieties produce and metabolize catechins, then be used to develop new tea cultivars with desired flavor profiles and health benefits.Results In this study, a total of 25 CsCOMT genes were identified based on the high-quality tea (Camellia sinensis) plant genome database. Phylogenetic tree analysis of CsCOMTs with COMTs from other species showed that COMTs divided into four subfamilies (Class I, II, III, IV), and CsCOMTs was distributed in Class I, Class II, Class III. CsCOMTs not only undergoes large-scale gene recombination in pairs internally in tea plant, but also shares 2 and 7 collinear genes with Arabidopsis thaliana and poplar (Populus trichocarpa), respectively. The promoter region of CsCOMTs was found to be rich in cis-acting elements associated with plant growth and stress response. By analyzing the previously transcriptome data, it was found that some members of CsCOMT family exhibited significant tissue-specific expression and differential expression under different stress treatments. Subsequently, we selected six CsCOMTs to further validated their expression levels in different tissues organ using qRT-PCR. In addition, we silenced the CsCOMT19 through virus-induced gene silencing (VIGS) method and found that CsCOMT19 positively regulates the synthesis of melatonin in tea plant.Conclusion These results will contribute to the understanding the functions of CsCOMT gene family and provide valuable information for further research on the role of CsCOMT genes in regulating tea plant growth, development, and response to abiotic stress.

AB  - L-type voltage-gated calcium channels are important regulators of neuronal activity and are widely expressed throughout the brain. One of the major L-type voltage-gated calcium channel isoforms in the brain is Ca(V)1.3. Mice lacking Ca(V)1.3 are reported to have impairments in fear conditioning and depressive-like behaviors, which have been linked to Ca(V)1.3 function in the hippocampus and amygdala. Genetic variation in Ca(V)1.3 has been linked to a variety of psychiatric disorders, including autism and schizophrenia, which are associated with altered motor learning, associative learning and social function. Here, we explored whether Ca(V)1.3 plays a role in these behaviors. We found that Ca(V)1.3 knockout mice have deficits in rotarod learning despite normal locomotor function. Deletion of Ca(V)1.3 is also associated with impaired gait adaptation and associative learning on the Erasmus Ladder. We did not observe any impairments in Ca(V)1.3 knockout mice on assays of anxiety-like, depression-like or social preference behaviors. Our results suggest an important role for Ca(V)1.3 in neural circuits involved in motor learning and concur with previous data showing its involvement in associative learning.

AB  - Subterranean termites depend nutritionally on their gut microbiota, which includes protozoa as well as taxonomically and functionally diverse bacteria. Our previous metavirome study revealed a high diversity and novel families of bacteriophages in the guts of Coptotermes formosanus workers from New Orleans, Louisiana, United States. Two assembled bacteriophage genomes (Phages TG-crAlp-04 and 06, family Podoviridae) existed in all colonies and showed similarity to a prophage (ProJPt-Bp1) previously sequenced from a bacterial endosymbiont (Candidatus Azobacteroides pseudotrichonymphae, CAP) of protozoa in the gut of a termite species of the genus Prorhinotermes from Taiwan. In this study the genomes of Phage TG-crAlp-04 and 06 were subjected to detailed functional annotation. Both phage genomes contained conserved genes for DNA packaging, head and tail morphogenesis, and phage replication. Approximately 30% of the amino acid sequences derived from genes in both genomes matched to those of ProJPt-Bp1 phage or other phages from the crAss-like phage group. No integrase was identified; the lack of a lysogeny module is a characteristic of crAss-like phages. Primers were designed to sequence conserved genes of the two phages and their putative host bacterium (CAP) to detect their presence in different termite species from native and introduced distribution ranges. Related strains of the host bacterium were found across different termite genera and geographic regions. Different termite species had separate CAP strains, but intraspecific geographical variation was low. These results together with the fact that CAP is an important intracellular symbiont of obligate cellulose-digesting protozoa, suggest that CAP is a core gut bacterium and co-evolved across several subterranean termite species. Variants of both crAss-like phages were detected in different Coptotermes species from the native and introduced range, but they did not differentiate by species or geographic region. Since similar phages were detected in different termite species, we propose the existence of a core virome associated with core bacterial endosymbionts of protozoa in the guts of subterranean termites. This work provides a strong basis for further study of the quadripartite relationship of termites, protozoa, bacteria, and bacteriophages.

AB  - Camellia oleifera Abel., as one of the four major woody oilseeds, has a high economic value, and the wild C. oleifera genes, whose distribution area is located at the northern edge, are abundant and are valuable resources for C. oleifera breeding. In this study, a total of 341 wild C. oleifera populations were sampled from 11 different localitions in Xinxian County, the hinterland of the Dabie Mountains in the northern margin of the distribution of C. oleifera in China, and 16 pairs of simple sequence repeat (SSR) molecular markers were used to analyse the genetic diversity. Using these 16 pairs of primers to detect the genetic diversity of the wild C. oleifera population, 174 alleles were amplified. The average number of alleles (Na) was 10.875, the average expected heterozygosity (He) was 0.739, the observed heterozygosity (Ho) was 0.718, and the average polymorphic information index (PIC) was 0.739. The 11 wild C. oleifera populations in Xinxian County had high genetic diversity, and the average expected heterozygosity (He) among populations was 0.735. The molecular variance showed that the genetic variation mainly came from within the population, accounting for 88.21% of the total variation. The genetic differentiation coefficient Fst between populations was small, with an average of only 0.04. According to the results of Structure and principal cordinate analysis (PCoA) and cluster analysis, these 11 populations could be roughly divided into two categories. The Mantel test preferentially clustered some populations close to each other, but there was no significant correlation between genetic distance and geographical distance. We provides a theoretical basis for the rational development and utilisation of wild C. oleifera resources in the future and provide a scientific and technological method for future breeding.

AB  - This study assessed the replacement of fish oil (FO) with camelina oil, canola oil, and Argentinian marine shrimp oil (from industry waste) in juvenile rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) diets. Fish (initial weight 7.97 +/- 0.83 g) were distributed into eighteen 100-liter tanks (36 fish per tank; initial density similar to 2.9 kg/m(3)) and fed six experimental diets for 60 days at 3 % body weight per day. The diets were isonitrogenous (52 % crude protein) and isolipidic (21-22 % lipids). The experimental diets were FO (100 % fish oil), SH (100 % shrimp oil), SHCA (75 % canola + 25 % shrimp oil), COCA (75 % canola + 25 % camelina oil), CO (100 % camelina oil), and CA (100 % canola oil). Growth performance showed comparable outcomes across treatments. Whole-body proximal composition revealed stable dry matter content (96.05 % FO to 97.56 % SHCA) and protein content (50.25 % CO to 52.92 % FO). Lipid content was higher in SHCA (37.36 %) and COCA (37.28 %) diets, while FO (35.03 %) and SH (34.63 %) diets had lower levels. Protein was most digestible in FO (92.6 +/- 0.56 %) and SHCA (92.5 +/- 0.58 %) diets. Phosphorus digestibility was highest in SH-fed fish (69.7 +/- 2.24 %). Fatty acid profiles showed higher saturated fatty acids (SFA) in FO and SH (33.43 and 27.36 mg g(-)(1), respectively) and long-chain omega-3s (EPA and DHA) in FO. CO and CA diets were rich in monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA), with CA having 57.59 mg g(-)(1) . Fillet nutritional quality indices showed that FO (0.602 +/- 0.005) and SH (0.586 +/- 0.105) had the highest atherogenicity index and more favorable omega-6/omega-3 ratios (SH: 0.230 +/- 0.023, FO: 0.267 +/- 0.023).

AB  - Despite advances in technologies for cardiac repair after myocardial infarction (MI), new integrated therapeutic approaches still need to be developed. In this study, we designed a perfusable, multifunctional epicardial device (PerMed) consisting of a biodegradable elastic patch (BEP), permeable hierarchical microchannel networks (PHMs) and a system to enable delivery of therapeutic agents from a subcutaneously implanted pump. After its implantation into the epicardium, the BEP is designed to provide mechanical cues for ventricular remodeling, and the PHMs are designed to facilitate angiogenesis and allow for infiltration of reparative cells. In a rat model of MI, implantation of the PerMed improved ventricular function. When connected to a pump, the PerMed enabled targeted, sustained and stable release of platelet-derived growth factor-BB, amplifying the efficacy of cardiac repair as compared to the device without a pump. We also demonstrated the feasibility of minimally invasive surgical PerMed implantation in pigs, demonstrating its promise for clinical translation to treat heart disease. Implantation of a perfusable device into the epicardium enables delivery of therapeutic agents and infiltration of reparative cells into the heart, amplifying the therapeutic effects of FGF-23 in a rat model of myocardial infarction.

AB  - Introduction This study reports for the first time the complete sequence characteristics of the mitochondrial genome of the tea plant cultivar Camellia sinensis cv. 'Baihaozao'. It systematically unveils its multi-chromosomal structure, RNA editing patterns, and adaptive evolutionary mechanisms, providing critical theoretical insights into the structural complexity and evolutionary mechanisms of the tea plant mitochondrial genome.Methods The mitochondrial genome was fully analyzed using genome sequencing and annotation techniques. RNA editing sites were predicted to evaluate editing patterns. Codon usage bias analysis was conducted to identify high-frequency codons. Repeat sequence analysis was used to characterize dispersed and tandem repeats. Adaptive evolutionary analysis, based on Ka/Ks ratios, was performed to investigate gene selection pressures.Results The mitochondrial genome consists of 11 linear chromosomes, with a total length of 909,843 bp and a GC content of 45.62%. A total of 73 functional genes were annotated, among which 14 variable genes (e.g., ribosomal protein coding genes) retain intact functions without pseudogenization, which is rare among Theaceae plants. RNA editing site prediction revealed significant spatial heterogeneity, with the cox1 gene being a hotspot containing 19 editing sites. Approximately 58.49% of editing events were concentrated on the second base of codons, and 48.61% of the sites resulted in amino acid changes from hydrophilic to hydrophobic. Codon usage bias analysis showed significant enrichment of high-frequency codons, including UUU (phenylalanine), AUU (isoleucine), and UUC (phenylalanine). The genome's repeat sequences were predominantly dispersed repeats (70.6%), with forward and palindromic repeats of 30-40 bp being dominant. Tandem repeats exhibited significant distribution heterogeneity among chromosomes. Adaptive evolution analysis showed that most PCGs (protein-coding genes) had Ka/Ks ratios below 1 (ranging from 0.07 to 0.78), with the atp9 gene showing the lowest ratio (0.07), while the mttB gene exhibited a significantly higher Ka/Ks ratio of 3.48. Additionally, 1.62% of the mitochondrial genome sequence was homologous to the chloroplast genome, carrying 26 complete functional genes, including 15 tRNA and 2 rRNA genes.Discussion Codon usage bias may be related to mutation pressure due to the high AT content of the genome or reflect adaptive selection pressures for translational efficiency. The Ka/Ks results align with the widespread purifying selection observed in mitochondrial genomes, while the high Ka/Ks ratio of the mttB gene suggests it might be under positive selection to adapt to environmental pressures. The evolutionary evidence of inter-organelle gene transfer highlights the homologous sequences between mitochondria and chloroplasts. Overall, these findings systematically elucidate the adaptive evolutionary mechanisms and functional regulation of the tea plant mitochondrial genome.

AB  - Destabilization of previously consolidated memories places them in a labile state in which they are open to modification. However, strongly encoded fear memories tend to be destabilization-resistant and the conditions required to destabilize such memories remain poorly understood. Our lab has previously shown that exposure to salient novel contextual cues during memory reactivation can destabilize strongly encoded object location memories and that activity at muscarinic cholinergic receptors is critical for this effect. In the current study, we similarly targeted destabilization-resistant fear memories, hypothesizing that exposure to salient novelty at the time of reactivation would induce destabilization of strongly encoded fear memories in a muscarinic receptor-dependent manner. First, we show that contextual fear memories induced by 3 context-shock pairings readily destabilize upon memory reactivation, and that this destabilization is blocked by systemic (ip) administration of the muscarinic receptor antagonist scopolamine (0.3 mg/kg) in male rats. Following that, we confirm that this effect is dorsal hippocampus (dHPC)-dependent by targeting M1 receptors in the CA1 region with pirenzepine. Next, we show that more strongly encoded fear memories (induced with 5 context-shock pairings) resist destabilization. Consistent with our previous work, however, we report that salient novelty (a change in floor texture) presented during the reactivation session promotes destabilization of resistant contextual fear memories in a muscarinic receptor-dependent manner. Finally, the effect of salient novelty on memory destabilization was mimicked by stimulating muscarinic receptors with the selective M1 agonist CDD-0102A (ip, 0.3 mg/kg). These findings reveal further generalizability of our previous results implicating novel cues and M1 muscarinic signaling in promoting destabilization of resistant memories and suggest possible therapeutic options for dis -orders characterized by persistent, maladaptive fear memories such as PTSD and phobias.

AB  - Between 1862 and 1867, Albert Gaudry (1824-1908) published Animaux fossiles et g & eacute;ologie de l'Attique, a seminal work describing and depicting the rich collection of mammalian fossils that he assembled during his scientific expeditions in Attica, Greece. This paper will focus on how Gaudry's collection and reconstruction of the extinct fauna of Attica articulated itself with geopolitical, cultural, and economic concerns regarding the newly independent Greek state and its place within Europe. Since the Greek War of independence against the Ottomans between the 1820s and 1830s, European nations sought to secure a series of strategic advantages in the region. France for example invested a lot of capital, military, and cultural resources in the newly independent Greek state in hope of cementing France's influence in the Mediterranean. Between 1853 and 1854, Gaudry was sent on a mission by the French government to evaluate the agricultural production of countries of the 'Orient', including Greece. Gaudry was tasked with gathering information intended to facilitate the advancement of agriculture in France's colonies as well as the planning of future investments in the Eastern Mediterranean. In his report published in 1855, Gaudry explicitly defined the restoration of Greece's agricultural industry as a sine qua non condition for Greece's establishment as a European state. It was during this official mission that Gaudry learned about the existence of exceptionally rich fossil sites in Attica. He returned on multiple occasions to collect thousands of fossil specimens from these sites. In Animauxfossiles et g & eacute;ologie de l'Attique and in his subsequent publications on the same fossils, Gaudry regularly articulated the reconstruction of extinct mammals and their environment with inspired descriptions of the ruins of Athens. In his writings, the reconstruction of a Greek geological past inhabited by a grandiose and harmonious megafauna echoed the celebration of Ancient Greece as the cradle of Western civilization. This paper will comment on the complex interplay between three temporalities which informed Gaudry's work on the mammalian fossils of Attica: (1) the reconstructed paleontological past, (2) the idealized Ancient Greece, and (3) the present geopolitical context.

AB  - Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) has reemerged throughout the world in the past ten years and caused huge economic losses to the swine industry. No drugs are available to prevent or treat PEDV infection in piglets. Zinc oxide (ZnO) has been shown to reduce diarrhea. However, little is known about its role in PEDV infection. In this study, twenty-four 7-day-old piglets were randomly divided into three treatment groups: control, PEDV, and ZnO+PEDV. Piglets in the ZnO+PEDV group were orally administered with 100 mg/kg.BW ZnO and then inoculated PEDV at a dose of 10(4.5) TCID50 (50% tissue culture infectious dose) per pig. Growth performance, histologic lesions, viral load, indicators of intestinal damage, inflammation, and oxidative stress were recorded or detected to determine the effect of ZnO on PEDV infection. And the underlying mechanisms were revealed by microarray and proteomic analyses. Results showed that ZnO administration mitigated diarrhea and the reduction of average daily weight gain induced by PEDV infection. ZnO could inhibit PEDV replication in the small intestine and colon. Both villus height and crypt depth were affected by PEDV infection in the duodenum and jejunum, which could be rescued by ZnO administration. Moreover, the activity of catalase was decreased both in plasma and intestine after PEDV infection, while increased in the intestine by ZnO administration. PEDV infection also significantly increased the concentration of H2O2 in jejunal and ileum and decreased the activity of total superoxide dismutase and glutathione peroxidase in plasma, whereas ZnO administration obviously increased the activity of total superoxide dismutase and decreased the concentration of H2O2 in the ileum. The concentrations of IL-1 beta, IL-6, and IL-8 in the plasma were all decreased upon ZnO administration. A large number of differentially expressed genes and proteins were identified in the ileum among the three groups by microarray and proteomic analyses. Gene Ontology and Reactome pathway analyses indicated that neutrophil degranulation and nutrient metabolism were the main biological process and pathways in both PEDV infection and ZnO administration. Overall, ZnO administration could improve growth performance, intestinal redox status, morphology, and function and reduce diarrhea in PEDV-infected piglets; ZnO could exert antiviral and anti-inflammatory effects on PEDV-infected piglets probably through regulating neutrophil degranulation. Our findings have important implications in piglet and infant nutrition.

AB  - Industrial pollution in groundwater has become an essential health concern because of its life-threatening health impacts on humans. To examine the hydro-geochemical processes controlling groundwater chemistry in Peenya Industrial Area (PIA), Bangalore city, 65 groundwater samples were collected during July 2016, January 2017, and August 2017 to analyse major ions using Flame-photometer, UV-Spectrophotometer and standard titration methods. The main aim of this study was to categorise the groundwater quality due to improper discharges of industrial effluents (solid and liquid) and the health risk assessment of the local community using this groundwater for daily use. It observes that the nitrate varied from 21 to 461 mg/L (July 2016), 1.01 to 121.7 mg/L (January 2017), and 1.4 to 110 mg/L (August 2017). The maximum samples exceed the threshold values (>45 mg/L). Industrial activities and water-rock interactions are the major factors controlling groundwater chemistry. The pollution risks through the Water Quality Index (WQI), Pollution Index of Groundwater (PIG), Nitrate Pollution Index (NPI), Pollution Loads (%), Revelle Index (RI) and Cumulative Probability (C-P) strongly suggest that groundwater in PIA is control of mixing with industrial effluent discharges. Health risk to people through ingestion by computing chronic dose index (CDI), hazardous quotient (HQ), and health-hazardous index (HHI). Most groundwater samples show HHI >1, indicating its unsuitability and causing health effects. The maximum non-carcinogenic risk value for nitrate is 10.31 for adults and 15.07 for children during July 2016; 2.72 for adults and 3.97 for children during January 2017; 2.46 for adults and 3.60 for children during August 2017. Therefore, proper planning for mitigation is required to reduce exposure to save future generations. This study will bring awareness to minimising and treating the groundwater before use.

AB  - Rhodococcus equi, predominantly recognized as an opportunistic pathogen affecting immunocompromised hosts, and Brucella, a widespread zoonotic bacterium, infrequently co-infect immunocompetent adults, thereby posing a distinctive diagnostic challenge. Here, we describe a case involving a 53-year-old male with a history of goat farming, who presented with persistent chest tightness, cough, and notable weight loss, absent fever. Radiological and bronchoscopic assessments showed a right hilar mass, extensive vertebral destruction, and bronchial lesions, deviating from the typical symptoms associated with either pathogen. Laboratory analyses confirmed a co-infection involving R. equi and Brucella. Initial therapy with levofloxacin and vancomycin proved ineffective; however, a subsequent treatment regimen comprising azithromycin, etimicin, minocycline, and moxifloxacin resulted in substantial clinical improvement. This case accentuates the intricacies involved in diagnosing and managing atypical co-infections in immunocompetent individuals and underscores the importance of careful microbiological testing to inform effective therapeutic strategies.

AB  - Fat deposition involves the continuous differentiation of adipocytes and lipid accumulation. Studies have shown that microRNA miR-136 and 17 beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 12 (HSD17B12) play important roles in lipid accumulation. However, the regulatory mechanism through which miR-136 targets HSD17B12 during ovine adipogenesis remains unclear. This study aimed to elucidate the role of miR-136 and HSD17B12 in adipogenesis and their relationship in ovine adipose-derived stromal vascular fractions (SVFs). The target relationship between miR-136 and HSD17B12 was predicted and confirmed using bioinformatics and a dual-luciferase reporter assay. The results showed that miR-136 promoted proliferation and inhibited adipogenic differentiation of ovine SVFs. We also found that HSD17B12 inhibited proliferation and promoted adipogenic differentiation of ovine SVFs. Collectively, our results indicate that miR-136 facilitates proliferation and attenuates adipogenic differentiation of ovine SVFs by targeting HSD17B12. These findings provide a theoretical foundation for further elucidation of the regulatory mechanisms of lipid deposition in sheep.

AB  - EA-IRMS has been used to find isotope ratio patterns as a way of ascertaining the provenance of materials in several fields of science. In this work, EA-IRMS analysis of delta(13) C and delta(15) N was used to study historical rugs' raw materials. The influence of chromophores in the isotope ratio of wool was studied by dyeing contemporary wool with traditional dyestuff and analyzing it by EA-IRMS. Additionally, aiming towards provenance determination, historical rugs' samples were analyzed. In general, delta(13) C and delta(15) N of contemporary dyed wool showed no significant difference between samples ( P > 0.05) which rebutted the hypothesis that chromophore isotope ratios influence those of wool. Furthermore, delta(13) C and delta(15) N of both contemporary and historical wool samples were indicative of sheep diets comprised exclusively of C3 unfertilized plants. Exception was made for one rug whose 815 N values were compatible with organically fertilized plants. Particularly, delta(13) C and delta(15) N ratios of historical samples showed significant inter-rugs differences ( P < 0.05) which could evidence meteorological changes over the years. Intra-rug differences detected in only one of the three rugs studied could be linked to changes in sheep diet and pastures management practices due to drought conditions. In sum, this work's results showed that is possible to use EA-IRMS analysis of delta(13) C and delta(15) N to study dyed wool without chromophore interference. (c) 2024 The Author(s).

AB  - Acidic tea (Camellia sinensis) plantation soil usually suffers from magnesium (Mg) deficiency, and as such, application of fertilizer containing Mg can substantially increase tea quality by enhancing the accumulation of nitrogen (N)-containing chemicals such as amino acids in young tea shoots. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying the promoting effects of Mg on N assimilation in tea plants remain unclear. Here, both hydroponic and field experiments were conducted to analyze N, Mg, metabolite contents, and gene expression patterns in tea plants. We found that N and amino acids accumulated in tea plant roots under Mg deficiency, while metabolism of N was enhanced by Mg supplementation, especially under a low N fertilizer regime. N-15 tracing experiments demonstrated that assimilation of N was induced in tea roots following Mg application. Furthermore, weighted gene correlation network analysis (WGCNA) analysis of RNA-seq data suggested that genes encoding glutamine synthetase isozymes (CsGSs), key enzymes regulating N assimilation, were markedly regulated by Mg treatment. Overexpression of CsGS1.1 in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) resulted in a more tolerant phenotype under Mg deficiency and increased N assimilation. These results validate our suggestion that Mg transcriptionally regulates CsGS1.1 during the enhanced assimilation of N in tea plant. Moreover, results of a field experiment demonstrated that high Mg and low N had positive effects on tea quality. This study deepens our understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying the interactive effects of Mg and N in tea plants while also providing both genetic and agronomic tools for future improvement of tea production.

AB  - The obscure mealybug, Pseudococcus viburni, is a serious agricultural pest worldwide. The biological control in commercial fields of P. viburni relies on predators and parasitoids, in particular the generalist coccidophagous ladybird Cryptolaemus montrouzieri and the specific parasitoid Acerophagus flavidulus. However, these two natural enemies can establish an intraguild predation interaction, reducing the efficiency of biological control. Cryptolaemus montrouzieri may negatively impact the population dynamics of A. flavidulus if it feeds indifferently on healthy and parasitized mealybugs. With the aim of improving the biological control of P. viburni, in this work, we studied the feeding behavior of C. montrouzieri in the absence or presence of A. flavidulus larvae of different age within mealybugs, in laboratory conditions. Subsequently, with the data obtained, we mathematically modeled the dynamics of P. viburni to study the impact on P. viburni control of different field implementation schedules for the release of ladybird and parasitoid populations. The ladybird fed on parasitized P. viburni but reduced its consumption when they were infested by parasitoids aged of 4 days or more. Modeling results suggest that these feeding preferences of predators may have a positive impact on pest control, that releasing predators and parasitoids together is in general more effective than releasing them independently, and that releasing highly effective predators alone could be the best choice. Modeling results also provide information on different release schedules.

AB  - The perinuclear theca (PT) is a highly condensed, largely insoluble protein structure that surrounds the nucleus of eutherian spermatozoa. Recent reports have indicated that the PT unexpectedly houses several somatic proteins, such as core histones, which may be important post-fertilization during re-modelling of the male pronucleus, yet little is known regarding the overall proteomic composition of the PT. Here, we report the first in depth, label-free proteomic characterization of the PT of boar spermatozoa following the implementation of a long-established subcellular fractionation protocol designed to increase the detection of low abundance proteins. A total of 1,802 proteins were identified, a result that represents unparalleled depth of coverage for the boar sperm proteome and exceeds the entire annotated proteome of the Sus scrofa species so far. In the PT structure itself, we identified 813 proteins and confirmed the presence of previously characterized PT proteins including the core histones H2A, H2B, H3 and H4, as well as Ras-related protein Rab-2A (RAB2A) and Rab-2B (RAB2B) amongst other RAB proteins. In addition to these previously characterized PT proteins, our data revealed that the PT is replete in proteins critical for sperm-egg fusion and egg activation, including: Izumo family members 1-4 (IZUMO1-4) and phosphoinositide specific phospholipase zeta (PLCZ1). Through Ingenuity Pathway Analysis, we found surprising enrichment of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) proteins and the ER-stress response in the PT. This is particularly intriguing as it is currently held that the ER structure is lost during testicular sperm maturation. Using the String and Cytoscape tools to visualize protein-protein interactions revealed an intricate network of PT protein complexes, including numerous proteasome subunits. Collectively, these data suggest that the PT may be a unique site of cellular homeostasis that houses an abundance of protein degradation machinery. This fits with previous observations that the PT structure dissociates first within the oocyte post-fertilization. It remains to be explored whether proteasome subunits within the PT actively assist in the protein degradation of paternal cell structures post-fertilization and how aberrations in PT protein content may delay embryonic development.

AB  - Simple SummaryKnowledge for the distribution and genetic diversity of Blastocystis sp. can provide novel insights for the prevention and control of this parasite. The present study first reported the occurrence of Blastocystis infection in Camelus bactrianus, an important economic animal in northwestern China. We found the existence of eight Blastocystis subtypes in C. bactrianus, indicating potential risks and transmission of Blastocystis sp. for C. bactrianus.Blastocystis sp. is an important zoonotic protist in humans and various animals with worldwide distribution. However, there have been no data on the occurrence of Blastocystis sp. in C. bactrianus, an important economic animal in northwestern China. In the present study, a PCR-sequencing tool based on the SSU rRNA gene was applied to investigate the prevalence and genetic diversity of Blastocystis sp. in 638 faecal samples from C. bactrianus in 21 sampling sites within three main breeding areas (Gansu, Inner Mongolia and Xinjiang) in northwestern China. The total prevalence of Blastocystis sp. was 21.8% (139/638) in C. bactrianus, with the infection rates of 29.5% (18/61), 50.0% (14/28) and 19.5% (107/549) for animals aged < 2 years, 2-6 years and > 6 years, respectively. Significant differences in prevalence were detected among C. bactrianus from three geographic areas (chi(2) = 19.972, df = 2, p < 0.001) and all sampling sites (chi(2) = 104.154, df = 20, p < 0.001). A total of 16 of 21 sampling sites were positive for Blastocystis sp., with the prevalence ranging from 7.7% to 70.6%. Sequence analysis of the SSU rRNA gene identified eight subtypes in C. bactrianus in the present study, including seven animal adapted subtypes (ST10, ST14, ST21, ST24, ST25, ST26 and ST30) and one potentially novel subtype, with ST10 being the dominant one. To the best of our knowledge, this study provides the first insight for the occurrence and genetic make-up of Blastocystis sp. in C. bactrianus and contributes to the understanding of the transmission of Blastocystis infection in C. bactrianus in China.

AB  - Insect wounding activates a large number of signals that function coordinately to modulate gene expression and elicit defense responses. How each signal influences gene expression in absence of wounding is also important since it can shed light on changes occurring during the shift to wound response. Using simulated Helicoverpa armigera herbivory on chickpea, we had identified at least 14 WRKY genes that showed 5-50 fold increase in expression within 5-20 min of wounding. Our studies show that contrary to their collective effects upon wounding, individual chemical cues show distinct and often opposite effects in absence of wounding. In particular, jasmonic acid, a key early defense hormone, reduced transcripts of most WRKY genes by > 50% upon treatment of unwounded chickpea leaves as did salicylic acid. Neomycin (a JA biosynthesis inhibitor) delayed and also reduced early wound expression. H2O2 transiently activated several genes within 5-20 min by 5-8 fold while ethylene activated only a few WRKY genes by 2-5 fold. The summation of the individual effects of these chemical cues does not explain the strong increase in transcript levels upon wounding. Detailed studies of a 931 nt region of the CaWRKY41 promoter, show strong wound-responsive GUS expression in Arabidopsis even in presence of neomycin. Surprisingly its expression was lost in the coi1, ein2 and myc2myc3myc4 mutant backgrounds suggesting the requirement of intact ethylene and JA signaling pathways (dependent on MYCs) for wound-responsive expression. The studies highlight the complexity of gene regulation by different chemical cues in the presence and absence of wounding.

AB  - Mycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis (MAP) is the etiological agent of Paratuberculosis, a contagious, untreatable, and chronic granulomatous enteritis that results in diarrhea, emaciation, and death in farmed ruminants (i.e., cattle, sheep, and goats). In this study, the Ag85B antigen from MAP was expressed in transgenic alfalfa as an attractive vaccine candidate. Agrobacterium-mediated transformation allowed the rescue of 56 putative transformed plants and transgenesis was confirmed in 19 lines by detection of the Ag85B gene (MAP1609c) by PCR. Line number 20 showed the highest Ag85B expression [840 ng Ag85B per gram of dry weight leaf tissue, 0.062% Total Soluble Protein (TSP)]. Antigenicity of the plant-made Ag85B was evidenced by its reactivity with a panel of sera from naturally MAP-infected animals, whereas immunogenicity was assessed in mice immunized by either oral or subcutaneous routes. The plant-made Ag85B antigen elicited humoral responses by the oral route when co-administered with cholera toxin as adjuvant; significant levels of anti-85B antibodies were induced in serum (IgG) and feces (IgA). Long-lasting immunity was evidenced at day 180 days post-first oral immunization. The obtained alfalfa lines expressing Ag85B constitute the first model of a plant-based vaccine targeting MAP. The initial immunogenicity assessment conducted in this study opens the path for a detailed characterization of the properties of this vaccine candidate.

AB  - Peripheral metabolic disturbances are associated with a variety of clinical health consequences and may contribute to the development of neurocognitive disorders. This study investigates whether long-term high-fat diet (HFD) consumption changes the brain glucose metabolism and impairs memory performance in a sex -dependent manner. Male and female rats, after weaning, were fed HFD or normal chow diet (NCD) for 16 weeks. Behavioral tests for spatial memory and an 18 F-FDG-PET scan were performed. Also, the expression of brain insulin resistance markers and Alzheimer's pathology-related genes was assessed by qPCR. The Morris water maze and Y-maze results showed, respectively, that memory retrieval and spatial working memory were impaired only in HFD male rats compared to NCD controls. In addition, measuring whole brain 18 F-FDG uptake indicated a significant reduction in glucose metabolism in male but not female HFD rats. Analysis of 15 genes related to glucose metabolism and Alzheimer's pathology, in the hippocampus, showed that expression of GLUT3, IRS2, and IDE is significantly reduced in HFD male rats. Our results suggest that sex affects the HFD-induced dysregulation of brain glucose metabolism and cognitive performance.

AB  - Aims: To investigate the interplay between gray matter (GM) and white matter (WM) neurodegeneration in subjective cognitive decline (SCD), including thickness across the whole cortical mantle, hippocampal volume, and integrity across the whole WM.
   Methods: We included 225 cognitively unimpaired individuals from a community-based cohort. Subjective cognitive complaints were assessed through 9 questions covering amnestic and non-amnestic cognitive domains. In our cohort, 123 individuals endorsed from one to six subjective cognitive complaints (i.e. they fulfilled the diagnostic criteria for SCD), while 102 individuals reported zero complaints. GM neurodegeneration was assessed through measures of cortical thickness across the whole mantle and hippocampal volume. WM neurodegeneration was assessed through measures of mean diffusivity (MD) across the whole WM skeleton. Mediation analysis and multiple linear regression were conducted to investigate the interplay between the measures of GM and WM neurodegeneration.
   Results: A higher number of complaints was associated with reduced hippocampal volume, cortical thinning in several frontal and temporal areas and the insula, and higher MD across the WM skeleton, with a tendency to spare the occipital lobe. SCD-related cortical thinning and increased MD were associated with each other and jointly contributed to complaints, but the contribution of cortical thinning to the number of complaints was stronger.
   Conclusions: Neurodegeneration processes affecting the GM and WM seem to be associated with each other in SCD and include brain areas other than those typically targeted by Alzheimer's disease. Our findings suggest that SCD may be a sensitive behavioral marker of heterogeneous brain pathologies in individuals recruited from the community.

AB  - The Yunnan snub-nosed monkey Rhinopithecus bieti is an endangered species distributed in a narrow strip of land extending from the north side of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau of China. To better understanding the Yunnan snub-nosed monkey's distribution and ecology, this study recorded the winter activity of the monkeys using infrared cameras and then employed MaxEnt modelling with six factors to analyse the habitat suitability for the species in the most critical season for its survival. The results showed that the main ecological factors affecting the habitat suitability of this species were aspect, altitude and distance from roads and rivers. The model identified low coverage of highly suitable (1.89 % of the entire reserve) and medium suitable (6.48 % of the entire reserve) habitats. The most suitable habitats were on the eastern and north-eastern slopes, at altitudes of 3100-3400 m a.s.l. The study revealed that the protection of primary forests, including the connectivity among areas of suitable habitats, is of great significance to the survival of this species.

AB  - Migrating cells preferentially breach and integrate epithelial and endothelial monolayers at multicellular vertices. These sites are amenable to forces produced by the migrating cell and subsequent opening of the junctions. However, the cues that guide migrating cells to these entry portals, and eventually drive the transmigration process, are poorly understood. Here, we show that lymphatic endothelium multicellular junctions are the preferred sites of dendritic cell transmigration in both primary cell co-cultures and in mouse dermal explants. Dendritic cell guidance to multicellular junctions was dependent on the dendritic cell receptor CCR7, whose ligand, lymphatic endothelial chemokine CCL21, was exocytosed at multicellular junctions. Characterization of lymphatic endothelial secretory routes indicated Golgi-derived RAB6+ vesicles and RAB3+/27+ dense core secretory granules as intracellular CCL21 storage vesicles. Of these, RAB6+ vesicles trafficked CCL21 to the multicellular junctions, which were enriched with RAB6 docking factor ELKS (ERC1). Importantly, inhibition of RAB6 vesicle exocytosis attenuated dendritic cell transmigration. These data exemplify how spatially-restricted exocytosis of guidance cues helps to determine where dendritic cells transmigrate.
   Leukocytes transmigrate endothelia at preferred locations. This study reveals that targeted exocytosis of lymphatic endothelial chemokine CCL21 directs dendritic cell transmigration to multicellular junctions.Dendritic cells preferentially transmigrate lymphatic endothelium at multicellular junctions. RAB6+ Golgi-derived vesicles and RAB3/27+ dense-core secretory granules are the major CCL21 chemokine storage granules in lymphatic endothelial cells. RAB6, together with RAB8 and ELKS, promotes targeted CCL21 exocytosis at lymphatic endothelial multicellular junctions. Blunting RAB6-mediated CCL21 exocytosis inhibits dendritic cell transmigration across lymphatic endothelium.
   Dendritic cells preferentially transmigrate at multicellular junctions in response to localized chemokine exocytosis.

AB  - Background Vitamin D is an immunomodulator, and its effects have been linked to many diseases, including the pathogenesis of cancer. However, the effect of vitamin D supplementation on the regulation of gene expression of the lungs is not fully understood. This study aims to determine the effect of the increased dose of cholecalciferol and a combination of cholecalciferol + calcidiol, as well as the replacement of cholecalciferol with calcidiol, on the miRNA profile of healthy swine lungs.Methods and results The swine were long-term (88 days) supplemented with a standard dose (2000IU/kg) of cholecalciferol and calcidiol, the increased dose (3000 IU/kg) of cholecalciferol, and the cholecalciferol + calcidiol combination: grower: 3000 IU/Kg of vitamin D (67% of cholecalciferol and 33% of calcidiol), finisher 2500 IU/Kg of vitamin D (60% of cholecalciferol and 40% of calcidiol). Swine lung tissue was used for Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) of miRNA. Long-term supplementation with the cholecalciferol + calcidiol combination caused significant changes in the miRNA profile. They embraced altered levels of the expression of miR-150, miR-193, miR-145, miR-574, miR-340, miR-381, miR-148 and miR-96 (q-value < 0.05). In contrast, raising the dose of cholecalciferol only changed the expression of miR-215, and the total replacement of cholecalciferol with calcidiol did not significantly affect the miRNAome profile.Conclusions The functional analysis of differentially expressed miRNAs suggests that the use of the increased dose of the cholecalciferol + calcidiol combination may affect tumorigenesis processes through, inter alia, modulation of gene regulation of the TGF- beta pathway and pathways related to metabolism and synthesis of glycan.

AB  - Natural defensive substances synthesized by plants that could replace synthetic pesticides in the protection of plants against insect invasions are constantly being sought. The study assessed changes in the qualitative and quantitative composition of secondary metabolites in horse chestnut leaves collected in different locations and differing in the sensitivity of the plant to the invasion by the horse-chestnut leaf miner. An attempt was made to identify compounds that are most responsible for the increased plant resistance to this threat. Additionally, changes in the anatomy of chestnut leaves affected by the pest were presented. It was noticed that the trees differed in the composition of secondary metabolites already in the initial growing season, which should be related to the influence of habitat conditions. The analysis of the profile of the compounds in non-infested and infested horse chestnut leaves revealed a clear response of the plant to the stress factor, i.e., the foraging of the horse-chestnut leaf miner. Catechins seem to be compounds involved in plant resistance. The leaf anatomy showed enhanced accumulation of phenolic compounds at the pest foraging sites. Hypertrophy and thickened and cracked cell walls of the spongy parenchyma were visible in the vicinity of the mines.

AB  - Deciding on plant species when considering planting design in landscape design studies is a complex phenomenon. Considering the planting designs implemented, especially in urban areas, it is observed that exotic species are used instead of the species that grow naturally in the region, and compositions that are not suitable in terms of design elements, principles and functions are created. For this reason, our aim in this study is to determine the effective plant characteristics in the preference of plants and to reveal which characteristics come to the fore. The plant characteristics that emerged as a result of the research were collected under five main groups: urban tolerance, landscape effect, regenerative characteristic, functional characteristic, and economic characteristic; and under 29 subgroups. In our study, the scoring method was used for selection criteria on 218 plant species grown in the Eastern Black Sea coastal areas, and the numerical data obtained from the scores were evaluated by factor and cluster analysis with the SPSS 16.0 program. Urban tolerance and landscape effect selection criteria came to the fore in the application-oriented designs of these plants growing on the Black Sea coast, and species such as Tilia rubra DC, Aesculus hippocastanum L., Elaeagnus angustifolia L., Eucalyptus camaldulensis Dehnh., and Juglans regia L., ecologically pleasing, and esthetically enriching the place, were found to have the highest score.

AB  - Insect development is regulated by a combination of juvenile hormone (JH) and 20-hydroxyecdysone (20E). Production of both JH and 20E is regulated by transforming growth factor -I3 (TGFI3) signaling. TGFI3 can be classified into two branches, the Activin and Bone Morphogenetic Protein (BMP) pathways. In Drosophila melanogaster, BMP signaling is critical for JH synthesis, whereas Activin signal is required to generate the large pulse of 20E necessary for entering metamorphosis. However, to which extent the roles of these signals are conserved remains unknown. Here we studied the role of an Activin component Smad on X (Smox) in post-embryonic development in a defoliating ladybird Henosepilachna vigintioctopunctata. RNA interference (RNAi)-aided knockdown of Hvsmox inhibited larval growth, and impaired larval development. All Hvmyo RNAi larvae arrested at the fourth-instar larval stage. Moreover, knockdown of Hvsmox delayed gut and Malpighian tubules remodeling. Furthermore, the expression of a JH biosynthesis gene (Hvjhamt), a JH receptor gene HvMet and a JH response gene HvKr-h1 was greatly enhanced. Conversely, the expression levels of an ecdysteroidogenesis gene (Hvspo), a 20E receptor gene (HvEcR) and six 20E response genes (HvBrC, HvE74, HvE75, HvE93, HvHR3 and HvHR4) were significantly lowered. Knockdown of HvMet partially restored the negative phenotypes in the Hvsmox RNAi beetles. Our results suggest that Smox exerts regulative roles in JH production, ecdysteroidogenesis and organ remodeling, thus contributing to modulate the larva-pupa-adult transformation in H. vigintioctopunctata.

AB  - Simple Summary Aflatoxin B1 is a mycotoxin produced by toxigenic moulds that contaminate feedstuffs. If aflatoxin B1 is ingested by ewes, they can get sick and aflatoxin M1 can be found in milk. The objective of this work was to study the transfer of different moderate doses of aflatoxin B1 ingested by Assaf ewes (40 or 80 mu g aflatoxin B1/day) into milk (aflatoxin M1) and its effect on animals' health and performance. There is a clear transfer of aflatoxin B1 (feed) into aflatoxin M1 (milk). The transfer rate depends on the aflatoxin B1 dose (the lower the dose, the higher the transfer rate) and milk yield (high-producing animals show higher transfer rates than low-producing ones). Ewes' milk yield and health were not visibly affected. The aim of this study was to investigate the in vivo transfer of aflatoxin B1 (AFB1) to Assaf ewes' milk (aflatoxin M1, AFM1) and its effect on animal performance and health. Thirty Assaf ewes were allocated to three groups (C, L, H), and received a different individual daily dose of AFB1 (0, 40 and 80 mu g) for 13 days. Milk (days 1, 2, 3, 4, 7, 14, 16 and 18) and blood (days 1, 7, 14 and 18) samples were collected. Milk yield, composition (except protein) and somatic cell counts (SCC) were not affected by AFB1 intake (p > 0.05). Haemoglobin concentration increased (p < 0.05) and haematocrit and alanine aminotransferase levels tended to increase (p < 0.10) in group H on day 14. AFM1 excretion was highly variable and detected in L and H animals from days 1 to 16 (3 days increase, 10 days steady-state, 3 days clearance). Carry-over rate (0.23%) was significantly higher in L (0.22-0.34%) than in H (0.16-0.19%) animals (p < 0.05). AFB1 daily doses of 40 to 80 mu g do not impair milk yield; however, it may start affecting animals' health. Milk AFM1 depends mainly on the AFB1 intake whereas carryover rate is positively influenced by the level of milk production.

AB  - BackgroundThe underlying mechanism of quetiapine (QET) in treating cognitive impairment in sleep deprivation is unclear. The present study aimed to evaluate the effects of treatment with QET on novel object recognition and hippocampal (hippo) brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) levels in rats submitted to 72 h sleep deprivation (SD).Materials and MethodsA total of 42 adult male Wistar albino rats were assigned into six experimental groups: non-sleep-deprived (NSD) control, short-term control group (n = 7) received a single intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection 10 mg/kg QET of 1 mL saline (4 days) (NSD-STQET), long-term control group (n = 7) received single i.p. injection 10 mg/kg QET of 1 mL saline (30 days) (NSD-LTQET); 72 h sleep-deprived (SD) group, 72 h SD short-term group received short-term i.p. injection 10 mg/kg QET of either (n = 7) (SD-STQET), and 72 h SD long-term group received long-term i.p. injection 10 mg/kg QET of either (n = 7) QET (SD-LTQET). SD was performed using the modified multiple-platform technique in a water tank for 72 h. Additionally, we aim to reveal the consequences of 72 h SD and QET effects on memory processes with hippo BDNF levels by testing rats in the novel object recognition (NOR) test and ELISA method.ResultsLong-term QET administration in healthy rats decreased NOR and BDNF protein expression in the hippocampus, as did 72 h SD. Long- and short-term QET administration reversed SD effects, but only short-term QET administration increased hippo BDNF.ConclusionThese results suggest that the beneficial effects of QET on SD may be partly related to the upregulation of recognition memory and neuroprotective proteins such as BDNF. However, long-term QET treatment in the absence of a disease model may have the potential to negatively impact recognition memory and BDNF levels, which support synaptic plasticity and cognitive function.

AB  - Aflatoxin is considered as one of the most harmful mycotoxins in the world to be found in human food and animal feed. Previous reports have revealed that Aflatoxin B1 (AFB1) may disrupt gamete development through epigenetic modifications as well as promotion of oxidative stress, excessive autophagy, and apoptosis. Therefore, in this study we aimed to address the effects of AFB1 on the meiotic and cytoplasmic maturation, internal reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, mitochondrial membrane potential (Delta Psi m), blastocyst formation as well as mRNA alterations for the apoptotic (BAX and Caspase3), anti-apoptotic (BCL2), and DNA methyltransferase (DNMTs) genes in ovine oocytes. To accomplish this, maturation of oocytes was performed in presence of increasing AFB1 concentrations (0, 10, 50, and 100 mu M). Meiotic and cytoplasmic maturation, intracellular ROS level, and Delta Psi m were evaluated following 24 h of IVM. Embryonic cleavage and blastocyst formation following fertilization were also assessed. We also investigated alterations of BAX, BCL2,Caspase3, DNMT1, DNMT3a, and DMT3b mRNA levels in mature oocytes. In the presence of 50 and 100 mu M AFB1, the number of oocytes reaching the metaphase II stage decreased and the oocytes presented with lower intracellular levels of GSH (P < 0.05). Furthermore, intracellular ROS production in matured oocytes reached the highest-level following exposure to 50 and 100 mu M of AFB1 (P < 0.05). Reduction of Delta Psi m was clearly evident in the AFB1-treated groups (P < 0.05). Rates of cleavage and blastocyst formation decreased in the presence of AFB1 as compared with those recorded in the Control group (P < 0.05). Apoptosis-related gene analysis in AFB1 treated groups (10 and 50 mu M) revealed a higher abundance of the BAX and Caspase3 genes, and a lower abundance of the BCL2 gene as compared with the Control group (P < 0.05). Additionally, our data showed that relative abundances of DNMT3b gene decreased in the 10 mu M group when compared to the Control group (P < 0.05). We showed that exposure of oocytes to AFB1 leads to a reduced nuclear and cytoplasmic maturation that may ultimately impair the embryonic development in the sheep oocyte. Furthermore, alterations in DNA methylation and initiation of apoptosis through excessive ROS generation could be a prime molecular mechanism responsible for the disruption of oocyte developmental competence in the presence of AFB1 in the ovine model.

AB  - IntroductionAccumulating evidence highlights the key role of adult neurogenesis events in environmental challenges, cognitive functions and mood regulation. Abnormal hippocampal neurogenesis has been implicated in anxiety-like behaviors and social impairments, but the possible mechanisms remain elusive.MethodsThe present study questioned the contribution of altered excitation/inhibition as well as excessive neuroinflammation in regulating the neurogenic processes within the Social Decision-Making (SDM) network, using an adult zebrafish model displaying NMDA receptor hypofunction after sub-chronic MK-801 administration. For this, the alterations in cell proliferation and newborn cell densities were evaluated using quantitative 5-Bromo-2 '-Deoxyuridine (BrdU) methodology.ResultsIn short-term survival experiments. MK-801-treated zebrafish displayed decreased cell proliferation pattern within distinct neurogenic zones of telencephalic and preoptic SDM nodes, in parallel to the social withdrawal and anxiety-like comorbidity. BrdU+ cells co-expressed the pro-inflammatory marker IL-1 beta solely in MK-801-treated zebrafish, indicating a role of inflammation. Following the cessation of drug treatment, significant increases in the BrdU+ cell densities were accompanied by the normalization of the social and anxiety-like phenotype. Importantly, most labeled cells in neurogenic zones showed a radial glial phenotype while a population of newborn cells expressed the early neuronal marker TOAD or mGLuR5, the latter suggesting the possible involvement of metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 in neurogenic events.DiscussionOverall, our results indicate the role of radial glial cell proliferation in the overlapping pathologies of anxiety and social disorders, observed in many neuropsychiatric disorders and possibly represent potential novel targets for amelioration of these symptoms.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Improper herbicide application can affect tea plant physiology and elevate risks to tea consumption. This study investigated the absorption, distribution, and metabolism of glyphosate (GLY), bentazone (BNTZ), and atrazine (ATZ) in hydroponic tea seedlings under single and mixed treatments at concentrations of 20, 50, and 100 mg L-1 over 5 and 13 days. RESULTS: Chlorophyll content decreased by 29.4-39.5% after mixed treatment at 100 mg L-1 for 13 days, whereas malondialdehyde content increased by 0.99-1.37-fold compared with single treatment. The distribution of ATZ and BNTZ after single treatment was roots > stems > mature leaves > young leaves, whereas GLY distribution was roots > stems > young leaves > mature leaves under both treatments. Deethyl atrazine (an ATZ metabolite) residues were 4.58- and 1.44-fold higher than deisopropylatrazine (another metabolite of ATZ) after single and mixed treatments respectively. The total 8-OH bentazone (a BNTZ metabolite) content was 6.23 times greater under mixed treatment than single treatment. In addition, GLY and its metabolite aminomethyl phosphonic acid residues were 0.24-17.9-fold and 0.05-478-fold higher after mixed treatment compared with single treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Herbicide mixtures typically led to greater accumulation of both precursors and metabolites compared with single herbicide applications, and longer exposure times resulted in higher residue levels and more severe phytotoxic effects. These findings provide a reference for safer herbicide use in tea plantations, ensuring the quality and safety of tea products. (c) 2025 Society of Chemical Industry.

AB  - Maternal immune activation (MIA) is a risk factor for schizophrenia. Since memory for sequence and stimulus order are disrupted in individuals with schizophrenia, we tested whether MIA animals showed deficits in a sequence learning and object-place recency memory task. In experiment one, control and MIA-challenged rats were required to nose poke five ports in a cued sequence. The sequences were presented randomly except for one structured sequence that was repetitive and initiated from the same port. Both groups were more accurate on the structured sequence and learned the task at similar rates. When a new structured sequence was presented, control animals were able to respond flexibly and take advantage of the structure, whereas the performance of MIA animals was similar for random and structured sequences. Experiment two tested MIA and control rats were evaluated in a Temporal Ordering for Spatial Locations task (TOSL). Control animals had a significant preference for the object in the least-recent location, indicating a novelty preference, while MIA animals did not, although the between-group difference failed to reach significance. Exploration patterns changed differentially over time, possibly because of variation in habituation processes. As a result, MIA animals were significantly less likely to explore the object at the least-recent location during the second half of the exploration session, compared to control animals. Collectively these studies indicate that while MIA animals are unimpaired in simple sequence learning, they display changes in behaviour compared to controls. Differences may result from habituation rate or inflexibility when responding to change.

AB  - Simple Summary One of the limiting factors in sheep husbandry is reproductive seasonality, which is regulated by nocturnal melatonin secretion. Subcutaneous implants of this hormone have been used to modulate this seasonality. Nowadays, consumers are increasingly concerned about organic, hormone-free production. In order to adapt sheep production to these new demands, it would be of interest to replace synthetic melatonin with phytomelatonin, which is present in plants and can be included in sheep diet. In addition, if phytomelatonin comes from by-products from the food industry, a further step would be taken towards the objectives of the circular economy. Thus, the main objective of this work was to evaluate the effect of phytomelatonin-rich diets on ram sperm quality and seminal plasma composition. With this work, we found that a phytomelatonin-rich diet, including a mix of grape pulp, and pomegranate and tomato pomaces, can increase melatonin levels in seminal plasma, improve sperm viability and morphology, and protect sperm cells against oxidative damage. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of a phytomelatonin-rich diet, including by-products from the food industry, on ram sperm quality and seminal plasma composition. Melatonin content in several by-products before and after in vitro ruminal and abomasal digestion was determined by HPLC-ESI-MS/MS. Finally, 20% of a mix of grape pulp with pomegranate and tomato pomaces was included in the rams' diet, constituting the phytomelatonin-rich diet. Feeding the rams with this diet resulted in an increase in seminal plasma melatonin levels compared with the control group (commercial diet) in the third month of the study. In addition, percentages higher than those in the control group of morphologically normal viable spermatozoa with a low content of reactive oxygen species were observed from the second month onwards. However, the antioxidant effect does not seem to be exerted through the modulation of the antioxidant enzymes since the analysis of the activities of catalase, glutathione reductase and glutathione peroxidase in seminal plasma revealed no significant differences between the two experimental groups. In conclusion, this study reveals, for the first time, that a phytomelatonin-rich diet can improve seminal characteristics in rams.

AB  - Although mushrooms are widely used for nutraceutical purposes, post -harvest storage is extremely crucial to avoid degradation and quality reduction in fresh mushrooms. Drying treatments are commonly applied in the mushroom industry to extend shelf life. Drying may cause instability of food quality and antioxidant parameters due to unsuitable drying temperatures. Therefore, in this research a common set of temperatures typically used by mushroom growers was applied (50 degrees C, 60 degrees C, 70 degrees C) to Ganoderma lucidum, Lignosus rhinocerus, Auricularia auricula-judae, and Schizophyllum commune to analyze color changes and concentration of elements and phenolic compounds. Mushrooms were chosen based on commonly cultivated species among growers. L. rhinocerus dried at 70 degrees C indicated significantly lower L* (78.90) compared to control (89.94). Element retention in each sample differed depending on the species. The amount of calcium was significantly higher in L. rhinocerus (11,893 mg/kg) and A. auricula-judae (10,941.81 mg/kg) when dried at 60 degrees C. Drying at 70 degrees C resulted in significantly higher magnesium for Sch. commune (13,054.38 mg/kg) and A. auricula-judae (80,56.92 mg/kg). Higher levels of iron and manganese were observed in Sch. commune dried at 70 degrees C (216.54 and 10.02 mg/kg, respectively). Gallic acid had significantly higher retention at 50 degrees C for A. auricula-judae and G. lucidum. Meanwhile, L. rhinocerus and Sch. commune showed significantly higher gallic acid at 60 degrees C. It is evident from these results that temperature does affect the food quality and elemental parameters during the drying process for each mushroom.

AB  - In the heart, the delayed rectifier K current, I-K, composed of the rapid (I-Kr) and slow (I-Ks) components contributes prominently to normal cardiac repolarization. In lipotoxicity, chronic elevation of pro-inflammatory cytokines may remodel I-K, elevating the risk for ventricular arrythmias and sudden cardiac death. We investigated whether and how the pro-inflammatory interleukin-6 altered I-K in the heart, using electrophysiology to evaluate changes in I-K in adult guinea pig ventricular myocytes. We found that palmitic acid (a potent inducer of lipotoxicity), induced a rapid (~24 h) and significant increase in IL-6 in RAW264.7 cells. PA-diet fed guinea pigs displayed a severely prolonged QT interval when compared to low-fat diet fed controls. Exposure to isoproterenol induced torsade de pointes, and ventricular fibrillation in lipotoxic guinea pigs. Pre-exposure to IL-6 with the soluble IL-6 receptor produced a profound depression of I-Kr and I-Ks densities, prolonged action potential duration, and impaired mitochondrial ATP production. Only with the inhibition of I-Kr did a proarrhythmic phenotype of I-Ks depression emerge, manifested as a further prolongation of action potential duration and QT interval. Our data offer unique mechanistic insights with implications for pathological QT interval in patients and vulnerability to fatal arrhythmias.</p>

AB  - This study discusses the genetic mutations that have a significant association with economically important traits that would benefit tea breeders. The purpose of this study was to analyze the leaf quality and SNPs in quality-related genes in the tea plant collection of 20 mutant genotypes growing without nitrogen fertilizers. Leaf N-content, catechins, L-theanine, and caffeine contents were analyzed in dry leaves via HPLC. Additionally, the photochemical yield, electron transport efficiency, and non-photochemical quenching were analyzed using PAM-fluorimetry. The next generation pooled amplicon-sequencing approach was used for SNPs-calling in 30 key genes related to N metabolism and leaf quality. The leaf N content varied significantly among genotypes (p <= 0.05) from 2.3 to 3.7% of dry mass. The caffeine content varied from 0.7 to 11.7 mg g(-1), and the L-theanine content varied from 0.2 to 5.8 mg g(-1) dry leaf mass. Significant positive correlations were detected between the nitrogen content and biochemical parameters such as theanine, caffeine, and most of the catechins. However, significant negative correlations were observed between the photosynthetic parameters (Y, ETR, Fv/Fm) and several biochemical compounds, including rutin, Quercetin-3-O-glucoside, Kaempferol-3-O-rutinoside, Kaempferol-3-O-glucoside, Theaflavin-3 '-gallate, gallic acid. From our SNP-analysis, three SNPs in WRKY57 were detected in all genotypes with a low N content. Moreover, 29 SNPs with a high or moderate effect were specific for #316 (high N-content, high quality) or #507 (low N-content, low quality). The use of a linear regression model revealed 16 significant associations; theaflavin, L-theanine, and ECG were associated with several SNPs of the following genes: ANSa, DFRa, GDH2, 4CL, AlaAT1, MYB4, LHT1, F3 ' 5 ' Hb, UFGTa. Among them, seven SNPs of moderate effect led to changes in the amino acid contents in the final proteins of the following genes: ANSa, GDH2, 4Cl, F3 ' 5 ' Hb, UFGTa. These results will be useful for further evaluations of the important SNPs and will help to provide a better understanding of the mechanisms of nitrogen uptake efficiency in tree crops.

AB  - Porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV2) is highly prevalent in nature and serves as the primary pathogen responsible for porcine circovirus-associated disease (PCVD/PCVAD), posing a significant threat to pig production. Currently, vaccination alone could not provide the complete protection for PCV2 infection. The active ingredients of traditional Chinese medicine have shown a positive effect in combating viral infections. This study employed tandem mass tag (TMT) labeled proteomic analyses and network pharmacology to examine the effect and mechanism of sanguinarine against PCV2. IFIH1, IFITM1, p38 alpha, and JNK were identified as the key targets of sanguinarine against PCV2 based on proteomics and network pharmacology. Using PCV2-infected PK-15 cells, it was discovered that sanguinarine inhibited the expression of the PCV2 CAP gene by upregulating IFIH1, thereby promoting STAT1 phosphorylation and activating MAVS expression. This, in turn, facilitated IRF3 phosphorylation, leading to increase IFITM1 expression. Simultaneously, sanguinarine suppressed the expression of the PCV2 CAP gene by inhibiting the expression of p38 alpha, JNK, and p-JNK protein. In conclusion, the results of this study suggest that sanguinarine exerts anti-PCV2 effects through different targets and pathways, which lays the foundation for the subsequent development of new anti-PCV2 veterinary drugs.

AB  - This study aimed to determine the effects of the dietary supplementation of chromium methionine (CrMet) and ractopamine (RAC) on pigs in the growing-finishing stage under heat stress. The parameters evaluated included productive behavior, blood components, carcass characteristics, organ weight, and meat quality. This study was conducted during the summer season in Sonora, Mexico. The treatments included: (1) control diet (CON), a base diet (BD) formulated to satisfy the nutritional requirements of pigs; (2) RAC, BD plus 10 ppm RAC supplemented during the last 34 days of the study; (3) CrMet-S, BD supplemented with 0.8 ppm of Cr from CrMet during the last 34 days; and (4) CrMet-L, BD supplemented with 0.8 ppm of Cr from CrMet for an 81 d period. RAC supplementation improved the productive behavior and main carcass characteristics of the pigs compared with CON. However, RAC and CrMet supplementation during the last 34 days showed similar results in terms of weight gain, carcass quality, blood components, organ weight, and meat quality. The addition of CrMet-S had a moderate (although not significant) increase in productive performance and carcass weight. These findings are encouraging, as they suggest that CrMet may be a potential alternative for growth promotion. However, more research is needed.

AB  - This study aimed to investigate the mechanism by which Se in regulates the proliferation and apoptosis of sheep Leydig cells via the miR-200a/NRF pathway. The cells were isolated and purified from the testes of 8-month-old sheep via a Percoll density gradient. After the cells were treated with different concentrations of Se (0, 2.0, 4.0, 6.0, and 8.0 mu mol/L of Se) for 18 h, the miR-200a levels was detected. MiR-200a mimics and inhibitors were transfected into the cells, resulting in five groups (control, NC mimics, miR-200a mimics, NC inhibitor and miR-200a inhibitor). Cell viability and antioxidant status were measured via CCK8 and antioxidant assays, respectively. The abundances of pro-apoptotic (BAX, CASPASE 3 and CASPASE 8), cell cycle (P21, P27 and CDK1), and NRF2-related (NRF2, HO-1, NQO1 and KEAP1) genes were detected by real-time PCR and Western blot analysis. The results revealed that miR-200a mimics group presented greater (P < 0.05) abundances of NRF2, HO-1 and NQO1 mRNA transcripts and proteins. Compared with those both in the NC mimics and the miR-200a inhibitor groups, the activities of GSH-Px and SOD, as well as cell viability in the miR-200a mimics group were significantly greater (P < 0.05). In contrast, the ROS levels, MDA content and abundances of KEAP1, P21, P27 and apoptosis-related genes mRNA transcripts and proteins were decreased (P < 0.05). The highest (P < 0.05) miR-200a expression level was detected in the Se-6.0 group. Compared with that in the Se (6.0 mu mol/L) group, cell viability in the Se + miR-200a inhibitor group was lower (P < 0.05). The abundances of NRF2, HO-1 and NQO1 in the Se + miR-200a inhibitor group were lower (P < 0.05) than those in the Se (6.0 mu mol/L) group but greater (P < 0.05) than those in the inhibitor group, while KEAP1 displayed the opposite trend (P < 0.05). These results indicate that Se can activate the NRF2 antioxidant signaling pathway to regulate the proliferation and apoptosis of sheep Leydig cells and that miR-200a plays a vital role in this process. The regulatory effect of Se on male reproduction and spermatogenesis may be related to the number of Leydig cells. This study aimed to provide experimental data for Se regulation of spermatogenesis.

AB  - Subterranean termites build underground tunnels for foraging. The obtained food is transported to the nest through these tunnels, and consumed to maintain the termite colony. In this process, termites can cause damage to wooden structures. To develop effective control strategies to reduce termite damage, it is important to know the sizes of the termite populations in the tunnels. In this study, we proposed a method for estimating the termite population size using the spatial statistic indices including fractal dimension (FD), local density (LD), and join count statistic (JCS) for the tunnel patterns. However, the method needs further improvement to be applied in field conditions. For the method, we generated 8,000 tunnel pattern images (1,000 images for each N) using an agent-based model based on experimental data. Here, N (= 3, 4, ..., 10) represents the number of termites participating in tunnel construction in the simulation. Subsequently, we calculated the FD, LD and JCS values of the tunnel pattern and trained and verified the k-nearest neighbors (KNN) algorithm, using 5,600 and 2,400 images, respectively. The population size (N) was estimated based on the FD, LD and JCS using the KNN algo-rithm. The estimated accuracy for all N was 60% to 97% in the range of k = 1 to 300. If the model for tunnel pattern generation includes heterogeneous environmental conditions, the proposed method could be used to effectively estimate the actual number of termite populations. Finally, we briefly discuss the challenges affecting our model, and how these could be overcome.

AB  - BACKGROUNDSolid-state fermentation (SSF) is a general approach for preparing food and feed, which not only improves nutrition but also provides prebiotics and metabolites. Although many studies have been conducted on the effects of fermentation on feed substrate, the dynamics of microbiota and metabolites in SSF remain unclear. Here, high-throughput sequencing combined with gas chromatography-quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry was used to evaluate the dynamic changes of solid fermented soybean meal and corn mixed matrix inoculated with Bacillus pumilus and Limosilactobacillus fermentum. RESULTSGenerally, inoculated bacteria rapidly proliferated, accompanied by the degradation of macromolecular proteins and an increase in the content of small peptides, trichloroacetic acid-soluble protein, free amino acids and organic acids. Bacillus, Lactobacillus and Enterococcus dominated the whole fermentation process. 389 non-volatile metabolites and 182 volatile metabolites were identified, including amino acids, organic acids, ketones, aldehydes, furans and pyrazine. Typical non-volatile metabolites such as lactic acid, 4-aminobutanoic acid, l-glutamic acid, d-arabinose and volatile metabolites such as 4-ethyl-2-methoxyphenol, 4-penten-2-ol, 2-pentanone, 2-ethylfuran, 2-methylhexanoic acid and butanoic acid-ethyl ester were significantly increased in two-stage solid fermentation. However, some adverse metabolites were also produced, such as oxalic acid, acetic acid, tyramine and n-butylamine, which may affect the quality of fermented feed. Sixteen genera were significantly correlated with differential non-volatile metabolites, while 11 genera were significantly correlated with differential volatile metabolites. CONCLUSIONThese results characterized the dynamic changes in the process of two-stage solid-state fermentation with Bacillus pumilus and Limosilactobacillus fermentum and provided a potential reference for additional intervention on improving the effectiveness and efficiency of solid-state fermentation of feed in the future. & COPY; 2023 Society of Chemical Industry.

AB  - Conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) is a potential nutritional strategy to regulate meat quality in pigs and produce high-quality pork. However, the effects of CLA on nutritional quality, lipid dynamics, microbiota, and their metabolites in the gut of pigs remain unclear. Our study explored the effects of CLA on lipo-nutritional quality based on a Heigai pig model and investigated the regulatory mechanism using an integrated analysis of multiple omics. A total of 58 Heigai finishing pigs (body weight: 85.58 +/- 10.39 kg) were randomly divided into 2 treatments and fed diets containing 1% soyabean oil and 1% CLA for 40 days. 1% CLA significantly decreased the backfat thickness (P < 0.05) and increased the intramuscular fat (IMF) content (P < 0.05). The expression of lipid metabolism-related genes was significantly changed (P < 0.05) and lipidome analysis showed the alternations of lipid dynamics in the longissimus dorsi muscle (LDM). In addition, based on the microbiome and metabolomic analyses, the relative abundances of Parabacteroides, Bacteroides, and Lachnospiraceae_UCG-010 increased and CLA changed the metabolome profiles and the short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) composition in the gut, which were significantly increased (P < 0.05). Additionally, Pearson's correlation analysis indicated that differential microbial genera and SCFAs induced by CLA had tight correlations with the backfat thickness, IMF content and lipids in the LDM. CLA enhances the lipid accumulation and metabolism in muscle and these changes are associated with the production and functions of the differential bacteria and SCFAs in the gut of pigs.

AB  - BACKGROUND: For most insect herbivores, where females decide to lay their eggs has a significant impact on offspring survival. Although females' behavior is essential for oviposition site selection, it is unclear what role the egg itself has in this process. RESULTS: Two closely related spittlebugs, Callitettix versicolor and Abidama liuensis, with diametrically opposite egg colors, were selected to investigate whether egg color has a vital role in oviposition site selection. Both spittlebugs preferred to lay eggs on the side of the substrate that had more light. Eggs laid by C. versicolor on the substrates were positioned significantly higher than eggs laid by A. liuensis. A higher position meant more light and more ultraviolet (UV) radiation. Accordingly, the different egg colors of these two spittlebugs resulted in different resistance abilities toward UV radiation. C. versicolor eggs, which are black, were more tolerant of UV radiation than the white eggs of A. liuensis. The color difference between the two spittlebugs' eggs is caused by their melanin compositions. The UV tolerance of C. versicolor eggs allows females to occupy more space to lay eggs than A. liuensis. Consequently, the egg density of A. liuensis was higher than that of C. versicolor. CONCLUSION: This study revealed that closely related species use different egg colors to segregate their eggs on the same host plant, ensuring their coexistence in the same habitat. The results also provide a behavioral and ecological basis for prevention and control strategies for these two pests. (c) 2025 Society of Chemical Industry.

AB  - G9 group A rotaviruses (RVAs) are considered emerging pathogens in pigs and humans, and pigs are considered a potential host reservoir for human G9 RVAs. In this study, RVAs of two genotypes, G9P[23] and G9P[13], were successfully isolated and the genomic sequences were obtained, the genome constellation is G9-P[23]-I5-R1-C1-M1-A8-N1-T1-E1-H1 and G9-P[13]-I5-R1-C1-M1-A8-N1-T7-E1-H1 respectively. One strain which amplified from clinic faecal sample had an unique genome constellation G9-P[23]-I1-R1-C1-M1-A8-N1-T1-E1-H1. All the genomic segments of three porcine G9 RVAs were closely related to those of porcine and/or porcine-like human RVAs, demonstrating that the three viruses were porcine-human reassortant strains. To study the immunogenicity of the porcine G9 RVAs, 6-week-old female BALB/c mice were immunized with inactivated vaccines derived from porcine RVAs and then mated. The highest titres of neutralizing antibodies against G9P[23] and G9P[13] porcine RVAs (1,291 +/- 35.22 and 1:232 +/- 39.28 respectively) were produced in mice 7 days after the second immunization. Suckling mice born to the vaccinated dams were protected by maternal antibodies against challenge with homologous strains. Overall, our data demonstrate the occurrence of porcine-human reassortants of G9 RVAs, and extend our understanding of the immunogenicity of porcine G9 rotaviruses. They also provide a basis for the development of a porcine G9 RVA vaccine.

AB  - Many insects engage in stable nutritional symbioses with bacteria that supplement limiting essential nutrients to their host. While several plant sap-feeding Hemipteran lineages are known to be simultaneously associated with two or more endosymbionts with complementary biosynthetic pathways to synthesize amino acids or vitamins, such co-obligate symbioses have not been functionally characterized in other insect orders. Here, we report on the characterization of a dual co-obligate, bacteriome-localized symbiosis in a family of xylophagous beetles using comparative genomics, fluorescence microscopy, and phylogenetic analyses. Across the beetle family Bostrichidae, most investigated species harbored the Bacteroidota symbiont Shikimatogenerans bostrichidophilus that encodes the shikimate pathway to produce tyrosine precursors in its severely reduced genome, likely supplementing the beetles' cuticle biosynthesis, sclerotisation, and melanisation. One clade of Bostrichid beetles additionally housed the co-obligate symbiont Bostrichicola ureolyticus that is inferred to complement the function of Shikimatogenerans by recycling urea and provisioning the essential amino acid lysine, thereby providing additional benefits on nitrogen-poor diets. Both symbionts represent ancient associations within the Bostrichidae that have subsequently experienced genome erosion and co-speciation with their hosts. While Bostrichicola was repeatedly lost, Shikimatogenerans has been retained throughout the family and exhibits a perfect pattern of co-speciation. Our results reveal that co-obligate symbioses with complementary metabolic capabilities occur beyond the well-known sap-feeding Hemiptera and highlight the importance of symbiont-mediated cuticle supplementation and nitrogen recycling for herbivorous beetles.

AB  - Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) attract interest in regenerative medicine for their potential application in bone regeneration. However, direct transplantation of cells into damaged tissue is not efficient enough to regenerate large bone defects. This problem could be solved with a biocompatible scaffold. Consequently, bone tissue engineering constructs based on biomaterial scaffolds, MSCs, and osteogenic cytokines are promising tools for bone regeneration. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of FGF-2 and BMP-2 on the osteogenic potential of ovine bone marrow-derived MSCs seeded onto an nHAP-coated PCL/HAP/beta-TCP scaffold in vitro and its in vivo biocompatibility in a sheep model. In vitro analysis revealed that cells preconditioned with FGF-2 and BMP-2 showed a better capacity to adhere and proliferate on the scaffold than untreated cells. BM-MSCs cultured in an osteogenic medium supplemented with FGF-2 and BMP-2 had the highest osteogenic differentiation potential, as assessed based on Alizarin Red S staining and ALP activity. qRT-PCR analysis showed increased expression of osteogenic marker genes in FGF-2- and BMP-2-treated BM-MSCs. Our pilot in vivo research showed that the implantation of an nHAP-coated PCL/HAP/beta-TCP scaffold with BM-MSCs preconditioned with FGF-2 and BMP-2 did not have an adverse effect in the sheep mandibular region and induced bone regeneration. The biocompatibility of the implanted scaffold-BM-MSC construct with sheep tissues was confirmed by the expression of early (collagen type I) and late (osteocalcin) osteogenic proteins and a lack of an elevated level of proinflammatory cytokines. These findings suggest that FGF-2 and BMP-2 enhance the osteogenic differentiation potential of MSCs grown on a scaffold, and that such a tissue engineering construct may be used to regenerate large bone defects.

AB  - Accumulating evidence suggests that nanoplastics contribute to an increased risk of brain damage, however, the precise underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Here, we subjected mice to long-term exposure to aminomodified polystyrene nanoplastics (APS-NPs). These nanoplastics were detected in the mouse brain; coupled with the observed upregulation of Alzheimer's disease-associated genes (APP and MAPT). To further explore nanoplastic damage mechanisms and the corresponding protective strategies against these mechanisms in vitro, we used hCMEC/D3 and HT22 cells. Results showed that APS-NPs disrupted tight junction proteins (Occludin and ZO-1) via TLR2/MMP9 axis, resulting in blood-brain barrier permeation; this was significantly mitigated by functional food Camellia pollen treatment. APS-NPs initiated iNOS and nNOS upregulation within neurons resulting in Sirtuin 1 deacetylase inactivation and CBP acetyltransferase stimulation, ultimately leading to Ac -Tau formation. This process was attenuated by Camellia pollen, which also ameliorated the APS-NPs-induced neuronal apoptosis mediated by the p53/Bax/Bcl-2 axis. Network pharmacology analysis of Camellia pollen offered a further theoretical understanding of its potential applications in preventing and treating nervous system disorders, such as Alzheimer's disease. This study established that Camellia pollen protects the brain against APS-NPs-mediated blood-brain barrier damage and alleviates neuronal apoptosis and Alzheimer's disease-like neurotoxicity. This study elucidates the mechanisms underlying polystyrene-induced brain damage and can be used to inform future prevention and treatment strategies.

AB  - Wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) is cultivated as a monocotyledonous plant in a large part of the world. The Wheat aphid, Schizaphis graminum Rondani (Hemiptera: Aphididae), is among the most important pests of wheat. One of the most important predators of this pest is Hippodamia variegata Goeze. Considering the use of insecticide spirotetramat in cereal fields, in this study, the lethal and sub-lethal effects of this insecticide were investigated on the biological characteristics and parameters of the life table of S. graminum and predator H. variegata. The experiments were performed at a temperature of 27 +/- 1(degrees)C, relative humidity of 65 +/- 10%, and a photoperiod of 16:8 (light:dark). For this purpose, biometric and life table experiments were performed by immersing wheat leaves in insecticide and placing adult aphids on them, and feeding adonis ladybird larvae from the treated aphids. Insecticide side effects were estimated using the International Organization for Biological Control (IOBC) method and a two-sex life table. The LC50 level of spirotetramat insecticide for aphids and predators was 210.93 and 725.86 mg/l, respectively. The results of this study indicate that there is a significant difference between treatments in terms of the intrinsic rate of increase (r), finite rate of increase (lambda), mean generation times (T), net reproduction rate (R-0), and gross reproduction rate (GRR) parameters in aphids and adonis ladybird. The highest and lowest rates of the reproduction and population growth of the studied insects were related to the control and LC30 spirotetramat treatments, respectively. According to the IOBC classification, the concentration of LC10 in spirotetramat was harmless to the adonis ladybird H. variegata, while the LC30 concentration of this insecticide was slightly harmful to this species. Experiments showed that the sub-lethal concentrations of the insecticide spirotetramat had a significant negative effect on the life table parameters of the Wheat aphid.

AB  - Phylogeographic, population genetics and diversity analysis are crucial for local tea resource conservation and breeding programs. Lincang in Yunnan has been known as the possible place of domestication for tea worldwide, yet, its genetic makeup and unique Lincang origin are little understood. Here, we reported a large-scale whole-genome resequencing based population genomic analysis in eight main tea-producing areas of Lincang in Yunnan (1,350 accessions), and the first comprehensive map of tea genome variation in Lincang was constructed. Based on the population structure, tea sample in Lincang was divided into three subgroups, and inferred Xigui and Nahan Tea Mountain in Linxiang, Baiying Mountain Ancient Tea Garden in Yun, and Jinxiu Village of Xiaowan Town in Fengqing, which belong to the birthplace of the three subgroups, were all likely to be the origin center of Lincang tea. Meanwhile, the history population sizes analysis show that similar evolutionary patterns were observed for the three subgroups of Lincang. It also was observed that the hybrid among eight areas of Lincang was noticeable, resulting in insignificant genetic differentiation between geographical populations and low genetic diversity. The findings of this study clarified the genetic make-up and evolutionary traits of the local population of tea, which gave some insight into the development of Lincang tea.

AB  - Testosterone is secreted by Leydig cells (LCs), which play an important physiological role in preserving male secondary sex characteristics, protecting male reproductive function, and establishing the blood-testis barrier. Studies have shown that autophagy is particularly active in LCs; however, its involvement in testosterone synthesis in porcine LCs has not been fully explored. Therefore, this experiment aimed to investigate the influence of autophagy on testosterone secretion in porcine LCs and its potential regulatory mechanism. Our results demonstrated that both testicular autophagy and serum testosterone levels increased in piglets during postnatal development from 4 to 18 weeks. In addition, autophagy was found to degrade the Na+/H+ exchange regulatory factor 2 (NHERF2), leading to the up-regulation of scavenger receptor class B type 1 (SRB1). This process resulted in increased cholesterol intake and enhanced testosterone production. The observable level of sirtuin 1 (SIRT1) was directly proportional to the level of autophagy. In vitro investigations have shown that SIRT1 can affect the level of autophagy, cholesterol uptake as well as testosterone release. In conclusion, testosterone synthesis during pig development is regulated by SIRT1. SIRT1 mediates the degradation of NHERF2 through autophagy, thereby weakening its negative regulatory effect on the high-density lipoprotein receptor SRB1 in Leydig cells. This process increases cholesterol uptake and enhances testosterone synthesis.

AB  - Golden2, ARR-B, Psr1 (GARP) proteins are plant-specific transcription factors that play vital and diverse roles in plants. However, systematic research on the GARP gene family in plants, including tea plant (Camellia sinensis), is scarce. In this study, a total of 69 GARP genes were identified and characterized from the tea plant genome based on the B-motif sequence signature. The CsGARP genes were clustered into five subfamilies: PHR1/PHL1, KAN, NIGT1/HRS1/HHO, GLK and ARR-B subfamilies. The phylogenetic relationships, gene structures, chromosomal locations, conserved motifs and regulatory cis-acting elements of the CsGARP family members were comprehensively analyzed. The expansion of CsGARP genes occurred via whole-genome duplication/segmental duplication, proximal duplication, and dispersed duplication under purifying selective pressure. The expression patterns of the CsGARP genes were systematically explored from various perspectives: in different tissues during different seasons; in different leaf color stages of tea plant; under aluminum treatment and nitrogen treatment; and in response to abiotic stresses such as cold, drought and salt and to biotic stress caused by Acaphylla theae. The results demonstrate that CsGARP family genes are ubiquitously expressed and play crucial roles in the regulation of growth and development of tea plant and the responses to environmental stimuli. Collectively, these results not only provide valuable information for further functional investigations of CsGARPs in tea plant but also contribute to broadening our knowledge of the functional diversity of GARP family genes in plants.

AB  - Terpene synthase (TPS) gene family is ubiquitous in land plants and plays an important role in regulating various biological processes in plants, especially in pathogen and herbivore defense mechanisms. Also, little is known about this gene family in wheat. In this research, 153 TaTPS genes were identified and named according to their chromosome location. Phylogenetic analysis of TaTPS proteins and other homologous proteins corresponded to a six-subgroup classification. The analysis of gene structure and motif showed that the TaTPS gene was highly conserved in each subgroup, which suggested that whole genome duplication and segmental duplication events were the main expansion way of the TaTPS gene family. Nineteen tandem duplication gene pairs and 91 homologous genes on different chromosomes were produced by segmental duplication. Expression profiles derived from transcriptome data results indicated that TaTPS genes may contribute to defense responses of wheat to pests such as aphids. The cis-regulatory elements (CREs) of TaTPS were found to be diversified indicating that TaTPS gene may participate in many physiological processes of wheat growth and development. Each TaTPS gene contains at least two or more defense or hormone-related CREs, suggesting an important role in wheat pest defense through hormone pathways. This study can provide valuable clues for elucidating the evolutionary relationship of the TaTPS gene family. Also, it may provide a research basis for functional investigations related to wheat development, particularly to plant-pest interactions and further breeding for new wheat varieties with aphid resistance.

AB  - Simple Summary The estrous cycle, which is divided into follicular and luteal phases based on ovulation, is influenced by reproductive hormones which affect reproduction and cause changes in the reproductive system of the pig. As the main reproductive organ, the ovary is involved in ovulation and changes in the corpus luteum. We aimed to identify dynamic changes in gene expression through differentially expressed gene profiling and to provide a comprehensive understanding of the molecular mechanisms that occur in the pig ovary during the estrous cycle. The transcriptome analysis revealed that the dynamic change in gene expression was more activated in the luteal phase than in the follicular phase. Functional analysis revealed that the metestrus and diestrus periods are important in preparation for pregnancy or the next estrous cycle after ovulation. The porcine estrous cycle is influenced by reproductive hormones, which affect porcine reproduction and result in physiological changes in the reproductive organs. The ovary is involved in ovulation, luteinization, corpus luteum development, and luteolysis. Here, we aimed to provide a comprehensive understanding of the gene expression patterns in porcine ovarian transcriptomes during the estrous cycle through differentially expressed genes profiling and description of molecular mechanisms. The transcriptomes of porcine ovary were obtained during the estrous cycle at three-day intervals from day 0 to day 18 using RNA-seq. At seven time points of the estrous cycle, 4414 DEG were identified; these were classified into three clusters according to their expression patterns. During the late metestrus and diestrus periods, the expression in cluster 1 increased rapidly, and steroid biosynthesis was significant in the pathway. Cluster 2 gene expression patterns represented the cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction in significant pathways. In cluster 3, the hedgehog signaling pathway was selected as the significant pathway. Our study exhibited dynamic gene expression changes with these three different patterns of cluster 1, 2, and 3. The results helped identify the functions and related significant genes especially during the late metestrus and diestrus periods in the estrous cycle.

AB  - The separation between planting and breeding results in an unbalanced distribution of the regional livestock and poultry manure (RLM) industry, and it has raised great concerns. A holistic analysis and problem-solving scheme using 72 townships as the research point was developed in this study. On the basis of a survey from a typical agricultural region in China, the local characteristics of manure discharge, land use, and crop cultivation were analyzed. The assessment of land carrying capacity and environmental risk assessment was conducted by simulating the nitrogen cycle. Afterwards, optimized livestock breeding strategies and inter-regional transfer and flow scheme of manure nutrients were proposed. The spatial distribution of RLM in terms of pig manure equivalent showed an imbalance of high north-south and low middle, and the nitrogen requirement of crops showed a decreasing trend from north to south. In some townships, the environmental risks were higher than level I, which indicated that pollution existed around large construction sites and water areas in the northwest. The land carrying capacity index calculated at 50% nutrient ratio displayed no overloaded risk, whereas 10-20% nutrient ratio exhibited overloaded risk. Assessments showed that the residual RLM and its nitrogen volume were 151,700 and 3574.64 tons per year, respectively. More than 80% of the study area could be used as a nitrogen nutrient sink area, and only six townships are nitrogen nutrient sources. Therefore, optimizing the allocation of manure nutrients is expected to avoid agricultural contamination from livestock manure.

AB  - Background: Sophoridine (SR) has shown the potential to be an antiarrhythmic agent. However, SR's electro-physiological properties and druggability research are relatively inadequate, which limits the development of SR as an antiarrhythmic candidate. Purpose: To facilitate the development process of SR as an antiarrhythmic candidate, we performed integrated studies on the electrophysiological properties of SR in vitro and ex vivo to gain more comprehensive insights into the multi-ion channel blocking effects of SR, which provided the foundation for the further drugability studies in antiarrhythmic and safety studies. Firstly, SR's electrophysiological properties and antiarrhythmic potentials were recorded and assessed at the cell and tissue levels by comprehensively integrating the patch clamp with the Electrical and Optical Mapping systems. Subsequently, the antiarrhythmic effects of SR were validated by aco-nitine and ouabain-induced arrhythmia in vivo. Finally, the safety of SR as an antiarrhythmic candidate com-pound was evaluated based on the guidelines of the Comprehensive in Vitro Proarrhythmia Assay (CiPA). Study design: The antiarrhythmic effect of SR was evaluated at the in vitro, ex vivo, and in vivo levels. Methods: Isolated primary cardiomyocytes and stable cell lines were prepared to explore the electrophysiologic properties of being a multiple ion-channel blocker in vitro by whole-cell patch clamp. Using electrical and optical mapping, the negative chronotropic effect of SR was determined in langendorff-perfused rat or guinea-pig hearts. The antiarrhythmic activity of SR was assessed by the ex vivo tachyarrhythmia models induced by left coronary artery ligation (LCAL) and isoproterenol (ISO). Canonical models of aconitine and ouabain-induced arrhythmia were used to verify the antiarrhythmic effects in vivo. Finally, the pro-arrhythmic risk of SR was detected in Human-Induced Pluripotent Stem Cell-Derived Cardiomyocytes (hSC-CMs) using a Microelectrode array (MEA). Results: Single-cell patch assay validated the multiple ion-channel blockers of SR in transient outward current potassium currents (Ito), l-type calcium currents (ICa-l), and rapid activation delayed rectifier potassium currents (IKr). SR ex vivo depressed heart rates (HR) and ventricular conduction velocity (CV) and prolonged Q-T in-tervals in a concentration-dependent manner. Consistent with the changes in HRs, SR extended the active time of hearts and increased the action potential duration measured at 90% repolarization (APD90). SR could also significantly lengthen the onset time and curtail the duration of spontaneous ventricular tachycardia (VT) in the ex vivo arrhythmic model induced by LCAL. Meanwhile, SR could also significantly upregulate the programmed electrical stimulation (PES) frequency after the ISO challenge in forming electrical alternans and re-entrant excitation. Furthermore, SR exerted antiarrhythmic effects in the tachyarrhythmia models induced by aconi-tine and ouabain in vivo. Notably, the pro-arrhythmic risk of SR was shallow for a moderate inhibition of the human ether -`a-go-go-related gene (hERG) channel. Moreover, SR prolonged field potential duration (FPDc) of hSC-CMs in a concentration-dependent manner without early after depolarization (EAD) and arrhythmia occurrence. Conclusion: Our results indicated that SR manifested as a multiple ion-channel blocker in the electrophysiological properties and exerts antiarrhythmic effects ex vivo and in vivo.
   Meanwhile, due to the low pro-arrhythmic risk in the hERG inhibition assay and the induction of EAD, SR has great potential as a leading candidate in the treatment of ventricular tachyarrhythmia.

AB  - Social stressors negatively impact social function, and this is mediated by the amygdala across species. Social defeat stress is an ethologically relevant social stressor in adult male rats that increases social avoidance, anhedonia, and anxiety-like behaviors. While amygdala manipulations can mitigate the negative effects of social stressors, the impact of social defeat on the basomedial subregion of the amygdala is relatively unclear. Un-derstanding the role of the basomedial amygdala may be especially important, as prior work has demonstrated that it drives physiological responses to stress, including heart-rate related responses to social novelty. In the present study, we quantified the impact of social defeat on social behavior and basomedial amygdala neuronal responses using anesthetized in vivo extracellular electrophysiology in adult male Sprague Dawley rats. Socially defeated rats displayed increased social avoidance behavior towards novel Sprague Dawley conspecifics and reduced time initiating social interactions relative to controls. This effect was most pronounced in rats that displayed defensive, boxing behavior during social defeat sessions. We next found that socially defeated rats showed lower overall basomedial amygdala firing and altered the distribution of neuronal responses relative to the control condition. We separated neurons into low and high Hz firing groups, and neuronal firing was reduced in both low and high Hz groups but in a slightly different manner. This work demonstrates that basomedial amygdala activity is sensitive to social stress, displaying a distinct pattern of social stress-driven activity relative to other amygdala subregions.

AB  - Various root-colonizing bacterial species can promote plant growth and trigger systemic resistance against aboveground leaf pathogens and herbivore insects. To date, the underlying metabolic signatures of these rhizobacteria-induced plant phenotypes are poorly understood. To identify core metabolic pathways that are targeted by growth-promoting rhizobacteria, we used combinations of three plant species and three rhizobacterial species and interrogated plant shoot chemistry by untargeted metabolomics. A substantial part (50%-64%) of the metabolites detected in plant shoot tissue was differentially affected by the rhizobacteria. Among others, the phenylpropanoid pathway was targeted by the rhizobacteria in each of the three plant species. Differential regulation of the various branches of the phenylpropanoid pathways showed an association with either plant growth promotion or growth reduction. Overall, suppression of flavonoid biosynthesis was associated with growth promotion, while growth reduction showed elevated levels of flavonoids. Subsequent assays with 12 Arabidopsis flavonoid biosynthetic mutants revealed that the proanthocyanidin branch plays an essential role in rhizobacteria-mediated growth promotion. Our study also showed that a number of pharmaceutically and nutritionally relevant metabolites in the plant shoot were significantly increased by rhizobacterial treatment, providing new avenues to use rhizobacteria to tilt plant metabolism towards the biosynthesis of valuable natural plant products.

The host seeking and orientation of this butterfly mainly rely on chemosensory-related genes expressed in the antennae, including chemosensory proteins (CSPs). Here, we characterized the putative roles of a female-antenna-biased PxutCSP19 in P. xuthus associated with the perception of host volatiles and the sequestering of insecticides. This study examined the key functions of PxutCSP19 in the interactions of six host-derived odorants and eight insecticides. Notably, an extended N-terminus of PxutCSP19 did not significantly affect the binding specificities of this protein to ligands with high affinities. Our findings provide insight into the binding mechanisms of PxutCSP19 in P. xuthus to host volatiles and insecticides.
   Chemosensory protein (CSP) genes significantly enriched in the female antennae are potential molecular candidates for mediating female oviposition behaviors. In this study, we presented the interaction mechanisms of a female-antenna-biased PxutCSP19 in Papilio xuthus to 47 host volatiles, four biopesticides and 24 synthetic insecticides. Using a bioinformatics-based homology search, 22 genes orthologous to PxutCSP19 were identified from 22 other Papilio butterflies with high sequence identities to each other (73.20 similar to 98.72%). Multiple alignment analyses revealed a particularly extended N-terminus of Papilio CSP19s (an average of 154 residues) compared to insects' typical CSPs (approximately 120 residues). The expression profiles indicated that PxutCSP19 was significantly enriched in the female antennae, with a 31.81-fold difference relative to the male antennae. In ligand-binding assays, PxutCSP19 could strongly bind six host odorants with high affinities, ranging from dissociation constant (K-i) values of 20.44 +/- 0.64 mu M to 22.71 +/- 0.73 mu M. Notably, this protein was tuned to a monoterpenoid alcohol, linalool, which generally existed in the Rutaceae plants and elicited electrophysiological and behavioral activities of the swallowtail butterfly. On the other hand, PxutCSP19 was also capable of binding eight insecticides with stronger binding abilities (K-i < 12 mu M) compared to host odorants. When an extended N-terminal region of PxutCSP19 was truncated into two different proteins, they did not significantly affect the binding of PxutCSP19 to ligands with high affinities, suggesting that this extended N-terminal sequences were not involved in the specificity of ligand recognition. Altogether, our study sheds light on the putative roles of PxutCSP19 enriched in the female antennae of P. xuthus in the perception of host volatiles and the sequestering of insecticides, and it complements the knowledge of butterfly CSPs in olfaction and insecticide resistance.

AB  - As an important class of non-coding RNAs, miRNAs participate in a variety of biological processes, including cell proliferation, differentiation, apoptosis, and hormone secretion. However, little is known about the role of pituitary miRNAs in follicular development in FecB mutant (Fecundity Booroola) sheep. Given the critical role of the pituitary gland in follicular development, this study employed miRNA-seq technology to analyze pituitary transcriptome expression patterns during the follicular phase (F) and the luteal phase (L) of FecB mutant homozygous (BB) and wild-type (WW) of Small Tail Han sheep. This study identified differentially expressed miRNAs (DEMs) related to re-production. Of these, 10, 4, 10, and 4 were differentially expressed (DE) between BB_F and BB_L, WW_F and WW_L, BB_F and WW_F, and BB_L and WW_L, respectively. Bioinformatics analysis revealed the enrichment of the target genes of these DEMs in multiple GO terms linked to animal re-productive processes and KEGG signaling pathways. The follicular phase and luteal phase show significant enrichment in multiple pathways closely related to cell communication and signal transduction, including the MAPK signaling pathway, neuroactive ligand-receptor interaction, and the cAMP signaling pathway. In comparisons of genotypes, the calcium signaling pathway, the cAMP signaling pathway, and the MAPK signaling pathway are enriched. The miRNA-mRNA co-expression network indicates that novel121 and oar-miR-10b may regulate CUL4B and ZFAND5, respectively, playing crucial roles in sheep reproduction. Dual luciferase reporter gene assays hinted at a potential targeting relationship between novel-121 and DNMT3A. These findings elucidate the impact of pituitary miRNAs on follicular development influenced by FecB gene mutation, providing valuable insights into sheep breeding.

AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurogenerative disorder manifested by gradual memory loss and cognitive decline due to profound damage of cholinergic neurons. The neuropathological hallmarks of AD are intracellular deposits of neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) and extracellular aggregates of amyloid beta (A beta). Mounting evidence indicates that intensified neuroinflammatory processes play a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of AD. Chemokines serve as signaling molecules in immune cells but also in nerve cells. Under normal conditions, neuroinflammation plays a neuroprotective role against various harmful factors. However, overexpression of chemokines initiates disruption of the integrity of the blood-brain barrier, facilitating immune cells infiltration into the brain. Then activated adjacent glial cells-astrocytes and microglia, release massive amounts of chemokines. Prolonged inflammation loses its protective role and drives an increase in A beta production and aggregation, impairment of its clearance, or enhancement of tau hyperphosphorylation, contributing to neuronal loss and exacerbation of AD. Moreover, chemokines can be further released in response to growing deposits of toxic forms of A beta. On the other hand, chemokines seem to exert multidimensional effects on brain functioning, including regulation of neurogenesis and synaptic plasticity in regions responsible for memory and cognitive abilities. Therefore, underexpression or complete genetic ablation of some chemokines can worsen the course of AD. This review covers the current state of knowledge on the role of particular chemokines and their receptors in the development and progression of AD. Special emphasis is given to their impact on forming A beta and NFTs in humans and in transgenic murine models of AD.

AB  - One of the main challenges of modern neurobiology is finding approaches to prevent structural abnormalities in the brain, specifically, in the hippocampus affected by epileptic activity. It is well known that epilepsy leads to an increase in proliferation in the hippocampal neurogenic niche, the subgranular layer of the dentate gyrus. In the recent years, there is a prevalent idea that newborn neural cells contribute to epileptogenesis to a larger extent than prevent neurodegenerative disorders associated with increased cell death. We hypothesized that a proapoptotic protein p53 can be one of the possible therapeutic targets in treating epilepsy and its neurodegenerative consequences. In the present work, we used the Krushinsky-Molodkina (KM) inbred rats, which are genetically prone to audiogenic seizures (AGS). Audiogenic kindling, a commonly accepted model of epileptogenesis, induces epileptiform activity in the limbic system and cerebral cortex. In KM rats, it has been shown that 4 AGS lead to an increase in proliferation, aberrant migration of newborn cells to the hilus, and accelerated neural differentiation of these cells. We revealed abnormalities neither in apoptosis nor in autophagy levels at the initial stages of temporal lobe (limbic) epilepsy. Treatment with pifithrin-alpha, a chemical p53 inhibitor, did not change apoptosis and autophagy levels but caused an increase in proliferation and migration of newborn cells to the granule cell layer of the dentate gyrus and to the hilus. However, a week after the last seizure, p53 inactivation entailed a decrease in the number of differentiating cells, as compared to the vehicle control group, despite a significant increase in the number of newborn cells. These data indicate a decrease in the neural differentiation rate of newborn cells, thus allowing pifitrin-alpha to be considered as a potential therapeutic agent to alleviate neurodegenerative disorders in epilepsy.

AB  - Simple Summary This study investigates the impact of subclinical ketosis (SCK) and subclinical acidosis (SCA) on dairy cow rumination, eating, drinking and locomotion behavior. It focuses on cows in their second or subsequent lactation, producing an average of 12,000 kg/year milk in their previous lactation. The cows were categorized into three groups, SCK, SCA, and healthy cows, based on the milk fat-protein ratio, blood beta-hydroxybutyrate and clinical examinations by a veterinarian. The results show significant differences between the cows affected by SCK and the healthy cows. SCK leads to a reduction in the milk yield (11.78%), rumination time (17.47%), and various eating and chewing behaviors. SCA is associated with a substantial decrease in Eating Time 2 (ET2) by 36.84% and Eating Chews 2 (EC2) by 38.10% compared to the healthy cows. These findings highlight the influence of SCA on feeding behaviors and chewing activity, with implications for nutrient intake and cow health. Additionally, SCK affects locomotion parameters, leading to a 27.36% reduction in the overall activity levels, as well as reductions in the Walking Time (WT), Other Activity Time (OAT), and Activity Change (AC). Early detection and effective management of SCK are crucial for maintaining dairy cow health and productivity. In conclusion, this research underscores the need for advanced strategies to prevent and manage subclinical metabolic disorders in the dairy industry. Effective management and early detection methods are essential to mitigate the impact of SCK and SCA on dairy cow health and benefit the dairy farming sector.Abstract This study delves into the effects of subclinical ketosis (SCK) and subclinical acidosis (SCA) on various parameters related to dairy cow rumination, eating, drinking and locomotion behavior. The research hypothesized that these subclinical metabolic disorders could affect behaviors such as rumination, feeding, and locomotion. A total of 320 dairy cows, with a focus on those in their second or subsequent lactation, producing an average of 12,000 kg/year milk in their previous lactation, were examined. These cows were classified into three groups: those with SCK, those with SCA, and healthy cows. The health status of the cows was determined based on the milk fat-protein ratio, blood beta-hydroxybutyrate, and the results of clinical examinations performed by a veterinarian. The data collected during the study included parameters from the RumiWatch sensors. The results revealed significant differences between the cows affected by SCK and the healthy cows, with reductions observed in the rumination time (17.47%) and various eating and chewing behaviors. These changes indicated that SCK had a substantial impact on the cows' behavior. In the context of SCA, the study found significant reductions in Eating Time 2 (ET2) of 36.84% when compared to the healthy cows. Additionally, Eating Chews 2 (EC2) exhibited a significant reduction in the SCA group, with an average of 312.06 units (+/- 17.93), compared to the healthy group's average of 504.20 units (+/- 18.87). These findings emphasize that SCA influences feeding behaviors and chewing activity, which can have implications for nutrient intake and overall cow health. The study also highlights the considerable impact of SCK on locomotion parameters, as the cows with SCK exhibited a 27.36% reduction in the walking time levels. These cows also displayed reductions in the Walking Time (WT), Other Activity Time (OAT), and Activity Change (AC).
   In conclusion, this research underscores the critical need for advanced strategies to prevent and manage subclinical metabolic disorders within the dairy farming industry. The study findings have far-reaching implications for enhancing the well-being and performance of dairy cattle. Effective management practices and detection methods are essential to mitigate the impact of SCK and SCA on dairy cow health and productivity, ultimately benefiting the dairy farming sector.

AB  - In this chapter we review the neuroethological approach correlating behavior and dorsal hippocampal activity recorded in rabbits in laboratory conditions or in a semi-natural enclosure and exposed to intra and interspecific confrontations.
   Behaviors of the same modality, i.e., immobility, and the same motivation, i.e., defense, can be distinguished by a different pattern of hippocampal activity, in terms of the relative ratio of RSA (rhythmic slow activity), and LIA (large amplitude irregular activity), and of RSA frequencies. In addition, the frequency and the duration of RSA episodes represent critical indicators of the amount of awareness during immobility conditions. The neural pattern is also differentially affected by dynamic (a live cat) and static (a stuffed sparrow hawk) stimuli.
   On a neuroethological basis, the hippocampal profile of TI, characterized by the prevalence of LIA, is similar to a sparrow-hawk exposure and to the submissive posture in a conspecific confrontation.

AB  - The biomethanization of lignocellulosic wastes remains an inefficient and complex process due to lignin structures that hinder the hydrolysis step, therefore, some treatments are required. This work describes the addition of an enriched microbial consortium in the biomethanization of rice straw. The experiment was carried out in lab batch reactors following two strategies: (i) pretreatment of rice straw for 48 h using the enriched microbial consortium (dilution 1:100), and (ii) addition of this enriched microbial consortium (dilution 1:100) directly to the anaerobic reactors (bioaugmentation). The kinetic behavior was described using three models. As a result, the microbial consortium molecular characterization showed 58 different bacterial species, predominantly the Lactobacillaceae family (45.7%), and the Clostridiaceae family (19.1%), which were responsible for the positive effect obtained by bioaugmentation with methane yield increases of 16% (290 LNCH4/kgVS) respect to the control. All kinetic models applied fitted the experimental data for cumulative methane production, although the modified Hill model showed the best fit. Bioaugmentation strategies demonstrate their effectiveness in lignocellulosic biodegradation, but the novelty of this research lies in the application of an enriched microbial consortium obtained by the authors through soil isolation techniques, which are very inexpensive and affordable for developing countries.

AB  - Plant essential oils (PEOs) are being studied as a potential alternative to synthetic pesticides in agriculture. PEOs have the potential to control pests both directly, by being toxic or repellent to pests, and indirectly, by activating plant's defense mechanisms. In this study, the effectiveness of five PEOs (Achillea millefolium, Allium sativum, Rosmarinus officinallis, Tagetes minuta, and Thymus zygis) on controlling Tuta absoluta and their impact on the predator Nesidiocoris tenuis was examined. The study revelead that PEOs from A. millefolium and A. sativum-sprayed plants significantly reduced the number of T. absoluta-infested leaflets and did not affect the establishment and reproduction of N. tenuis. Additionally, the spraying of A. millefolium and A. sativum increased the expression of defense genes in the plants, triggering the release of herbivory-induced plant volatiles (HIPVs), such as C6 green leaf volatiles, monoterpenes, and aldehydes, which can be messengers in tritrophic interactions. The results suggest that PEOs from A. millefolium and A. sativum can provide a dual benefit for controlling arthropod pests, as they can directly exhibit toxicity against these pests while also activating plant defense mechanisms.

AB  - Islet transplantation is a useful therapeutic choice for severe diabetes mellitus; however, limited donor supplies have interfered with the use of this treatment. Therefore, the establishment of alternative donor sources and engineered tissue, which enables to produce appropriate insulin for controlling blood glucose, is an important challenge. The adult pig is a promising and feasible donor source and materials for the engineered tissue for the clinical setting among various candidates. The recent progress of gene-editing technology contributes to possible clinical porcine xenotransplantation, including porcine islet xenotransplantation. For the success of future clinical porcine islet xenotransplantation, establishing an islet isolation technique for acquiring adequate, good-quality porcine islets is equally important to use a gene-edited pig. However, the characteristics of porcine islets are different from other species; therefore, establishing a suitable technique for porcine islets is challenging. Impact statementRecent technological progress promotes the feasibility of xenotransplantation, including islet xenotransplantation, for clinical setting. Adult pig is a promising and feasible donor source for islet xenotransplantation and engineered tissue, which enables to control blood glucose in recipients. It is important to acquire porcine islets in good qualities for the promotion, however, establishing a technique for adult porcine islet isolation is important but challenging because of the vulnerability of adult porcine islets. Deciding the proper timing of stopping pancreatic digestion is one of the important factors for obtaining adult porcine islets in good quality.

AB  - Despite advances in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) therapies, resistance remains a major challenge. Ferroptosis, a form of regulated cell death, plays a key role in cancer progression and treatment response. However, the mechanisms governing ferroptosis in NSCLC are not fully understood. The Hippo pathway, which regulates cell proliferation, has recently been implicated in ferroptosis regulation. In this study, we identify Mitotic Spindle Positioning (MISP) as a critical inhibitor of ferroptosis in NSCLC. MISP is upregulated in NSCLC tissues, and its loss sensitizes cells to ferroptosis, reducing cell proliferation in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, MISP binds to the SARAH domain of MST1/2 kinases, inhibiting their homodimerization and autophosphorylation, leading to sustained activation of YAP, a transcriptional coactivator in the Hippo pathway. YAP activation increases SLC7A11 expression, which protects cells from ferroptosis. We also identify a mutant MISP-R390/391A that disrupts MISP-MST1/2 binding, further illustrating the MST1/2-dependent inhibition of Hippo signaling. Notably, MISP is a target of YAP, creating a feedback loop that amplifies YAP signaling. Our findings suggest a novel MISP-YAP axis regulating ferroptosis, positioning MISP as a potential therapeutic target for NSCLC, especially in cases with dysregulated YAP.

AB  - Animal husbandry has been an indispensable part of human subsistence since the origin of agriculture. Along with the prehistoric cultural exchange, several kinds of major domestic animals diffused and gradually got popularized across the Eurasia. The specific geographic setting makes the Hexi Corridor in northwestern China one of the key regions to converge various types of major crops and livestock, and to witness the deep impact of novel species on local subsistence. Archeological evidence reveals an emergence of early oriental-occidental cultural communication at the opening of the local Bronze Age in Hexi Corridor, resulting in a significant shift of local subsistence. However, due to the lack of more detailed archeological evidence, the initial timing and trajectory of the transformation of livestock feeding patterns remain unclear. In this study, we reported systematic stable isotope and precise radiocarbon dating analyses on faunal remains unearthed from Huoshiliang and Ganggangwa, two Early Bronze Age settlements (ca. 4,000-3,700 BP) in middle Hexi Corridor. Our results show distinct diversification in livestock feeding patterns at similar to 3,850 cal BP; in contrast with previous periods, some omnivorous livestock appear to have consumed mainly C-3 foodstuff and some herbivorous livestock primarily consumed C-4 plants. Combined with published stable isotope data and other archeological findings in the neighboring region, a clearer trajectory of the evolution of livestock feeding patterns has been revealed with diversified strategy amid the transformation during the Early Bronze Age in Hexi Corridor. We argued that the alteration of the local livestock feeding pattern reflects the attempt to achieve more efficient economy and sustainable society, in order to withstand the harsh arid environment in Hexi Corridor.

AB  - The effects of plant volatiles on parasitoids are important with regards to the tri-trophic interactions among host plants, insect herbivores, and their natural enemies. However, the effects of plant volatiles on the important parasitoid (Microplitis pallidipes Szepligeti; Hymenoptera: Braconidae) of noctuids have not been determined at the molecular, laboratory, and outdoor scales with complementary approaches. The odorant binding protein 8 of M. pallidipes (MpOBP8) with an open reading frame of 459 bp was cloned and successfully expressed in Escherichia coli (Eubacteriales: Enterobacteriaceae). The purified protein MpOBP8 had a relatively high binding capacity to the plant volatile beta-ionone (Ki value was 28.86 mu M) in the fluorescence competitive binding assay. Meanwhile, Y-tube olfactometer experiments indicated that beta-ionone selectively attracts the parasitic wasp as the ratio of M. pallidipes selecting beta-ionone vs. control was 2:1. Likewise, field screenhouse experiments verified the above results as the ratio of M. pallidipes selecting beta-ionone vs. control was close to 2:1. This study suggested that beta-ionone is a plant volatile that attracts the parasitoid M. pallidipes, and MpOBP8 may play a key role in the discrimination of M. pallidipes in searching for hosts via beta-ionone. In general our results suggest that beta-ionone has the potential to enhance the biocontrol effect of parasitoids on insect herbivores.

AB  - Hippocampus is essential for episodic memory formation, lesion studies demonstrating its role especially in processing spatial and temporal information. Further, adult hippocampal neurogenesis (AHN) in the dentate gyrus (DG) has also been linked to learning. To study hippocampal neuronal activity during events like learning, in vivo calcium imaging has become increasingly popular. It relies on the use of adeno-associated viral (AAV) vectors, which seem to lead to a decrease in AHN when applied on the DG. More notably, imaging requires the implantation of a relatively large lens into the tissue. Here, we examined how injection of an AAV vector and implantation of a 1-mm-diameter lens into the dorsal DG routinely used to image calcium activity impact the behavior of adult male C57BL/6 mice. To this aim, we conducted open-field, object-recognition and objectlocation tasks at baseline, after AAV vector injection, and after lens implantation. Finally, we determined AHN from hippocampal slices using a doublecortin-antibody. According to our results, the operations needed for in vivo imaging of the dorsal DG did not have adverse effects on behavior, although we noticed a decrease in AHN ipsilaterally to the operations. Thus, our results suggest that in vivo imaging can be safely used to, for example, correlate patterns of calcium activity with learned behavior. One should still keep in mind that the defects on the operated side might be functionally compensated by the (hippocampus in the) contralateral hemisphere.

AB  - In the lengthy co-evolution between insects and their animal or plant hosts, insects have evolved a wide range of salivary strategies to help evade host defenses. Although there is a very large literature on saliva of herbivorous and hematophagous insects, little attention has been focused on the saliva of parasitoid wasps. Some parasitoid species are natural enemies that effectively regulate insect population sizes in nature that they are applied for biological control of agricultural pests. Here, we demonstrate the influence of the endoparasitoid, Pteromalus puparum, larval saliva on the cellular and humoral immunity of its host. Larval saliva increases mortality of hemocytes, and inhibits hemocyte spreading, a specific cellular immune action. We report that high saliva concentrations inhibit host cellular encapsulation of foreign invaders. The larval saliva also inhibits melanization in host hemolymph. The saliva inhibits the growth of some bacterial species, Bacillus subtilis, Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa in vitro. This may promote larvae fitness by protecting them from infections. Insight into such functions of parasitic wasp saliva provides a new insight into host-parasitoid relationships and possibly leads to new agricultural pest management technologies.

AB  - Cooperative breeding allows the costs of parental care to be shared, but as groups become larger, such benefits often decline as competition increases and group cohesion breaks down. The counteracting forces of cooperation and competition are predicted to select for an optimal group size, but variation in groups is ubiquitous across cooperative breeding animals. Here, we experimentally test if group sizes vary because of sex differences in the costs and benefits of cooperative breeding in captive ostriches, Struthio camelus, and compare this to the distribution of group sizes in the wild. We established 96 groups with different numbers of males (1 or 3) and females (1, 3, 4, or 6) and manipulated opportunities for cooperation over incubation. There was a clear optimal group size for males (one male with four or more females) that was explained by high costs of competition and negligible benefits of cooperation. Conversely, female reproductive success was maximised across a range of group sizes due to the benefits of cooperation with male and female group members. Reproductive success in intermediate sized groups was low for both males and females due to sexual conflict over the timing of mating and incubation. Our experiments show that sex differences in cooperation and competition can explain group size variation in cooperative breeders.

AB  - Simple Summary The activity of weaned piglets on a commercial farm was measured using passive infrared detectors during six breeding cycles. Highly heterogeneous daily behaviors were observed. A high level of movement was detected immediately after weaning, followed by a sudden drop and a subsequent stabilization throughout the cycle. The real series were best characterized by models with a single peak of activity. Measuring animal activity is useful for monitoring animal welfare in real time. In this regard, passive infrared detectors have been used in recent years to quantify piglet activity because of their robustness and ease of use. This study was conducted on a commercial farm in Northwest Spain during six complete breeding cycles. The hourly average activity of weaned piglets with a body mass of 6-20 kg was recorded and further analyzed by using a multiplicative decomposition of the series followed by a wavelet analysis. Finally, the real series were compared to the theoretical models of activity. Results showed a high level of movement immediately after weaning and a sustained level of activity throughout the cycles. The daily behavior of the piglets followed a clear circadian pattern with several peaks of activity. No differences in behavior were observed between spring-summer cycles and autumn-winter cycles. Single-peak models achieved the best predictive results. In addition, the installed sensors were found to underestimate mild activity.

AB  - With the ever-increasing global population, dietary needs, and nutritional scarcities like micronutrient inadequacies of Vitamin A and C, the present study was planned to improve nutritional, antioxidant, physicochemical stability, and organoleptic characteristics of nutrient-dense carrot powder (CP) supplemented (0.75-2%) goat milk yogurt at 0-14 days of storage. CP and goat milk were found to uphold appreciable magnitudes of ash, dietary fiber, and protein content as 4.89 and 0.92 g/100g, 10.68 and 0.005 g/100g, 6.38 and 3.40 g/100g, respectively. The results for the nutritional and physicochemical characteristics of CP supplemented (0-2%) goat milk yogurt at the 0-14th day of storage elucidated a significant (p < 0.05) increase in total solids (10.9-13.3 %), vitamin A (0.05-1.97 mg/100g), vitamin C (2.3-3.3 mg/100g) and carotenoid contents (0.84-1.3 mg/100g). Likewise, total flavonoids, total phenolics, FRAP and DPPH values of the supplemented yogurt significantly (p < 0.05) enhanced from 117.7 to 120.2 mg CE/g, 8.2-12.1 mg GAE/100g, 39.8-41.3 mu M TE/g and 58.3-59.6 %, respectively. However, a* value (i.e., redness) increased from -0.76 to 12.3 among color parameters. The results for the supplemented yogurt's pH, vitamin A, and carotenoid contents showed slight variation in the storage of 0-14 days. Sensory evaluation of value-added yogurt showed the highest aroma and textural scores for T2 (1.25 %), i.e., 8.2 and 8.1, whereas the data also showed the highest overall acceptability of the finished product for the treatment T2 (1.25 %), i.e., 8.1. Conclusively, CP is a promising carrier of vitamins A and C, which could be used as a viable ingredient of choice to develop novel food products with health-improving properties.

AB  - In this study, we analyzed the meat quality of Qianhua Mutton Merino sheep (QHMM). QHMM and Small-tail Han sheep (STH) were selected as the test animals. After slaughtering, the longissimus dorsi muscles were tested to determine the nutrient composition, content of amino acid, fatty acid, and muscle fiber diameter. According to the nutrient test result, the protein content of QHMM was higher than that of STH. However, the fat content was significantly lower (P < 0.05) than STH. Additionally, total amino acid content, total essential amino acid content, total half-essential amino acid content, total non-essential amino acid content, and flavor amino acid content of QHMM were significantly higher (P < 0.05) than those of STH. Moreover, the contents of C22:1 n9, C18:2 n6, C18:3 n6, C22:6 n6, and C10:0 of the muscle in QHMM were significantly higher (P < 0.05) than those of STH. Furthermore, the essential amino acid score, the total unsaturated-to-saturated fatty acid ratio, and the polyunsaturated-to-saturated fatty acid ratio of QHMM were greater than those of STH. Additionally, the muscle fiber diameter of QHMM was considerably lower (P < 0.01) than that of STH. In conclusion, the meat quality of QHMM was better than that of STH.

AB  - Venta Micena (Orce, Guadix-Baza Basin, Spain) is an Early Pleistocene locality renowned for the richness and quality of its palaeontological record. VM is spread over an area of 2.5 km(2), where several exposed fossil outcrops are visible amidst its gorges and ravines. The best known of these sites, VM3, has been interpreted as a hyaena den. In addition, a new site, named VM4, has recently been the focus of fieldwork and taphonomic studies. The publication by Luzon et al. (2021) pointed out that VM4 presents a more complex history than VM3. First, two different sub-levels were identified: VM4-I and VM4-II. Secondly, the preliminary taphonomic analysis showed conspicuous differences with regard to VM3. Nevertheless, such interpretation has been challenged by Palmqvist et al. (2022) who proposed that VM3 and VM4 are both the result of a single depositional process, entailing the selective transport of skeletal parts by the giant extinct hyaena Pachycrocuta brevirostris back to its den. Using well-preserved faunal elements whose depositional context and provenance are reliable, in this paper we show that: 1) there are two clearly defined sub-levels in VM4 with some shared taphonomic characteristics as well as some notable differences; 2) VM3 and VM4 exhibit enough divergence to support differences in site formation processes; 3) The interpretation of both VM4-I and VM4-II is more consistent with their characterisation as open-air sites in which multiple agents and depositional processes contributed to its formation, rather than with hyaena dens. Nevertheless, excavations are still in progress at VM4 and therefore any results and interpretations ought to be considered as provisional. (c) 2023 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - IntroductionThe Camellia oleifera (C. oleifera) cultivars 'Huashuo' (HS) and 'Huaxin' (HX) are new high-yielding and economically valuable cultivars that frequently encounter prolonged cold weather during the flowering period, resulting in decreased yields and quality. The flower buds of HS sometimes fail to open or open incompletely under cold stress, whereas the flower buds of HX exhibit delayed opening but the flowers and fruits rarely drop. MethodsIn this study, flower buds at the same development stage of two C. oleifera cultivars were used as test materials for a combination of physiological, transcriptomic and metabolomic analyses, to unravel the different cold regulatory mechanisms between two cultivars of C. oleifera. Results and discussionKey differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and differentially expressed metabolites (DEMs) involved in sugar metabolism, phenylpropanoid biosynthesis, and hormone signal transduction were significantly higher in HX than in HS, which is consistent with phenotypic observations from a previous study. The results indicate that the flower buds of HX are less affected by long-term cold stress than those of HS, and that cold resistance in C. oleifera cultivars varies among tissues or organs.This study will provide a basis for molecular markers and molecular breeding of C. oleifera.

AB  - Observational surface data are utilized to reconstruct the subsurface density and geostrophic velocity fields via the "interior + surface quasigeostrophic" (isQG) method in a subdomain of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current (ACC). The input variables include the satellite-derived sea surface height (SSH), satellite-derived sea surface temperature (SST), satellite-derived or Argo-based sea surface salinity (SSS), and a monthly estimate of the stratification. The density reconstruction is assessed against a newly released high-resolution in situ dataset that is collected by a southern elephant seal. The results show that the observed mesoscale structures are reasonably reconstructed. In the Argo-SSS-based experiment, pattern correlations between the reconstructed and observed density mostly exceed 0.8 in the upper 300 m. Uncertainties in the SSS products notably influence the isQG performance, and the Argo-SSS-based experiment yields better density reconstruction than the satellite-SSS-based one. Through the two-dimensional (2D) omega equation, we further employ the isQG reconstructions to diagnose the upper-ocean vertical velocities (denoted w(isQG2D)), which are then compared against the seal-data-based 2D diagnosis of w(seal). Notable discrepancies are found between w(isQG2D) and w(seal), primarily because the density reconstruction does not capture the seal-observed smaller-scale signals. Within several subtransects, the Argo-SSS-based w(isQG2D) reasonably reproduce the spatial structures of w(seal), but present smaller magnitude. We also apply the isQG reconstructions to the 3D omega equation, and the 3D diagnosis of w(isQG3D) is very different from w(isQG2D), indicating the limitations of the 2D diagnostic equation. With reduced uncertainties in satellite-derived products in the future, we expect the isQG framework to achieve better subsurface estimations.

AB  - Lignosus rhinocerus is a medicinal mushroom that is well recognized for its diverse pharmacological properties. We evaluated the protective effects of L. rhinocerus ethanol fraction (LREF) in Friedreich's ataxia (FRDA) by using fibroblasts treated with L-buthionine sulfoximine (L-BSO) to induce oxidative damage to mimic the pathogenesis of the disease. Liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) of LREF revealed a total of eight compounds. The compound-target gene-disease network analysis also identified that phthalic acid, citric acid, oleic acid, methyl palmitate and tryptophan, were associated with gene subunits related to potassium, sodium, and calcium ion channels. In FRDA, dysregulation of ion channels leads to mitochondrial iron accumulation and decreased activity of iron-sulfur cluster enzymes. The FRDA fibroblasts were administered LREF for 4 h, followed by 12mM L-BSO for 24 h to induce oxidative damage. Fibroblasts treated with 2.50 mu M idebenone were used as positive control. Administration of LREF (15.63 to 62.50 mu g/mL) enhanced cell viability, superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity, and mitochondrial function and biogenesis; attenuated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release, excessive intracellular ROS generation and apoptosis; and modulated the expression of key metabolic genes, namely peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma, coactivator 1 alpha (PPARGC1A), nuclear respiratory factor 1 (NRF1), and transcription factor A, mitochondrial (TFAM). The protective effects of LREF were associated with its antioxidant properties and compounds that regulate mitochondrial function and biogenesis. Our study showed that LREF can mitigate oxidative damage induced by L-BSO in a cellular model of FRDA, which could be developed into mitochondria-targeted antioxidants.

AB  - Simple Summary Rotavirus is an increasingly widespread zoonotic agent, the segmented feature of rotavirus genome is responsible for the emergence of new diverse viruses and inter-species transmission. Therefore, monitoring the genetic diversity of rotavirus is helpful to understand its evolution. In this study, a novel potential zoonotic G4P[6] rotavirus with a 344-nt duplication sequence in the non-encoding gene of NSP5 was for the first time detected in a diarrhoea pig sample collected from Guangdong Province, China. Further genome analyses revealed genome reassortment between human-origin and porcine-origin rotavirus.Abstract Rotavirus is a major causative agent of diarrhoea in children, infants, and young animals around the world. The associated zoonotic risk necessitates the serious consideration of the complete genetic information of rotavirus. A segmented genome makes rotavirus prone to rearrangement and the formation of a new viral strain. Monitoring the molecular epidemiology of rotavirus is essential for its prevention and control. The quantitative RT-PCR targeting the NSP5 gene was used to detect rotavirus group A (RVA) in pig faecal samples, and two pairs of universal primers and protocols were used for amplifying the G and P genotype. The genotyping and phylogenetic analysis of 11 genes were performed by RT-PCR and a basic bioinformatics method. A unique G4P[6] rotavirus strain, designated S2CF (RVA/Pig-tc/CHN/S2CF/2023/G4P[6]), was identified in one faecal sample from a piglet with severe diarrhoea in Guangdong, China. Whole genome sequencing and analysis suggested that the 11 segments of the S2CF strain showed a unique Wa-like genotype constellation and a typical porcine RVA genomic configuration of G4-P[6]-I1-R1-C1-M1-A8-N1-T1-E1-H1. Notably, 4 of the 11 gene segments (VP4, VP6, VP2, and NSP5) clustered consistently with human-like RVAs, suggesting independent human-to-porcine interspecies transmission. Moreover, a unique 344-nt duplicated sequence was identified for the first time in the untranslated region of NSP5. This study further reveals the genetic diversity and potential inter-species transmission of porcine rotavirus.

AB  - Simple Summary Prolonged feeding of excessive fermentable concentrates reduces rumen acidity and causes gram-negative bacteria to lyse and release lipopolysaccharides, triggering an inflammatory response in the body. As an important immune and metabolic organ in animals, the liver is susceptible to damage. Although the Chinese herb Sophora alopecuroides has antitumor, anti-inflammatory, antioxidant and other pharmacological effects, the mechanism of action of Sophora alopecuroides on the anti-inflammatory and antioxidant functions of the liver in lambs is still unclear. In this study, via liver function indices, liver inflammatory factor levels, antioxidant indices and transcriptome analysis, we demonstrated that Sophora alopecuroides could improve the immune and antioxidant functions of the liver in lambs under high-concentrate conditions and regulate the mechanism of liver injury in sheep through the expression of the relevant genes involved in the ECM-receptor interactions and the focal adhesion pathway. Elucidating the molecular mechanism of inflammatory responses is crucial for understanding liver dysfunction induced by high-concentrate diets. Abstract The purpose of this study was to determine the effects of Sophora alopecuroides (SA) on liver function, liver inflammatory factor levels, antioxidant indexes and transcriptome in sheep. Twenty-four 3-month-old healthy Dumont hybrid lambs weighing 25.73 +/- 2.17 kg were randomly divided into three groups: C1 (the control group), fed a concentrate-to-forage ratio of 50:50; H2 (the high-concentration group), fed a concentrate-to-forage ratio of 70:30; and S3 (the SA group), fed a concentrate-to-forage ratio of 70:30 + 0.1% SA. The results showed that the rumen pH values of the C1 and S3 groups were significant or significantly higher than that of the H2 group (p < 0.05 or p < 0.01). The serum ALT, AST and LDH activities and the LPS and LBP concentrations in the sheep serum and liver in the H2 group were significantly or extremely significantly higher than those in the C1 and S3 groups (p < 0.01), and the IL-10 content and SOD, GPX-PX and T-AOC activities showed the opposite trend (p < 0.05 or p < 0.01). KEGG enrichment analysis showed that the differentially expressed genes were significantly enriched in the ECM-receptor interaction and focal adhesion pathways, which are closely related to immune and antioxidant functions (p-adjust < 0.1). In summary, SA could improve the immune and antioxidant functions of lamb livers under high-concentrate conditions and regulate the mechanism of damage on sheep livers, which is caused by high-concentrate diets and through the expression of related genes in the ECM/FAs pathway.

AB  - Myxobolus nagaraensis is a myxozoan parasite first reported in freshwater gobies (Rhinogobius spp.) from the Nagara River, Gifu Prefecture, Japan. Myxospores of M. nagaraensis form plasmodia in the visceral cavities of gobies, commonly presenting as distended abdomens. Although Rhinogobius is a common fish genus in Japan, details of M. nagaraensis, including genetic information, remain unknown. We compared the nucleotide sequences of the ribosomal RNA gene (rDNA) of M. nagaraensis from three different host species (R. fluviatilis, R. nagoyae, and R. similis) caught in three different rivers in Japan (Sakai, Sagami, and Kaname). The ITS region (ITS-1, 5.8S rDNA, and ITS-2) and large subunit (LSU) rDNA exhibited 49 and 55 variable sites, respectively. The highest nucleotide diversity was observed in the ITS region (0.00962), whereas that of the LSU rDNA was 0.00187. Differences in host species, rather than rivers, were a significant factor for genetic variation in both the ITS region (62.58%; P < 0.001) and LSU rDNA (55.22%; P < 0.01). Significant genetic variation was observed in M. nagaraensis from R. similis compared to R. fluviatilis (P < 0.001) or R. nagoyae (P < 0.001) from the same river. Such details are valuable for understanding parasite dispersal and its ecological impact on Rhinogobius hosts.

AB  - Hippophae rhamnoides widely known as sea buckthorn berries (SB) are rich in vitamins and phytonutrients. The subspecies ssp. sinensis and ssp. mongolica are highly valued for their medicinal properties and vitamin contents, hence domesticated widely across Eurasia and Southeast Asia. Due to the frequent usage of these two subspecies, accurate identification is required to prevent economically motivated adulteration. In this study, we report the single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) based molecular markers to easily distinguish these two subspecies at 45S nrDNA region. From the determined 45S rDNA region, we designed two primers (5' sinensis and 5' mongolica) and developed a multiplex PCR profile. The developed primers effectively distinguished the sea buckthorn subspecies in commercial products as well. Along with the development of subspecies specific primers, we have profiled vitamin contents from H. rhamnoides ssp. sinensis and ssp. mongolica and found ascorbic acid and riboflavin contents were high in both ssp. sinensis and spp. mongolica, yet the content of folic acid was high only in ssp. mongolica. Thus, we provide species specific primers and vitamin profile as an effective authentication of H. rhamnoides.

AB  - Simple Summary
   Lack of selenium (Se) is a global problem that leads to increased exposure of animals to various diseases, as well as a reduction in productive and reproductive performance. Mineral supplementation can improve the immune system and could therefore be of assistance for lambs. We studied the effects of injectable supplementation with selenium. Supplementation of the Se lead to improved immune status, blood parameters, body weights, and average daily gain of lambs.
   The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of a long-acting selenium (Se) preparation administered to sheep. The experiment was conducted on 30 dams and 36 lambs divided into three equal groups of 10 dams and 12 lambs each: Control-C, and two experimental groups-E (Se administered to pregnant ewes) and EI (Se administered directly to lambs after the colostral period). The Se preparation (Barium Selenate Injection, BVP Animal Care, 50 mg/mL) was administered by injection at 1 mL/50 kg (1 mg Se/kg) body weight (BW) to group E ewes in the third month of pregnancy (between 70 and 90 days) and to group EI lambs between 4 and 7 days of age. The following parameters were determined: Se concentration in the blood of ewes, milk yield, milk composition, Se concentration in milk; hematological, biochemical, and immunological parameters and Se concentration in the blood of lambs; growth rate and in vivo measurements of lean meat and fat content in lambs. Barium selenate significantly improved the Se status of dams and lambs, regardless of whether it was administered to pregnant ewes or directly to lambs in the first week of their life. The milk of ewes receiving the Se preparation was characterized by higher concentrations of fat and dry matter. The Se preparation induced significant changes in immunological parameters, thus enhancing defense mechanisms in lambs. The Se preparation exerted more stimulatory effects on humoral and cellular immune responses when administered directly to lambs after the colostral period (group EI) than to pregnant ewes (group E). The results of this study indicate that the long-acting Se preparation delivers benefits to sheep by boosting their immunity and, therefore, improving performance.

AB  - For frugivorous fruit flies, the decision whether to accept or reject a host fruit for oviposition is influenced by a variety of fruit quality factors. Additionally, ovipositing flies may be influenced by the presence of eggs or larvae already within the host fruit. Species of the genus Bactrocera have been shown to avoid ovipositing into larval-infested fruits. However, the observed oviposition aversion in Bactrocera is variable, with some studies showing that deterrence to infested fruits may not always occur, but what may influence such variation is unknown. Using the polyphagous fruit fly Bactrocera tryoni (Froggatt), we tested if the quality of host fruit for offspring survival was a factor in influencing a female fly's decision whether to oviposit or not into larval-infested fruits. In both small cages and field cages, ovipositing B. tryoni did not discriminate between infested and non-infested high-quality fruits. However, when given a choice between poor-quality infested and non-infested fruits, significantly more flies selected and oviposited in non-infested fruits. For example, B. tryoni did not discriminate between infested and non-infested guava (a fruit in which there is high offspring survival), but more flies selected and oviposited on non-infested than on infested green apples (a fruit in which there is poor offspring survival). Small cage experiments also showed that prior oviposition experience on a larval-infested host negated the previously observed aversive response for that particular infested host fruit. The results are discussed in the light of a long recognised, but often ignored fact that herbivore host choice is about the sum of both the positive and negative cues received from the host.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of freeze-thawing (F/T) and freeze-drying (F/D) on the quality of epididymal goat sperm. Sperm from each region of the epididymis (caput, corpus and cauda) were collected and evaluated for the expression of phospholipase C zeta (PLC-), protamine 1 (PRM1), transition protein 1 (TNP1) and 2 (TNP2). The effects of F/T and F/D on sperm quality in terms of PLC-expression, chromatin stability (Chromomycin A3; CMA3) and DNA integrity were examined. The fertilising ability after intra-cytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) was also tested. Fresh sperm existed PLC-, PRM1, TNP1 and TNP2, irrespective of the regions of the epididymis. However, different patterns of PLC-expression were found. Although PRM1, TNP1, TNP2 were still expressed after F/T or F/D, only F/T could preserve the presence of PLC-. For fresh sperm, caput epididymal sperm had the lowest evidence of chromatin stability when compared to sperm harvested from other regions of the epididymis. The F/T and F/D further increased the numbers of CMA3-positive sperm (P < 0.001). In all cases, no CMA3 staining was observed in caudal epididymal sperm. The caudal epididymal sperm had significantly greater proportions of sperm with intact DNA compared with caput and corpus epididymal sperm, especially when F/T and F/D were performed. The fertilisation rates of F/D sperm tended to decrease when compared with F/T sperm (4.2 +/- 3.2 vs. 13.6 +/- 9.0, P 1/4 0.08). It is concluded that the sperm recovered from the caudal epididymis is suitable for freezing and lyophilisation. However, poor fertilisation rates of F/D sperm were coincidently observed, with a deficit demonstration of PLC-.(c) 2022 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Herbivorous insects can identify their host plants by sensing plant secondary metabolites as chemical cues. We previously reported the two -factor host acceptance system of the silkworm Bombyx mori larvae. The chemosensory neurons in the maxillary palp (MP) of the larvae detect mulberry secondary metabolites, chlorogenic acid (CGA), and isoquercetin (ISQ), with ultrahigh sensitivity, for host plant recognition and feeding initiation. Nevertheless, the molecular basis for the ultrasensitive sensing of these compounds remains unknown. In this study, we demonstrated that two gustatory receptors (Grs), BmGr6 and BmGr9, are responsible for sensing the mulberry compounds with attomolar sensitivity for host plant recognition by silkworm larvae. Calcium imaging assay using cultured cells expressing the silkworm putative sugar receptors (BmGr4-10) revealed that BmGr6 and BmGr9 serve as receptors for CGA and ISQ with attomolar sensitivity in human embryonic kidney 293T cells. CRISPR/Cas9-mediated knockout (KO) of BmGr6 and BmGr9 resulted in a low probability of making a test bite of the mulberry leaves, suggesting that they lost the ability to recognize host leaves. Electrophysiological recordings showed that the loss of host recognition ability in the Gr-KO strains was due to a drastic decrease in MP sensitivity toward ISQ in BmGr6-KO larvae and toward CGA and ISQ in BmGr9-KO larvae. Our findings have revealed that the two Grs, previously considered to be sugar receptors, are molecules responsible for detecting plant phenolics in host plant recognition.

AB  - Resistance (R) genes usually compete in a coevolutionary arms race with reciprocal effectors to confer strain-specific resistance to pathogens or herbivorous insects. Here, we investigate the specificity of SLI1, a recently identified R gene in Arabidopsis that encodes a small heat shock-like protein involved in resistance to Myzus persicae aphids. In a panel with several aphid and whitefly species, SLI1 compromised reproductive rates of three species: the tobacco aphid M. persicae nicotianae, the cabbage aphid Brevicoryne brassicae and the cabbage whitefly Aleyrodes proletella. Electrical penetration graph recording of aphid behaviour, revealed shorter salivations and a 3-to-5-fold increase in phloem feeding on sli1 loss-of-function plants. The mustard aphid Lipaphis erysimi and Bemisia tabaci whitefly were not affected by SLI1. Unlike the other two aphid species, L. erysimi exhibited repetitive salivations preceding successful phloem feeding, indicating a role of salivary effectors in overcoming SLI1-mediated resistance. Microscopic characterization showed that SLI1 proteins localize in the sieve tubes of virtually all above- and below-ground tissues and co-localize with the aphid stylet tip after penetration of the sieve element plasma membrane. These observations reveal an unconventional R gene that escapes the paradigm of strain specificity and confers broad-spectrum quantitative resistance to phloem-feeding insects.

AB  - Simple Summary Odorant receptors (ORs) are at the core of the high-efficiency and sensitive olfactory system in insects. The expression and specific function of ORs largely contribute to the habits and speciation of one species. Although being predominantly expressed in the antennae, ORs in non-olfactory organs are suggested to have particular roles in promoting the reproduction or host fitness of insects. Our previous work has identified four ORs in the mouthpart organs of Helicoverpa armigera. Here, we amplified the full-length sequences of HarmORs from the proboscis. Further functional characterization suggested that HarmOR30 narrowly tuned to indole, the vital nitrogen-containing compounds that mediate tritrophic interactions. Our study deepens the insight into the olfactory perception of H. armigera, and explored a candidate functional receptor target for studying the interaction between insects and their plant hosts. Helicoverpa armigera is a serious agricultural pest with polyphagous diets, widespread distribution, and causing severe damage. Among sixty-five candidate ORs in H. armigera, the co-receptor HarmOrco and three specific ORs with partial sequences were identified to be expressed in the proboscis by our previous work, whereas their exact function is not known yet. In this study, we first confirmed the expression of these ORs in the proboscis by full-length cloning, which obtained the complete coding region of HarmOrco, OR24, and OR30. We then performed functional identification of HarmOR24 and OR30 by co-expressing them respectively with HarmOrco in Xenopus oocytes eukaryotic expression system combined with two-electrode voltage-clamp physiology. By testing the response of HarmOR24/OR30-expressing oocytes against eighty structural-divergent compounds, respectively, HarmOR30 was characterized to narrowly tune to indole and showed a specific tuning spectrum compared to its ortholog in Spodoptera littoralis. As indole is a distinctive herbivore-induced plant volatile and floral scent component, HarmOR30 might play roles in foraging and mediating the interactions between H. armigera with its surrounding environment.

AB  - In Pacific halibut (Hippoglossus stenolepis) longline fisheries in the eastern North Pacific Ocean bycatch of yelloweye rockfish (Sebastes ruberrimus) is a concern as their stock status along the U.S. West Coast is "rebuilding" from being "overfished", the southeast Alaska stock has shown a similar to 60% decline since at least 1994 and through 2015 where it stabilized, and the Canadian stock has been recently declared "threatened". In this study, we evaluated how size 16/0 and 18/0 circle hooks affect the catch efficiency of Pacific halibut and yelloweye rockfish. Further, we examined the catch efficiency of these hooks modified with a 3.1 mm stainless-steel wire appendage extending 7.6 cm from their shank at either a 45 degrees or 90 degrees angle. We estimated hooking location probabilities for Pacific halibut and yelloweye rockfish for the hooks tested, and tested for a difference in the time of capture between Pacific halibut and yelloweye rockfish. Results showed that hook size did not significantly affect the catch efficiency of Pacific halibut or yelloweye rockfish. However, hooks with a 45 degrees appendage angle caught significantly fewer yelloweye rockfish than hooks without an appendage, irrespective of hook size. Appendage angle did not affect the catch efficiency of Pacific halibut. For both Pacific halibut and yelloweye rockfish, the most frequent hooking location was hook through cheek, both with and without an appendage. Time of capture of Pacific halibut and yelloweye rockfish did not differ over the duration of a set; however, the majority (75%) of individuals were caught within 2.5 h of gear deployment. Results from our study suggest that hook appendages could have potential use in reducing catch rates on yelloweye rockfish in Pacific halibut longline fisheries, which could lead to increased fishing opportunities, more efficient Pacific halibut fisheries and less effect of fluctuations in the more productive Pacific halibut stock on fisheries that may be constrained by yelloweye rockfish.

AB  - Simple Summary Animal welfare policy regarding husbandry practices in sheep in Australia differs between states and territories. This dis-uniformity of the legislature can be confusing and limit the application of the law, particularly with growing pressure from the local and global community to improve animal welfare. The influence of scientific evidence contributing to the development of these policies is unclear. This article explores the Australian animal welfare legislature and the scientific evidence informing husbandry practices commonly performed at lamb marking. The development and substance of animal welfare policy is subject to a range of social, cultural, economic, and scientific influences that commonly vary within and between countries. Discrepancies in policy can create confusion and mistrust among stakeholders and consumers and limit the ability to create a uniform minimum level of requirements to safeguard animal welfare, as well as create a level 'playing field' for farmers when trading with other jurisdictions. The livestock sector is receiving growing scrutiny globally for real and perceived violations of animal welfare, for example, the practice of mulesing in Australia. This article explores animal welfare legislation within Australia and how it reflects the scientific evidence surrounding routine husbandry practices in sheep, including tail docking, castration, and mulesing. While there is some variation between state and territory legislation, the most notable concern is the lack of enforceable recommendations surrounding the evidence-based use of analgesia and anaesthesia for painful husbandry procedures. The age at which these procedures are recommended to be performed is relatively consistent across Australian jurisdictions, but there is a marked difference compared to international legislation. The global context of animal welfare legislation, public perception, and producer perception of these procedures are also discussed, highlighting the difficulty of creating robust animal welfare legislation that promotes a good standard of welfare that is respected worldwide whilst being practical in an Australian setting given our unique geography and climatic conditions.

AB  - To clone the polyphenol oxidase gene (CsPPO) from Yunwu Tribute Tea (Camellia sinensis [L.] Kuntze var. niaowangensis Q.H. Chen) and conduct bioinformatics analysis, expression vector construction, and analysis of its physiological activity in transgenic plants. The CsPPO was cloned from Yunwu Tribute Tea, and bioinformatics and evolutionary analysis was conducted. Transgenic plants overexpressing CsPPO were created by Agrobacterium tumefaciens infection and expression and changes in physiological indices were analyzed under low-temperature stress to determine the role of the gene in cold tolerance in tea trees. The cloned CsPPO had a total length of 1740 bp, encoding 580 amino acids, and showed 96.72% homology with the PPO gene of C. sinensis. Analysis of the physiological features of cold tolerance showed that the transgenic tobacco were more tolerant to cold stress than wild-type tobacco, and the relative conductivity and malondialdehyde content of transgenic tobacco were significantly lower than in the wild-type, while the PPO activity was significantly higher. Increased expression of the CsPPO in tobacco significantly reduced oxidative damage to the cell membrane and markedly improved cold tolerance in the plants. These findings verify the role of CsPPO in cold tolerance in Yunwu Tribute tea plants.

AB  - This study examined the effect of dietary Vachellia tortilis leaf meal and sunflower oil inclusion in supplementary diets on in vitro short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) and gas production and the in vivo growth performance of lambs. Four concentrate dietary treatments comprising control (CL), Vachellia tortilis leaf meal (VT), sunflower oil (SFO), and Vachellia tortilis leaf meal sunflower oil (VSFO) were formulated. Eight Merino lambs were blocked into two live weight blocks where animals within each block were randomly assigned to dietary treatments, making two animals per treatment. Lambs were offered a concentrate diet of 480 g/day per head, with urea-treated hay fed as a basal diet. Dietary effects were evaluated for in vitro short-chain fatty acid and gas production and 28-day growth performance of lambs over three study periods. The inclusion of VT and SFO showed no statistically significant effect on total SCFAs, acetate to propionate (A:P) ratio, methane (CH4), and carbon dioxide (CO2) production (p > 0.05), which might be attributable to low experimental units. The hourly A:P ratio and CH4 yield were the highest (p < 0.05) at 16 h of incubation. The inclusion of VT showed no statistically significant effect on growth performance and gas production due to the small sample size. Therefore, VT can be explored as a supplementary protein source in lamb diets given the impression of not showing any causative adverse effects on growth performance and in vitro gas production, although further research with larger sample sizes is needed to confirm these findings.

AB  - Porcine pleuropneumonia, caused by Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae, is one of the main causes of massive losses in the pig industry, with a high economic impact. This study aimed to identify A. pleuropneumoniae serotypes isolated from pneumonic lesions in dead pigs, naturally infected, in some Piedmontese farms and to describe the macroscopic and microscopic lesions. The identification of circulating serotypes in swine farming is crucial to adopting optimal strategies to control the diseases, such as vaccination plans and biosecurity measures. Porcine pleuropneumonia (PPP) is one of the main causes leading to massive losses in the pig industry, with high economic impacts. Among different etiological agents, Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae (APP) is responsible for severe fibrinous-necrotizing pleuropneumonia. A total of 19 different APP serotypes are currently recognized. This study aimed to identify APP serotypes isolated from pneumonic lesions in naturally infected and dead pigs in the Piedmont Region and to describe lesions. A total of 107 dead pigs with a suspected PPP diagnosis were included in this study. Lungs were evaluated using gross-pathology scoring systems, histopathology, and APP isolation and serotypes identification by multiplex PCR were conducted. Gross lung lesions were mainly represented by fibrinous pneumonia and pleuropneumonia. APP was isolated in 20/107 (18.7%) samples. PCR indicated APP DNA presence in 53/107 (49.5%) of lung samples. The most observed serotypes were serotype 2 in 24/53 (45.3%) and serotype 6 in 13/53 (24.5%) samples. Moreover, multiplex PCR results suggested a coinfection of different serotypes in five samples. This study emphasizes the importance of an integrated approach, utilizing various techniques, such as gross- and histopathology, and bacteriological culture and PCR, to enhance the diagnosis of APP infections.

AB  - The exposure of hepatocytes to high concentrations of glucose results in a glucotoxic environment and ensu-ing hepatocellular injury, often due to oxidative stress. The popularly consumed herbal tea, Rooibos (Aspala-thus linearis), demonstrates pleiotropic pharmacological and antioxidant activities. Our study investigated the molecular events regulating the antioxidant effects of a Rooibos ethanolic extract (REE) in a glucotoxic HepG2 liver cell model. It is hypothesized that REE enhances antioxidant enzyme profiles of HepG2 cells exposed to high glucose to attenuate glucotoxic damage. Glucotoxicity was induced by treating the cells with 25 mM glucose. For this study, colorimetric, luminometric and western blot analyses were used to determine the potential of the REE to reduce biomarkers associated with oxidative damage and its potential to enhance the intracellular antioxidant defense system. The REE was found to be hepatoprotective as evi-denced by reduced levels of oxidative damage biomarkers (MDA and protein carbonylation) and enhanced antioxidant capacity under glucotoxic conditions as evidenced by elevated GSH (reduced form). We also observed decreased intracellular hydrogen peroxide levels and caspase activity in the REE treated cells and further showed that the REE enhanced SOD2, CAT, and GPx1 protein expression. These effects were depen-dent on the transcriptional activity of NRF2. Collectively, our results show that the REE enhances the cellular antioxidant defense capacity and may provide a relevant supportive therapeutic option for treating diabetic complications associated with oxidative stress.(c) 2022 SAAB.

AB  - Castration is commonly used to control the behavior of companion animals and livestock, yet there have been few longitudinal studies of its effects. Despite the ubiquity of this surgery in ridden horses, the effects of castration (termed gelding in horses) have rarely been examined in a reproductive population. We tested effects of gelding on maintenance and social behaviors of individuals pre-and post-gelding, and in comparison to intact control adult males (2 to >16 years old) in both harem and bachelor status, we then tested how gelding affected association with mares (i.e., maintenance of a harem group) compared to intact controls, and any effects on bachelor social associations. We further explored any effects on foaling rate to assess potential impacts on population growth rate. We conducted this study over four years (2017-2020) at two Herd Management Areas (HMAs) in western Utah, USA: Conger and Frisco. We conducted demographic observations year round at both HMAs to record survival and foaling rate. We additionally recorded behavioral observations at Conger HMA. In December 2017, 27 adult males from Conger (42% of adult males in the population) were gelded and returned to the range with their social groups. Due to pre-treatment observations we were able to compare stallions of known status pre-and post-treatment (harem or bachelor), as well as gelded and intact males. We had no morbidity or mortality related to the gelding surgery and all males maintained good body condition throughout the study. There was no effect of gelding on maintenance behaviors (feeding, moving, and standing). There was no effect of gelding on frequency of agonistic behavior, and a non-significant tendency for less reproductive behavior in geldings; geldings showed more affiliative and less marking behavior. Age class and/or social status were better predictors of behavior than gelding. Over time fewer geldings maintained a harem, and their harem size declined during the study. Horses that were bachelors when gelded tended to remain as bachelors, whereas intact bachelors of the same cohort mostly attained a harem. Foaling rate at Conger was reduced in the year following treatment, but then returned to pre-treatment levels. From a welfare perspective gelding is safe to use in feral horses and has minimal effects on horse behavior and social interactions in a reproductive herd. Effectiveness for population growth control would likely require a larger proportion of males in the population to be castrated for longer-term effects on foaling rate.

AB  - Pig genome editing using the oviductal nucleic acid delivery (GONAD) method with electroporation would allow the efficient obtention of genetically modified pigs. However, oocytes and zygotes at various stages after ovulation must be targeted, and cumulus cell attachment and mosaic mutations are major obstacles. Therefore, we investigated whether two parameters (electroporation timing and the cumulus cell attachment) influence the effectiveness of multiplex genome editing by electroporation in porcine oocytes or zygotes. Three gRNAs targeting either GGTA1, CMAH or B4GALNT2 were introduced individually into oocytes and zygotes with and without cumulus cells at three different time points, 0 h before in vitro fertilisation (IVF) and 5 h and 10 h after IVF initiation. The introduction of gRNAs into oocytes and zygotes did not significantly affect the rates of blastocyst formation and total mutation of the resulting blastocysts irrespective of cumulus cell attachment and electroporation timing. In conclusion, the electroporation timing and the cumulus cell attachment did not interfere with the efficient delivery of the CRISPR/Cas9 system to the oocytes/zygotes, indicating that porcine genome editing in the oviduct using GONAD method may be possible.

AB  - Isoflurane was responsible for acute neuronal impairment, but its potential molecular mechanisms in damaging hippocampal neurons had not been clearly understood. This study aimed to explore the underlying mechanism of how isoflurane affected the cognitive function of aged rats by damaging the hippocampal neurons. Acute cognitive impairment was found in aged Wistar rats via Morris water maze test and Y-maze test after isoflurane anesthesia in a dose-dependent manner compared with the control group in vivo. Isoflurane also decreased the viabilities and strengthened the apoptotic potential of hippocampal neurons by damaging the mitochondria in a time-dependent manner compared with the control group which was reported by MTT, immunofluorescent assay, flow cytometry and western blot assay in vitro. Isoflurane jeopardized hippocampal neurons by directly inactivating the NR2B/CaMKII/CREB pathway and its harmful effects could be ameliorated by adding CaMKII activator CdCl2. These findings provided evidence that the cognitive ability of aged rats was injured by isoflurane exposure and isoflurane also inhibited the viability and enhanced the apoptosis of hippocampal neurons by damaging the mitochondria through inhibition of the NR2B/CaMKII/CREB pathway and its harmful roles could be partially ameliorated by CdCl2. Our study demonstrated that isoflurane could cause acute neuronal damage and we provided fresh insights that contributed to the safe use of anesthetic agents and the prevention of PND in elderly people.

AB  - Most ecological studies of chiropteran diets report that phyllostomid bats of the subfamilies Stenodermatinae, Carolliinae, and Rhinophyllinae feed principally on fruits. Nevertheless, under certain circumstances, some species can consume a considerable amount of other food resources (nectar/pollen, leaves, and arthropods) as dietary complements to meet their nutritional requirements. We found a relatively high consumption of arthropods by frugivorous phyllostomids as a result of an analysis of feces from a bat community in a lowland forest of northeastern Peru during the dry season. A total of 290 bats (30 species) were captured, from which 188 were frugivorous phyllostomids (13 species). Fecal samples with arthropod remnants were obtained from bats of the genera Artibeus, Carollia, Sturnira, and Rhinophylla, which corresponded to 45% of the samples obtained from the complete assemblage of frugivorous phyllostomids. For three Artibeus species (A. lituratus, A. obscurus, and A. planirostris), arthropods were found in half or more of their fecal samples. This relatively high consumption of arthropods did not significantly differ between male and female frugivorous bats. Findings could be related to a low availability of fruits and high availability of arthropods during the study period.

AB  - Copper (Cu) and zinc (Zn), two potentially toxic trace elements, are commonly abundant in organic wastes (OWs) recycled in soils as fertilizer. Yet current knowledge on the long-term behavior and fate of Cu and Zn in soil following OW spreading is scant. We addressed this issue by studying the fate of OW-borne Cu and Zn in amended soils from four different long-term field experiments. By combining the stable isotope analysis and Xray absorption spectroscopy, we identified changes in Cu and Zn concentrations, speciation and isotopic compositions in the amended soils only when OW had been applied at high rates over long periods. Under these conditions, we highlighted that: (i) all OW-derived Cu and Zn had accumulated in the topsoil layer regardless of the soil and OW type; (ii) the amended soil isotopic signatures were the result of the mixing of OW-borne and natural Cu and Zn; and (iii) Cu and Zn exhibited distinct speciation patterns in amended soils. Indeed, the unprecedented persistence of OW-borne crystallized Cu(I)-sulfide in the amended soils contrasted with the complete transformation of pig slurry-borne nanosized Zn-sulfide or household compost-derived amorphous Zn phosphate and Zn complexed by organic matter.

AB  - Current practices of flea beetle (Phyllotreta spp.) control in Brassica napus L. rely heavily on seed treatments and due to growing concerns regarding the safety of such treatments on non-target and beneficial insect populations, genetic resistance would be beneficial for a more balanced integrated pest management strategy. However, none of the registered B. napus. canola varieties exhibit measurable resistance to flea beetle injury. To this end, an evaluation of 14 winter-type B. napus breeding lines and 15 spring-type B. napus breeding lines for resistance to flea beetle feedings was conducted, as it was found that at least one line in each family exhibited noticeably reduced flea beetle damage compared to sister lines ina breeding nursery. The study revealed natural genetic variation within B. napus for flea beetle antixenosis which could be used by dedicated breeders to develop canola varieties with higher levels of flea beetle resistance. Data indicated that host plant resistance did not vary between feeding by newly emerged adult flea beetles in the fall and the overwintered adults in the spring in either winter-type or spring-type canola, as well as for adult feeding preferences. This indicates that favourable genes identified in in either habitat-type could be used interchangeably to confer resistance even though the flea beetle life cycle is different for each planting period, while either overwintered adults or newly emerged adults can be used to evaluate feeding damage.

AB  - Predation is one of the most important extrinsic factors acting upon animal populations and is a strong selective force in the evolution of form and function. Understanding the impact of predation on bird population dynamics is crucial for understanding the predation pressure of bird populations and implementing conservation strategies, especially for threatened or endemic bird species. In this paper, we sorted the predation events in the wild Crested Ibis population in Yangxian County, Shaanxi Province, from 1981 to 2021 and in the reintroduced Crested Ibis population in Ningshan from 2008 to 2021. With the use of age-classified Leslie matrix models to simulate Crested Ibis populations under different predation pressures, the random population growth rate was estimated, and the impact of predation on population dynamics was evaluated. The results showed that snakes and raptors were the main predators of Crested Ibis in the wild and reintroduced populations, and the number of dead individuals was unevenly distributed within the three age classes in both the wild population (df = 2, chi(2) = 13.236, p < 0.05) and reintroduced population (df = 2, chi(2) = 49.273, p < 0.01). Predation caused a reduction in the potential annual population growth rate of 2.37% (confidence interval [CI]: 2.29-2.45) in the wild population and 2.88% (CI: 2.82-2.94) in the reintroduced population. The overall average growth rates of the wild and reintroduced populations derived from population model simulations were 12.84 and 18.13%, respectively, which suggested that the wild and reintroduced populations was increasing under the current predation pressure and that the impact of predation on the population was acceptable and sustainable.

AB  - We describe two ichnotaxa -Cuniculonomus parallelus Givulescu emend. Robledo et al. and Foliomacula diffussus ichnogen. et ichnosp. nov.- of insect leaf mines from the Late Triassic of Mendoza, Argentina. The specimens, from the Potrerillos Formation at the Quebrada del Durazno locality, consist of a linear mine on a Yabeiella leaf, and a blotch mine on a Heidiphyllum leaf. The earliest convincing records of leaf mining are all linear mines, dating back to the middle-late Triassic, with the first blotch mines appearing from the Cretaceous onwards. The discov-ery presented here therefore represents the earliest record of a blotch mine, and demonstrates that strategies of endophytic herbivory diversified considerably earlier than previously thought. The abundant associated paleoentomological fauna from the locality provides a rare opportunity to consider possible producers of these interactions. A definitive identification of the miners however, remains highly speculative, partly due to the pau-city of direct analogues of insect lineages with leaf mining larvae this early in the fossil record. The exceptional abundance and quality of fossil preservation of both plants and associated insects at the Quebrada del Durazno locality also provides an opportunity to re-evaluate plant host diversity and possible adaptations to mitigate in-sect herbivory. The insect mine on Yabeiella is the first, and to date only, record of this type of interaction on a gnetalean host. We consider the presence of dense pubescence on Yabeiella and its affiliated Fraxinopsis seeds, as a potential passive defense mechanism against insect herbivory rather than as an adaptation to environmental conditions.

AB  - Background and aimsSea-buckthorn (Hippophae rhamnoides) is widely domesticated and cultivated in orchards worldwide. With the advantages of a large root system and the symbiosis of fibrous roots with Frankia, a group of N-2 fixing bacteria which form nodules with the roots, sea-buckthorn can grow in harsh environment under extreme weather conditions. However, its tolerance to petroleum contamination in the soil has so far not been studied. To elucidate whether sea-buckthorn can be employed for phytoremediation of petroleum contamination, its remediation efficiency as well as its growth and metabolic traits in petroleum contaminated soil were examined in an experiment with potted plants.MethodsSea-buckthorn seedlings were planted in soils with four different petroleum concentrations from April to September in a pot experiment. The responses of growth, gas exchange and the antioxidative system were examined on three sampling dates. After 5.5-month of exposure, soil petroleum remediation was evaluated in planted and unplanted soils.ResultsThe petroleum decontamination rate was significantly enhanced by H. rhamnoides in soils with petroleum contamination up to 15 g kg(-1) after one growing season. The root to shoot ratio increased continuously with the increase of the petroleum concentration as a consequence of reduced biomass allocated to the shoots, probably as a mechanism to counteract stress by the petroleum contamination of the soil. Photosynthesis was enhanced by lower petroleum concentrations in the soil (<= 15 g kg(-1)) in September. Short-term exposure (in July) to high petroleum concentrations (20 g kg(-1)) in the soil enhanced ascorbate peroxidase (APX), glutathione reductase (GR), superoxide dismutase (SOD), and catalase (CAT) activity and increased ascorbic acid (AsA) and glutathione (GSH) contents, indicating elevated activity of the Foyer-Haliwell-Asada-Cycle. However, similar effects were not observed at long-term exposure.ConclusionsOur results prove that sea-buckthorn is a promising tool for phytoremediation of petroleum contaminated soils up to 15 g kg(-1) in loess plateau soil in China.

TI  - Out with the New And In With the Old: Reviving a Traditional Makah Halibut Hook for Modern Fisheries Management Challenges
T2  - FISHERIES
LA  - English
AB  - Although fisheries challenges evolve rapidly, historical approaches may provide "new" tools for managers. In the state of Washington, the Makah Tribe have used cibu center dot d, their traditional fishhook, to target Pacific Halibut Hippoglossus stenolepis long before the advent of modern fisheries. We describe our experience in rediscovering this historical harvesting method, testing the species selectivity, refining the approach, and producing a tool ready for application in modern fisheries management. Over nearly a decade, we were able to uncover substantial traditional knowledge in the community. Turning this knowledge into a reproducible and consistent product for testing proved difficult. Initial attempts to deploy the gear using commercial longlines encountered a range of challenges, but suggested refinements for further research. Subsequent experiments in recreational fisheries were successful due to the lessons learned during initial work. Our experience may be of value to others hoping to investigate historical methods with potential for addressing modern problems.

AB  - Host specialisation is a common phenotype in herbivores and is considered as an important driver for species diversity of herbivores. Previous studies have revealed that a distinct plant defence mechanism underlies herbivores' host specialisation. However, the role of plant nutritional status, especially sugar metabolism, is a widely overlooked driver of host specialisation formation. Here, the Cucurbitaceae biotype (CA) and Malvaceae biotype (MA) of cotton-melon aphids, Aphis gossypii, were used to reveal the potential role of plant sugar metabolism in the formation of host-specialised aphid biotypes. The abundance, intrinsic rate of increase and net reproductive rate of CA and MA biotypes significantly decreased after reciprocal host transfer, suggesting a host utilisation trade-off between these biotypes. Further analysis of sugar quality showed differences in sugar components, especially raffinose-family oligosaccharides (RFOs), between watermelon and cotton plants. The concentrations and ratios of raffinose and stachyose were higher in watermelon leaves than in cotton leaves, respectively. Exogenous application of different sugar substrates showed that CA biotypes performed the best on artificial diets with sucrose and raffinose (3:8) while MA biotypes established populations on artificial diets with only sucrose. Moreover, the level of aphid's galactosidase activity, a key enzyme in RFOs metabolism, decreased in CA biotypes but increased in MA biotypes after reciprocal host transfer for acclimatising themselves to changes in RFOs of host plants. Consequently, optimal sugar components provide essential cues for the formation of host-specialised cotton-melon aphids.

AB  - Flower color is an important ornamental trait that influences plant growth and pollination. However, the molecular mechanisms of flower color variation in Camellia, a widely used ornamental woody flower for landscaping, remain unexplored. Here, we used an integrated transcriptomic and metabolomic approach to investigate the molecular regulatory mechanisms underlying petal coloration diversity in three Camellia species: Camellia amplexicaulis Cohen Stuart (red flower, RD), C. petelotii (Merr.) Sealy (yellow flower, YE), and C. oleifera Abel (white flower, WH). We found that in RD flowers, the anthocyanin content, which is closely associated with red flowers, was the highest. In YE flowers, compounds believed to play important roles in flower coloration, such as apigenin, vitexin and their derivatives, as well as quercetin and its derivatives, were significantly greater than those in flowers of other colors. Kaempferol and its derivative contents, which are considered white petal pigments, were greater in WH flowers. Additionally, we identified 139 structural genes involved in flavonoid biosynthesis and screened 29 key structural genes, including PAL, 4CL, CHI, CHS, ANS, ANR, LAR, CYP75B1, FLS, C12RT1, FG3, and CYP93B2_16. The expression patterns of these genes in flowers of different colors were closely related to the patterns of flavonoid metabolite accumulation, indicating that these genes play a key role in flower color development. Transcription factors (TFs) also play important roles in regulating flower color formation. We identified 3,181 TFs, including members of the MYB, bHLH, bZIP, and WRKY TF families, which play crucial roles in the flavonoid and anthocyanin biosynthetic pathways. According to the results of the correlation analysis, 66 TFs were highly correlated with the total flavonoid and anthocyanin contents, and these TFs directly or indirectly regulate flower color development. Moreover, we identified numerous potential metabolites, along with many candidate structural genes and TFs, that may cause flower color variations. Therefore, our findings provide new insights into the molecular regulatory network of Camellia flower color diversity and offer significant genetic insight and a theoretical foundation for the cultivation of Camellia varieties with desirable color characteristics. With further functional validation and breeding applications, these results may increase the ornamental value of Camellia species and contribute to the genetic improvement of the Camellia flower.

AB  - ACSS1/2 converts acetate into acetyl-coenzyme A, which contributes to histone acetylation in the mitochondria and cytoplasm. Zygotic genome activation (ZGA) is critical for embryo development involving drastic histone modification. An efficient crRNAs-Cas13a targeting strategy was employed to investigate the ACSS1/2 function during ZGA. The results showed that nuclear accumulation of ACSS1 and ACSS2 occurs during ZGA. Knockdown of ACSS1/2 did not affect blastocyst formation when using a normal medium. On culturing embryos in a medium with acetate and no pyruvate (-P + Ace), knockdown of ACSS1 did not affect histone acetylation levels but significantly reduced ATP levels, whereas knockdown of ACSS2 significantly reduced histone acetylation levels in porcine embryos. Inhibition of fatty acid beta-oxidation by etomoxir significantly reduced ATP levels, which could be restored by acetate. The histone acetylation levels in the ACSS1 and ACSS2 knockdown groups both decreased considerably after etomoxir treatment. Moreover, acetate showed dose-dependent effects on SIRT1 and SIRT3 levels when under metabolic stress. The C-terminus of ACSS1 regulated the nuclear translocation. In conclusion, ACSS1/2 helps to maintain ATP and histone acetylation levels in porcine early embryos under metabolic stress during ZGA.

AB  - Simple Summary Pork production in Ecuador is a significant contributor to the country's economy and food security, producing 227,769 metric tons of meat and 1,969,922 pigs, including 1,019,570 fattening pigs. This industry provides employment for 80,000 people, with many operations being family-run and utilizing alternative feed ingredients made from agricultural by-products or surplus crops to reduce costs. This approach to farming not only helps to lower production costs and increase profitability, but also minimizes environmental impact by using local resources and reducing waste. In addition, research has demonstrated that incorporating alternative feedstuffs, such as cooked cassava and taro, as partial substitutes for corn can lead to improved growth and fattening in pigs, as well as increased protein assimilation at the ileum level. Pork production in Ecuador is of significant economic and nutritional importance. Many of these operations are family- or backyard-based and utilize alternative feed ingredients to reduce production costs. The current study aimed to determine the chemical composition of cooked cassava and taro, and to evaluate their inclusion in the feed of backyard pigs during the growth and fattening phases. A total of 42 castrated pigs from two geographic locations in Ecuador were studied over a period of 100 days, during which their weight and measurements were recorded at three-week intervals. At the end of the experiment, ileum samples were collected from the slaughtered pigs in order to calculate the apparent digestibility of the feed. The crude protein levels of cassava and taro were found to be 3.2% and 2.1%, respectively. The combination of cooked cassava and taro was found to be a suitable replacement for corn, with the best results observed in the group receiving a diet incorporating 21% each of cassava and taro. Analysis of the ileal content also revealed that this group exhibited the highest nitrogen assimilation from the diet.

AB  - In respect of pig instance segmentation, the application of traditional computer vision techniques is constrained by sundries barrier, overlapping, and different perspectives in the pig breeding environment. In recent years, the attention-based methods have achieved remarkable performance. In this paper, we introduce two types of attention blocks into the feature pyramid network (FPN) (see nomenclature table) framework, which encode the semantic interdependencies in the channel (named channel attention block (CAB)) (see nomenclature table) and spatial (named spatial attention block (SAB)) (see nomenclature table) dimensions, respectively. By integrating the associated features, the CAB selectively emphasizes the interdependencies among the channels. Meanwhile, the SAB selectively aggregates the features at each position through a weighted sum of the features at all positions. A dual attention block (DAB) (see nomenclature table) is proposed to integrate CAB features with SAB information flexibly. A total of 45 pigs with 8 pens are captured as the experiment subjects. In comparison with such state-of-art attention modules as convolutional block attention module (CBAM) (see nomenclature table), bottleneck attention module (BAM) (see nomenclature table), and spatial-channel squeeze & excitation (SCSE) (see nomenclature table), embedding DAB can contribute to the most significant performance improvement in different task networks with distinct backbone networks. Especially with HTC-R101-DAB (hybrid task cascade) (see nomenclature table), the best performance is produced, with the AP0.5 (average precision) (see nomenclature table) AP0.75, AP0.5:0.95, and AP0.5:0.95-large reaching 93.1%, 84.1%, 69.4%, and 71.8%, respectively. Also, as indicated by ablation experiments, the SAB contributes more than CAB. Meanwhile, the predictive results appear a trend of increasing initially and decreasing afterwards after different numbers of SAB are merged. Besides, as revealed by the visualization of attention maps, attention blocks can extract regions with similar semantic information. The attention-based models also produce outstanding segmentation performance on public dataset, which evidences the practicability of our attention blocks. Our baseline models are available1.

AB  - Multi-trophic and multispecies interactions among family of arthropods assemblages are ubiquitous and include all type of interactions from mutualistic to antagonistic. To better inform the biological control of aphids, the multitrophic interactions between aphids, coccinellids and their parasitoids in natural and managed plant systems were examined over a span of 4 years. Coccinellid larvae naturally found feeding on aphids on two non-crop plants growing in agricultural landscapes in Pakistan were studied; Aphis nerii Boyer de Fonscolombe (Hemiptera: Aphididae) feeding on Calotropis procera Aiton, and Nerium oleander L, and four crop host; Lipaphis erysimi Kalt (Hemiptera: Aphididae) feeding on Eurica sativa Mill. and Brassica campestris L., Uroleucon compositae Theobold (Hemiptera: Aphididae) feeding on Carthamus tinctorius L., and Diuraphis noxia Mordvilko (Hemiptera: Aphididae) feeding on Hordeum vulgare L.; were collected throughout the aphid season and reared on their respective aphid-plant combinations in the laboratory conditions to identify coccinellid species, their parasitoids and asses their performance in items of survival and pupal weight. The coccinellid pupal weight on different host plant-aphid combinations varied from 3.4 to 11.2 mg, as did the mortality of coccinellid larvae due to diseases and unknown causes (5 to 31%). Parasitism of coccinellid larvae by Homalotylus flaminus (Dalman) (Hymenoptera: Encyrtidae) ranged from approximately 10 to 30 in B. campestris and E. sativa, respectively. The parasitism of coccinellid pupae by Oomyzus scaposus (Thomson) (Hymenoptera: Eulophidae) ranged between 17 (C. procera) to 41% (B. compestris). One Dinocampus coccinellae Schrank (Hymenoptera: Braconidae) was reared. Coccinellids displayed selectivity towards host plants and aphids. Some coccinellids were never or rarely recorded on a particular aphid-plant combination, suggesting that their prey selection is more specific than often assumed. Management decision and conservation biological control cannot be based on superficial categories such as "aphids" and "coccinellids" but need to be plant and species specific.

AB  - Ticks are important vectors of pathogenic viruses, bacteria, and protozoans to humans, wildlife, and domestic animals. Due to their life cycles, ticks face significant challenges related to water homeostasis. When blood-feeding, they must excrete water and ions, but when off-host (for stretches lasting several months), they must conserve water to avoid desiccation. Aquaporins (AQPs), a family of membrane-bound water channels, are key players in osmoregulation in many animals but remain poorly characterized in ticks. Here, we bioinformatically identified AQP-like genes from the deer tick Ixodes scapularis and used phylogenetic approaches to map the evolution of the aquaporin gene family in arthropods. Most arachnid AQP-like sequences (including those of I. scapularis) formed a monophyletic group clustered within aquaglycerolporins (GLPs) from bacteria to vertebrates. This gene family is absent from insects, revealing divergent evolutionary paths for AQPs in different hematophagous arthropods. Next, we sequenced the full-length cDNA of I. scapularis aquaporin 1 (IsAQP1) and expressed it heterologously in Xenopus oocytes to functionally characterize its permeability to water and solutes. Additionally, we examined IsAQP1 expression across different life stages and adult female organs. We found IsAQP1 is an efficient water channel with high expression in salivary glands prior to feeding, suggesting it plays a role in osmoregulation before or during blood feeding. Its functional properties are unique: unlike most GLPs, IsAQP1 has low glycerol permeability, and unlike most AQPs, it is insensitive to mercury. Together, our results suggest IsAQP1 plays an important role in tick water balance physiology and that it may hold promise as a target of novel vector control efforts.

TI  - Inflammatory Responses with Left Ventricular Compromise after Induction of Myocardial Infarcts in Sheep (Ovis aries)
T2  - COMPARATIVE MEDICINE
LA  - English
KW  - HEART-DISEASE
AB  - Ischemic myocardial disease is a major cause of death among humans worldwide; it results in scarring and pallor of the myocardium and triggers an inflammatory response that contributes to impaired left ventricular function. This response includes and is evidenced by the production of several inflammatory cytokines including TNF alpha, IL1 beta, IL4, IFN gamma, IL10 and IL6. In the current study, myocardial infarcts were induced in 6 mo old male castrated sheep by ligation of the left circumflex obtuse marginal arteries (OM 1 and 2). MRI was used to measure parameters of left ventricular function that include EDV, ESV, EF, SVI, dp/dt max and dp/dt min at baseline and at 4 wk and 3 mo after infarct induction. We also measured serum concentrations of an array of cytokines. Postmortem histologic findings corroborate the existence of left ventricular myocardial injury and deterioration. Our data show a correlation between serum cytokine concentrations and the development of myocardial damage and left ventricular functional compromise.

AB  - Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE, EC 3.4.15.1) in the renin-angiotensin system regulates blood pressure by catalyzing angiotensin I to the vasoconstrictor angiotensin II. In this study, the ACE was purified and characterized from sheep lung. The kinetic properties of the ACE were designated. The inhibition effect of captopril, a specific ACE inhibitor, was determined. ACE was purified from sheep lung using the affinity chromatography method in one step. NHS-activated Sepharose 4 Fast Flow as column filler and lisinopril as a ligand in this method used. The molecular weight and purity of ACE were designated using the SDS-PAGE method. Optimum temperature and optimum pH were found for purified ACE. K-M and V-max values from Lineweaver-Burk charts determined. The inhibition type, IC50, and K-i values of captopril on purified ACE were identified. ACE was 6405-fold purified from sheep lung by affinity chromatography in one step and specific activity was 16871 EU/mg protein. The purity and molecular weight of ACE were found with SDS-PAGE and observed two bands at around 60 kDa and 70 kDa on the gel. Optimum temperature and optimum pH were designated for purified ACE. Optimum temperature and pH were found as 40 degrees C and pH 7.4, respectively. V-max and K-M values were calculated to be 35.59 (mu mol/min).mL(-1) and 0.18 mM, respectively. IC50 value of captopril was found as 0.51 nM. The inhibition type of captopril was determined as non-competitive from the Lineweaver-Burk graph and the K-i value was 0.39 nM. As a result, it was observed in this study that the ACE enzyme can be successfully purified from sheep lungs in one step. Also, it was determined that captopril, which is a specific ACE inhibitor, has a significant inhibitory effect with a very low IC50 value of 0.51 nM.

AB  - Simple Summary Inactivated foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) vaccines are used to protect livestock against the FMD virus. However, adequate levels of antibodies to provide protection against the FMD virus cannot be rapidly produced and take a long time to develop. In this study, to solve the challenge presented by the low antibody formation following FMD vaccination in pigs, an ionic amino-zinc complex (Amino-Zn), which has high bioavailability and immunity-enhancing effects, was administered orally. The effect on the FMD vaccine structural protein (SP) antibody formation was evaluated. As a result, the FMD vaccine SP antibody titer and immune indicators (IFN-& gamma;, IgA) were significantly higher in the FMD vaccine group administered with 0.2% Amino-Zn in the feed compared with the positive control group (FMD vaccine only) after the first and second vaccinations. These results demonstrated that administering Amino-Zn effectively improved the antibody titer induced by the FMD vaccine and the immunity of the piglets. Foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) is a highly contagious animal disease that occurs in cloven-hoofed animals including pigs. To prevent FMD, vaccines and adjuvants are routinely used to induce an immune response; however, it requires an extended period of time to produce sufficient antibodies to prevent viral infection. In this study, we evaluated the increased effectiveness of the FMD vaccine structural protein (SP) antibody by administrating the Amino-Zn adjuvant to 100 pigs from 3 test pig farms in their feed. The FMD vaccine antibody titer and immunological index were analyzed using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kit, and the hematological and blood biochemical parameters were analyzed using an automatic blood analyzer. The titer of the FMD vaccine SP antibodies in the 0.2% Amino-Zn-administered group was significantly increased compared to that of the positive control group only injected with FMD vaccine at 4 weeks after the first vaccination and at 4, 8, and 16 weeks after the second vaccination (p < 0.05). The FMD vaccine SP antibody positive rate was 100% until shipment. The IFN-& gamma; and IgA levels were significantly increased by Amino-Zn administration 4 weeks after the first vaccination and 4 weeks after the second vaccination (p < 0.05). On the other hand, serum AST, and CPK (p < 0.001) were significantly decreased by Amino-Zn administration. These results show that the administration of Amino-Zn is effective in enhancing the antibody titer and immunogenicity of the FMD vaccine and can be used as an oral adjuvant (OrAd) to prevent viral diseases, such as FMD.

AB  - Liquid fertilizers (LFs) produced by microwave-assisted acid hydrolysis of livestock and poultry wastes were applied to potted hot pepper (Capsicum annuum L.) to evaluate their potential to be used as amino acid LFs. A preliminary experiment was conducted to determine the optimum acid-hydrolysis conditions for producing LFs from a mixture of pig hair and faeces (P) and another mixture of chicken feathers and faeces (C). Two LFs were produced under the optimum acid-hydrolysis conditions (acidification by sulphuric acid (7.5 mol L-1) in a microwave (200 W) for 90 minutes), and a commercial amino acid LF (Guo Guang (GG)) was used for comparison. P, C and GG fertilizers were tested in potted hot pepper cultivation at two doses, whereas no fertilizer application served as the control (CK). P and C fertilizers significantly increased the fruit yield compared with GG fertilizer, particularly at the higher dose. Moreover, the treatments improved the fruit vitamin C and soluble sugar contents in the order of C > P > GG compared with CK. These results could be attributed to more types of amino acids in C fertilizer than in P and GG fertilizers. The results also indicated that the prepared fertilizers could significantly increase the shoot and root dry weight, soil available nitrogen and phosphorus contents and nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium (NPK) uptake by plants compared with CK. In conclusion, microwave-assisted acid hydrolysis could effectively convert unusable wastes into valuable fertilizers comparable or even superior to commercial fertilizers.

AB  - The health status of weaned pigs is crucial for their subsequent growth performance. Supplementation with fermented feedstuff is able to improve the feed intake and growth of weaned pigs; however, the exact mechanism behind this is not clear. Hence, in the present study a total of 320 Duroc x Landrace x Yorkshire weaned pigs were selected and allocated to the following two groups: unfermented diet group (UFD) and fermented diet group (FD). The experimental period lasted 21 days. At the end of the experiment, feces, blood, and gastrointestinal tissue samples (including the stomach, jejunum, and ileum) were collected and used for further analysis. The results of growth performance suggested that the FD group had significantly increased (p < 0.05) average daily feed intake (ADFI) and average daily gain (ADG) during the first week, during the last two weeks, and over the entire three-week period compared with the UFD group. The results of the apparent nutrient digestibility of pigs showed that, compared with the UFD group, the FD group showed increased phosphorus (p < 0.05) and CP (p < 0.1) digestibility. There were no significant differences in the serum biochemical parameters between the UFD and FD groups. Moreover, our results showed that the FD group showed significantly increased gene expression of SGLT1 and PepT1 in the jejunum (p < 0.05). Compared with the UFD group, the FD group showed an increased (p < 0.05) serum orexin level and prepro-orexin (PPDX) expression in the gastric fundus, jejunum, and ileum mucosa and increased IGF-1 and IGFR expression in the jejunum. Collectively, these results indicated that supplementation with fermented feedstuff in the diet effectively enhanced the feed intake and growth of weaned pigs and that this may have been caused by the increased orexin, IGF-1, and IGFR serum levels.

AB  - Enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2) has been extensively investigated to participate in diverse biological processes, including carcinogenesis, the cell cycle, X-chromosome inactivation, and early embryonic development. However, the functions of this protein during mammalian oocyte meiotic maturation remain largely unexplored. Here, combined with RNA-Seq, we provided evidence that EZH2 is essential for oocyte meiotic maturation in pigs. First, EZH2 protein expression increased with oocyte progression from GV to MII stage. Second, the siRNA-mediated depletion of EZH2 led to accelerated GVBD and early occurrence of the first polar body extrusion. Third, EZH2 knockdown resulted in defective spindle assembly, abnormal SAC activity, and unstable K-MT attachment, which was concomitant with the increased rate of aneuploidy. Finally, EZH2 silencing exacerbated oxidative stress by increasing ROS levels and disrupting the distribution of active mitochondria in porcine oocytes. Furthermore, parthenogenetic embryonic development was impaired following the depletion of EZH2 at GV stage. Taken together, we concluded that EZH2 is necessary for porcine oocyte meiotic progression through regulating spindle organization, maintaining chromosomal integrity, and mitochondrial function.

AB  - Numerous technologies have been investigated for mitigating air pollutant emissions from swine barns. Among them, algal photobioreactors (PBRs) can remove and utilize air pollutants such as CO2 and NH3 from barn exhaust. However, a challenge to PBR operation is that it involves multiple system input parameters and output goals. A key question is then how to determine the appropriate CO2 and NH3 concentrations in this case. Conventional statistical methods are inadequate for handling this complex problem. Multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) emerges as a practical methodology for comparison and can be utilized to rank different CO2-NH3 interactions based on their environmental and biological performance. By employing MCDM methods, producers can effectively control the ratio of CO2 and NH3 concentrations, enabling them to identify the optimal range of operating parameters for various housing types, ensuring efficient pollutant mitigation. In this study, a multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) approach was employed to support operation management. Specifically, influent CO2 and NH3 concentrations were optimized for three scenarios (the best biological, environmental, and overall performance), using a combination of two MCDM techniques. This study is anticipated to facilitate the system analysis and optimization of algae-based phytoremediation processes.

AB  - Ecotypes, subpopulations or strains of a single species locally adapted to divergent ecological conditions within the same habitat are often considered to be the first steps in sympatric speciation. It has been suggested that two ecotypes are distinguishable in Nasonia vitripennis, a prominent model organism for parasitic Hymenoptera, with one ecotype parasitizing fly pupae in bird nests, and the other one parasitizing fly pupae on carrion. This differentiation into two ecotypes has been hypothesized to indicate incipient sympatric speciation in populations of this globally distributed species. In the present study, we investigated the differentiation into these two distinct ecotypes focusing on chemical profiles and the population genetic divergence in a wild N. vitripennis population from the Netherlands. Isofemale lines were obtained from bird nest boxes and from deer carrion, respectively, representing both microhabitats. To test for phenotypic differentiation, we determined the surface cuticular hydrocarbon (CHC) profiles from wasps of both host patches. Using a panel of 14 microsatellites, we concordantly determined the population genetic structure and tested for genetic differentiation between foundresses obtained from both microhabitats. Both the phenotypic as well as the genetic datasets show no evidence for any kind of separation based on the postulated two ecotypes, but rather suggest free interbreeding with no gene flow interruption between the two distinct host patches. Our findings challenge previous assumptions on clearly distinguishable ecotypes in N. vitripennis, and demonstrate how a chemical ecological assessment coupled with population genetics can be instrumental in re-evaluating the potential of ecological differentiation and incipient speciation mechanisms in parasitoid wasps.

AB  - Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a neurodegenerative disorder associated to deteriorating motor and cognitive functions, and short survival. The disease is caused by neuronal death which results in progressive muscle wasting and weakness, ultimately leading to lethal respiratory failure. The misbehaviour of a specific protein, TDP-43, which aggregates and becomes toxic in ALS patient's neurons, is supposed to be one of the causes. TDP-43 is a DNA/RNA-binding protein involved in several functions related to nucleic acid metabolism. Sequestration of TDP-43 aggregates is a possible therapeutic strategy that could alleviate or block pathology. Here, we describe the selection and characterization of a new intracellular antibody (intrabody) against TDP-43 from a llama nanobody library. The structure of the selected intrabody was predicted in silico and the model was used to suggest mutations that enabled to improve its expression yield, facilitating its experimental validation. We showed how coupling experimental methodologies with in silico design may allow us to obtain an antibody able to recognize the RNA binding regions of TDP-43. Our findings illustrate a strategy for the mitigation of TDP-43 proteinopathy in ALS and provide a potential new tool for diagnostics.

AB  - Fannia pusio (Wiedemann, 1830) is a species belonging to the family Fanniidae, which is of great forensic, sanitary, and veterinary interest. The behavioral peculiarities of this species, depending on the temperature at which it is found, may provide additional information for future research. The application of entomology in the forensic field has focused especially on the early colonizing taxa of corpses that are in the initial stage of decomposition. However, species occurring at more advanced stages can contribute to further knowledge, as is the case with F. pusio. In addition, the species has the ability to colonize buried corpses that are inaccessible to larger dipterans. On the other hand, the sanitary and veterinary interest of this species is due to the performance of females as phoretic hosts of Dermatobia hominis eggs that cause myiasis in both animals and humans. In the current study, the behavior of F. pusio was observed at a temperature range of 5 degrees C to 40 degrees C. We found that its viability range is limited between 15 degrees C and 35 degrees C; above and below these temperatures, adults survive but oviposition does not take place. Data collected by statistical analysis were subsequently applied to calculate the post-mortem interval (PMI) using isomorphen and isomegalen diagrams. The results show a directly proportional relationship between growth rate and temperature increase. However, a slowdown in the growth of individuals was observed at extreme temperatures (5 degrees C and 35 degrees C). The results shown in this manuscript, together with the existing bibliography of other species, help to broaden the knowledge of F. pusio, which has not been studied in such depth until now.

AB  - ObjectiveTo study innovative approaches to ovarian tissue cryopreservation, a critical issue for fertility preservation in pediatric cancer patients. Despite historical attempts, recent advances in cancer treatment have underscored the urgent need for more effective and reliable ovarian tissue cryopreservation methods. Our research aims to evaluate if decreasing the rigidity of stroma before cryopreservation by investigating pre-treatments with enzymes can enhance the quality of ovarian tissue post-thawing.DesignOur research evaluated the use of five commonly used enzymes to disaggregate tissue (trypLE, collagenase, dispase, accutase and hyaluronidase) before freezing ovarian tissue to decrease rigidity and facilitate cryopreservation. Sheep ovaries, with high similarity to human ovaries, were used as an animal model. Tissue structure, cell proliferation, apoptosis and viability were assessed before and after thawing.ResultsOur findings showed that enzymatic treatment with trypLE before freezing offered immediate benefits post-thawing with the highest viability values and percentage of intact follicles. A decrease in viability was observed after thawing and culturing the samples. The pretreatment with accutase damaged the tissue severely with also the lowest viability values. Ki67-positive follicles and stromal cells were observed in fresh samples, but only trypLE and hyaluronidase maintained Ki67-positive antral follicles after 2 days culture. Besides, only trypLE maintained all follicles negative to caspase-3 after thawing, and 7 days after culture primordial follicles were apoptotic in all treatments apart from trypLE.Conclusionour findings suggest that trypLE pretreatment could provide a beneficial approach for maintaining the functions and viability of cryopreserved ovaries after thawing. Further research is needed to fully understand their impact and optimize cryopreservation protocols in this important clinical context.

AB  - This study evaluates the adsorptive capacity of elephant grass (EG) in the removal of Methylene blue (MB) dye from wastewater sourced from two major local dyeing industries in Ogun State, Nigeria. Batch adsorption method was used to determine the optimum conditions, characterization of the adsorbent, equilibrium Isotherm models, kinetics and thermodynamics studies were conducted to evaluate the nature of the adsorption process. The optimum adsorption conditions obtained for the standard solution of MB dye were; pH 7, Temp 40 degrees C, contact time 180 min and adsorbent dosage 2.0 g. The presence of oxygen containing functional groups and shift or disappearance of bands in the FTIR suggested the suitability of EG for the process. The SEM of EG revealed presence and disappearance of pores before and after the adsorption process. The mechanism of this adsorption is complex, the adsorption data is best fitted to Langmuir isotherm, the mean adsorption energy E (<= 6.455 kJ/mol), and activation energy (10.84 kJ/mol) represents physical process but, the thermodynamic studies revealed spontaneity (Delta G degrees -15.93 to -14.26 kJ mol(-1)), randomness, and endothermic (Delta H degrees 40.1 kJ/mol) nature, representing chemisorption. Therefore, local dyers around the study sites can make use of the freely available EG for the remediation of their wastewater.
   NOVELTY STATEMENTElephant grass (EG) abundantly thrives on the study sites where dye wastewater is released by local dyers. This serves as the impetus for this research as no other plants thrive on the dye-polluted environment. A favorable adsorption was obtained with EG as adsorbent for the Methylene blue (MB) dye that is a major constituent of the wastewater from the two major local dyeing industries investigated. Therefore, this study provides scientific support for the local dyers around the study sites to make use of the freely available EG for the remediation of their wastewater.

AB  - The biochemical heterogeneity of food items often yields tradeoffs as each bite of food tends to contain some nutrients in surplus and others in deficit, as well as other less palatable or even toxic compounds. These multidimensional nutritional challenges are likely to be compounded when foraged foods are used to provision others (e.g., offspring or symbionts) with different physiological needs and tolerances. We explored these challenges in free-ranging colonies of leafcutter ants that navigate a diverse tropical forest to collect plant fragments they use to provision a co-evolved fungal cultivar. We tested the prediction that leafcutter farmers face provisioning tradeoffs between the nutritional quality and concentration of toxic tannins in foraged plant fragments. Chemical analyses of plant fragments sampled from the mandibles of Panamanian Atta colombica leafcutter ants provided little support for a nutrient-tannin foraging tradeoff. First, colonies foraged for plant fragments that ranged widely in tannin concentration. Second, high tannin levels did not appear to restrict colonies from selecting plant fragments with blends of protein and carbohydrates that maximized cultivar performance when measured with in vitro experiments. We also tested whether tannins expand the realized nutritional niche selected by leafcutter ants into high-protein dimensions as: (1) tannins can bind proteins and reduce their accessibility during digestion, and (2) in vitro experiments have shown that excess protein provisioning reduces cultivar performance. Contrary to this hypothesis, the most protein-rich plant fragments did not have highest tannin levels. More generally, the approach developed here can be used to test how multidimensional interactions between nutrients and toxins shape the costs and benefits of providing care to offspring or symbionts.

AB  - Simple Summary This study investigated the developmental differences between in vivo-developed (IVV) and in vitro embryos (in vitro fertilization (IVF) and parthenogenetic activation (PA)) in pigs using single-cell RNA sequencing data from the oocyte to the 8-cell stages. Findings show that in vitro embryos have more similar developmental trajectories and lower gene diversity, especially PA, compared to IVV. Significant variations were observed in maternal mRNA, influencing mRNA splicing, energy metabolism, and chromatin remodeling, where key genes like SMARCB1 and HDAC1 (in vivo) and SIRT1 and EZH2 (in vitro) might be playing crucial roles. Despite similar ZGA timings across embryo types, IVV embryos exhibited more upregulated genes, particularly during major ZGA, and global epigenetic modification differences were evident from the oocyte stage and continued to expand during minor ZGA. They also uniquely upregulated genes linked to mitochondrial function, ATP synthesis, and oxidative phosphorylation. A notable difference in mRNA degradation between in vivo and in vitro embryos was observed during major ZGA, and the timely decay of maternal mRna in IVV except in in vitro embryos was related to phosphatase activity and cell junctions. The study also highlighted the higher expression of mitochondrially encoded genes in in vitro embryos, though nucleosome occupancy and ATP8 expression were higher in IVV.Abstract In vitro-fertilized (IVF) and parthenogenetically activated (PA) embryos, key to genetic engineering, face more developmental challenges than in vivo-developed embryos (IVV). We analyzed single-cell RNA-seq data from the oocyte to eight-cell stages in IVV, IVF, and PA porcine embryos, focusing on developmental differences during early zygotic genome activation (ZGA), a vital stage for embryonic development. (1) Our findings reveal that in vitro embryos (IVF and PA) exhibit more similar developmental trajectories compared to IVV embryos, with PA embryos showing the least gene diversity at each stage. (2) Significant differences in maternal mRNA, particularly affecting mRNA splicing, energy metabolism, and chromatin remodeling, were observed. Key genes like SMARCB1 (in vivo) and SIRT1 (in vitro) played major roles, with HDAC1 (in vivo) and EZH2 (in vitro) likely central in their complexes. (3) Across different types of embryos, there was minimal overlap in gene upregulation during ZGA, with IVV embryos demonstrating more pronounced upregulation. During minor ZGA, global epigenetic modification patterns diverged and expanded further. Specifically, in IVV, genes, especially those linked to H4 acetylation and H2 ubiquitination, were more actively regulated compared to PA embryos, which showed an increase in H3 methylation. Additionally, both types displayed a distinction in DNA methylation. During major ZGA, IVV distinctively upregulated genes related to mitochondrial regulation, ATP synthesis, and oxidative phosphorylation. (4) Furthermore, disparities in mRNA degradation-related genes between in vivo and in vitro embryos were more pronounced during major ZGA. In IVV, there was significant maternal mRNA degradation. Maternal genes regulating phosphatase activity and cell junctions, highly expressed in both in vivo and in vitro embryos, were degraded in IVV in a timely manner but not in in vitro embryos. (5) Our analysis also highlighted a higher expression of many mitochondrially encoded genes in in vitro embryos, yet their nucleosome occupancy and the ATP8 expression were notably higher in IVV.

AB  - Chronic or recurrent stress is associated with reactive oxygen species (ROS) overproduction and can lead to oxidative damage, which plays important roles in neurodegenerative diseases. Mito ? TEMPO is an antioxidant targeted at mitochondria. The aim of the presented study was to assess antidepressant and antioxidant efficacy of Mito ? TEMPO administered alone or with fluoxetine in mice exposed to chronic stress. The evaluation of the antidepressant-like activity was based on forced swimming test (FST) and tail suspension test (TST). In order to evaluate the antioxidant potential, the level of mRNA expression of Adora1, Ogg1, Msra, Nrf2 and Tfam in the hippocampus of mice was determined. Behavioural research data showed the antidepressant effect of fluoxetine and Mito ? TEMPO administered to mice alone and in combination. The molecular research results indicate a significant impact of chronic stress on the oxidation-reduction balance and an antioxidant effect of Mito ? TEMPO. The results obtained in the study suggest that Mito ? TEMPO protects DNA against oxidative damage and may be beneficial in the way of cellular function improvement under the conditions of chronic stress. Adora1, Msra, Nrf2 and Tfam genes may be involved in mediating the antioxidant effect of the combined treatment with fluoxetine and Mito ? TEMPO.

AB  - Simple Summary: An animal's genetic merit can govern its production potential and performance. This study used a bio-economic model informed by a large dataset of records from a commercial sheep-production-flock study to investigate the effects of selecting breeding females based on their maternal genetic merit for productivity, feed demand and gross margin. The results showed that selecting and using breeding females of high genetic merit will increase the gross margin of the flock, thus improving the profitability of the production system for the farmer. Our results provide insight for sheep-meat-production industries into the cumulative economic returns of using animals of high genetic merit. Our results also indicate potential outcomes from improving flock genetic merit, an important key performance indicator for the industry, and inform decision-making around production priorities of producers. The objective of this study was to simulate and assess the profitability of sheep production systems that varied in maternal genetic merit (high or low) and country of origin (New Zealand (NZ) or Ireland), using the Teagasc Lamb Production Model (TLPM). A production system study performed at Teagasc Athenry, Co. Galway, Ireland, from 2016 to 2019, inclusive, provided key animal performance input parameters, which were compared across three scenarios: high maternal genetic merit NZ (NZ), high maternal genetic merit Irish (High Irish) and low maternal genetic merit Irish (Low Irish). Prior to the beginning of the study ewes and rams were imported from New Zealand to Ireland in order to compare animals within the same management system. Ewes were selected based on the respective national maternal genetic indexes; i.e., either the New Zealand Maternal Worth (NZ group) or the eurouro-star Replacement index (Irish groups). The TLPM was designed to simulate the impact of changes in physical and technical outputs (such as number of lambs, drafting rates and replacement rates) on a range of economic parameters including variable costs, fixed costs, gross margin and net profit. Results showed that total farm costs (variable and fixed) were similar across the three scenarios, driven by the similar number of ewes in each scenario. The number of lambs produced and the cost of production per lamb was 14.05 lambs per hectare for the NZ scenario at a cost of EUR 82.35 per lamb, 11.40 lambs per hectare for the High Irish scenario at a cost of EUR 101.42 per lamb and 11.00 lambs per hectare for the Low Irish scenario at a cost of EUR 105.72 per lamb. The net profit of the three scenarios was EUR 514, EUR 299, and EUR 258 per hectare, for the NZ, High Irish and Low Irish scenarios, respectively. Overall, the NZ scenario had a lower cost of production in comparison to either Irish group, while the High Irish scenario had a 14% greater net profit than the Low Irish scenario, equating to an additional EUR 41 per hectare net profit. Output from this simulation model reiterates the importance, for overall farm profitability, of maximising the number of lambs weaned per hectare, particularly through maximising income and diluting the total farm costs. To conclude, the use of high-maternal-genetic-merit animals, regardless of their country of origin impacts farm profitability.

AB  - The composition of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in large-scale livestock farms is complex, which seriously affects the health of livestock and is difficult to evaluate. In order to quickly analyze the pollution degree of VOCs in livestock farms, electronic nose technology was used in this study to detect and analyze the gases in pig and chicken houses, respectively. Firstly, the gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) and electronic nose were used to analyze the VOCs in the pig and chicken houses at different time and locations. The types and relative contents of VOCs were obtained from different livestock farms by GC-MS analysis. The sensor array response of the electronic nose showed similar results. In addition, linear discriminant analysis (LDA), K nearest neighbor (KNN) and support vector machine (SVM) analyses were performed on the electrical signal that was generated by the sensors of electronic nose, respectively. Finally, the classification rate of different odor sources in livestock farms was the highest (>85%), which indicates that SVM is a more effective method suitable for volatile gases recognition in livestock farms. The results have shown that the developed electronic nose sensor is a promising and feasible instrument for characterizing volatile odors in livestock farms.

AB  - eLife digest Memories are stored by distributed groups of neurons in the brain, with individual neurons contributing to multiple memories. In a part of the brain called the neocortex, memories are held in a silent state through a balance between excitatory and inhibitory activity. This is to prevent them from being disrupted by incoming information. When a memory is recalled, an area of the brain called the hippocampus is thought to instruct the neocortex to activate the appropriate neuronal network. But how the hippocampus and neocortex coordinate their activity to switch memories 'on' and 'off' is unclear. The answer may lie in the fact that neurons in the neocortex consist of two broad types: excitatory and inhibitory. Excitatory neurons increase the activity of other neurons. They do this by releasing a chemical called glutamate. Inhibitory neurons reduce the activity of other neurons, by releasing a chemical called GABA. Koolschijn, Shpektor et al. hypothesized that the hippocampus activates memories by changing the balance of excitatory and inhibitory activity in neocortex. To test this idea, Koolschijn, Shpektor et al. invited healthy volunteers to explore a virtual reality environment. The volunteers learned that specific sounds in the environment predicted the appearance of particular visual patterns. The next day, the volunteers returned to the environment and viewed these patterns again. After each pattern, they were invited to open a virtual box. Volunteers learned that some patterns led to money in the virtual box, while other patterns did not. Finally, on day three, the volunteers listened to the sounds from day one again, this time while lying in a brain scanner. The volunteers' task was to infer whether each of the sounds would lead to money. Given that the sounds were never directly paired with the content of the virtual box, the volunteers had to solve the task by recalling the associated visual patterns. As they did so, the brain scanner measured their overall brain activity. It also assessed the relative levels of excitatory and inhibitory activity in visual areas of the neocortex, by measuring glutamate and GABA. The results revealed that as the volunteers recalled the visual cues, activity in both the hippocampus and the visual neocortex increased. Moreover, the ratio of glutamate to GABA in visual neocortex also increased which was predicted by activity in the hippocampus. This suggests that the hippocampus reactivates memories stored in neocortex by temporarily increasing excitatory activity to release memories from inhibitory control. Disturbances in the balance of excitation and inhibition occur in various neuropsychiatric disorders, including schizophrenia, autism, epilepsy and Tourette's syndrome. Damage to the hippocampus is known to cause amnesia. The current findings suggest that memories may become inaccessible - or may be activated inappropriately - when the interaction between the hippocampus and neocortex goes awry. Future studies could test this possibility in clinical populations.
   The brain has a remarkable capacity to acquire and store memories that can later be selectively recalled. These processes are supported by the hippocampus which is thought to index memory recall by reinstating information stored across distributed neocortical circuits. However, the mechanism that supports this interaction remains unclear. Here, in humans, we show that recall of a visual cue from a paired associate is accompanied by a transient increase in the ratio between glutamate and GABA in visual cortex. Moreover, these excitatory-inhibitory fluctuations are predicted by activity in the hippocampus.

AB  - An important advantage to sociality is division of labour, which is often associated with specialization of group members, such as the polymorphic subcastes of ant workers. Given this advantage, it is puzzling that many social groups do not show clear specialization. Among ants, workers of closely related species have one, two or even three polymorphisms. The degree of specialism of asocial animals depends on environmental variability because specialists will perform poorly in some conditions. Here, we use a numeric model to consider whether the magnitude and type of environmental variability can help to explain the diversity of specialism in cooperative groups. By finding the optimal distribution of group members along a single dimension of specialization for two tasks, we predict when groups should be composed of specialists, generalists, both of these (trimodal) or moderate specialists. Generalism is predicted more when environments are unstable and when task importance-rather than demand-varies but depends on the likelihood that the group can complete all tasks in the range of experienced conditions. The benefit of sociality is strongest in invariable environments and there is selection for redundancy in the workforce, which may explain the widely observed inactivity in social insects.This article is part of the theme issue 'Division of labour as key driver of social evolution'.

AB  - Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae is a pathogen that infects pigs and poses a serious threat to the pig industry. The emergence of quinolone-resistant strains of A. pleuropneumoniae further limits the choice of treatment. However, the mechanisms behind quinolone resistance in A. pleuropneumoniae remain unclear. The genomes of a ciprofloxacin-resistant strain, A. pleuropneumoniae SC1810 and its isogenic drug-sensitive counterpart were sequenced and analyzed using various bioinformatics tools, revealing 559 differentially expressed genes. The biological membrane, plasmid-mediated quinolone resistance genes and quinolone resistance-determining region were detected. Upregulated expression of efflux pump genes led to ciprofloxacin resistance. The expression of two porins, OmpP2B and LamB, was significantly downregulated in the mutant. Three nonsynonymous mutations in the mutant strain disrupted the water-metal ion bridge, subsequently reducing the affinity of the quinolone-enzyme complex for metal ions and leading to cross-resistance to multiple quinolones. The mechanism of quinolone resistance in A. pleuropneumoniae may involve inhibition of expression of the outer membrane protein genes ompP2B and lamB to decrease drug influx, overexpression of AcrB in the efflux pump to enhance its drug-pumping ability, and mutation in the quinolone resistance-determining region to weaken the binding of the remaining drugs. These findings will provide new potential targets for treatment.

AB  - Tannery sludge has great potential for use in agriculture, however it is a potentially toxic waste, and it is necessary to establish the ideal dose for each crop. The objective of this study was to evaluate the influence of fertilization with liquid tannery sludge on growth, chlorophyll a fluorescence and gas exchange of Pennisetum purpureum in two production cycles. A 2 x 6 + 1 split plot scheme was used, where the first factor was composed of two productive cycles, the second factor different fertilizations doses: 0, 30, 70, 110, 150, 190 t ha(-1) of liquid tannery sludge and an additional treatment with nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium control. Plant height, number of leaves and tillers, canopy and stem diameter, leaf area, dry matter, chlorophyll index (SPAD), chlorophyll a fluorescence and gas exchange were evaluated. The highest production of total dry matter was observed in the second production cycle. The range between 72-100 t ha(-1) of liquid tannery sludge showed the greatest gains in growth and production of elephant grass. At doses above 150 t ha(-1) of liquid tannery sludge, the photochemical apparatus begins to show possible damage to the photosystem II (PSII) and reductions in gas exchange.

AB  - The coordinated regulation of growth control and metabolic pathways is required to meet the energetic and biosynthetic demands associated with proliferation. Emerging evidence suggests that the Hippo pathway effector Yes-associated protein 1 (YAP) reprograms cellular metabolism to meet the anabolic demands of growth, although the mechanisms involved are poorly understood. Here, we demonstrate that YAP coopts the sterol regulatory element-binding protein (SREBP)-dependent lipogenic program to facilitate proliferation and tissue growth. Mechanistically, YAP stimulates de novo lipogenesis via mechanistic target of rapamcyin (mTOR) complex 1 (mTORC1) signaling and subsequent activation of SREBP. Importantly, YAP-dependent regulation of serum- and glucocorticoid-regulated kinase 1 (SGK1) is required to activate mTORC1/SREBP and stimulate de novo lipogenesis. We also find that the SREBP target genes fatty acid synthase (FASN) and stearoyl-CoA desaturase (SCD) are conditionally required to support YAP-dependent proliferation and tissue growth. These studies reveal that de novo lipogenesis is a metabolic vulnerability that can be targeted to disrupt YAP-dependent proliferation and tissue growth.

AB  - Crude protein (CP) reduction and amino acid (AAs) supplementation is an interesting cost-reducing strategy for environmental compliance. The objective of this work is to study productive performances of heavy Duroc X (Landrace X Large white) male and female pigs during the finishing stage under a 2% CP reduction with crystalline AA supplementation. A total of 60 entire male and 60 female pigs (means +/- standard deviations: 109 +/- 4.9 days of age; 67.9 +/- 7.18 kg of body weight) were distributed in split-sex pens (6 pigs/pen) and fed ad libitum. Two isoenergetic diets were provided (145 and 125 g CP/kg with AA supplementation, control and low-CP) during the final 42 days of finishing period. Growth performance, carcass and meat traits were evaluated. The fixed effects of dietary treatment, sex and their interaction were considered and simple least squares models used. Males were 7.25% heavier (p < 0.001) and had 16% higher average daily gains (p < 0.0001) than females in both treatments with no differences in feed intake or feed conversion ratio (p > 0.05). Nitrogen efficiency was 35% higher in low-CP males. Little difference was found for most carcass and meat traits between treatments. Males had 7-8% higher loin subcutaneous fat thickness in both dietary treatments (p = 0.011). Males and females of the low-CP diet showed higher fat and saturated fat contents than controls (p = 0.020). A 20 g/kg CP reduction with AA supplementation is an efficient strategy during the finishing phase without productivity losses in heavy Duroc sire line genotypes of both sexes.

AB  - Nicotine-exposed animal models exhibit neurobehavioral changes linked to impaired synaptic plasticity. Previous studies highlighted alterations in neurotransmitter levels following nicotine exposure. Vesicular glutamate transporter (VGLUT1) and vesicular gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) transporter (VGAT) are essential for the transport and release of glutamate and GABA, respectively, from presynaptic neurons into synapses. In our work, an e-cigarette device was used to deliver vapor containing nicotine to C57BL/6J mice for four weeks. Novel object recognition, locomotion, and Y-maze tests were performed to investigate the behavioral parameters. Protein studies were conducted to study the hippocampal expression of VGLUT1, VGAT, and postsynaptic density protein 95 (PSD95) as well as brain cytokine markers. Long-term memory and locomotion tests revealed that e-cigarette aerosols containing nicotine modulated recognition memory and motor behaviors. We found that vapor exposure increased VGLUT1 expression and decreased VGAT expression in the hippocampus. No alterations were found in PSD95 expression. We observed that vapor-containing nicotine exposure altered certain brain cytokines such as IFN beta-1 and MCP-5. Our work provides evidence of an association between neurobehavioral changes and altered hippocampal VGLUT1 and VGAT expression in mice exposed to e-cigarette vapors containing nicotine. Such exposure was also associated with altered neurobehaviors, which might affect neurodegenerative diseases.

AB  - We consider the dynamics of a virus spreading through a population that produces a mutant strain with the ability to infect individuals that were infected with the established strain. Temporary cross-immunity is included using a time delay, but is found to be a harmless delay. We provide some sufficient conditions that guarantee local and global asymptotic stability of the disease-free equilibrium and the two boundary equilibria when the two strains outcompete one another. It is shown that, due to the immune evasion of the emerging strain, the reproduction number of the emerging strain must be significantly lower than that of the established strain for the local stability of the established-strain-only boundary equilibrium. To analyze the unique coexistence equilibrium we apply a quasi steady-state argument to reduce the full model to a two-dimensional one that exhibits a global asymptotically stable established-strain-only equilibrium or global asymptotically stable coexistence equilibrium. Our results indicate that the basic reproduction numbers of both strains govern the overall dynamics, but in nontrivial ways due to the inclusion of cross-immunity. The model is applied to study the emergence of the SARS-CoV-2 Delta variant in the presence of the Alpha variant using wastewater surveillance data from the Deer Island Treatment Plant in Massachusetts, USA.

AB  - The use of in vivo models to assess nephrotoxicity has faced ethical limitations. A viable alternative is the ex vivo model that combines the 3 R principles with the preservation of tissue histology. Here, we established a gentamicin nephrotoxicity model using pigs` kidney explants and investigated the effect of phytic acid (IP6) against gentamicin- induced nephrotoxicity. A total of 360 kidney explants were divided into control, gentamicin (10 mM), IP6 (5 mM), and gentamicin+IP6 groups. The activity of gammaglutamyltransferase (GGT), creatinine levels, histological assessment, oxidative stress, and inflammatory cytokine expression were analyzed. Exposure to gentamicin induced an increase in GGT activity, creatinine levels, lesion score, lipoperoxidation and IL-8 expression. Explants exposed to IP6 remained like the control. The addition of IP6 to gentamicin prevented tissue damage, increasing the antioxidant status and gene expression of IL-10. This model proved to be an adequate experimental approach for identifying nephrotoxins and potential products to modulate the toxicity.

AB  - Aerobic composting (AC), anaerobic digestion (AD), and anaerobic manure storage tank (AMST) are conventional systems for treating liquid swine manure (LSM). In this study, life cycle assessment (LCA) was used to evaluate environmental impact in both construction and operation phases to compare AC, AD, and AMST systems. The results were obtained using SimaPro(& REG;) with ReCiPe impact assessment method. The system boundary was from cradle to grave, and the adopted functional unit was 10.0 m(3) of LSM. LCA results showed that steel and cement were the inputs with higher environmental impact in construction phase in AC and AD with average percentages of 74.25 and 24.56%, and 57.17 and 17.30%, respectively. For AMST, high-density polyethylene (HDPE) was more significant with average impact of 83.37%. The comparison between the construction and operation phases of each system individually showed that the construction causes the higher impact in AC and AD, while in AMST was the operation phase. The comparison between the construction phases of the systems showed that AC resulted in higher environmental impacts than in AD and AMST in all impact categories. In relation to operation phase, AMST system causes higher impact compared to AD and AC. Finally, the global comparison of systems showed that the AD with energy use has the better environmental performance. The high use of steel and cement in construction phase and methane production in operation phase have a significant impact on the global life cycle.

AB  - Regulatory elements are essential components of plant genomes that have shaped the domestication and improvement of modern crops. However, their identity, function and diversity remain poorly characterized, limiting our ability to harness their full power for agricultural advances using induced or natural variation. Here we mapped transcription factor (TF) binding for 200 TFs from 30 families in two distinct maize inbred lines historically used in maize breeding. TF binding comparison revealed widespread differences between inbreds, driven largely by structural variation, that correlated with gene expression changes and explained complex quantitative trait loci such as Vgt1, an important determinant of flowering time, and DICE, an herbivore resistance enhancer. CRISPR-Cas9 editing of TF binding regions validated the function and structure of regulatory regions at various loci controlling plant architecture and biotic resistance. Our maize TF binding catalogue identifies functional regulatory regions and enables collective and comparative analysis, highlighting its value for agricultural improvement.

AB  - This study presents primary observations of the natural diet of two endemic fishes, Delminichthys ghetaldii and Telestes dabar, along with an examination of their niche overlap. The feeding habits of these species were analyzed based on a dataset comprising 115 specimens collected from five karst poljes during the year 2018. Statistical analyses, including one-way ANOVA and Tukey's HSD post-hoc testing, were employed to discern significant differences in body size and weight among the five populations of Delminichthys ghetaldii. Numeric indices such as numerical abundance, weight percentage of abundance, and frequency of occurrence, alongside a composite index (IRI - index of relative importance), were applied to elucidate the feeding strategy of these species. The diversity of diet and poljes utilization was assessed using Simpson's diversity index, while predation selectivity was analyzed through the electivity index. Considerable overlap in the diet of Delminichthys ghetaldii was observed among the five poljes, as well as in the overlap between these two species. The findings of this study indicate that Delminichthys ghetaldii exhibits a zoophagous planktivorous diet, i.e. carnivorous, while Telestes dabar demonstrates a phytofagous planktivorous diet, i.e. herbivorous.

AB  - Humans are able to adapt to the fast-changing world by estimating statistical regularities of the environment. Although fear can profoundly impact adaptive behaviors, the computational and neural mechanisms underlying this phenomenon remain elusive. Here, we conducted a behavioral experiment (n = 21) and a functional magnetic resonance imaging experiment (n = 37) with a novel cue-biased adaptation learning task, during which we simultaneously manipulated emotional valence (fearful/neutral expressions of the cue) and environmental volatility (frequent/infrequent reversals of reward probabilities). Across 2 experiments, computational modeling consistently revealed a higher learning rate for the environment with frequent versus infrequent reversals following neutral cues. In contrast, this flexible adjustment was absent in the environment with fearful cues, suggesting a suppressive role of fear in adaptation to environmental volatility. This suppressive effect was underpinned by activity of the ventral striatum, hippocampus, and dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) as well as increased functional connectivity between the dACC and temporal-parietal junction (TPJ) for fear with environmental volatility. Dynamic causal modeling identified that the driving effect was located in the TPJ and was associated with dACC activation, suggesting that the suppression of fear on adaptive behaviors occurs at the early stage of bottom-up processing. These findings provide a neuro-computational account of how fear interferes with adaptation to volatility during dynamic environments.

AB  - Three Lactococcus lactis strains from the nasal microbiota of healthy pigs were identified as candidates for reducing MRSA in pigs. The safety of nasal administration of a cocktail of these strains was examined in new-born piglets. Six days pre-farrowing, twelve sows were assigned to the placebo or cocktail group (n = 6/group). After farrowing, piglets were administered with either 0.5 mL of the placebo or the cocktail to each nostril. Health status and body weight were monitored at regular time points. Two piglets from three sows/treatment group were euthanised at 24 h, 96 h and 14 d after birth, and conchae, lung and tonsil samples were collected for histopathological and gene expression analysis. Health scores were improved in the cocktail group between d1-5. Body weight and daily gains did not differ between groups. Both groups displayed histological indications of euthanasia and inflammation in the lungs, signifying the findings were not treatment related. The expression of pBD2, TLR9 and IL-1 beta in the nasal conchae differed between groups, indicating the cocktail has the potential to modulate immune responses. In summary, the L. lactis cocktail was well tolerated by piglets and there was no negative impact on health scores, growth or lung histopathology indicating that it is safe for administration to new-born piglets.

AB  - The smaller tea tortrix, Adoxophyes honmai Yasuda (Lepidoptera: Tortricidae), is one of the most common pests that affect the tea plant, Camellia sinensis (L.) O. Kuntze. Diacylhydrazine-analog insect growth regulators, such as tebufenozide, have been used as controls; however, the species began showing resistance to this compound in approximately 2004. Previously, we identified an amino acid mutation (A415V) in the ecdysone receptor gene (EcR) as a principal factor in tebufenozide resistance and developed a molecular diagnostic method to detect the EcR A415V mutation through polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP). However, for the continuous management of tebufenozide resistance in A. honmai, a simple and quick genetic diagnostic method that does not require specialized equipment is preferable. In this study, we developed a novel technique to detect the mutation using allele-specific loop-mediated isothermal amplification (AS-LAMP). This method enables the monitoring and detection of tebufenozide-resistance alleles much faster than PCR-RFLP and with moderate accuracy. Therefore, it could be a powerful tool for the early detection of tebufenozide-resistant A. honmai in tea plantations.

AB  - Small-tailed Han sheep, with different FecB genotypes, manifest distinct ovulation rates and fecundities, which are due to differences in reproductive hormones secreted by the hypothalamic-pituitary-ovarian axis. Nevertheless, the function of the hypothalamus against a FecB mutant background on increasing ovulation rate is rarely reported. Therefore, we determined the expression profiles of hypothalamus tissue collected from six wild-type (WW) and six FecB mutant homozygous (BB) ewes at the follicular and luteal phases by whole-transcriptome sequencing. We identified 53 differentially expressed mRNAs (DEGs) and 40 differentially expressed long non-coding RNAs (DELs) between the two estrus states. Functional annotation analysis revealed that one of the DEGs, PRL, was particularly enriched in the hypothalamic function, hormone-related, and reproductive pathways. The lncRNA-target gene interaction networks and KEGG analysis in combination suggest that the lncRNAs LINC-676 and WNT3-AS cis-acting on DRD2 and WNT9B in different phases may induce gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) secretion. Furthermore, there were differences of regulatory elements and WNT gene family members involved in the follicular-luteal transition in the reproductive process between wild-type (WNT7A) and FecB mutant sheep (WNT9B). We combined the DEG and DEL data sets screened from different estrus states and genotypes. The overlap of these two sets was identified to select the mRNAs and lncRNAs that have major effects on ovulation. Among the overlapping molecules, seven DEGs and four DELs were involved in the follicular-luteal transition regulated by FecB mutation. Functional annotation analysis showed that two DEGs (FKBP5 and KITLG) were enriched in melanogenesis, oxytocin, and GnRH secretion. LINC-219386 and IGF2-AS were highly expressed in the BB ewes compared with WW ewes, modulating their target genes (DMXL2 and IGF2) to produce more GnRH during follicular development, which explains why mutated ewes produced more mature follicles. These results from expression profiling of the hypothalamus with the FecB mutation at different estrus states provide new insights into how the hypothalamus regulates ovulation under the effect of the FecB mutation.

AB  - Preventive excavation in the ancient Forum Iulii city (Fre ' jus, southern France) in 2013 revealed a housing block where a very well preserved charred wooden floor was discovered. It was laid in a house dating back to the first half of the 1st century AD and used as the floor of a room decorated with painted plaster. It was destroyed by fire around 70 AD. The ligneous species used for its construction (Aleppo pine, Scots pine, beech and fir) were characterized by anthracological analysis. Numerous traces of xylophagous insects and lignivorous fungi were observed. Their identification, their number and their distribution in the floor open on to very interesting new interpretations for both anthracologists and archaeologists as regards the condition of timber, the original source of the infestation, and the historical record of the building. This study is a direct and unprecedented application of a key for identifying traces of wood-boring insects in charred remains from the Roman period. Field samples were tested during the excavation of Camelin block, and microscope observation protocols were adapted to entomo-archaeology during anthraco-analysis.

AB  - There is a correlation between long-term manganese (Mn) exposure and the Parkinson's-like disease (PD), with depression as an early symptom of PD. However, the direct relationship between Mn exposure and depression, and the mechanisms involved, remain unclear. We found that Mn exposure led to depressive-like behavior and mild cognitive impairment in mice, with Mn primarily accumulating in the cornu ammonis 3 (CA3) area of the hippocampus. Mice displayed a reduction in neuronal dendritic spines and damage to astrocytes specifically in the CA3 area. Spatial metabolomics revealed that Mn downregulated glutamic acid decarboxylase 1 (GAD1) expression in astrocytes, disrupting the Glutamine-Glutamate-gamma-aminobutyric acid (GlnGluGABA) metabolic cycle in the hippocampus, leading to neurotoxicity. We established an in vitro astrocyte Gad1 overexpression (OEX) model and found that the cultured medium from Gad1 OEX astrocytes reversed neuronal synaptic damage and the expression of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) related receptors. Using the astrocyte Gad1 OEX mouse model, results showed that OEX of Gad1 ameliorated depressive-like behavior and cognitive dysfunction in mice. These findings provide new insight into the important role of GAD1 mediated GlnGluGABA metabolism disorder in Mn exposure induced depressive-like behavior. This study offers a novel sight to understanding abnormal emotional states following central nervous system damage induced by Mn exposure.

AB  - Background Sainfoin (Onobrychis viciifolia) and sulla (Hedysarum coronarium) are forage legumes usually preserved to optimize their utilization as feedstuffs. However, the method of preservation modifies the chemical composition differently in both legume species. Secondary compounds (such as proanthocyanidins, fatty acids, carotenoids and tocopherols) present in forages affect the quality of animal products. Therefore, the effect of preservation on the contents of secondary compounds should be investigated. Accoridngly, samples of sainfoin and sulla were directly freeze-dried (fresh), dried at ambient temperature (hay) and vacuum-packaged for 82 days (silage). Results In both legumes, the total fatty acid and C18:3 n-3 contents decreased and C16:0 increased with preservation (P < 0.001), with a greater effect for the hays than for the silages. For both legumes, the lutein, neoxanthin and violaxanthin contents decreased to a greater extent in the silages than in the hays (P < 0.001). Both hays exhibited the lowest beta-carotene concentrations (P < 0.001). The alpha-tocopherol contents decreased in hays, but not in silages, compared to the fresh forages of both legumes (P < 0.001). The antioxidant activities were lower in the silages than in the hays and fresh forages (P < 0.001) and were very strongly related to the contents of polyphenols and proanthocyanidins (P < 0.001). Conclusion Haymaking affected the fatty acid, carotenoid and alpha-tocopherol contents to a greater extent but had a lesser effect on the antioxidant activities than silage-making, which were very strongly related to their contents of polyphenols and proanthocyanidins.

AB  - Monoamine neurotransmitter activity in brain reward, limbic, and motor areas play key roles in the motivation to misuse alcohol and can become modified by exercise in a manner that may affect alcohol craving. This study investigated the influence of daily moderate physical activity on monoamine-related neurochemical concentrations across the mouse brain in response to high volume ethanol ingestion. Adult female C57BL/6J mice were housed with or without 2.5 h of daily access to running wheels for 30 days. On the last 5 days, mice participated in the voluntary binge-like ethanol drinking procedure, "Drinking in the dark" (DID). Mice were sampled immediately following the final episode of DID. Monoamine-related neurochemical concentrations were measured across brain regions comprising reward, limbic, and motor circuits using ultra High-Performance Liquid Chromatography (UHPLC). The results suggest that physical activity status did not influence ethanol ingestion during DID. Moreover, daily running wheel access only mildly influenced alcohol-related norepinephrine concentrations in the hypothalamus and prefrontal cortex, as well as serotonin turnover in the hippocampus. However, access to alcohol during DID eliminated wheel running-related decreases of norepinephrine, serotonin, and 5-HIAA content in the hypothalamus, but also to a lesser extent for norepinephrine in the hippocampus and caudal cortical areas. Finally, alcohol access increased serotonin and dopamine-related neurochemical turnover in the striatum and brainstem areas, regardless of physical activity status. Together, these data provide a relatively thorough assessment of monoamine-related neurochemical levels across the brain in response to voluntary binge-patterned ethanol drinking, but also adds to a growing body of research questioning the utility of moderate physical activity as an intervention to curb alcohol abuse.

AB  - Growing concern regarding animal welfare has increased the need for reliable methods of assessing the animal health status without stress during commercial farm practice. Measuring the body temperature with a thermal imaging camera is one possible stress-free technique since it is non-contact and non-invasive. The first objective of this study was to determine the best anatomical site in healthy pigs for measuring the temperature with a high spatial resolution thermal imaging camera that gives results equivalent or related to the temperatures measured in the rectum. The second objective was the assessment of the possibility to accurately and reliably measure or predict the pigs' temperature with a low spatial resolution thermal imaging camera. Reference temperatures, measured with a calibrated thermometer in the rectum, were compared to the measurements of two calibrated thermal imaging cameras (a low resolution camera and a high resolution camera) on four anatomical sites of pigs (ear canal, eye canthus, outer ear and perianal area). We found that it is not possible to accurately measure or predict the pigs' body temperature with a high noise equivalent temperature difference (NETD), low accuracy, low spatial resolution thermal imaging camera. However, a low NETD, high accuracy, high spatial resolution thermal imaging camera gives at least results that enable prediction (using a linear regression model) of the pigs' body temperature. We showed that there are three anatomical sites in healthy pigs (ear canal, outer ear, perianal area) that are statistically similarly suitable for predicting the body temperature with a calibrated high spatial resolution thermal imaging camera under non diseased thermal neutral conditions.

AB  - TPN672MA, an innovative antipsychotic drug candidate currently in clinical trials, acts as a dopamine D2/D3 receptor partial agonist, serotonin 5-HT1A receptor agonist, and serotonin 5-HT2A receptor antagonist. Preclinical investigations have demonstrated its potential in treating the core symptoms of schizophrenia. The present study highlights TPN672MA's significant antidepressant-like effects in classical behavioral models, such as the chronic social defeat stress paradigm. The pronounced 5-HT1A receptor agonism and D2/D3 receptor partial agonism of TPN672MA likely contribute to its therapeutic effects in depression. Additionally, TPN672MA's antidepressantlike efficacy may be linked to its ability to enhance the expression levels of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and postsynaptic density protein-95 (PSD95) in the hippocampus. Furthermore, TPN672MA displayed a more rapid onset of antidepressant-like action. In conclusion, TPN672MA represents a promising new drug candidate for the treatment of symptoms of schizophrenia and depression.

   The African swine fever (ASF) virus is one of the deadliest viruses plaguing the global swine industry. There are no effective treatments for pigs becoming infected with the ASF virus. Eliminating infected pigs is the only effective method to tackle an outbreak. Whole farm biosecurity is therefore critical to prevent the virus from entering in the first place. In recent years, feed and feed ingredients have been identified as potential vectors of viral diseases including ASF. The objective of this research was to simulate contamination of feed by ASF virus in a laboratory setting and use this simulation to test the efficacy of some select feed additives for reducing the amount and viability of this virus in feed. The main result shows that the inoculated virus in feed disappeared in a shorter time when the feed had been treated with the compounds. We conclude that these feed additives could be adopted as part of a comprehensive biosecurity system for pig holdings. Pigs might be protected from feed possibly contaminated by this virus, and the pork supply will thus be less likely to be impacted by this viral disease.
   African swine fever virus is one of the most highly contagious and lethal viruses for the global swine industry. Strengthening biosecurity is the only effective measure for preventing the spread of this viral disease. The virus can be transmitted through contaminated feedstuffs and, therefore, research has been conducted to explore corresponding mitigating measures. The purpose of the current study was to test a combination of pure benzoic acid and a blend of nature identical flavorings for their ability to reduce African swine fever viral survival in feed. This virus was inoculated to feed with or without the supplementation of the test compounds, and the viral presence and load were measured by a hemadsorption test and quantitative real time polymerase chain reaction. The main finding was that the combination of pure benzoic acid and nature identical flavorings could expedite the reduction in both viral load and survival in a swine feed. Therefore, this solution could be adopted as a preventive measure for mitigating the risk of contaminated feed by African swine fever virus.

AB  - The study aims to determine the effect of supplementation with a mixture of Curcuma longa and Rosmarinus officinalis extracts (896:19 ratio) on the expression of 15 cytokine genes in the livers of 20 castrated goat bucks. Two equal groups were created: treated and control groups. The treated group was provided a mixture (1.6 g/day/buck) for 124 days. Liver tissue samples were collected after slaughter. The gene expression was analyzed using RT-qPCR with two reference genes. Variance analysis was conducted using a model with the group fixed effect. IL-2 and IL-8 expression was below the detection level. No differences were found for IL-1 alpha, IL-1 beta, IL-4, IL-6, IL-10, IL-16, IFN-alpha, IFN-beta, TNF-alpha, and CCL4 expressions, suggesting that supplementation does not activate cytokine production in the healthy hepatocytes. The treated group demonstrated lower IL-12 expression (p < 0.05) and a tendency for higher IL-18 and INF-gamma (0.05 < p < 0.10) expressions, which may indicate a hypersensitivity resulting from excessive supplement dose. The increased IFN-gamma expression could be caused by the increased IL-18 expression. If a small dose of extract can induce an allergic reaction in young goat bucks, it is also possible that humans may be susceptible to an overdose of curcumin and/or turmeric extracts.

AB  - Iron overload has been shown to have deleterious effects in the brain through the formation of reactive oxygen species, which ultimately may contribute to neurodegenerative disorders. Accordingly, rodent studies have indicated that systemic administration of iron produces excess iron in the brain and results in behavioral and cognitive deficits. To what extent cognitive abilities are affected and which neurobiological mechanisms underlie those deficits remain to be more fully characterized. In the present study, we looked at the effects of a 30 mg/kg iron sub-chronic treatment on cognitive abilities in two hippocampal-dependent spatial tasks (place navigation, spatial/non-spatial object recognition), in relation with iron content and oxidative stress biomarkers (MDA, SOD, CAT) in the cerebellum, hippocampus, prefrontal cortex and striatum, four brain areas known to be involved in the processing of spatial information. Iron-treated rats were impaired in acquisition and retention of the platform location in the navigation task and in the spatial/non-spatial object recognition task. Iron content and MDA were found to be increased in the four brain regions of interest, but activity of the antioxidant enzymes was not modified. The results indicate that the ability of rats to process spatial information whether in place navigation or spontaneous object spatial/non-spatial recognition is disrupted following a 30 mg/kg sub-chronic treatment. The deficits are hypothesized to result from iron excess-induced oxidative stress in the network of brain areas involved in the processing of spatial information.

AB  - Ethnopharmacology relevance In Mexico, Agastache mexicana subsp. mexicana (PT) and subsp. xolocotziana (WT), and Dracocephalum moldavica (BT), are used together as the "three toronjiles" to treat gastrointestinal spasms. Aim of study To evaluate if the spasmolytic activity of these three medicinal species is better in combination or in an individual manner. Materials and methods Spasmolytic effect of PT, WT and BT alone or combinate were evaluated in rings of the guinea-pig ileum contracted with potassium chloride (KCl), electrical field stimulation (EFS), or acetylcholine (ACh). Chemical analysis by thin layer and ultra-high pressure liquid chromatography of the aqueous extracts of each species were done for their comparison, and their acute toxicity were determined in mice. Results PT and WT diminished in a dose-dependent manner the contractions induced by KCl, EFS, and ACh. Whereas BT did not altered contractions in any experimental protocol. A combination of the PT (EC50) and WT (EC50) diminished the contractions induced by KCl or EFS. Interestingly, the addition of BT extract (10 mu g/ml) to the combination (PT (EC30) + WT (EC30)) blocked the inhibitory effect produced on the contracted tissue in the presence of KCl, EFS, or ACh. Moreover, addition of BT extract (100 mu g/ml) to the same combination blocked the inhibitory effect on the pre-contracted tissue only in the presence of EFS. None of the aqueous extracts produced toxicity in its individual administration in mice. Chemical analysis demonstrated similarities between PT and WT, but differences with BT. Conclusions The results of this study confirmed that either combined or by themselves aqueous extracts of PT and WT produced a spasmolytic action on guinea pig ileum, suggesting that this combination of medicinal plants could relieve gastrointestinal diseases in human, but when BT aqueous extract is added to those obtained with PT and WT, the spasmolytic activity diminished or even was blocked. Our results give evidence that mixture of several plants might produce disadvantages in the medicinal properties of their individual activity.

AB  - For ships voyaging in severe sea condition, cyclic extreme hogging and sagging bending moments would cause longitudinally alternative tensile and compressive stress on deck and bottom structures. These extreme cyclic inplane stress may induce the increasingly structural accumulative plasticity, which could reduce the ultimate strength of stiffened panels. Both quasi-static experimental design and numerical methods simulate various loading scenarios to investigate the plastic accumulation effects, which include longitudinal monotonic and cyclic loading with different amplitudes of displacement loads. The influences of load types, loading sequence and load selection were discussed under stochastic extreme wave conditions, which aims to summarize the appropriate and efficient prediction approaches of ultimate strength for design proposal. After suffering unpredictable cyclic extreme loads, releasing the structural accumulative plastic stress is also recommended to obviously decelerating the tensile and compressive ultimate strength attenuation for improving the navigation safety.

AB  - We examined the response of Eurasian watermilfoil (Myriophyllum spicatum) coverage on Manistee Lake, Michigan (U.S.A.) in the presence of milfoil weevils (Euhrychiopsis lecontei). Among 150 sites, milfoil presence declined from 2008 levels of 34 (23%) sites to 2 (1%) sites by 2015 coincident with cumulative stocking of 259,500 weevils from 2007 to 2014. Severe winter temperatures also were associated with milfoil declines. Each 1 degrees C decline in average low temperature during the preceding winter was associated with 3.4 (95% CI 0.8-6.1) fewer sites with milfoil. Impacts of weevil herbivory on watermilfoil may be accentuated by severe winter temperatures. Lake managers should, when possible, integrate weather conditions with weevil stocking regimes to control Eurasian watermilfoil.

AB  - Carabids beetles are considered important biocontrol agents of weeds, but predicting levels of weed seed con-sumption and regulation is difficult. Olfactory cues from predators or potential competitors alter the selection and consumption of particular food resources by foraging individuals. Whether this leads to changes in con-sumption levels or simply to changes in the rate at which consumption takes place over time is not yet known. Identifying and understanding the factors that drive the seed foraging behaviour of carabid beetles, in the context of interspecific interaction, is essential for predicting consumption levels in different carabid communities and hence improve the ecosystem service of weed regulation by carabid beetles.We tested the response of 119 Harpalus affinis individuals foraging for Viola arvensis or Taraxacum officinale seeds, to encounters with individuals of another carabid species, Pterostichus melanarius. Their foraging behaviour (i.e. total consumption, latency to first seed acceptance and position in the arena) was recorded for 72 h and the consumption rates were reported in detail for the first 7 h of the experiment for all treatments.Even though the total number of seeds consumed after 24 h did not differ, the dynamic of seed consumption by H. affinis changed significantly in the presence of P. melanarius. The attraction of individuals to the seeds diminished over time, indicating a probable state of satiety being reached. This suggests that looking at the total number of seeds consumed after a long period of time may be misleading and that a greater focus on of the temporal dynamics of consumption is needed if we are to understand carabids interest in specific weed species in a specific foraging context. We found that only females seemed to react to the presence of P. melanarius in-dividuals, indicating that the perception of the level of risk may be sex-specific in carabid beetles.

AB  - Extensive literature has reported a link between social stress and mental health. In this complex relationship, individual strategies for coping with social stress are thought to have a possible modulating effect, with socia-bility being a key factor. Despite the higher incidence of affective disorders in females and sex-related neuro-chemical differences, female populations have been understudied. The aim of the present study was, therefore, to analyze the behavioral, neuroendocrine, and neurochemical effects of stress in female OF1 mice, paying special attention to social connectedness (female mice with high vs low sociability). To this end, subjects were exposed to the Chronic Social Instability Stress (CSIS) model for four weeks. Although female mice exposed to CSIS had increased arousal, there was no evidence of depressive-like behavior. Neither did exposure to CSIS affect corticosterone levels, although it did increase the MR/GR ratio by decreasing GR expression. Female mice exposed to CSIS had higher noradrenaline and dopamine levels in the hippocampus and striatum respectively, with a lower monoaminergic turnover, resulting in an increased arousal. CSIS increased serotonin levels in both the hippocampus and striatum. Similarly, CSIS was found to reduce kynurenic acid, 3-HK, and IDO and iNOS enzyme levels in the hippocampus. Interestingly, the observed decrease in IDO synthesis and the increased se-rotonin and dopamine levels in the striatum were only found in subjects with high sociability. These highly sociable female mice also had significantly lower levels of noradrenaline in the striatum after CSIS application. Overall, our model has produced neuroendocrine and neurochemical but not behavioral changes, so it has not allowed us to study sociability in depth. Therefore, a model that induces both molecular and behavioral phe-notypes should be applied to determine the role of sociability.

AB  - Introduction: Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a malignant proliferative disease affecting the bone marrow hematopoietic system and has a poor long-term outcome. Exploring genes that affect the malignant proliferation of AML cells can facilitate the accurate diagnosis and treatment of AML. Studies have confirmed that circular RNA (circRNA) is positively correlated with its linear gene expression. Therefore, by exploring the effect of SH3BGRL3 on the malignant proliferation of leukemia, we further studied the role of circRNA produced by its exon cyclization in the occurrence and development of tumors.Methods: Genes with protein-coding function obtained from the TCGA database. we detected the expression of SH3BGRL3 and circRNA_0010984 by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). We synthesized plasmid vectors and carried out cell experiments, including cell proliferation, cell cycle and cell differentiation by cell transfection. We also studied the transfection plasmid vector (PLVX-SHRNA2-PURO) combined with a drug (daunorubicin) to observe the therapeutic effect. The miR-375 binding site of circRNA_0010984 was queried using the circinteractome databases, and the relationship was validated by RNA immunoprecipitation and Dual-luciferase reporter assay. Finally, a protein-protein interaction network was constructed with a STRING database. GO and KEGG functional enrichment identified mRNA-related functions and signaling pathways regulated by miR-375.Results: We identified the related gene SH3BGRL3 in AML and explored the circRNA_0010984 produced by its cyclization. It has a certain effect on the disease progression. In addition, we verified the function of circRNA_0010984. We found that circSH3BGRL3 knockdown specifically inhibited the proliferation of AML cell lines and blocked the cell cycle. We then discussed the related molecular biological mechanisms. CircSH3BGRL3 acts as an endogenous sponge for miR-375 to isolate miR-375 and inhibits its activity, increases the expression of its target YAP1, and ultimately activates the Hippo signaling pathway involved in malignant tumor proliferation.Discussion: We found that SH3BGRL3 and circRNA_0010984 are important to AML. circRNA_0010984 was significantly up-regulated in AML and promoted cell proliferation by regulating miR-375 through molecular sponge action.

AB  - Introduction Mid-gestation is a critical period for the development of the nervous system. Exposure to exogenous harmful chemicals during this period may lead to longterm neurological developmental abnormalities in offspring. Benzo[a]pyrene (B[a]P) is a commonly occurring neurotoxic environmental pollutant that can pass through the placental barrier and blood-brain barrier (BBB), thereby affecting placental nerve development.Methods To investigate the neurotoxic mechanism of B[a]P on offspring exposed in mid-gestation, pregnant rats were exposed to B[a]P (25 mg/kg) from gestation days 8 to 14. Meanwhile, as an agonist of Wnt/beta-catenin signaling pathway, lithium chloride (LiCl) was administered to observe the intervention effects.Results The results showed that in rats exposed to B[a]P in mid-gestation, the developmental nodes of the offspring were delayed, and the neurosensory sensitivity of the offspring was reduced. These offspring also had cognitive impairments in adulthood. Subsequent morphological and protein experiments showed that the exposed offspring had reduced neuronal complexity in the CA1 region of the hippocampus, decreased beta-catenin expression, and increased GSK-3 beta expression in the hippocampal tissue. However, all these indexes can be reversed by LiCl.Discussion These results suggest that B[a]P exposed in mid-gestation pregnancy may lead to neurological damage in the offspring by downregulating the Wnt/beta-catenin signaling pathway.

AB  - Extrafloral nectar production can vary depending on the structure of the plant in which it is found, as well as environmental conditions. This can in turn influence plant-ant interactions. We evaluated the role of extrafloral nectaries of Canavalia rosea as ant attractants in a coastal zone of the Gulf of Mexico. We compared the productivity of the extrafloral nectaries present on leaves and inflorescences, as well as between day and night, and described the associated ant community. Nectar volume and concentration were higher in inflorescences than in leaves, and the rate of ant visitation was higher in inflorescences during the day. These results suggest congruence with the Optimal Defense Hypothesis. Nectar volume was generally greater during the night in both structures, but sugar concentration did not differ between day and night. We found a turnover in the ant species visiting C. rosea, with S. geminata being the most abundant species. The extrafloral nectar of C. rosea attracts several ant species and probably other arthropods, providing a valuable resource in a stressful system.

AB  - When fetuses are exposed to abnormally high levels of glucocorticoids in utero, irreversible damage to neuronal synaptogenesis occurs, leading to long-term cognitive and emotional behavioral abnormalities after birth. In this study, we investigated how maternal exposure to a novel environmental pollutant-synthetic glucocorticoid dexamethasone-affects offspring cognitive and emotional behaviors enduringly. We noted that offspring subjected to maternal dexamethasone exposure (MDE) displayed cognitive and emotional neurobehavioral deficits beginning in infancy, and these impairments persisted into adulthood. The principal mechanism involves MDEinduced damage to hippocampal neuronal synapse formation in the offspring, primarily due to a cholesterol deficiency which destabilizes neuronal membranes, thereby affecting normal synapse formation and ultimately leading to cognitive and emotional deficiencies. Specifically, we demonstrated abnormal activation of glucocorticoid receptors in hippocampal astroglial cells of MDE offspring, which triggers changes in the miR-450a-3p/ HAT1/ABCG1 signaling axis, causing impaired cholesterol efflux in astroglial cells and insufficient cholesterol supply to neurons, further impairing synaptogenesis. This research not only underscores the significant impact of prenatal environmental pollutants on long-term health outcomes in offspring but also broadens our understanding of how prenatal exposure to glucocorticoids affects brain development in the progeny, providing new insights for interventions in neurodevelopmental and psychiatric disorders of fetal origin.

AB  - This study is aimed at presenting a new biological technique to enrich rice straw via the cultivation of Musca domestica (MD) and at evaluating the outcome of this technique using in vitro and in vivo studies. Rice straw was treated using molasses and water at 17.5: 0.375: 7.0 (w/v/v), respectively. The mixture was left in an open shaded area for 11 successive days to allow MD to lay eggs and produce larvae. During this time, the recorded temperature was 35.6 +/- 2.2 degrees C and the humidity was 49 +/- 5.7%. Rice straw treated with 4% urea (URS) and untreated rice straw (RS) were used for comparison with in vitro and in vivo MD maggot rice straw (MRS). The crude protein (CP) and ether extract (EE) contents gradually increased during the first 8 days, and then began to gradually decrease until the 11th day. In vitro studies were performed on RS, MRS and URS as a single substrate. Instead, in the in vivo studies, experimental RS was offered ad libitum to sheep, and a concentrate feed mixture was provided as pellets to cover the maintenance requirements. The volume of produced gas and the in vitro degradability of the organic matter (OM), ash-free neutral detergent fibre, and CP (P< 0.05) increased with the fermentation of the mg of MRS, compared to URS, which in turn was (P< 0.05) higher than that of RS incubation. The consumed MRS was significantly (P< 0.05) higher than the consumed URS. At the same time, the URS consumption was highly (P< 0.05) significant, compared to the RS consumption. The eating, ruminating and chewing time (min/head/d) was significantly (P< 0.05) higher when RS was consumed, compared to URS and MRS. Eating a diet including MRS led to higher (P< 0.05) dry matter, OM, CP, EE, neutral detergent fibre, and acid detergent fibre digestibility, than the diet containing URS, which was significantly (P<0.05) superior to the diet containing RS. The total digestible nutrients (TDN) and digestible crude protein values of the MRS-containing diet improved (P< 0.05) more than that of URS, which was significantly (P< 0.05) higher than RS. In short, the results indicate that MD maggots could be produced on rice straw to elevate the protein content and nutritional value of feeds. Moreover, this technique improved the feed consumption and digestion coefficients more than the treated and untreated rice straw.

AB  - Canola expeller (CE) contains similar to 200 g/kg residual oil, but also fiber that impairs nutrient digestibility in weaned pigs. To study if feed enzymes increase digestibility, six diets containing either the basal or two CE samples mixed in at 250 g/kg (CE-A or CE-B) were formulated with or without a multi-enzyme blend containing cellulase, xylanase, glucanase, amylase, protease, invertase, and pectinase. The basal diet containing 620 g/kg wheat and 150 g/kg barley served as control. Twelve ileal-cannulated barrows (9-15 kg) were fed the six diets in a replicated 6 (pigs) x 3 (periods) Youden square. Ileal digestibility of gross energy and amino acids was 5% greater for basal than CE diets without differences between CE samples. Diet energy values were 4% greater for CE than basal diets due to residual oil in CE. Inclusion of the multi-enzyme blend increased total tract digestibility of energy of the basal but not CE diets by 2%. Net energy value was greater for CE-A than CE-B because CE-A contained more residual oil. In conclusion, feeding 250 g/kg CE increased diet energy values; thus, CE can substitute added fat in weaned pig diets. Feeding the multi-enzyme blend increased the energy digestibility of wheat and barley-based diets fed to weaned pigs. However, research is needed to identify enzyme combinations that increase the nutrient digestibility of CE.

AB  - Urinary tract infections influence the mortality rate in pigs and are linked to extensive antibiotic usage in the farm industry. Filipendula ulmaria (L.) Maxim. and Orthosiphon aristatus (Blume) Miq. are widespread medicinal plants traditionally used to treat urinary tract disorders. As their preparations are orally administered, the metabolism of their constituents by gut microbiota before absorption should be considered. Until now, no experiments had been performed to describe the biotransformation of tthose plants extracts by animal gut microbiota. The study evaluates the influence of pig intestinal microbiota on the structure of active compounds in flowers of F. ulmaria and leaves of O. aristatus . The incubations of the extracts with piglet gut microbiota were performed in anaerobic conditions, and the samples of the batch culture were collected for 24h. In F. ulmaria , the main metabolites were quercetin and kaempferol, which were products of the deglycosylation of flavonoids. After 24h incubation of O. aristatus extract with the piglet gut microbiota, 2 main metabolites were observed. One, tentatively identified as 3-(3-dihydroxyphenyl)propionic acid, is likely the primary metabolite of the most abundant depsides and phenolic acids. The results confirm the formation of the compounds with anti-inflammatory and diuretic activity in the microbiota cultures, which might suggest F. ulmaria and O. aristatus for treating urinary tract disorders in piglets. Based on the similarities of human and pig gut microbiota, the pig model can help estimate the metabolic pathways of natural products in humans.

AB  - This study used oregano essential oil (EO), cobalt (Co) and synergistic of both of them additives instead of antibiotics to explore the effects of different additives on the corn silage fibre structure degradation, nutrient degradation rate and rumen fermentation characteristics of sheep. The additives used in the study as a product were provided by Ralco, Inc., USA. The Latin square experimental design was adopted with 5 treatments. The following treatments were fed through the rumen fistula: carrier (Car), carrier + EO, carrier + Co, carrier + EO + cobalt (EOC) and no additives as the control (CON). These treatments were fed to five sheep for five rounds at a dose of 80 mg/kg. At 48 h of degradation, the area of degraded corn leaf and husk reached 100%, SEM results showed that except for Car and CON treatment, there were obvious destroyed fibre structure differences under EO, Co and EOC treatment, showing total disappearance of leaf epidermal cells, palisade tissue and spongy tissue, especially under EOC. Under EOC treatment, DMD48 h, CPD48 h, NDFD48 h and ADFD(48 h) increased by 3.33%, 3.89%, 7.64% and 5.67%, respectively, compared with CON, while NDFD48 h and ADFD(48 h) increased by 4.70% and 6.05% under Co (p > 0.05). The NH3-N concentration in rumen fluid decreased by 19.36%, 27.20% and 19.48%, while the microbial protein (MCP) content increased by 6.32%, 4.29% and 5.97% (p > 0.05) under EO, Co and EOC treatments compared with CON at 48 h (p < 0.05). The total VFA concentration under EO, Co and EOC treatment was lower than CON at 6 and 48 h (p = 0.016, p = 0.022) and the propionate and acetate concentrations were higher under EOC treatment than CON at 48 h (p > 0.05). Feeding EOC increased the fibre structure degradation and nutrient degradation rate of corn silage and improved rumen fermentation in sheep, resulting in better effects than feeding EO or Co alone.

AB  - The efficient mass-rearing systems of Aedes mosquitoes is a critical step for physiological study and for the development of novel control methods. Various species of mosquito had been widely maintained by an artificial feeding system, which needs to be optimized for mass rearing in the laboratory. For optimization of Aedes albopictus mass rearing, the effect of differences in blood meal and time-of-day for blood feeding on mosquito fitness was examined by comparing blood feeding rate, the number of eggs laid, egg hatching rate, and the period of time for development. Heparin or EDTA-treated whole blood (horse, swine, and bovine) and defibrinated blood (horse and sheep) were provided to the Asian tiger mosquito at either 8:00 or 18:00. Heparinized ATP swine blood-fed females laid significantly larger number of eggs than those of horse/bovine blood-fed females at 18:00. While heparinized ATP-free bovine blood-fed females laid the largest number of eggs, although it was not significantly different in morning feeders. The hatching rate was not significantly different among progeny. Offspring from females fed blood meal at 18:00 showed a significantly shorter period of time for development when compared to those of females fed blood meal at 08:00. Interestingly, the rate of blood feeding was not significantly different between ATP-free animal blood and ATP animal blood. Taken together, we suggest that mass rearing of A. albopictus should consider time-of-day for feeding and selection of animal blood.

AB  - The Western corn rootworm (WCR; Diabrotica virgifera virgifera) is an economically important belowground pest of maize. Belowground feeding by WCR is damaging because it weakens the roots system, diminishes nutrient uptake, and creates entry points for fungal and bacterial pathogens and increases lodging, all of which can significantly suppress maize yields. Previously, it was demonstrated that belowground herbivory can trigger plant defense responses in the roots and the shoots, thereby impacting intraplant communication. Although several aspects of maize-WCR interactions have been reported, co-transcriptomic remodeling in the plant and insect are yet to be explored. We used a maize genotype, Mp708, that is resistant to a large guild of herbivore pests to study the underlying plant defense signaling network between below and aboveground tissues. We also evaluated WCR compensatory transcriptome responses. Using RNA-seq, we profiled the transcriptome of roots and leaves that interacted with WCR infestation up to 5 days post infestation (dpi). Our results suggest that Mp708 shoots and roots had elevated constitutive and WCR-feeding induced expression of genes related to jasmonic acid and ethylene pathways, respectively, before and after WCR feeding for 1 and 5 days. Similarly, extended feeding by WCR for 5 days in Mp708 roots suppressed many genes involved in the benzoxazinoid pathway, which is a major group of indole-derived secondary metabolites that provides resistance to several insect pests in maize. Furthermore, extended feeding by WCR on Mp708 roots revealed several genes that were downregulated in WCR, which include genes related to proteolysis, neuropeptide signaling pathway, defense response, drug catabolic process, and hormone metabolic process. These findings indicate a dynamic transcriptomic dialog between WCR and WCR-infested maize plants.

AB  - In many species that fight over resources, individuals use specialized structures to gain a mechanical advantage over their rivals during contests (i.e. weapons). Although weapons are widespread across animals, how they affect the probability of winning contests is still debated. According to theory, understanding weapon function during contests is essential to: (i) understanding its importance in determining the winner, and (ii) identifying what weapon traits (e.g. weapon length versus shape versus performance) are most relevant for contest success. However, quantitative evaluations of how weapon function affects the extent to which weapon traits influence contest success are still lacking. Here, we first develop an individual-based model to evaluate how increasing the influence of the weapon in determining the winner translates to differences between winners and losers. Then, we use a meta-analysis to identify: (z) whether different weapon measures influence contest outcome differently; (ii) how animals use their weapons during fights - i.e. weapon function; and (iii) if weapon function correlates to how weapons influence contest outcome. Our model showed that, as weapons increased the chance of determining the winner, the mean difference between winners and losers also increased. Therefore, in our meta-analysis we used the mean trait difference between winners and losers as a proxy for the extent to which weapons influence contest success. The literature search identified 49 suitable studies, containing information for 52 species, totalling 107 effect sizes. Four main patterns emerged. First, most of the literature focuses on linear measures of weapons, while performance measures are concentrated on Crustacea and Squamata; other types of measures were rare. Second, differences between winners and losers in linear measurements were greater than differences in performance measurements when all species were combined (and when we used only a subset). Third, species that bear weapons almost always perform visual/tactile displays before engaging in physical contact. And fourth, while the way individuals display their weapons did not influence the importance of weapon size on contest outcomes, fighting style predicted when differences between winners and losers would be higher. Species that used their weapons to push or lift (even when combined with other functions) showed greater differences between winners and losers when compared to species that used their weapons to impact, pierce, pull or squeeze. Overall, our results show that we have an incomplete understanding of animal weapons built mostly on weapon size and a few select taxa. Thus, we should start focusing on measuring weapons according to how they are used during contests and in a wider diversity of species. One way forward is to conduct studies that integrate weapon morphology to weapon function to ensure we are measuring the most ecologically relevant variables.

AB  - Key messageSimulated animal feeding alters endogenous phytohormone levels and gene expression within related metabolic pathways, thereby regulating the growth, development, and defense mechanisms of Leymus chinensis.AbstractLeymus chinensis (Trin.) Tzvel. is a vital forage species in grassland animal husbandry, serving as the primary food source for grazing herbivores. Unraveling the mechanisms underlying herbage responses to grazing enhances our understanding of plant-animal interactions and their coevolution. In this study, we simulated grazing by applying animal saliva to L. chinensis post-clipping and conducted transcriptomic and phytohormonal analyses. Our findings revealed that differentially expressed genes (DEGs) responding to clipping but reverting to control levels after saliva treatment were enriched in a limited number of metabolic pathways. In contrast, DEGs specifically responsive to animal saliva were significantly enriched in numerous pathways related to plant growth, development, and defense. Quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) validated the expression patterns of representative DEGs, confirming the reliability of the transcriptome-based analyses. Five classes of DEGs were annotated in the plant hormone signal transduction pathway, including Auxin (IAA), Abscisic acid (ABA), Salicylic acid (SA), Cytokinin (CTK), and Jasmonic acid (JA). Phytohormone quantification revealed significant changes in hormone levels upon saliva treatment, peaking at 6 h post-treatment, which may account for the surge in DEGs observed at this time point. These results deepen our understanding of how animal saliva influences the growth and defense of L. chinensis and may inform more effective grassland management practices.

AB  - The mother-young contact during suckling influences the development of the offspring and their stress-coping abilities. Progressive weaning reduces the stress response in lambs as the separation time increases gradually until permanent maternal deprivation. The aim of this study was to determine if repeated maternal deprivation in suckling lambs alters their behavioural, physiological and immunological responses to social isolation after weaning. Twenty-four Saint Croix single born-lambs remained with their mothers for their first 29 days of age. Thereafter, 12 lambs were temporarily separated from their mothers every day for 4 weeks, during 4 h/d the first week, increasing 4 h weekly until they were separated 16 h/day (progressive weaning group: PW). During the progressive separation, PW lambs were moved to an enclosed pen, where they did not have visual or olfactive communication with their mothers. The other 12 lambs remained in permanent contact with their mothers until the definitive separation of both groups at 61 days old (abrupt weaning group: AW). At day 90 of age, all lambs were individually isolated for 10 min in a novel place, alternating one lamb from each group. Lambs' behaviour was video recorded during the test. Cortisol concentration and haematological measurements were determined before and after the test. The PW lambs crossed more lines (P = 0.007), attempted to escape more times (P = 0.009), displayed more freezing behaviour (P = 0.01) and tended to vocalise more than AW lambs (P = 0.054). The AW lambs tended to sniff more times (P = 0.09) than the PW lambs. Cortisol concentration and the percentage of monocytes were lower in PW than in AW lambs (P & LE; 0.04). In conclusion, lambs repeatedly deprived of their mother displayed a more intensive behavioural response to social isolation one month after the definitive separation from their mothers. Progressive weaning reduced the cortisol concentration and the percentage of monocytes. These results call attention to the importance of further studies being undertaken in reference to the short and long-term effects of different procedures applied in order to better improve mother and the lamb welfare before artificial weaning.

AB  - Divaricate plant species account for more than 10% of New Zealand/Aotearoa's woody flora, a higher proportion for that life form than anywhere else on earth. Two main hypotheses have been proposed to account for the prevalence of this phenotype. The first suggests herbivorous birds, particularly large flightless moa, exerted selective pressure on many plants to adopt the form. The second proposes climate as the main driver since insular New Zealand has many exposed habitats and, historically, experienced stressing conditions during the Pleistocene. Our study investigated two questions to shed further light on the evolution of divaricates, in particular related to the potential influence of browsing by large avian herbivores. First, divaricate plants have been posited to have a higher tensile strength than non-divaricates as a defence mechanism against moa browsing. We tested the great majority of New Zealand plant genera within which divaricates occur, contrasting the stem tensile strength of these plants against their closest non-divaricate counterparts using accurate testing technology. The results indicate divaricate species have tensile strength that approaches twice that of non-divaricates across a broad and disparate phylogenetic range that includes gymnosperms and many clades of angiosperms. Second, we tested the species level distributions of widely dispersed woody plant genera across the New Zealand archipelago on islands where moa had been present or always absent. We found that no endemic divaricate species occurred on any islands from which moa had been permanently absent. In contrast, their non-divaricate counterparts were commonly endemic to those same islands.

AB  - Ethylene is very important in the process of plant development and regulates the biosynthesis of many secondary metabolites. In these regulatory mechanisms, transcription factors (TFs) that mediate ethylene signals play a very important role. Capsaicinoids (CAPs) are only synthesized and accumulated in Capsicum species, causing their fruit to have a special pungent taste, which can protect against attack from herbivores and pathogens. In this study, we identified the TF CcERF2, which is induced by ethylene, and demonstrated its regulatory effect on CAPs biosynthesis. Transcriptome sequencing analysis revealed that the expression patterns of CcERF2 and multiple genes associated with CAPs biosynthesis were basically the same. The spatiotemporal expression results showed CcERF2 was preferentially expressed in the placenta of the spicy fruit. Ethylene can induce the expression of CcERF2 and CAPs biosynthesis genes (CBGs). CcERF2 gene silencing and 1-methylcyclopropene (1-MCP) and pyrazinamide (PZA) treatments caused a decrease in expression of CBGs and a sharp decrease in content of CAPs. The results indicated that CcERF2 was indeed involved in the regulation of structural genes of the CAPs biosynthetic pathway.

AB  - Floral scent influences the recruitment, learning, and behaviour of floral visitors. Variation in floral scent can provide information on the amount of reward available or whether a flower has been visited recently and may be particularly important in species with visually concealed rewards. In many buzz-pollinated flowers, tubular anthers opening via small apical pores (poricidal anthers) visually conceal pollen and appear similar regardless of pollen quantity within the anther. We investigated whether pollen removal changes floral scent composition and emission rate in seven taxa of buzz-pollinated Solanum (Solanaceae). We found that pollen removal reduced both the overall emission of floral scent and the emission of specific compounds (linalool and farnesol) in S. lumholtzianum. Our findings suggest that in six out of seven buzz-pollinated taxa studied here, floral scent could not be used as a signal by visitors as it does not contain information on pollen availability.

AB  - Sustainable solutions aiming at limiting Reynoutria japonica invasion consist of frequent removal of its aerial biomass. The aims of this study were to measure the accumulation of metallic trace elements (MTE) in R. japonica, and to assess the eco-toxicological risk related to the valorization of the produced biomass. R. japonica fragmented rhizomes were regenerated in pots for 41 days on a control soil (CTL) or a moderately MTE-contaminated soil (POL, 3.6 mg Cd kg(-1) DM). Growth traits were recorded, as well as MTE bioconcentration (BCF) and translocation factors (TF) from soil to plant organs. Whatever the MTE and plant organs, BCF remained below one (mean Cd-BCF for stem and leaf: 0.07 and 0.29 for CTL and POL, respectively), conversely to TF (until 2.2 for Cd and Ni in POL soil). When grown on the POL soil, R. japonica stem and leaf Cd content was close to the EU maximum regulatory limit for organic amendments or animal feed. Model simulations suggested that liver and kidney Cd concentrations would exceed the regulatory limit in food when adult cattle or sheep constantly ingest R. japonica grown on the POL soil over 200 to 800 days. The results of the present study will be useful to help managers in selecting efficient and safe solutions for the control of R. japonica invasion.

AB  - Insectivorous bats play an essential role in suppressing pests and controlling disease vectors, yet their dietary habits remain understudied in Nepal. Thus far, there have been three theses and a single study on insectivorous bat diets from the country. To address this gap, guano samples collected during bat surveys from March 2020 to March 2023 in four regions: Shivapuri Nagarjun Bajrabarahi Forest (Lalitpur District), were analyzed. The diet composition of ten bat species from four families: Rhinolophidae (Rhinolophus pusillus, R. sinicus), Miniopteridae (Miniopterus fuliginosus), Hipposideridae (Hipposideros gentilis), and assessed, with the diets of M. csorbai, M. sicarius, and S. caliginosus documented for the first time. Dietary analysis of 176 guano pellets revealed the presence of seven insect orders, with Diptera and Lepidoptera detected in all samples, followed by Coleoptera (80%), Neuroptera (40%), Hemiptera (30%), Psocodea (20%), and Hymenoptera (20%). A single mite (Acari) was also detected, likely ingested incidentally during grooming or alongside prey. Percentage volume analyses revealed species-specific foraging preferences among insectivorous bats, complementing frequency data. Hipposideros gentilis showed a marked preference for Lepidoptera (83.8%), while M. fuliginosus, R. lepidus, and P. coromandra also favored Lepidoptera, though to a lesser extent (43.5%, 46.0%, and 39.4%, respectively). Rhinolophus affinis consumed only Diptera, which also dominated the diets of R. pusillus (48.6%), P. javanicus (40.0%), an unidentified Pipistrellus species (37.0%), M. csorbai (56.2%), another unidentified Myotis species (68.8%), and S. caliginosus (56.0%). In contrast, R. sinicus and M. sicarius had diets dominated by Coleoptera (61.0% and 50.5%, respectively), with M. sicarius exhibiting the broadest dietary range, consuming all seven identified insect orders. These dietary compositions suggest that the studied bat species employ diverse foraging strategies, including aerial hawking, foliage gleaning, ground gleaning, and trawling. The presence of mosquitoes in the diet of M. fuliginosus, R. lepidus, R. pusillus, P. javanicus, Pipistrellus sp., M. csorbai, M. sicarius, Myotis sp., and S. caliginosus; pests from the families Miridae and Aphididae in the diet of R. lepidus and Pipistrellus sp.; and scarab beetles in the diet of R. sinicus, P. javanicus, Pipistrellus sp., M. csorbai, M. sicarius, and S. caliginosus underscores the role of bats in regulating disease vectors and agricultural pests. Such findings are essential for fostering positive attitudes toward bats among local communities - an important step toward ensuring their long-term conservation in Nepal, where their ecological and economic benefits are often overlooked.

AB  - Interactions between plants and soil microbes are widespread and are documented to modulate plant-insect herbivore interactions. Still, it remains unclear how these shape the overall plant defense responses and the mechanisms in suppressing insect populations. We performed bioassays and a time-series global gene expression analysis of barley (Hordeum vulgare) plants to study the underlying molecular pathways induced by two rhizobacteria, Acidovorax radicis or Bacillus subtilis, against Sitobion avenae aphids. Root inoculation by A. radicis or B. subtilis suppressed aphid populations on barley. Analysis of differentially expressed genes and co-expressed gene modules revealed a combination of rhizobacteria and aphid-induced plant responses. Aphid feeding triggered distinct plant responses in rhizobacteria-inoculated barley compared to uninoculated control plants, in phytohormone, glutathione, and phenylpropanoid pathways within 24 h. By day 7, stronger responses were observed in phenylpropanoid and nutrient pathways. By day 21, changes occurred in flavonoid pathways and genes related to aphid-induced tissue damage and repair. Our study suggests that rhizobacteria inoculation of barley against aphids is dynamic and acts through several molecular pathways to modulate and prime plant resistance (defenses) and tolerance (nutrition and growth) to aphids. Future research holds promise for exploiting these interactions for crop protection and pest management in agriculture.

AB  - Environmental enrichment is one of the methods used to reduce conflicts at weaning, which erupt when mixing unknown litters and are known to negatively affect growth and welfare of piglets. Here we aimed to test a simple approach of increasing the amount of existing enrichment objects to mitigate post-weaning aggression. The experiment comprised ten groups of piglets (five controls, five tests) with 3-4 litters weaned in each of them. In the control group, a red hanging plastic object (biting ring) and a piece of spruce wood (7 cm x 7 cm x 30 cm) were used for enrichment. In the test group, the enrichment was multiplied according to the number of weaned litters (one toy and one piece of wood was provided per each mixed litter). On days 1, 3, 5, 7 and 14 after weaning, behaviours (negative social behaviours, pen equipment-directed and enrichment-directed behaviours) and injuries (on different parts of the body, tail lesions, lameness) were recorded. On day 21 after weaning, the overall welfare status of the piglets was assessed using the Welfare Quality (R) protocol for pigs. A significant (4-fold) increase in the enrichment-directed behaviours was observed in the test group (p < 0.001). Consequently, there were 3.5 times fewer negative social behaviours (p < 0.001), 38-52% fewer injuries on different body parts (p < 0.001) and higher overall welfare status of the piglets in the test group. Adjusting enrichment to the number of weaned litters proved to be an effective solution to reduce aggression at weaning and improve piglets' welfare. The study provides important information on the use of enrichment material in commercial weaner pens and demonstrates the possibility of significantly improving pig welfare with low effort, input and cost.

AB  - The present study analyzes the effectiveness (exhaustivity and mutual exclusivity) of a taxonomy for classifying animals into the categories of pet, pest, and profit (PPP), as well as variables that affect the classification assigned to the different species. A total of 463 university students (Mean age = 21.07 years; SD = 4.15), mainly female (87%), classified 14 animal species into the PPP categories and answered questionnaire assessments of personality, anthropomorphism, and attitudes toward the wellbeing of animals. On average, the different species were classified into a single PPP category in 71% of the cases (maximum 95% for dogs, and minimum 27% for chimpanzees), with 8% having multiple classifications (15% for horses and pigs, 21% for rabbits), and 21% being unclassified. Women used the profit category less than men (p < 0.05; g = 0.33). Attitudes toward animals, anthropomorphism, and conscientiousness presented significant correlations (p < 0.05) with the use of PPP categories. Finally, logistic regression analyses showed that these variables had a limited yet significative effect in predicting the classification of horses as either pet or profit (explained variance = 8%) and the classification of snakes as pet or pest (explained variance = 9%), but no effect on the classification of bees as pest or profit. The fact that 29% of the cases received multiple or null classifications indicates the need for caution when considering conclusions drawn from studies based on the PPP taxonomy. Personality, anthropomorphism, sex, and attitudes toward animals' wellbeing had only a small effect on the classification of animals, but they revealed possible mechanisms for developing interventions to raise awareness about the treatment of animals.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Cellobiose 2-epimerase (CE) has received great attention due to its potential applications in the food and pharmaceutical industries. In this study, a novel CE from mesophilic anaerobic halophilic bacterium Iocasia fonsfrigidae strain SP3-1 (IfCE) was successfully expressed in Escherichia coli and characterized. RESULTS: Unlike other CEs, the purified IfCE shows only epimerization activity toward beta-1,4-glycosidic linkages of disaccharides, including mannobiose, cellobiose and lactose, but not for monosaccharides, beta-1,4-glycosidic linkages of trisaccharides and alpha-1,4-glycosidic linkages of disaccharides. Only one epimerization product was obtained from the action of IfCE against mannobiose, cellobiose and lactose. Under optimum conditions, 31.0% of epilactose, a rare and low-calorie prebiotic sweetener with medicinal and pharmacological properties, was obtained from 10 mg mL(-1) lactose. IfCE was highly active against lactose under NaCl concentrations up to 500 mmol L-1, possibly due to the excessive basic (arginine and lysine) and acidic (aspartic and glutamic acids) amino acid residues, which are localized on the surface of the halophilic enzyme structure. These residues may protect the enzyme from Cl- and Na+ ions from the environment, respectively. Under normal conditions, IfCE was able to convert lactose present in fresh goat milk to epilactose with a conversion yield of 31% in 10 min. In addition, IfCE has been investigated as a safe enzyme for human allergen. CONCLUSION: The results suggested that IfCE is a promising candidate to increase the quality and value of milk and dairy products by converting lactose that causes digestive problems in people with lactose intolerance into epilactose.

AB  - Social isolation can have long-term effects on brain development and behavior and increases the risk of developing clinical conditions, including anxiety disorders. One modulator of the stress response is gamma-aminobutyric acid, an inhibitory neurotransmitter synthesized by glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD). This study examined sex differences in behavior and GAD expression following prolonged social isolation beginning in adolescence in Long Evans rats. Males and females were equally divided into group-housed (GH) and socially isolated conditions on Postnatal Day 28 (n = 8 per group). Beginning 5 weeks later, tests were conducted for anxietylike behaviors (open-field test and elevated plus maze), social interactions (sociability test), and spatial memory (novel object location). Sex differences in behavior were observed, with GH females showing fewer anxietylike behaviors in the open-field test and elevated plus maze and spending more time with objects (sociability task) compared to GH males. Isolation had no effect on males but increased anxiety and reduced neophilic measures in females, removing sex differences. On the sociability task, all groups spent more time with novel rats compared to objects, suggesting social interest was retained after isolation. In the hippocampus, isolation reduced GAD in both sexes, and sex differences were seen (F > M). However, no group differences in behavior were observed in the hippocampal-dependent novel object location task. Our findings suggest that prolonged social isolation beginning in adolescence is anxiogenic for female Long Evans rats. Furthermore, sex and housing impact hippocampal GABA-ergic activity, which may have important implications in the treatment of anxiety disorders.

AB  - While circular RNAs (circRNAs) regulating angiogenesis have been identified in fish and rodent hearts, their expression profiles in pig hearts remain largely unknown. This study aims to identify circRNAs that regulate angiogenesis in postnatal pig hearts. Total RNA sequencing data on pig heart tissues collected on postnatal days 1 (P1), 3 (P3), 7 (P7) and 28 (P28) were previously reported. This study analyzed conserved circRNAs associated with angiogenesis in the database. Functional studies were conducted in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) and hiPSC-derived endothelial cells (hiPSC-ECs). siRNA-mediated knockdown of circRNAs and miRNAs was performed to validate their functions in regulating angiogenesis. Fluorescence in situ hybridization was used to examine circRNA localization. Sus-PSMB7_0001 expression increased in pig hearts at P7 and P28 compared to P1 and P3. Knockdown of hsa-PSMB7_0025 (the human orthologue of sus-PSMB7_0001) impaired DNA synthesis, mitosis, migration, and tube formation in HUVECs and hiPSC-ECs. hsa-PSMB7_0025 negatively regulated hsa-miR-490-3p. Activation of hsa-miR-490-3p inhibited hiPSC-EC proliferation, while its inhibition promoted proliferation. Inhibition of miR-490-3p upregulated hsa-PSMB7_0025. miR-490-3p regulates five downstream effectors (TP53BP1, TMOD3, CDYL2, FOXO1, and TGFBR1) involved in cell cycle and vascular function. These findings suggest circRNA sus-PSMB7_0001 is a potential pro-angiogenic molecule in neonatal pig hearts.

AB  - Air pollution has been widely recognized as a risk factor for neurological disorders, and the gut microbiome may play a mediating role. However, current evidence remains limited. In this study, a mouse model was employed with continuous exposure to real-time air pollution from conception to late adolescence. Effects of growth-stage air pollution exposure on the gut microbiome, host metabolites, and brain tissue were assessed. Pathological damage in the hippocampus and cortex was observed. Fecal metagenomic sequencing revealed alterations in both compositions and functions of the gut microbiome. Metabolic disturbances in unsaturated fatty acids and glycerophospholipids were identified in the intestine, serum, and brain tissues, with significant changes in metabolites (e.g., gamma-linolenic acid, alpha-linolenic acid, docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), phosphatidylcholine (PC) and phosphatidylserine (PS). Serum levels of the pro-inflammatory mediator leukotriene C4 were also elevated. Correlation analysis identified a group of different gut microbiome species that were associated with host metabolites. Furthermore, mediation analysis showed that intestinal and serum metabolites mediated the associations between the key gut microbiome and brain microbiome. These findings indicate that the metabolic crosstalk in the gut-brain axis mediates the neuronal damage in mice induced by growth-stage air pollution exposure, potentially through pathways involving lipid metabolism and inflammation.

AB  - Poly (I:C) can work as an immunostimulant and a viral vaccine; however, its functional mechanism in aquatic animals needs to be further investigated. In this study, comparative transcriptomic analyses were performed to investigate the effects of poly (I:C) on Argyrosomus japonicus at 12 h and 48 h postinjection. A total of 194 and 294 differentially expressed genes were obtained in the liver and spleen, respectively. At 12 h, poly (I:C) injection could significantly influence the function of the metabolism-related pathways and immune-related pathways in the liver through the upregulation of the genes GST, LPIN, FOXO1, CYP24A1, ECM1, and SGK1, and the downregulation of the genes IL-1 beta, CXC19, TNFAIP3, and IRF1. At 48 h, poly (I:C) could enhance the liver energy metabolism by upregulating the genes TXNRD and ECM1, while it also induced some injury in the cells with the downregulation of the genes HBA and CYP24A1. In the spleen, poly (I:C) could regulate the fish immunity and inflammatory response by upregulating the genes DDIT4, C3, EFNA, and MNK, and by downregulating the genes ABCA1, SORT1, TNF, TLR2, IL8, and MHCII at 12 h, and at 48 h, the poly (I:C) had a similar influence as that in the liver. Intersection analyses demonstrated that CYP24A1 and ECM1 were the main functional genes that contributed to the health of the liver. Ten and four genes participated in maintaining the health of the two tissues after 12 h and 48 h, respectively. In summary, our results provided a new insight into ploy (I:C) application in A. japonicus, and it also helped us to better understand the fish response mechanism to the viral vaccine injection.

AB  - The use of processed insect proteins for poultry and pig feed has been authorized since August 2021 (Regulation EU, 2021/1372). It has been already authorized for aquaculture since 2017 (Regulation EU, 2017/893). The adoption of this Regulation has boosted the European insect industry. However, there is currently little information regarding the evaluation of the shelf-life of insect-based feeds. The present work analyzed meals of Hermetia illucens that underwent two different treatments. The first treatment involved pre-sterilization at 80 degrees C for 2 h, and after that the larvae were subjected to treatment at 65 degrees C. The second treatment consisting in a heat treatment at 65 degrees C without pre-sterilization. The analysis performed for specific microbiological parameters, such as presence of (3-glucuronidase positive Escherichia coli, Enterobacteriaceae, colony count at 30 degrees C, Salmonella spp., Listeria monocytogenes, Bacillus cereus, Clostridium perfringens, coagulase-positive Staphylococcus, yeasts and moulds, did not reveal any concerns about bacteria counts or pathogen presence.

AB  - Pollination by small non-flying mammals occurs in Africa, Australia, Asia and the Neotropics. One hotspot is in the winter rainfall zone of the Cape Floral Region of South Africa. This phenomenon is known for a handful of plant lineages, of which one comprises geoflorous monocots including the tribe Hyacintheae of the Asparagaceae. Small mammal pollination has been documented for four members of the Hyacintheae. A further representative of this taxon, Massonia grandiflora, is hypothesized to be pollinated by small mammals as it shares floral characters with other plants adapted to small mammal pollinators. The study aims at the identification of the pollinators and the characterisation of the floral features of M. grandiflora as well as to experimentally test whether the plants' nectar scent is an attractant to the flower visitors. With direct observations and video monitoring, we demonstrate the fitting between the head of elephant-shrews and rodents and the bowl-shaped flowers with protruding stigmas and styles as well as pollen transfer from the plants' anthers on the animals' body parts that made contact with the stigma. We experimentally show the transfer of pollen surrogates by elephant-shrews and rodents from the anthers via the animals' fur onto the stigmas of conspecific flowers. Pollen loads on the animals' snout and in their faeces represent indirect evidence for flower visits. Insects and birds were not observed as nectar consumers. Choice tests revealed that mice and elephant-shrews are attracted by nectar scent. We conclude that the fragrant nectar attracts mice and elephant-shrews as pollinators, whereas its bitterness and viscosity as well as the flowers' visual crypsis might filter out insects (and birds) as less effective pollinators.

AB  - Prenatal exposure to endocrine disruptors such as bisphenol A (BPA) plays a critical role in the developmental programming of liver dysfunction that is characteristic of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Circadian and aging processes have been implicated in the pathogenesis of NAFLD. We hypothesized that the prenatal BPA-induced fatty-liver phenotype of female sheep is associated with premature hepatic senescence and disruption in circadian clock genes. The expression of circadian rhythm and aging-associated genes, along with other markers of senescence such as telomere length, mitochondrial DNA copy number, and lipofuscin accumulation, were evaluated in the liver tissue of control and prenatal BPA groups. Prenatal BPA exposure significantly elevated the expression of aging-associated genes GLB1 and CISD2 and induced large magnitude differences in the expression of other aging genes-APOE, HGF, KLOTHO, and the clock genes PER2 and CLOCK-in the liver; the other senescence markers remained unaffected. Prenatal BPA-programmed aging-related transcriptional changes in the liver may contribute to pathological changes in liver function, elucidating the involvement of aging genes in the pathogenesis of liver steatosis.

AB  - The manure fertilizer increases the phosphorus (P) saturation of soils and the colloidal P release to water bodies. Manure of different particle-sizes may have different effects on colloidal P release by soil, and to date there is limited knowledge on colloidal P release from soils amended with different size manures. We produced sheep micro-(S-Micro) and nano-manure (S-Nano), and poultry micro- (P-Micro), nano-manure (P-Nano) from bulk samples by wet fractionation method. The fractionation reduced the P contents of micro- and nano-manures, and enriched them in ash and calcium, iron (Fe), magnesium, and aluminum (Al) phosphate minerals compared with the bulk manures. The degree of P saturation (DPS) in Anthorsol and Cambisol was decreased (S-Micro, 17.6 and 17.2 %; S-Nano, 14.5 and 13.3 % and P-Micro, 19.0 and 19.7 mg kg(-1); P-Nano, 17.0 and 14.3 mg kg(-1)) and released less colloidal P (S-Micro, 3.12 and 3.78 mg kg(-1); S-Nano, 3.01 and 3.56 mg kg(-1) and P-Micro, 3.34 and 3.92 mg kg(-1); P-Nano, 3.21 and 3.65 mg kg(-1)) than the soils receiving the bulk manures. The decrease in colloidal P was correlated with less DPS in both soils amended with micro and nano manures. That is, the only measurable effect of manure particle size on colloidal P release from the amended soils was due to chemical fractionation during separation of the size fractions. It was suggested that nano and micro manures were the effective approach to reduce colloidal P release from manure amended soils.

AB  - This study investigated the effects of a low-protein diet without soybean meal on the growth performance, nutrient digestibility, plasma-free amino acids, and meat quality of finishing pigs. A total of 81 barrows and 81 gilts ([Yorkshire x Landrace] x Duroc) of 150 days old with similar body weights (103.64 +/- 3.65 kg) were selected and randomly allocated into three groups with three replicates in each group and 18 finishing pigs in each pen (4.5 m x 8.5 m). Three dietary formulations were established in this experiment: (1) 14% crude protein, and 14% soybean meal for the control group diet (CON); (2) 13% crude protein, and 7% soybean meal for half soybean meal group diet (HSB); (3) 12% crude protein, and 0% soybean meal for soybean meal free group diet (SBF). Three groups of diets were equal to standard ileal digestible amino acids and swine net energy. Results showed that (1) there was no significant difference in final body weight, average daily feed intake, and average daily gain in CON, HSB, and SBF groups (p > 0.05). However, the feed conversion rate was higher in the SBF but the differences were not significant (p = 0.08). (2) Compared with the CON group, the apparent digestibility of dry matter, crude protein, and calcium in the SBF group was significantly increased by 6.42%, 4.78%, and 9.82%, respectively (p < 0.05). However, ether extract and phosphorus did not differ significantly between the three groups (p > 0.05). All groups had no significant differences in serum biochemical indexes (p > 0.05). (3) Compared with the CON group, the plasma-free contents of glycine and glutamate in the HSB and SBF groups were significantly decreased by 42.90% and 37.06%, respectively (p < 0.05). Compared with the CON group, the contents of plasma-free histidine and valine in the SBF group were significantly decreased by 16.72% and 16.21%, respectively (p < 0.05), but there was no significant difference compared with the HSB group (p > 0.05). Compared with the CON group, plasma-free isoleucine content in the HSB group was significantly decreased by 50.39% (p < 0.05), but there was no significant difference compared with the SBF group (p > 0.05). (4) Backfat thickness in the SBF group was significantly increased by 3.53% compared with that in the CON group (p < 0.05), but there was no significant difference compared with the HSB group (p > 0.05). Compared with the CON group, lean meat percentage in the HSB and SBF groups showed a tendency to increase and decrease, respectively (p = 0.09). (5) The urine ammonia-nitrogen content of finishing pigs in the SBF group was significantly lower than that of the CON (p < 0.05), at a rate of 28.80%. H2S content in the urine of the SBF group tended to decrease (p = 0.06). This study demonstrates that a low-protein diet without soybean meal can be applied as a dietary strategy for finishing pigs with no adverse influence on growth performance.

AB  - Volatile organic compounds (VOCs) produced by plants are essential indicators of their physiological response to environmental conditions. But evidence of natural variation in VOC emissions and their contributing factors is still limited, especially for non-cultivated species. Here we explored the natural volatile emissions of Dracophyllum subulatum Hook.f., an endemic shrub to the North Island Central Plateau of New Zealand, and determined some environmental factors driving the plant's emissions. Volatile emissions of D. subulatum were measured on four separate occasions from December 2017 to September 2018 using the "push-pull" headspace sampling technique and analyzed using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). D. subulatum was classified based on the volatiles measured on each sampling occasion using linear discriminant analysis (LDA). On each sampling occasion, we also recorded and compared ambient air temperature, herbivory damage, total soil nitrogen (N), available phosphorus (P), potassium (K), and soil moisture content. The relationship between environmental variables that differed significantly between sampling occasions and volatile emissions were estimated using generalized linear models (GLMs). Based on VOCs measured on each sampling occasion, we were able to distinguish different chemical profiles. Overall, we found that total emission and the relative proportions of all major chemical classes released by D. subulatum were significantly higher during summer. The GLMs reveal that differences in environmental factors between the four sampling occasions are highly associated with changing emissions. Higher temperatures in summer had a consistently strong positive relationship with emissions, while the impacts of soil moisture content, P and K were variable and depended on the chemical class. These results are discussed, particularly how high temperature (warming) may shape volatile emissions and plants' ecology.</p>

AB  - The increasing consumption of sugar and fat seen over the last decades and the consequent overweight and obesity, were recently linked with a deleterious effect on cognition and synaptic function. A major question, which remains to be clarified, is whether obesity in the elderly is an additional risk factor for cognitive impairment. We aimed at unravelling the impact of a chronic high caloric diet (HCD) on memory performance and synaptic plasticity in aged rats. Male rats were kept on an HCD or a standard diet (control) from 1 to 24 months of age. The results showed that under an HCD, aged rats were obese and displayed significant long-term recognition memory impairment when compared to age-matched controls. Ex vivo synaptic plasticity recorded from hippocampal slices from HCD-fed aged rats revealed a reduction in the magnitude of long-term potentiation, accompanied by a decrease in the levels of the brain-derived neurotrophic factor receptors TrkB full-length (TrkB-FL). No alterations in neurogenesis were observed, as quantified by the density of immature doublecortin-positive neurons in the hippocampal dentate gyrus. This study highlights that obesity induced by a chronic HCD exacerbates age-associated cognitive decline, likely due to impaired synaptic plasticity, which might be associated with deficits in TrkB-FL signaling.

AB  - Microplastics (particles smaller than 5 mm) are among the most common pollutants in aquatic habitats because they may develop to high densities and can interact with both the abiotic and biotic environments. There is less information available on microplastics in the freshwater systems than there is in the marine environment. This study aims to shed light on the abundance and spatial distribution of microplastics in the Brahmaputra River (Mymensingh) through the utilization of the wet peroxide oxidation isolation technique, supplemented with sodium chloride, to examine fish and sediment specimens collected between December 21, 2022 and January 12, 2023. A total of 26 and 189 microplastic particles were identified in the fish and sediment samples, respectively. Microplastics (MPs) concentrations in fish gut ranged from 0.5 +/- 0.7 to 1.67 +/- 0.58 MPs individual-1. The most prevalent shape found in fish stomachs was fiber (46%), and the most common color was transparent (32%). Sizes 0.5-1 mm (1.6 +/- 0.74) had the most microplastics. This study found that fishes from the demersal (3.25 +/- 1.7) zone had more MPs than the benthopelagic (2.5 +/- 0.58) and pelagic (1.5 +/- 0.7) zones. Omnivorous fishes (54%) consumed more microplastics than carnivorous (31%, 2.6 +/- 0.58) and herbivorous fishes (15%,1.33 +/- 0.94). Microplastic consumption had a moderate correlation with fish body weight (r = 0.34), length (r = 0.46), and gastrointestinal content (r = 0.45). The MPs per kilogram of Brahmaputra River bed sediment ranged from 8 to 31, with a mean abundance of 18.9 +/- 7.01 particles kg-1. The most common shape identified in this study was fragments (52%) and 33% of sediment microplastics were blue in color. Microplastics were most abundant in the 1-3 m-meter size class. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) showed that polypropylene (PP) was the most prevalent MP in both fish (34%) and sediment (40%) samples. In this study, the Pollution load index (PLI) for each sampling site is <10, with the highest value found for station 2(1.97 +/- 0.49), regarded as risk category I. This study's results will be useful for future research on microplastics in freshwater environments.

AB  - Background: One of the most studied molecular models of gene-environment interactions is that of FKBP5, which has been shown to interact with childhood adversity to increase the risk of psychiatric disorders, and has been implicated in schizophrenia. While the model predicts up-regulation of FKBP5, previous brain samples gene expression studies yielded inconsistent results. Methods: We performed a systematic gene expression meta-analysis of FKBP5 and NR3C1, a glucocorticoid receptor inhibited by FKBP5, in cerebellum samples of patients with schizophrenia. The gene expression databases GEO, SMRI and those of NIMH were searched, and out of six screened datasets, three were eligible for the meta-analysis (overall 69 with schizophrenia and 78 controls). Results: We detected up-regulation of FKBP5 and down-regulation of NR3C1 in schizophrenia, and a negative correlation between their expression patterns. Correlation analysis suggested that the detected differential expression did not result from potential confounding factors. Conclusions: Our results give significant support to the FKBP5 gene-environment interaction model for schizophrenia, which provides a molecular mechanism by which childhood adversity is involved in the development of the disorder. To explore FKBP5's potential as a therapeutic target, a mapping of its differential expression patterns in different brain regions of schizophrenia patients is needed.

AB  - Phosphate (Pi) is a critical nutrient for plants and is often a limiting factor in food production, as many agricultural soils are limited in available Pi. Inositol pyrophosphates (PP-InsPs) are signaling molecules involved in Pi sensing and jasmonic acid (JA)-regulated plant defense. Here, we report that overexpression of 1,3,4-trisphosphate 5/6-kinase 1 (ITPK1) and the kinase domain of the dual-domain diphosphoinositol pentakisphosphate kinase 2 (VIP2KD) in Arabidopsis thaliana results in unique elevations in PP-InsPs, accompanied by altered leaf growth and senescence patterns, as well as delayed time to flowering. While plants overexpressing ITPK1 and VIP2KD (ITPK1 OX and VIP2KD OX) accumulated significantly lower levels of Pi, transcriptomic and qRT-PCR analysis revealed that these plants showed elevated expression of Pi starvation response genes. Our transcriptomic analysis also revealed ITPK1 OX and VIP2KD OX showed a significant enrichment in differentially expressed genes relating to plant defense and hypoxia. Of the two transgenic types, VIP2KD OX had significantly higher expression of more diverse plant defense-related differentially expressed genes and showed greater resistance to Trichoplusia ni compared to WT and ITPK1 OX plants. ITPK1 OX, although also having elevated PP-InsPs, was fed upon by insect larvae comparably to WT plants. Taken together, our data indicate the elevation of certain PP-InsPs may be a useful strategy for developing new traits in crop plants.

AB  - Accurate detection and quantification of spike transmission between neurons is essential for determining neural network mechanisms that govern cognitive functions. Using point process and conductance-based simulations, we found that existing methods for determining neuronal connectivity from spike times are highly affected by burst spiking activity, resulting in over- or underestimation of spike transmission. To improve performance, we developed a mathematical framework for decomposing the cross-correlation between two spike trains. We then devised a deconvolution-based algorithm for removing effects of second-order spike train statistics. Deconvolution removed the effect of burst spiking, improving the estimation of neuronal connectivity yielded by state-of-the-art methods. Application of deconvolution to neuronal data recorded from hippocampal region CA1 of freely-moving mice produced higher estimates of spike transmission, in particular when spike trains exhibited bursts. Deconvolution facilitates the precise construction of complex connectivity maps, opening the door to enhanced understanding of the neural mechanisms underlying brain function.
   A mathematical framework and algorithm are developed that decompose the cross-correlation histogram between two spike trains to determine connectivity between two neurons.

AB  - Magnetic resonance sounding (MRS) has been applied to underground constructions, such as tunnels and mines, to detect and forewarn groundwater sources hidden in front of the mine face, also named disaster water sources. Disaster water sources are mostly found in 2-D or 3-D structures; as such, their spatial distribution characteristics are difficult to reflect accurately by conventional 1-D MRS results. This letter proposes a method for sector-scanning magnetic resonance tomography (MRT) measurement using rotating antennas for 2-D water-bearing structures, such as water-filling conduits, faults, and goafs to obtain the 2-D distribution image of water content and relaxation time (T-2*) in front of the face by inversion. Through the numerical simulation of conduits, we analyzed the 2-D sensitivity, resolution, and inversion results of the rotating antennas. The imaging result at a high noise level was improved by increasing the number of antenna rotations. We also determined the effects of 2-D MRT on the faults and goat's and discussed the minimum cross-sectional area and maximum distance for reliable imaging of conduits.

AB  - Plants mediate interactions between different herbivores that attack simultaneously or sequentially aboveground (AG) and belowground (BG) organs. The local and systemic activation of hormonal signaling pathways and the concomitant accumulation of defense metabolites underlie such AG-BG interactions. The main plant-mediated mechanisms regulating these reciprocal interactions via local and systemic induced responses remain poorly understood. We investigated the impact of root infection by the root-knot nematode (RKN) Meloidogyne incognita at different stages of its infection cycle, on tomato leaf defense responses triggered by the potato aphid Macrosiphum euphorbiae. In addition, we analyzed the reverse impact of aphid leaf feeding on the root responses triggered by the RKN. We focused specifically on the signaling pathways regulated by the phytohormones jasmonic acid (JA), salicylic acid (SA), abscisic acid (ABA), and indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) as well as steroidal glycoalkaloids as induced defense compounds. We found that aphid feeding did not induce AG hormonal signaling, but it repressed steroidal glycoalkaloids related responses in leaves, specifically when feeding on plants in the vegetative stage. Root infection by the RKN impeded the aphid-triggered repression of the steroidal glycoalkaloids-related response AG. In roots, the RKN triggered the SA pathway during the entire infection cycle and the ABA pathway specifically during its reproduction stage. RKN infection also elicited the steroidal glycoalkaloids related gene expression, specifically when it was in the galling stage. Aphid feeding did not systemically alter the RKN-induced defense responses in roots. Our results point to an asymmetrical interaction between M. incognita and Ma. euphorbiae when co-occurring in tomato plants. Moreover, the RKN seems to determine the root defense response regardless of a later occurring attack by the potato aphid AG.

AB  - Among the artiodactyls, male animals belonging to the Family Moschidae have a unique tissue, the musk gland, with the capability of musk synthesis. However, the genetic basis of musk gland formation and musk production are still poorly understood. Here, musk gland tissues from two juvenile and three adult Chinese forest musk deer (Moschus berezovskii) were utilized to analyze genomic evolution events, evaluate mRNA profiles and investigate cell compositions. By performing genome reannotation and comparison with 11 ruminant genomes, three expanded gene families were identified in the Moschus berezovskii genome. Transcriptional analysis further indicated that the musk gland displayed a prostate-like mRNA expression pattern. Single-cell sequencing revealed that the musk gland is composed of seven distinguishable cell types. Among them, sebaceous gland cells and luminal epithelial cells play important roles in musk synthesis, while endothelial cells master the regulation of cell-to-cell communication. In conclusion, our study provides insights into musk gland formation and the musk-synthesizing process.

AB  - Fopius arisanus (Sonan) is an exotic parasitoid used to control Bactrocera spp. In Brazil, it is suggested as a control agent for Bactrocera carambolae Drew & Hancock. The pest is currently restricted to the northern territory of Brazil; however, temperature changes may lead to an increase in its distribution. Species distribution models (SDMs) can predict a species' potential geographic range in a particular climate change scenario. We aimed to predict the susceptible areas for expanding and establishing B. carambolae and its parasitoid, F. arisanus in Brazil, particularly, in the Amazon region. Climate layers were extracted from bioclimatic variables, and Random Forest was used to predict the SMDs for both Brazilian species under two climatic scenarios (intermediary and extreme). Our predictions showed a larger suitability area for B. carambolae establishment than for its parasitoids. Although B. carambolae is widespread, especially in the North and Midwest, F. arisanus has a limited area from west of Ceara<acute accent> State to North and East of Amapa<acute accent> State. Fopius arisanus had a low chance of increasing its geographical area under both climatic scenarios. The parasitoids and their hosts were similarly influenced by bioclimatic variables [precipitation seasonality (BIO15) and annual precipitation (BIO12)]. Our results revealed a limited compatibility area for both B. carambolae and F. arisanus in the Brazilian territory, with potential expansion of the pest compared with its parasitoid. In this context, the country's northern regions face a "red alert flag" for implementing strategies to prevent the spread of pests by releasing parasitoids.

AB  - Assisted reproductive technology (ART)such as in vitro embryo culture (IVC), is widely used in human infertility treatments; however, its long-term effects on the cardiac health of offspring remain unclear. This study aimed to determine whether the effects of IVC on cardiac metabolism and associated signaling pathways persist after birth into adolescence. Embryos were either transferred to an intermediate ewe (ET) or cultured in vitro in the absence (IVC) or presence of human serum (IVCHS) with methionine supplementation (IVCHS+M) for 6 days after mating. Naturally mated (NM) ewes were used as controls. Protein expression and hormone concentrations in the left ventricle (LV) were analyzed using Western blot and LC-MS/MS analyses, respectively. IVC was associated with sex-specific alterations in cardiac mitochondria, with males exhibiting reduced mitochondrial abundance. Cardiac protein expression of oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) complexes 1 and 4 was reduced by IVC. Additionally, IVC reduced protein expression of PDK-4 and Mn-SOD in the IVCHS+M group, which may impact energy efficiency and defense against oxidative stress. These changes may predispose IVC offspring to cardiac oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction, particularly in males. This study provides insights into the sex-dependent effects of IVC on cardiac health, emphasizing the importance of evaluating long-term cardiovascular risks associated with IVC protocols.

AB  - It is estimated that 1 in 36 children are affected by autism spectrum disorder (ASD) in the United States, which is nearly a twofold increase from a decade ago. Recent genetic studies have identified de novo loss-of-function (dnLoF) mutations in the Down Syndrome Cell Adhesion Molecule (DSCAM) as a strong risk factor for ASD. Previous research has shown that DSCAM ablation confers social interaction deficits and perseverative behaviors in mouse models. However, it remains unknown to what extent DSCAM underexpression captures the full range of behaviors, specifically cognitive phenotypes, presented in ASD. Here, we conducted a comprehensive cognitive behavioral phenotyping which revealed that loss of one copy of DSCAM, as in the DSCAM(2J)+/-, that is, DSCAM heterozygous mice, displayed hyperactivity, increased anxiety-like behavior, and motor coordination deficits. Additionally, hippocampal-dependent learning and memory was affected, including impairments in working memory, long-term memory, and contextual fear learning. Interestingly, implicit learning processes remained intact. Therefore, DSCAM LoF produces autistic-like behaviors that are similar to those observed in human cases of ASD. These findings further support a role for DSCAM dnLoF mutations in ASD and suggest DSCAM(2J)+/- as a suitable model for ASD research.

AB  - Successfully repairing large articular cartilage defects remain an unmet clinical challenge. Our lab has previously developed a biomimetic mechanically reinforced type I/II collagen-hyaluronic acid (CI/II-HyA) scaffold, which was proven in vitro to effectively support a hyaline-like cartilage formation while providing mechanical properties mimicking healthy cartilage. This initial pre-clinical study aimed to elucidate the chondral regenerative capacity of this collagen-based scaffold to repair large clinically challenging articular cartilage defects in goats. Furthermore, a biomaterial-fixation technique - previously tested ex-vivo - was also assessed in vivo. Scaffolds were implanted into large cartilage defects (8 mm diameter) in a load-bearing area of goat medial femoral condyles and fixed in place using this new fixation technique with either resorbable or non-resorbable sutures. Following 6 months implantation, scaffolds showed promise to repair the large chondral defects. Macroscopic and histological evaluation showed new hyaline-like cartilage formation partially covering the defect area in 3 out of 6 cartilage defects. Moreover, microCT analysis revealed that all scaffolds showed indications of being successfully secured in the defect. Taken together, the biomimetic reinforced CI/II-HyA scaffold in combination with the innovative fixation method provides strong promise to become a viable treatment to currently limited large articular cartilage repair strategies in the clinic.

AB  - Binge drinking (BD) is a serious health concern in adolescents as high ethanol (EtOH) consumption can have cognitive sequelae later in life. Remarkably, an enriched environment (EE) in adulthood significantly recovers memory in mice after adolescent BD, and the endocannabinoid, 2-arachydonoyl-glycerol (2-AG), rescues synaptic plasticity and memory impaired in adult rodents upon adolescent EtOH intake. However, the mechanisms by which EE improves memory are unknown. We investigated this in adolescent male C57BL/6J mice exposed to a drinking in the dark (DID) procedure four days per week for a duration of 4 weeks. After DID, the mice were nurtured under an EE for 2 weeks and were subjected to the Barnes Maze Test performed the last 5 days of withdrawal. The EE rescued memory and restored the EtOH-disrupted endocannabinoid (eCB)-dependent excitatory long-term depression at the dentate medial perforant path synapses (MPP-LTD). This recovery was dependent on both the cannabinoid CB1 receptor and group I metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs) and required 2-AG. Also, the EE had a positive effect on mice exposed to water through the transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 (TRPV1) and anandamide (AEA)-dependent MPP long-term potentiation (MPP-LTP).

AB  - Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is associated with the etiology of multiple neurological disorders, including neurodegeneration, leading to various cognitive deficits. Daidzin (obtained from kudzu root and soybean leaves) is known for its neuroprotective effects through multiple mechanisms. This study aimed to investigate the pharmacological effects of Daidzin on sensory, and biochemical parameters, cognitive functions, anxiety, and depressive-like behaviors in the TBI rat model. Rats were divided into four groups (Control, TBI, TBI + Ibuprofen (30 mg/kg), and TBI + Daidzin (5 mg/kg)). Rats were subjected to TBI by dropping a 200 g rod from a height of 26 cm, resulting in an impact force of 0.51 J on the exposed crania. Ibuprofen (30 mg/kg) was used as a positive control reference/standard drug and Daidzin (5 mg/kg) as the test drug. Neurological severity score (NSS) assessment was done to determine the intactness of sensory and motor responses. Brain tissue edema and acetylcholine levels were determined in the cortex and hippocampus. Cognitive functions such as hippocampusdependent memory, novel object recognition, exploration, depressive and anxiety-like behaviors were measured. Treatment with Daidzin improved NSS, reduced hippocampal and cortical edema, and improved levels of acetylcholine in TBI-induced rats. Furthermore, Daidzin treatment improved hippocampus-dependent memory, exploration behavior, and novel object recognition while reducing depressive and anxiety-like behavior. Our study revealed that Daidzin has a therapeutic potential comparable to Ibuprofen and can offer neuroprotection and enhanced cognitive and behavioral outcomes in rats after TBI.

AB  - Prenatal protein malnutrition (PPM) alters the developing brain including changes in monoaminergic systems and attention. In the present study, we used in vivo microdialysis to examine the relationship between PPM, acute stress, and extracellular serotonin (5HT), dopamine (DA) and norepinephrine (NE) in both hemispheres of lateral orbital frontal cortices (lOFC) in the adult rat. We hypothesized that prenatal protein malnutrition would alter extracellular concentrations of cortical monoamines. The effects of an acute restraint stress were also assessed because PPM alters the brain's response to stress. We used adult male, Long-Evans rats [10 prenatally malnourished (6% casein) and 10 prenatally well-nourished (25% casein)]. Samples were collected from the left and right hemispheres of the lOFC every 20 min for 6 hr total and quantified using high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). After 2 hr of sampling, animals were exposed to a 40-min restraint stress. Extracellular levels of NE were significantly higher in PPM animals than in well-nourished controls across both hemispheres at all time-points. In contrast, baseline levels of 5HT and DA levels did not differ between nutritional groups. 5HT levels, but not NE or DA levels, were elevated compared to baseline levels in both nutritional groups and in both hemispheres during the first 20 min of stress exposure. These data highlight the impact of PPM on neuromodulatory systems and the profile of changes in response to acute stress. Additional studies are needed to determine how these basal and stress-related responses impact cognitive performance and whether these differences persist during cognitive testing.

AB  - Tinnitus, a widespread condition affecting numerous individuals worldwide, remains a significant challenge due to limited effective therapeutic interventions. Intriguingly, patients using cochlear implants (CIs) have reported significant relief from tinnitus symptoms, although the underlying mechanisms remain unclear and intracochlear implantation risks cochlear damage and hearing loss. This study demonstrates that targeted intracochlear electrical stimulation (ES) in guinea pigs with noise-induced hearing loss reversed tinnitus-related maladaptive plasticity in the cochlear nucleus (CN), characterized by reduced auditory innervation, increased somatosensory innervation, and diminished inhibitory neural networks. Additionally, a customized extracochlear ES delivered by a newly designed extracochlear electrode array to guinea pigs with salicylate-induced tinnitus also reversed the aforementioned maladaptive plasticity and alleviated tinnitus without causing additional cochlear damage or hearing loss. These findings suggest that CI-delivered ES may alleviate tinnitus by reversing maladaptive CN plasticity. Additionally, the extracochlear ES strategy offers a promising tinnitus treatment with minimal risk to hearing.

AB  - Herbivorous insects such as Spodoptera litura, pose a constant threat to agricultural crops. The incompetence of contemporary pest management tools and techniques stipulates unravelling of molecular dogma, that drives pest-plant interaction. From our previous observations, we inferred that despite being a voracious polyphagous herbivore, S. litura growth and adaptability is severely hampered on maize foliage diet. In this investigation we explored further and demonstrated the impact of maize diet on the insect gut peritrophic membrane (PM, a crucial membrane involved in compartmentalizing digestive events and absorption of nutrients), its structural analysis using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) revealed damaged and perforated PM. Further, this study delves into the intricate resistance mechanism adapted by Z. mays against S. litura by conducting a comparative proteome analysis. We have detected 345 differentially abundant proteins (DAPs) at p < 0.05 and fold change >= 1. The DAPs were categorized as plant defense, secondary metabolite synthesis, redox homeostasis, cytoskeleton/ cell wall biosynthesis, primary metabolism, transport and molecular processes. We remarkably report differential expression of proteolysis- and defense-related proteins that have potential to target insect gut, digestion and absorption of nutrients. Our findings contribute to a deeper understanding of the molecular dynamics governing maize resistance against S. litura. Understanding of such intricate molecular dialogues at these interfaces could provide valuable information on the arms race between plants and herbivores, it may pave the way for innovative pest management strategies.

AB  - Simple Summary For this study, several pens of weaned piglets were recorded with cameras on a commercial farm. The goal was to use velocity data to establish an automated method of identifying when all animals are lying down. This automated method had an accuracy of 94.1%. This method can benefit modern farm management and highlight otherwise overlooked conditions in the barn. The resting behavior of rearing pigs provides information about their perception of the current temperature. A pen that is too cold or too warm can impact the well-being of the animals as well as their physical development. Previous studies that have automatically recorded animal behavior often utilized body posture. However, this method is error-prone because hidden animals (so-called false positives) strongly influence the results. In the present study, a method was developed for the automated identification of time periods in which all pigs are lying down using video recordings (an AI-supported camera system). We used velocity data (measured by the camera) of pigs in the pen to identify these periods. To determine the threshold value for images with the highest probability of containing only recumbent pigs, a dataset with 9634 images and velocity values was used. The resulting velocity threshold (0.0006020622 m/s) yielded an accuracy of 94.1%. Analysis of the testing dataset revealed that recumbent pigs were correctly identified based on velocity values derived from video recordings. This represents an advance toward automated detection from the previous manual detection method.

AB  - Semen cryopreservation combined with artificial insemination (AI) benefits germplasm conservation, production, and breeding. Sperm cells are vulnerable to oxidative and other stressors during cryopreservation, necessitating the use of additives/antioxidants to mitigate this damage. This study aimed to evaluate the effects of vitamin E, IGF-1, and crocin supplementation on the quality of cryopreserved goat semen. A total of 48 pooled ejaculates from six goat bucks were diluted in Tris-Citrate-Fructose-Egg Yolk-Glycerol (TCFEYG) extender and divided into four groups: a control group (no antioxidant addition) and groups supplemented with 2 mM vitamin E, 125 ng/mL IGF-1 and 1 mM crocin. The semen samples were cryopreserved in liquid nitrogen (LN2) and analyzed post-thaw for sperm quality attributes, antioxidant enzyme activities and mRNA expression levels. IGF-1 supplementation significantly (P < 0.05) enhanced in vitro sperm quality, and antioxidant enzyme viz., catalase (CAT), glutathione reductase (GR), glutathione peroxidase (GPx), glutathione S transferase (GST) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) compared to other treatments. Lipid peroxidation (LPO) levels were significantly (P < 0.05) lower, and fertility-related mRNA transcripts (NFE2L2, GPx4, CAT, and SOD2) were significantly (P < 0.05) upregulated in the IGF-1 group. No significant (P > 0.05) differences in pregnancy rates were observed among treatments after AI. In conclusion, IGF-1 supplementation significantly improved the post-thaw quality of cryopreserved goat semen, enhancing antioxidant activity and fertility- related mRNA expression compared to vitamin E and crocin treatments.

AB  - The offshore industry widely uses offshore pipelines to transport petroleum products due to their high capacity and reasonable installation costs. Corrosion is the leading failure cause of offshore pipelines, and their reliability analysis is necessary for reducing maintenance costs. This study presents a corrosion analysis in the bursting mode of the pipeline using a codified method based on probabilistic space theory, considering the monitored data of the oil pipeline and the pigging data of the AB-KHARK pipeline. The relationship between pigging data, pa-rameters affecting corrosion, and the reduction of pipe wall thickness are determined based on the indicators of Regression and Neural Network machine learning methods. A new method is presented for modeling the failure modes of offshore pipelines based on their historical data and statistical computation results. Finally, the system is investigated by the first-order reliability method considering the limit state function provided by evaluating the offshore pipeline reliability. The proposed method is evaluated using a dataset from AB-KHARK island in IRAN indicate zero percentage error in failure prediction versus related works with 1% error for PRCI and MB methods, 6, 8, and 11 percentages error against RITCHE, DNV, and AMSE methods, respectively.

AB  - Fin bud initiation factor homolog (Fibin) is a secreted protein that is relatively conserved among species. It is closely related to fin bud development and can regulate a variety of cellular processes. In our previous highthroughput chromosome conformation capture (Hi-C) study of pig embryonic muscle development, it was found that Fibin has high expression and activity during the development of pig primary muscle fibers. Therefore, we speculated Fibin participated in myogenesis severely. Specific deletion of Fibin in mouse skeletal muscle resulted in abnormal primary muscle fiber development during the embryonic period and a substantial decrease in skeletal muscle mass in adulthood. In vitro, knocking out Fibin in C2C12 cells promoted cell proliferation; however, after myogenic induction, cells lacking Fibin had almost no ability to differentiate into myotubes. During myogenic differentiation, loss of Fibin disrupts the normal function of mitochondria and impairs oxidative phosphorylation, resulting in decrease of NADH and FADH in the electron transport chain. Transmission electron microscopy also showed that mitochondrial morphology of Fibin-deficient C2C12 was impaired.

AB  - In eastern Africa, ecologists have found that when mobile pastoralists abandon their temporary encampments, the accumulation of burned animal dung, wood, and other organic waste enriches the concentration of nutrients (e.g., calcium, phosphorous, magnesium) essential to soil health, in comparison to other soils without prior human habitation. These nutrient-enriched soils promote glade development and greater biodiversity. Geo-archaeological research on the time depth of this anthropogenic "nutrient hotspot" phenomenon has demonstrated that soils at several archaeological sites in southern Kenya still remain enriched in these soil macro- and micro-nutrients after several thousand years. However, soil scientists and geoarchaeologists do not yet understand how these anthropogenic soils vary over the extensive geographic conditions of eastern Africa. The discovery of a Pastoral Neolithic site (ca. 3000 BP) at Luxmanda on the Mbulu Plateau, Tanzania, provides an opportunity to examine if similar patterns of nutrient enrichment can be detected in a different geological and climatic zone. In this paper, we use geochemical and sedimentary analyses to determine how archaeological soils at Luxmanda differ from adjacent off-site soils and known archaeological soils in Kenya, as well as from computationally derived soil nutrient models for eastern Africa. Our results indicate that soils derived from anthropogenic sediments and ashy dung are 4 to 16-fold more abundant in soil macro nutrients relative to off-site or modeled values. This pattern fits previous studies' observations that elevated macro- and micro-nutrients in soils are strongly correlated with ancient pastoralist habitation sites. We conclude that anthropogenic soils found at Pastoral Neolithic archaeological sites may be a valuable, but unappreciated, soil resource in eastern Africa.

AB  - Prunus mahaleb seeds were selected for phytochemical study directed by ex-vivo bronchodilator effect based on the traditional use for the treatment of respiratory problems. From the active chloroform fraction, five known phenylpropanoid glycosides: cis-melilotoside sodium salt (1), cis-methoxy-melilotoside (2), 3-(2-O-beta-D-glucopyranosyl-4-methoxyphenyl) propanoic acid (3), trans-methoxy-melilotoside (4) and trans- melilotoside (5) were identified for the first time from genus Prunus. Chemical structure of the compounds elucidated by spectroscopic techniques such as 1D, 2D NMR and HRESI/MS. Compounds 1 , 2 , 4 , 5 showed promising bronchodilator effects against carbamylcholine (CCh) induced bronchospasm in isolated Guinea-pig trachea while 3 was found completely inactive. The mechanism(s) of action was studied using both CCh, low K+ (25 mM) and high K+ (80 mM)-mediated contractions and compound 2 was found distinctly more potent and efficacious against CCh compared to both types of K+ mediated contractions where partial efficacy was observed, hence showed dual inhibition of cholinergic receptors followed by Ca2+ channels. The anticholinergic and Ca2+ inhibitory activities of compound 2 were further confirmed when it deflected CCh concentration response curves (CRCs) without suppression, whereas its higher doses shifted Ca2+ CRCs similar to verapamil. The bronchodilator effect proved to be mediated via dual anticholinergic and Ca2+ channels blocking effects.

AB  - In rodents, status epilepticus (SE) triggered by chemoconvulsants can differently affect the proliferation and fate of adult-born dentate granule cells (DGCs). It is unknown whether abnormal neurogenesis results from intracellular signaling associated with drug-receptor interaction, paroxysmal activity, or both. To test the contribution of these factors, we systematically compared the effects of kainic acid (KA)-and pilocarpine (PL)-induced SE on the morphology and localization of DGCs generated before or after SE in the ipsi-and contralateral hippocampi of mice. Hippocampal insult was induced by unilateral intrahippocampal (ihpc) administration of KA or PL. We employed conditional doublecortin-dependent expression of the green fluorescent protein (GFP) to label adult-born cells committed to neuronal lineage either one month before (mature DGCs) or seven days after (immature DGCs) SE. Unilateral ihpc administration of KA and PL led to bilateral epileptiform discharges and focal and generalized behavioral seizures. However, drastic granule cell layer (GCL) dispersion occurred only in the ipsilateral side of KA injection, but not in PL-treated animals. Granule cell layer dispersion was accompanied by a significant reduction in neurogenesis after SE in the ipsilateral side of KA-treated animals, while neurogenesis increased in the contralateral side of KA-treated animals and both hippocampi of PL-treated animals. The ratio of ectopic neurons in the ipsilateral hippocampus was higher among immature as compared to mature neurons in the KA model (32.8% vs. 10.0%, respectively), while the occurrence of ectopic neurons in PL treated animals was lower than 3% among both mature and immature DGCs. Collectively, our results suggest that KA-and PL-induced SE leads to distinct cellular alterations in mature and immature DGCs. We also show different local and secondary effects of KA or PL in the histological organization of the adult DG, suggesting that these unique epilepsy models may be complementary to our understanding of the disease.

AB  - In the lush tea estates of Northeast India, the growth of the tea plant (Camellia sinensis L.) hinges on the intricate dance of soil properties. This present study delves into the soil characteristics of sixteen tea estates, situated spanning the verdant landscapes of Assam and the enchanting Darjeeling hills in West Bengal. We meticulously analyzed soil pH, organic carbon (OC) content, texture, available nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, sulfur, exchangeable calcium, and magnesium using rigorous standard methods. In our analysis, we also investigated various forms of soil acidity. These include exchangeable acidity (EA), exchangeable aluminum (EAl), exchangeable hydrogen (EH), extractable acidity (ExtA), hydrolytic acidity (HA), non-exchangeable aluminum (NEA), pH-dependent acidity (pHDA), total acidity (TA), and total potential acidity (TPA). The findings revealed that most of the estates have soil with acidity levels below 4.50 rendering it unsuitable for tea cultivation. The various acidity fractions exhibited specific ranges for different soil components, with pH-dependent acidity emerging as the primary contributor to TPA, and EAl, exerting the most significant influence on TA in the soils being investigated. The study also demonstrated a strong inverse relationship between pH and all forms of acidity, except for non-exchangeable acidity and hydrolytic acidity. Furthermore, the presence of OC was found to have a substantial impact on soil acidity, displaying a notably strong positive association with EA, pHDA, and TPA. Canonical correlation analysis (CCA) revealed the relationship between soil acidity and its physical and chemical properties. The principal component analysis (PCA) showed that the first six PCs accounted for over 80% of the variability, with PC-1, PC-2, and PC-3 describing 31.86, 20.78, and 14.13% respectively. These results highlight the urgent need for soil amendments and better field management practices to combat soil acidity for sustainable tea cultivation.

AB  - Background: Increasing the dietary provision of L-arginine to pregnant swine beginning at Day 14 of gestation enhances embryonic survival, but the underlying mechanisms are largely unknown. Objective: This study determined the effects of dietary supplementation with 0.8% L-arginine to gilts between Days 14 and 25 of gestation on the global expression of genes in their placentae. Methods: Between Days 14 and 24 of gestation, gilts were fed 2 kg of a corn- and soybean meal-based diet (containing 12.0% crude protein and 0.70% Arg) supplemented with 0.8% L-arginine or without L-arginine (0.0%; with 1.64% L-alanine as the isonitrogenous control). On Day 25 of gestation, 30 min after the consumption of their top dressing containing 8 g L-arginine or 16.4 g L-alanine, gilts underwent hysterectomy to obtain placentae, which were snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen. Total RNAs were extracted from the frozen tissues and used for microarray analysis based on the 44-K Agilent porcine gene platform. Results: L-Arginine supplementation affected placental expression of 575 genes, with 146 genes being up-regulated and 429 genes being down-regulated. These differentially expressed genes play important roles in nutrient metabolism, polyamine production, protein synthesis, proteolysis, angiogenesis, immune development, anti-oxidative responses, and adhesion force between the chorioallantoic membrane and the endometrial epithelium, as well as functions of insulin, transforming growth factor beta, and Notch signaling pathways. Conclusion: Dietary supplementation with L-arginine plays an important role in regulating placental gene expression in gilts. Our findings help to elucidate mechanisms responsible for the beneficial effect of L-arginine in improving placental growth and embryonic/fetal survival in swine.

AB  - Extremes of climate and hypobaric hypoxia cause poor growth performance in broiler chickens at high altitude and the present study investigates the effect of aqueous extract of Salix alba leaves on growth performance, antioxidant level and immune status of broiler chickens reared at high altitude cold desert (3500 m). High performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) analysis of the extract revealed the presence of salicin and caffeic acid. In vitro efficacy evaluation revealed that the extract had a significant cytoprotective effect on lymphocytes. For in-vivo study, a total of 105 one d old RIR cross-bred broiler chickens were randomly assigned to seven groups: 1) Control fed basal diet and 2) Six treatments fed basal diet + S. alba extract @100, 150, 200, 300, 400, and 800 mg kg(-1) body weight of chicken, respectively. Chickens in the Salix 300 group had greater body weight (p < 0.05) and improved feed conversion ratio (FCR) compared to other treatments. Furthermore, chickens had greater (p < 0.05) total antioxidant capacity (TAC), free radical scavenging activity, interleukin-2, and lower malondialdehyde (MDA), interleukin-1, and interleukin-6 concentration as compared to the control group. Net profit was also increased in all the treatments that were fed diet with S. alba extract due to less mortality in chickens. These findings indicated that inclusion S. alba extract at dose concentration of 300 mg kg(-1) body weight of chicken, exhibited a beneficial effect on growth performance through immunomodulation and up-regulation of antioxidants, and therefore, it has a potential to be used as a phytogenic feed additive for improving broiler performance at high altitude.

AB  - This experiment was conducted to evaluate the effects of a methionine hydroxy analog (MHA) on in vitro gas production, rumen fermentation parameters, and rumen microbiota. Two different MHA, 2-hydroxy-4-(methylthio) butanoic acid isopropyl ester (HMBi) and the calcium salt of the hydroxy analog of methionine (MHA-Ca), were selected for in vitro experiments. The treatments were the Control group (0% of MHA), HMBi group (2%HMBi), and MHA-Ca group (2%MHA-Ca). Dry matter digestibility was measured after 12 h and 24 h of fermentation, and fermentation parameters and microbial composition were analyzed after 24 h. HMBi and MHA-Ca showed increased (p = 0.001) cumulative gas production in 3 h. The total volatile fatty acids, microbial protein (MCP) concentration, acetate, and acetate to propionate ratio in the HMBi and MHA-Ca groups were significantly higher than those in the Control group (p = 0.006, p = 0.002, p = 0.001, p = 0.004), and the NH3-N concentrations in the HMBi and MHA-Ca groups were significantly lower than those in the Control group (p = 0.004). The 16S rRNA sequencing revealed that the HMBi group had a higher (p = 0.039, p = 0.001, p = 0.027) relative abundance of Bacteroidetes, Firmicutes, and Synergistetes and a lower relative abundance of Proteobacteria (p = 0.001) than the Control group. At the genus level, Prevotella abundance was higher (p = 0.001), while Ruminobacter abundance was lower (p = 0.001), in the HMBi and MHA-Ca groups than in the Control group. Spearman's correlation analysis showed that the relative abundance of Prevotella_1, Streptococcus, and Desulfovibrio was positively correlated with dry matter digestibility, MCP, and fermentation parameters. MHA, thus, significantly increased gas production and altered the rumen fermentation parameters and microbiota composition of sheep.

AB  - Dairy proteins in the diet are beneficial for the growth of probiotics; however, what is unknown is the gut-mediated immune responses under protein energy malnutrition (PEM) and if dairy protein hydrolysates can be effective as dietary interventions. This study compares the composition of the gut microbiota of rats with moderate protein deficiency (M.PEM) and severe protein deficiency (S.PEM) induced by feeding 5% and 1% hypoprotein diets, followed by replenishment with buffalo and whey protein hydrolysates. Fecal samples were collected, and the composition of the gut bacteria was analyzed by whole genome sequencing using long-read sequencing. Gene expression studies of the immunomodulatory cytokines involved and quantification of sIgA were carried out. IL-6 and IFN-gamma were downregulated by about 0.17 +/- 0.06 and 0.12 +/- 0.10 fold when supplemented with whey protein hydrolysate in SP-RWC rats and by about 0.02 +/- 0.06 and 0.35 +/- 0.12 fold when using buffalo milk hydrolysate. The percentage of Firmicutes decreased in M.PEM and S.PEM rats (33.57%, 28.83 versus 47.73% of control at 3 weeks) but increased upon protein replenishment for all three protein sources at the end of nine weeks. The percentage of Bacteroidetes increased to 31.03% in S.PEM-induced rats as against 28.17% in control rats. The relative abundance of Lactobacillus sp. decreased in M.PEM and S.PEM rats while it showed the opposite effect upon protein replenishment. Gut microbiota modulated the pathogenesis of PEM differentially based on protein intervention along with a significant increase in the relative abundance of the keystone Lactobacillus genus.

AB  - Hydrogel coatings have been proposed as a promising strategy to improve the biocompatibility of therapeutic cells and biomedical devices. However, developed coating methods are only applicable for simple geometries, typical sizes, and limited substrates. In addition, its applications in therapeutic cell encapsulation are hampered by inadequate construction of the hydrogel capsules such as off-center encapsulation, immense volume, and lack of control over the thickness of capsules. Here, a method called surface-triggered in situ gelation (STIG) for universal hydrogel coating of multiscale objects ranging from single cells to mini-organs to biomedical devices with arbitrary shapes and heterogeneous components is reported. By covering cells or devices with calcium carbonate particles, progressive propagation of alginate hydrogel from their surface under the stimulation of GDL is achieved. The thickness of the hydrogel layers can be easily controlled from several micrometers to hundreds of micrometers by adjusting the gelation time and the release rate of calcium ions. Importantly, STIG facilitates accurate, complete, and individual cell encapsulation, which potentially overcomes the pitfalls of conventional strategies. It is further proven that the low-cost and facile method can potentially lead to advances in different fields by rendering precisely controlled microscale alginate layers on a wide variety of biomedical substrates.

AB  - Developmental exposure to polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), which are commonly used as flame retardants, results in irreversible cognitive impairments. Postnatal hippocampal neurogenesis, which occurs in the subgranular zone (SGZ) of the dentate gyrus, is critical for neuronal circuits and plasticity. Wnt7a-Frizzled5 (FZD5) is essential for both neurogenesis and synapse formation; moreover, Wnt signaling participates in PBDE neurotoxicity and also contributes to the neuroprotective effects of melatonin. Therefore, we investigated the impacts of perinatal decabromodiphenyl ether (BDE-209) exposure on hippocampal neurogenesis and synaptogenesis in juvenile rats through BrdU injection and Golgi staining, as well as the alleviation of melatonin pretreatment. Additionally, we identified the structural basis of Wnt7a and two compounds via molecular docking. The hippocampal neural progenitor pool (Sox2+BrdU+ and Sox2+GFAP+cells), immature neurons (DCX+) differentiated from neuroblasts, and the survival of mature neurons (NeuN+) in the dentate gyrus were inhibited. Moreover, in BDE-209-exposed offspring rats, it was observed that dendritic branching and spine density were reduced, alongside the long-lasting suppression of the Wnt7a-FZD5/beta-catenin pathway and targeted genes (Prox1, Neurod1, Neurogin2, Dlg4, and Netrin1) expression. Melatonin alleviated BDE-209-disrupted memory, along with hippocampal neurogenesis and dendritogenesis, for which the restoration of Wnt7a-FZD5 signaling may be beneficial. This study suggested that melatonin could represent a potential intervention for the cognitive deficits induced by PBDEs.

AB  - Wound healing is a complex process that is still not fully understood despite extensive research. To address this, we aimed to design and characterize a standardized porcine model for the evaluation of wound healing, dressings, cell therapies, and pharmaceutical agents. Using a standardized approach, we examined the wound healing process in 1.2 mm-deep dermatome wounds at defined positions in 11 female pigs. Unlike previous studies that have only described/analyzed selected punch biopsies, we performed and described histological analyses along the complete wound length using quantitative morphometric methods. All animals remained fully healthy following surgery and showed no signs of infection. Our histopathological evaluation using a predetermined grading score and quantitative manual morphometry demonstrated the impact of different tissue sampling methods, sampling sites, and residual dermis thickness on wound healing. Our study presents a reproducible model for wound healing evaluation and demonstrates the usefulness of porcine models for assessing dermal and epidermal wound healing. The use of histological analyses over the complete wound length provides advantages over previous studies, leading to the possibility of a deeper understanding of the wound healing process. This model could potentially facilitate future research on novel wound dressings and local wound healing therapies.

AB  - Ethnopharmacology relevance: The plant Senecio nutans SCh. Bip. is used by Andean communities to treat altitude sickness. Recent evidence suggests it may produce vasodilation and negative cardiac inotropy, though the cellular mechanisms have not been elucidated.
   Purpose: To determinate the mechanisms action of S. nutans on cardiovascular function in normotensive animals.
   Methods: The effect of the extract on rat blood pressure was measured with a transducer in the carotid artery and intraventricular pressure by a Langendorff system. The effects on sheep ventricular intracellular calcium handling and contractility were evaluated using photometry. Ultra-high-performance liquid-chromatography with diode array detection coupled with heated electrospray-ionization quadrupole-orbitrap mass spectrometric detection (UHPLC-DAD-ESI-Q-OT-MSn) was used for extract chemical characterization.
   Results: In normotensive rats, S. nutans (10 mg/kg) reduced mean arterial pressure (MAP) by 40% (p < 0.05), causing a dose-dependent coronary artery dilation and decreased left ventricular pressure. In isolated cells, S. nutans extract (1 mu g/ml) rapidly reduced the [Ca2+](i) transient amplitude and sarcomere shorting by 40 and 49% (p < 0.001), respectively. The amplitude of the caffeine evoked [Ca2+](i) transient was reduced by 24% (p < 0.001), indicating reduced sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) Ca2+ content. Sodium-calcium exchanger (NCX) activity increased by 17% (p < 0.05), while sarcoendoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase (SERCA) activity was decreased by 21% (p < 0.05). LC-MS results showed the presence of vitamin C, malic acid, and several antioxidant phenolic acids reported for the first time. Dihydroeuparin and 4-hydroxy-3-(3-methylbut-2-enyl) acetophenone were abundant in the extract.
   Conclusion: In normotensive animals, S. nutans partially reduces MAP by decreasing heart rate and cardiac contractility. This negative inotropy is accounted for by decreased SERCA activity and increased NCX activity which reduces SR Ca2+ content. These results highlight the plant's potential as a source of novel cardio-active phytopharmaceuticals or nutraceuticals.

AB  - Entomopathogenic fungi infect insects via spores but also live inside plant tissues as endophytes. Frequently, colonization by entomopathogens provides plants with increased resistance against insects, but the mechanisms are little understood. This study investigated direct, local, and systemic root-mediated interactions between isolates of the fungus Metarhizium brunneum and larvae of the cabbage root fly (CRF) Delia radicum attacking Brassica napus plants. All fungal isolates infected CRF when conidia were present in the soil, leading to 43-93% mortality. Locally, root-associated M. brunneum isolates reduced herbivore damage by 10-20% and in three out of five isolates caused significant insect mortality due to plant-mediated and/or direct effects. A split-root experiment with isolate Gd12 also demonstrated systemic plant resistance with significantly reduced root collar damage by CRF. LC-MS analyses showed that fungal root colonization did not induce changes in phytohormones, while herbivory increased jasmonic acid (JA) and glucosinolate concentrations. Proteinase inhibitor gene expression was also increased. Fungal colonization, however, primed herbivore-induced JA and the expression of the JA-responsive plant defensin 1.2 (PDF1.2) gene. We conclude that root-associated M. brunneum benefits plant health through multiple mechanisms, such as the direct infection of insects, as well as the local and systemic priming of the JA pathway.

AB  - Simple Summary The Canadian pork industry is transitioning to group housing gestation. The Code of Practice for pigs recommends the provision of enrichment. Although straw is considered prime enrichment, it is perceived as a biosecurity risk and manure management issue; therefore, identifying other enrichment materials is needed to promote adequate welfare. Previously, our group examined the effects of four types of point-source enrichments in an Electronic Sow Feeding (ESF) system. This study is a continuation of our previous research applied in Free Access Stalls (FAS). Four treatments were studied: (1) Constant: constant provision of wood on chain; (2) Rotate: rotation of three enrichments (rope, straw, and wood on chain); (3) Stimulus: rotation of three enrichments with an associative stimulus (bell or whistle); and (4) Control: no enrichment. Contact with enrichment and time spent in different postures were measured using scan sampling. Skin lesions were scored, and salivary cortisol was measured in a subset of dominant and subordinate sows. Sows spent more time contacting straw compared to other types of enrichment. There was no difference in enrichment use between dominant and subordinate sows, no increase in cortisol concentrations in subordinates nor significant differences in aggression. In conclusion, sows preferred straw enrichment and FAS provided some protection against aggression and stress. Continuing with previous research by our group in an ESF system, four types of enrichment treatments were assessed in gestating sows housed in Free Access Stalls: (1) Constant: constant provision of wood on chain; (2) Rotate: rotation of rope, straw and wood; (3) Stimulus: rotation of enrichments with an acoustic cue; and (4) Control: no enrichment. Treatments had a 12 day-duration. Four groups (28 +/- 2 sows) were studied from weeks 6 to 14 of gestation. Groups received all treatments in random order. Three dominant and 3 subordinates per pen were selected using a feed competition test. Digital photos were collected at 10 min intervals for 8 h on days 1, 8, 10 and 12 to record interactions with enrichment. Skin lesions were assessed on days 1 and 12, and salivary cortisol was assessed in weeks 6, 10 and 14 of gestation. More enrichment use was observed in Rotate and Stimulus treatments compared to Constant, and more sows contacted enrichment when straw was provided in the Rotate and Stimulus treatments. There was no difference in the amount of enrichment use by dominants and subordinates, no cortisol concentration elevation in subordinate sows nor any difference in lesion scores. In conclusion, social status had little impact and feeding system is important to reduce stress and aggression.

AB  - The use of nanoparticles is a promising ecofriendly strategy for mitigating both abiotic and biotic stresses. However, the physiological and defense response mechanisms of plants exposed to multiple stresses remain largely unexplored. Herein, we examined how foliar application of biogenic nanosilica (BNS) impacts rice plant growth, molecular defenses, and metabolic responses when subjected to arsenic (As) toxicity and infested by the insect Chilo suppressalis. We show that BNS significantly increased shoot and root silicon accumulation but reduced the shoot As content by 34.7% under herbivory. Additionally, BNS reduced C. suppressalis larval weight gain by 34.5 and 12.3% without and with As stress, respectively. Importantly, BNS enhanced antioxidant enzyme activity under As stress, herbivore attack, and combined pressures, surpassing the effects of traditional silicate fertilizers. BNS ultimately increased rice shoot biomass by 8.2-23.4% under the respective stress conditions compared to the control treatment. Moreover, while As stress alone diminished the plant's resistance to herbivores, BNS application countered this effect by increasing detoxifying compound (e.g., glutathione) production and antioxidant enzyme activity. This study highlights the impact of biotic and abiotic stress interactions on BNS-enhanced plant resilience mechanisms in rice plants, reallocating resources to counter heavy metal toxicity and herbivore damage in agroecosystems.

AB  - Broad bean is one of the most important leguminous crops worldwide. However, its productivity is greatly affected by the infestation of Aphis fabae and Aphis craccivora (Hemiptera: Aphididae). The main objective of the current study was to identify the most susceptible phenological stages of the broad bean variety (Histal) against black aphids' herbivory. This had been achieved through an evaluation of plant resistance mechanisms such as antixenosis and antibiosis. The results regarding an antixenosis test revealed that the four tested phenological stages of V. faba did not have a significant effect on the preference of A. craccivora and A. fabae towards the crop plant. Overall, a slightly higher number of adults settled on the three and four unfolded leaves' stage of the crop plant. Similarly, the highest number of developed embryos were found in the four leaves' stage of the crop, and the lowest in the second leaf stage. The adult body size of A. craccivora was slightly larger in the case of the three unfolded leaves. Furthermore, the maximum body size of A. fabae adults was recorded in the case of the first unfolded leaf stage crop. Linear correlations between the biological parameters for both species revealed only one significant relationship between developed and total embryos for A. craccivora. The results of the current study highlight the need to protect broad bean crops against infestations of black aphids, i.e., A. craccivora and A. fabae. This is essential for reducing direct damage and preventing the transmission of phytoviruses. However, future studies should aim to evaluate the susceptibility of all developmental phenological stages of the crop against black aphids to mitigate potential crop losses.

AB  - Simple Summary Mycoplasma hyopneumoniae (Mhy) is the cause of porcine enzootic pneumonia (PEN) which, although not lethal, may lead to fatal pneumonia caused by opportunistic bacteria and/or viruses, in concurrence with environmental and management stressors due to reduced muco-ciliary clearance and impaired immune-inflammatory function. PEN spreads progressively with high morbidity rate, causing major economic losses to pig producers worldwide, associated to diminished production indexes and increased control costs, based on vaccination and antimicrobial treatments, used to mitigate those detrimental effects. Vaccination is commonly used for Mhy prophylaxis. While vaccines improve growth performance and reduce clinical signs and lung lesions, the results are often variable. In response to multiple stimuli, cytokines -molecular signals produced by a variety of immuno-modulatory cells- are involved in numerous protective biological activities. To investigate the role of cytokines in vaccinated and non-vaccinated pigs, an experimental model of infection was developed, by combining trans-tracheal and aerosol route, using a mixture of Mhy-field strains. Comparison of clinical, microbiological, pathological, and immunohistochemical parameters revealed significant differences depending upon the profile of cytokines expressed. These results indicate the importance to enhance Th1-type cytokine response-cell-mediated immunity -, to improve the effectiveness of Mhy-immunization, and to develop more efficient vaccines against PEN. Mycoplasma hyopneumoniae (Mhy) is the causative agent of enzootic pneumonia, characterized by high morbidity and low mortality rates in intensive swine production systems. To better understand the mechanisms underlying the protection of an inactivated whole cell vaccine, we investigated the immunohistochemical differences in the cytokine expression in vaccinated and non-vaccinated pigs experimentally infected with Mhy. Four-week-old Mhy-negative pigs (n = 24) were allocated to negative control (n = 8), or one of two Mhy-infected groups: vaccinated (n = 8) and non-vaccinated (n = 8). Infection was carried out by a combination of trans-tracheal and aerosol route. Lung samples were processed for histopathological and immunohistochemical studies, by using antibodies against Mhy, IL1-alpha, IL1-beta, IL-2, IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, Il-8, IL-10, IL-12p35, IL-13, IL-17A, TNF-alpha, IFN-gamma, and CD-4 lymphocytes. Although all cytokines increased in both infected groups, IL-2, IL-12, and IFN-gamma were significantly overexpressed in vaccinated pigs. These findings, in conjunction with the decrease of macroscopic and histological lesions in vaccinated animals, indicate the importance to enhance Th1 response in the immunization strategies to control Mhy infection.

AB  - The fall armyworm (Spodoptera frugiperda) is a devastating invasive insect herbivore. Its success on its preferred host plant, maize (Zea mays), is supported by numerous specialized detoxification mechanisms that suppress the defense responses of maize. In this study, we used a resistant Chinese maize cultivar, Xi502, which showed slower growth and lower yield-related phenotypes compare with maize inbred line B73. Comparative transcriptomic analyses demonstrated that B73-fed fall armyworm larvae have a significantly faster transcriptomic re-configuration toward maturation compared to their siblings fed with Xi502 leaves, whereas a number of putative aromatic breakdown -related DEGs were specifically induced when feeding on Xi502. Targeted metabolomic quantification demonstrated that Xi502 contains significantly higher levels of various benzoxazinoid compounds. Artificial feeding with the structural analog of a benzoxazinoid compound preferentially accumulated in Xi502 demonstrated a significant growth inhibition effect on FAW larvae. These results provide important genetic material and preliminary evidence for further dissection of the FAW-resistance mechanism in maize.

AB  - Prolonged exposure to low levels of dietary contaminants is a context in modern life that could alter organ physiology gradually. Here, we aimed to investigate the impact of continuous exposure to acceptable daily intake (ADI) and non-observable adverse effect level (NOAEL) of glyphosate from gestation to adulthood using C57BL/ 6J mice and incorporating these levels into their food pellets. From adulthood, we analyzed neurophysiological and neuro-glia cellular adaptations in male and female animals. Using ex-vivo hippocampal slice electrophysiology, we found a reduced efficacy of Schaffer collateral-to-CA1 excitatory synapses in glyphosate-exposed dietary conditions, with ADI and NOAEL dose-dependent effects. Short-term facilitation of excitatory synaptic transmission was specifically increased in NOAEL conditions, with a predominant influence in males, suggesting a reduced probability of neurotransmitter release. Long-term synaptic potentiation (LTP) was decreased in NOAEL-exposed mice. Next, we explore whether these neurophysiological modifications are associated with neuro-glia changes in the somatosensory cortex and hippocampus. High-resolution confocal microscopy analyses unveil a dose-dependent increased density of excitatory Vglut1+ Homer1+ synapses. Microglial Iba1+ cells displayed a shortening of their ramifications, a sign of cellular reactivity that was more pronounced in males at NOAEL levels. The morphology of GFAP+ astrocytes was generally not modified. Finally, we asked whether mouse-specific cross-correlations exist among all data sets generated. This examination included the novel object recognition (NOR) test performed before ex vivo functional and immunohistochemical examinations. We report a negative linear regression between the number of synapses and NOR or LTP maintenance when plotting ADI and NOAEL datasets. These results outline synaptic and microglial cell adaptations resulting from prenatal and continuous dietary low levels of glyphosate, discernible in, but not limited to, adult males exposed to the NOAEL. We discuss the potential significance of these findings to real-world consumer situations and long-term brain resilience.

AB  - Excessive heavy metals (HMs) and metal resistance genes (MRGs) in manure pose significant environmental and human health risks. Our previous work proved enhanced control of antibiotic resistance and quality of swine manure composting with electrokinetic technology (EK). As a continuous study, EK treatments were further employed at typical stages of composting. The humification level increased significantly in EK treatments applied at the thermophilic stage (EK1) and throughout the whole composting period (EK2). The immobilization efficiency of heavy metals increased by 3.02 %-20.90 % for EK1, and 3.86 %-20.56 % for EK2, compared with the EK treatment applied at maturity stage (EK3). EK1 showed the highest ability to remove MRGs (29.38 %-87.13 %), while the abundance of potential host bacteria increased in EK2, raising potential transmission risk of MRGs. Furthermore, there was an elevated presence of bacteria associated with membrane transport as a response mechanism to HMs stress in EK1. Considering economic factors and environmental effects, EK treatment during the thermophilic stage was more effective in compost maturation, HMs passivation, as well as control of HMs resistance. This study provides an effective method to address HMs-related contamination with highly efficient maturation in swine manure composting.

AB  - Understanding moisture movement within building materials is critical for the understanding of how they dynamically respond to their hygrothermal environment. Utilising low embodied energy, hygrothermal materials such as bio-fibers and earth will enable a `green solution' to the current climate change issues surrounding carbon intensive materials such as concrete. Within this research an earth mortar with bio-fibres of 2 types of sheep wool: Wool 1 (W1), Wool 2 (W2) and a Saw Mill Residue (SMR) in addition to a plain, control sample (PL) were cast. Experimentation was completed on these materials to identify Water Vapour Permeability (WVP), Sorption Isotherms and latent heat of sorption. Results demonstrated that for WVP, SMR has the greatest value of WVP (2.2 x10 11 kg.m(-1).s(-1).Pa-1). PL also had the lowest value (1.4 x10(-11) kg.m(-1).s(-1).Pa-1). For sorption isotherm, over the course of the experiment it can be demonstrated that the incorporation of fibres increases the rate in which the mortars adsorb water molecules. This is particularly highlighted as above 30% RH sample begin to increase in moisture content with this rapidly increasing from approximately 65% RH. Finally, latent heat of sorption analysis demonstrated that a dynamic change in latent heat under differing hygorthermal conditions can be indentified; for all samples, even after 21, 24 h cycles. However, SMR had the lowest quantity of latent heat even by comparison to the PL sample as there is a sustained difference of approximately only 0.5 degrees C between samples. This establishes that the SMR sample requires less heat energy in order for the water to change to and from vapour and liquid state.

AB  - Cyfluthrin (Cy) is a widely used pyrethroid insecticide. There is growing evidence that Cy can cause damage to the nervous, reproductive, and immune systems, but there is limited evidence on the potential effects of maternal Cy exposure on offspring. A model of maternal Cy exposure was used to assess its neurobehavioral effects on young-adult offspring. We found that gestational Cy exposure affected pregnancy outcomes and fetal development, and that offspring showed impairments in anxiety as well as learning and memory, accompanied by impairments in hippocampal synaptic ultrastructure and synaptic plasticity. In addition, the IP3R-GRP75-VDAC1 apoptogenic pathway was also upregulated, and in vitro models showed that inhibition of this pathway alleviated neuronal apoptosis as well as synaptic plasticity damage. In conclusion, maternal Cy exposure during pregnancy can cause neurobehavioral abnormalities and synaptic damage in offspring, which may be related to neuronal apoptosis induced by activation of the IP3R-GRP75-VDAC1 pathway in the hippocampus of offspring. Our findings provide clues to understand the neurotoxicity mechanism of maternal Cy exposure to offspring during pregnancy.

AB  - CRISPR/Cas9 technology is a powerful tool used for genome manipulation in different cell types and species. However, as with all new technologies, it still requires improvements. Different factors can affect CRISPR/Cas efficiency in zygotes, which influence the total cost and complexity for creating large-animal models for research. This study evaluated the importance of zygote cell cycle stage between early-injection (within 6 h post activation/fertilization) versus late-injection (14-16 h post activation/fertilization) when the CRISPR/Cas9 components were injected and the inhibition of the homologous recombination (HR) pathway of DNA repair on gene editing, embryo survival and development on embryos produced by fertilization, sperm injection, somatic cell nuclear transfer, and parthenogenetic activation technologies. Injections at the late cell cycle stage decreased embryo survival (measured as the proportion of unlysed embryos) and blastocyst formation (68.2%; 19.3%) compared to early-stage injection (86.3%; 28.8%). However, gene editing was higher in blastocysts from late-(73.8%) vs. early-(63.8%) injected zygotes. Inhibition of the HR repair pathway increased gene editing efficiency by 15.6% in blastocysts from early-injected zygotes without compromising embryo development. Our finding shows that injection at the early cell cycle stage along with HR inhibition improves both zygote viability and gene editing rate in pig blastocysts.

AB  - Depression is a devastating mood disorder affecting more than 300 million people worldwide. Almost 30 % of patients still suffer from treatment resistant depression. Although many reports support the involvement of orexin in the pathophysiology of depression, the precise role of orexin is still unclear. In this study, we evaluated the role of the orexin 1 receptor (Orx1R) on depressive behaviors and the alterations in postsynaptic density-95 (PSD-95) protein in the chronic mild stress (CMS) model of depression. Fifty-four male Wistar rats were randomly allocated to 6 groups; Control, CMS, acute SB-334867 (SB), CMS+SB, chronic SB (CSB) and CMS+CSB. Rats were exposed to one or two unpredictable stressors each day for three weeks for the induction of CMS. Intra-cerebroventricular (icv) injection of SB-334867, a selective Orx1R antagonist, was performed either 30 min before behavioral tests (acute) or once daily for 14 days (chronic). Behavioral despair was assessed by immobility time in the forced swim test (FST), sucrose consumption in sucrose preference test (SPT), and the number of crosses in the open field test (OFT) on days 1, 11, and 22 of the experiment. Finally, rats were decapitated, and brain tissue of the hippocampus (HPC) and prefrontal cortex (PFC) were collected, and the relative expression of PSD-95 was evaluated by western blotting. The CMS model rats showed a significant increase in FST immobility time (P = 0.001) and a decrease in locomotion (P = 0.04) and sucrose preference (P = 0.039). Chronic appli-cation of SB decreased immobility time to the control values (P = 0.001) and diminished locomotion (P = 0.047) and sucrose preference (P = 0.042) in comparison to the CMS group. Acute SB reversed just the immobility time (P <= 0.006). Chronic SB treatment increased the relative PSD-95 expression in PFC (P = 0.001). Hence, chronic antagonism of Orx1R alleviates depressive behaviors induced by CMS and improves PSD-95 expression in PFC.

AB  - The DHRS3 gene, a member of the short-chain dehydrogenase/reductase (SDR) family, is involved in critical metabolic processes in animals. This study investigated the expression patterns of DHRS3 across various tissues of developmental stages in pigs and preliminarily evaluated its effects on myoblast proliferation, apoptosis, and differentiation. RT-qPCR (real-time quantitative PCR) was employed to analyze DHRS3 expression in the heart, liver, spleen, lungs, kidneys, longissimus dorsi, foreleg, and hind leg of pigs at 3 days, 6 months, and 12 months of age. Cell proliferation was analyzed using EdU (5-ethynyl-2 '-deoxyuridine) assays, RT-qPCR, and flow cytometry, while the expression changes of proliferation-, apoptosis-, and differentiation-related genes were assessed via RT-qPCR. The results indicated that DHRS3 was expressed in all eight tissues at all three developmental stages. At 3 days, DHRS3 expression was the highest in the kidneys; at 6 months, it peaked in the liver; and at 12 months, it was again the highest in the kidneys. Across all stages, the liver and kidneys exhibited the highest DHRS3 expression levels. Functional studies revealed that DHRS3 overexpression suppressed myoblast proliferation and differentiation while promoting apoptosis. In contrast, DHRS3 inhibition enhanced myoblast proliferation and differentiation and reduced apoptosis. These findings underscore the regulatory role of DHRS3 in myogenesis and provide insights into its metabolic and developmental functions in pigs.

AB  - A heterotrophic nitrifier and aerobic denitrifier was isolated from chaff bedding of a pig farm and identified as Enterobacter cloacae DK-6. The strain DK-6 showed efficient nitrogen removal abilities under aerobic condition, with the ammonium-N (105.56mg/L), nitrate-N (101.70mg/L) and nitrite-N (86.19mg/L) removal efficiency of 86.98, 94.66 and 100% under aerobic condition, respectively. Further experiments demonstrated that the nitrate-N removal efficiency was improved and strain DK-6 preferred to utilize nitriteN when ammonium-N, nitrate-N and nitrite-N were used as mixed nitrogen sources. Nitrogen balance showed ammonium-N removal was mainly achieved by assimilation in the process of nitrification, while nitrate-N removal was mainly realized through N2 loss and hardly no greenhouse gas (N2O) was generated during denitrification. Efficient nitrate-N removal occurs at sodium succinate as carbon source, carbon/nitrogen ratio of 8-10, dissolved oxygen concentration of 4.3-5.2 mg/L, pH of 6-7, temperature at 25-35 degrees C and initial nitrate-N concentration of 50-200 mg/L. Above results suggested strain DK-6 has significant potential involving in multiple nitrogen pollutants treatment of wastewater under aerobic condition and lower carbon/nitrogen ratio.

AB  - Extensive regulation of microRNAs (miRNAs) that belong to a type of endogenous small noncoding RNAs on gene expression in sheep has been recognised. Meanwhile, utilisation of water extract of Allium mongolicum Regel (WEA) in diet of sheep has been proved to regulate fatty acid composition and flavour in mutton. However, the regulatory mechanism remains unclear. We conducted miRNA and mRNA sequencing in this study. Briefly, 30 male small-tailed Han sheep (4.5 months old) were randomly assigned to two groups. A basal diet with 3.4 g center dot sheep(-1)center dot d(-1) WEA supplementation (WEA group) or with no WEA supplementation (CON group) was fed to sheep, respectively. Subcutaneous and visceral adipose tissue samples were collected during slaughter after 75-day feeding experiment. We obtained 30 differentially expressed miRNAs (DE-miRNAs) after application of WEA in diet of sheep in subcutaneous adipose tissue. Likewise, 15 DE-miRNAs in visceral adipose tissue were identified. A total of 746 differentially expressed mRNAs (DE-mRNAs) with 90 lipid-related DE-mRNAs in subcutaneous adipose tissue and 569 DE-mRNAs with 73 lipid-related DE-mRNAs in visceral adipose tissue were identified after WEA supplementation. The intersection genes from predicted target genes of DE-miRNAs by databases and actual DE-mRNAs by mRNA sequencing were enriched in several lipid-related pathways both in subcutaneous adipose and in visceral adipose tissue. We constructed differential miRNAs-mRNAs networks by Cytoscape software. Our results will help to explain regulatory mechanism of fatty acid composition in mutton by dietary WEA and will provide a theoretical basis for rational use of the plant extract in diet of sheep.

AB  - The study was conducted on 100 unsalted goat cheeses produced on a certified organic farm. From the 100 cheeses, 10 were selected, which constituted the so-called sample day 0 (before the start of cold storage) and were divided into three groups of 30 pieces each: A-unpackaged group; B-vacuum packed group; and C-vacuum packed group with MEGA CO2 absorbing insert. The cheeses were stored in a cold store at a temperature of 4 +/- 1 degrees C and relative humidity of 85% for 5, 10, and 15 days. The greatest weight loss of the cheese was shown in group C (4.63%) and on the 10th day of storage (6.09%). The lowest pH value was recorded in groups B (6.31) and C (6.32) and on the 15th day of storage (5.48). The lowest titratable acidity was recorded in group C (14.90 degrees SH) and in sample 0 (12.40 degrees SH). The highest value of shear force was in group B (3.89 N) and on the 10th day of storage (3.56 N). An analysis of the color parameters of the cheeses showed that the L* value on the surface and after cutting was the highest at p <= 0.01 and p <= 0.05 in group C and sample 0 and was, respectively: 94.30 and 94.97 and 95.31 and 96.17. The lowest values of the sensory evaluation were obtained in the case of cheeses from group A and on the 15th day of storage, where these values (points) were, respectively: 3.32 and 3.76-color; 2.79 and 3.32-aroma; 3.27 and 3.64-appearance; 4.07 and 4.18-structure and 2.80 and 2.91-taste.

AB  - Difenoconazole (DIF) is a fungicide used to control various fungi. It is absorbed on the surface of different plants and contributes significantly to increased crop production. However, DIF is reported to exhibit toxicity to fungi and to aquatic plants, fish, and mammals, including humans, causing adverse effects. However, research on the impact of DIF on the mammary epithelial cells of herbivorous bovines is limited. DIF-induced damage and accumulation in the mammary glands can have direct and indirect effects on humans. Therefore, we investigated the effects and mechanisms of DIF toxicity in MAC-T cells. The current study revealed that DIF reduces cell viability and proliferation while triggering apoptotic cell death through the upregulation of pro-apoptotic proteins, including cleaved caspase 3 and Bcl-2-associated X protein (BAX), and the downregulation of leukemia type 2 (BCL-2). DIF also induced endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress by increasing the expression of genes or proteins of Bip/GRP78, protein disulfide isomerase (PDI), activating transcription factor 4 (ATF4), C/EBP homologous protein (CHOP), and endoplasmic reticulum oxidoreductase 1 Alpha (ERO1-L alpha). We demonstrated that DIF induces mitochondria-mediated apoptosis in MAC-T cells by activating ER stress pathways. This cellular damage resulted in a significant increase in the expression of inflammatory response genes and proteins, including cyclooxygenase 2 (COX2), transforming growth factor beta 3 (TGFB3), CCAAT enhancer binding protein delta (CEBPD), and iNOS, in DIF-treated groups. In addition, spheroid formation by MAC-T cells was suppressed by DIF treatment. Our findings suggest that DIF exposure in dairy cows may harm mammary gland function and health and may indirectly affect human consumption of milk.

AB  - Radiocarbon dating of woolly mammoths remains from the Minusinsk Depression allowed us to clarify the peculiarities and timing of the species distribution in southern Siberia in the Late Pleistocene. It was demonstrated in this work that mammoths were most numerous in the cold periods in southern Siberia, and this species reached its maximal number during the Last Glacial Maximum. At the moment, there is no single discovery of a mammoth that could be confidently attributed to a warm time interval. It is possible that, during the warm intervals of the Late Pleistocene, the conditions in the south of Siberia were unfavorable for a permanent habitat of the Mammuthus primigenius species. In general, the mammoths of the Minusinsk Depression preserve species-specific stable carbon and nitrogen isotope (delta C-13 and delta N-15) signature in the bone collagen as compared with other large herbivores. The enriched values of delta N-15 with the depleted delta C-13 were noted for them; on the contrary, reindeer demonstrate the depleted delta N-15 values and the enriched delta C-13. The isotopic signals of other species of herbivorous mammals are located between the ranges for mammoths and reindeer. A comparison of data obtained from delta C-13 and delta N-15 for the remains of woolly mammoths from the Minusinsk Depression with similar indices in animals of the north of Eastern Siberia reveals significant differences. Differences in the diet of animals in the Minusinsk Depression and mammoths of other regions are one of the possible reasons for this phenomenon. However, similar trends (relatively depleted delta N-15 values and enriched delta C-13 values) in the Late Pleistocene are typical for both reindeer and woolly rhinoceroses of the Minusinsk Depression. This suggests that differences between the mammoth remains of the Minusinsk Depression and mammoths of the northern territories in carbon and nitrogen stable isotopes are associated not only with the type of nutrition, but also with somewhat different isotopic background of the regions caused by a local environment.

AB  - Heat stress is an important environmental factor affecting livestock production worldwide. Primary hepatocytes and preadipocytes derived from Hu sheep were used to establish a heat stress model. Quantitative reverse transcriptase-PCR (qRT-PCR) analysis showed that heat induction significantly increased the expression levels of heat stress protein (HSP) genes and the N-6-methyladenosine (m6A) methylation modification genes: methyltransferase-like protein 3 (METTL3), methyltransferase-like protein 14 (METTL14), and fat mass and obesity associated protein (FTO). Heat stress simultaneously promoted cell apoptosis. Transcriptome sequencing identified 3980 upregulated genes and 2420 downregulated genes related to heat stress. A pathway enrichment analysis of these genes revealed significant enrichment in fatty acid biosynthesis, degradation, and the PI3K-Akt and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) signaling pathways. Overexpression of METTL3 in primary hepatocytes led to significant downregulation of HSP60, HSP70, and HSP110, and significantly increased mRNA m6A methylation; FTO interference generated the opposite results. Primary adipocytes showed similar results. Transcriptome analysis of cells under METTL3 (or FTO) inference and overexpression revealed differentially expressed genes enriched in the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathways, as well as the PI3K-Akt and Ras signaling pathways. We speculate that METTL3 may increase the level of m6A methylation to inhibit fat deposition and/or inhibit the expression of HSP genes to enhance the body's resistance to heat stress, while the FTO gene generated the opposite molecular mechanism. This study provides a scientific basis and theoretical support for sheep feeding and management practices during heat stress.

AB  - Diet determination of endangered species is an essential element in defining successful conservation strategies and optimising captive breeding programmes. In this study, we developed a new diet identification system, derived from standard faecal analysis, to determine the diet of an elusive and endangered herbivore, the pygmy hippopotamus (Choeropsis liberiensis). We collected faecal samples from 10 free-ranging individuals covering a combined home range area of about 50 km(2) in Tai National Park, Cote d'Ivoire. In subsequent laboratory analyses, we extracted a large number of leaf epidermis fragments from spatially separated faecal samples and compared them with a reference plant database. Using Multiple Correspondence Analysis (MCA) of epidermis fragments combined with direct visual inspection, we identified the most frequently consumed plant species, which revealed that pygmy hippopotami qualified as intermediate feeders. Their diet was based on at least seven species of monocotyledonae, dicotyledonae and fern groups, with a preference for a small number of other plant species. We evaluate the merit of our method and discuss our findings for developing effective conservation and captive breeding strategies in an endangered species with a wild population of less than 2500 adult individuals.

AB  - BACKGROUNDVeterinary antibiotics are emerging contaminants and enter into soil principally by agricultural application of organic fertilizers. This article presents the results of the research obtained for the analyzed 70 samples of fertilizers (pig and poultry manure and slurry and digestate) for various classes of antibiotics. RESULTSDoxycycline, oxytetracycline, tetracycline, lincomycin, tiamulin and enrofloxacin were found in tested samples. Doxycycline was found as a dominant compound, and its highest concentration was 175 mg/kg in pig manure. This investigation indicated that fertilization with manure, especially animal feces, might be the primary source of antibiotics. Additionally, a risk assessment based on a risk quotient was carried out, which showed that the determined concentrations of antibiotics in fertilizers may pose a threat to soil microorganisms. CONCLUSIONSResults suggested that the ecological risk effects of antibiotic contamination on soil bases and their potential adverse risk on human health needs special attention.

AB  - Since zinc oxide nanoparticles (ZnO-NPs) are widely used, concerns about their potential human health effects are growing. Although ZnO-NPs, due to their nano-size, can cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and affect brain function, the potential risk of ZnO-NPs in brain endothelial cells, the major components of the BBB, is largely unknown. In brain endothelial cells (bEnd.3 cells), ZnO-NPs were exposed for 9 h to evaluate the brain endothelial dysfunction and BBB disruption. ZnO-NPs were deposited in the lysosome and promoted ferroptosis in bEnd.3 cells. Increased oxidative stress led to lysosomal dysfunction and cytotoxicity in bEnd cells treated with ZnO-NPs.3 cells. ZnO-NPs induced dysregulated autophagy flux and hyperpermeability via intracellular iron overload in bEnd.3 cells. We developed a putative adverse outcome pathway (AOP) to understand the effects of ZnO-NPs on the function of brain endothelial cells. Our study will help clarify the potential impact and toxicity of ZnO-NPs on the brain endothelium and the BBB.

AB  - In pig production systems, weaning is a major challenge that is usually paired with social mixing and may greatly affect health and welfare of piglets. Research efforts have been devoted to characterising early predictors of weaning adaptation, but have focused mainly on aggressive and harmful behaviours, whereas socio-positive behaviours have been poorly studied. Furthermore, serotonin (5-HT), a neurotransmitter regulating social behaviours, may also be a pertinent predictor of piglets' adaptation to challenging situations. This study aimed to assess whether social behaviours and blood 5-HT concentration before weaning were associated with behavioural and physiological responses of piglets to weaning. Social interactions (social exploration, aggression, playfight, locomotor play) of 72 focal piglets from 12 litters were scored continuously for 8 h at 42 days of age. At weaning (d48), focal piglets were allocated to four pens of 33 piglets from six litters. During the two days following weaning (d49-50), social interactions were scored continuously for 6 h per day, and behavioural activities were scored with 6-min instantaneous scan sampling. Blood was sampled one week before (d41) and 24 h after (d49) weaning to measure 5-HT concentrations and health-related variables. Exploration of pen mates represented 55% and 79% of all scored social interactions before and after weaning, respectively, and play was not observed after weaning. Using a multivariate analysis paired with clustering analysis on post-weaning behavioural and physiological responses, we identified three clusters of piglets with distinct profiles of adaption to weaning: unhealthy inactive animals, healthy inactive aggressors and healthy active affiliative animals. Compared to other clusters, unhealthy inactive animals at weaning were characterised by lower levels of social exploration and aggression before weaning (p < 0.05 for both). Furthermore, piglets that explored their pen mates more before weaning were more active (p = 0.03) after weaning, while piglets that were involved in greater number of locomotor play episodes (p = 0.009) or that were less aggressive (p = 0.04) before weaning walked more after weaning. Piglets with higher blood 5-HT concentrations before weaning were less aggressive (p = 0.01) and had greater growth (p = 0.009) after weaning. Pre-weaning aggression was also positively associated with post-weaning lymphocyte count (p = 0.04), and pre-weaning locomotor play with post-weaning hydroperoxide concentration (p = 0.05), a marker of oxidative stress. Our findings suggest that pre-weaning social behaviours and blood 5-HT concentration may be relevant predictors of piglets' adaptive responses to social mixing at weaning and deserve more research attention.

AB  - Tea (Camellia sinensis), a globally cultivated beverage crop, is sensitive to drought, which can have an adverse effect on the yield and quality of tea. Azoxystrobin (AZ) is one kind of fungicide considered as an agent to relieve damage caused by stress. Initially, the response of tea plant to osmotic-gradient stress was evaluated using leaf disc assays with PEG-induced osmotic stress. The decline of the maximum quantum yield of PSII (F-v/F-m), actual photosynthetic efficiency of PS II (Y(II)), total chlorophylls, carotenoids, DPPH radical scavenging capacity, reducing power, total phenols, and the increase in MDA was observed in leaf discs treated with a gradient of PEG solutions (22.8, 33.2, 41.1% PEG, and blank). These results revealed that efficiency of photosystem II (PSII), photosynthetic pigments, and antioxidant ability in leaf discs were inhibited with an aggravated lipid peroxidation under PEG-induced osmotic stress, and indicated leaf disc assay with moderate PEG iso-osmotic condition would reflect a portion of tea plant response to drought stress. Therefore, the protective effect of AZ (0.125 and 1.25 g a.i. L-1) on tea plants suffering from drought was evaluated using leaf disc assays with 22.8% PEG iso-osmotic condition. Pretreatment of AZ (0.125 a.i. g L-1) reversed F-v/F-m, Y(II), DPPH radical scavenging capacity, and reducing power with reduced MDA in PEG-treated leaf discs, but photosynthetic pigments, total phenols, and ascorbate peroxidase activity were irresponsive to AZ. An Alleviated physiological damage in tea leaf with AZ applying was preliminarily revealed in this study. A Rapid screening of agents for tea plants against drought was developed to assist in the selection of protective agents.

AB  - In the last few years several studies have reassessed the attraction and the role of small game in the subsistence economy of hunter-gatherers across Europe and the Mediterranean region since the Middle Paleolithic. The exploitation of small mammals intensified during the Pleistocene-Holocene transition, when some unusual faunal assemblages were recorded in the Alpine arch and the Prealpine belt. In this region marmot became a relevant resource during the Late Glacial, albeit the relative foraging systems were mostly focused on the exploitation of medium and large size herbivores. In this report we present zooarchaeological data from Grotte di Pradis (northeastern Italy) which displays a faunal assemblage composed of at least 637 marmot individuals, representing about the 99% of the total remains. Taphonomic evidence suggests a standardized processing of marmot carcasses finalized to the deferred consumption and utilization of different resources. The intensive exploitation together with the acquisition through repetitive hunting events and the ecological and ethological factors proper of this animal, substantially affected its definition of prey type and its ranking in terms of energy return balance. Hence, in this particular context marmot might be regarded as a high-ranked resource, seasonally exploited within a well-established logistical mobility system which reflects a repetitive regional phenomenon peculiar of the alpine area throughout the Late Glacial.

AB  - Recently, a Y727C variant in the dual-specific 3 ',5 '-cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase 11A (PDE11A-Y727C) was linked to increased sleep quality and reduced myopia risk in humans. Given the well-established role that the PDE11 substrates cAMP and cGMP play in eye physiology and sleep, we determined if (1) PDE11A protein is expressed in the retina or other eye segments in mice, (2) PDE11A-Y7272C affects catalytic activity and/or subcellular compartmentalization more so than the nearby suicide-associated PDE11A-M878V variant, and (3) Pde11a deletion alters eye growth or sleep quality in male and female mice. Western blots show distinct protein expression of PDE11A4, but not PDE11A1-3, in eyes of Pde11a WT, but not KO mice, that vary by eye segment and age. In HT22 and COS-1 cells, PDE11A4-Y727C reduces PDE11A4 catalytic activity far more than PDE11A4-M878V, with both variants reducing PDE11A4-cAMP more so than PDE11A4-cGMP activity. Despite this, Pde11a deletion does not alter age-related changes in retinal or lens thickness or axial length, nor vitreous or anterior chamber depth. Further, Pde11a deletion only minimally changes refractive error and sleep quality. That said, both variants also dramatically alter the subcellular compartmentalization of human and mouse PDE11A4, an effect occurring independently of dephosphorylating PDE11A4-S117/S124 or phosphorylating PDE11A4-S162. Rather, re-compartmentalization of PDE11A4-Y727C is due to the loss of the tyrosine changing how PDE11A4 is packaged/repackaged via the trans-Golgi network. Therefore, the protective impact of the Y727C variant may reflect a gain-of-function (e.g., PDE11A4 displacing another PDE) that warrants further investigation in the context of reversing/preventing sleep disturbances or myopia.

AB  - Oil tea trees produce high-quality edible oils with desirably high oleic acid (18:1) and low linoleic (18:2) and linolenic (18:3) fatty acid (FA) levels, but limited understanding of tea oil biosynthesis and regulation has become a significant obstacle for the breeding of high-yield and -quality oil tea varieties. By integrating metabolite and transcriptome analyses of developing oil tea seeds, we dissected the critical metabolic pathways, including glycolysis, fatty acid, and triacylglycerol (TAG) biosynthesis, as well as genes essential for tea seed oil production. Two plastidic stearoyl-acyl carrier protein desaturases (CoSAD1 and 2) and two endoplasmic reticulum-localized FA desaturases (CoFAD2 and 3) were functionally characterized as responsible for high 18:1 and low 18:2 and 18:3 proportions in tea oils. Two diacylglycerol O-acyltransferases (CoDGAT1 and 2) that may prefer to synthesize 18:1-TAG were functionally characterized and might be also important for high 18:1-TAG production. The highly expressed CoWRI1a and b were identified and characterized as activators of glycolysis and regulators of directing source carbon flux into FA biosynthesis in developing oil tea seeds. The upregulated CoSADs with downregulated CoFAD2 and CoFAD3 at the late seed developmental stages mainly accounted for high 18:1 levels. Two CoDGATs might be responsible for assembling TAGs with oleoyl acyl chains, whilst two CoWRI1s regulated carbons from parental sources, partitioning into oil production in oil tea embryo sinks. This study provides a deep understanding of the biosynthesis of tea seed oils and information on genes that may be used as molecular markers to breed oil tea varieties with higher oil yield and quality.

AB  - Despite the ubiquity and prevalence of lead (Pb) in the environment and industry, the mechanism of leadinduced neurotoxicity in the brain remains unclear, let alone its prevention and treatment. In this study, we hypothesized that exogenous cholesterol supplementation acts as an effective remedy for lead-induced neurodevelopmental impairments caused by lead. Forty 21-day-old male rats were randomly divided into four groups and administered 0.1 % lead water and/or 2 % cholesterol-containing feed for 30 d. Ultimately, rats in the lead group lost weight, accompanied by spatial learning and memory impairments as verified by the Morris water maze test, in which the escape latency of rats was prolonged, and the number of crossings in the target platform and the residence time in the target quadrant were significantly diminished compared to the control group. Hematoxylin-Eosin (H&E) staining and Nissl staining illustrated that typical pathological morphology occurred in the brain tissue of the lead group, where the tissue structure was loose, the number of hippocampal neurons and granulosa cells decreased significantly and were arranged loosely, along with enlarged intercellular space, light matrix staining, and decline in Nissl bodies. In addition, inflammatory response and oxidative stress were significantly induced by lead. Immunofluorescence experiments showed apparent activation of astrocytes and microglia, followed by the enhancement of TNF-alpha and IL-beta levels. Moreover, the MDA content in the lead group was elevated dramatically, whereas the activities of SOD and GSH were significantly inhibited. As for the mechanism, western blot and qRT-PCR experiments were performed, where lead could significantly inhibit the BDNF-TrkB signaling pathway, lowering the protein expression of BDNF and TrkB. Cholesterol metabolism was also affected by lead exposure, in which cholesterol metabolism-related protein expression and gene transcription, including SREBP2, HMGCR, and LDLR, were downregulated. However, cholesterol supplementation efficiently detoxified the negative effects of lead-induced neurotoxicity, reversing the inflammatory response, oxidative stress, inactivation of the BDNF signaling pathway, and imbalance of cholesterol metabolism, thus improving the learning and memory ability of rats. In brief, our study demonstrated that cholesterol supplementation could ameliorate the deficiency of learning and memory induced by lead, which is closely associated with the initiation of the BDNF/TrkB signaling pathway and regulation of cholesterol metabolism.

AB  - Camera-traps are a versatile and widely adopted tool for collecting biological data for wildlife conservation and management. While estimating population abundance from camera-trap data is the primarily goal of many projects, the question of which population estimator is suitable for analysing these data needs to be investigated. We took advantage of a 21 day camera-trap monitoring period of giraffes (Giraffa camelopardalis angolensis) on the Ongava Game Reserve (Namibia) to compare capture-recapture (CR), rarefaction curves and N-mixture estimators of population abundance. A marked variation in detection probability of giraffes was observed both in time and between individuals. Giraffes were also less likely to be detected after they were seen at a waterhole (mean daily visit frequency of f = 0.25). We estimated the population size to be 119 giraffes (C-v = 0.10) using the most robust reference estimator (CR). All other estimators deviated from the CR population size by ca. -20 to > +80%. This was due the fact that these models did not account for the temporal and individual variations in detection probability. We found that modelling choice was much less forgiving for N-mixture models than CR estimators because it leads to very variable and inconsistent estimations of abundance. Double counts were problematic for N-mixture models, challenging the use of raw counts (i.e. when individuals are not identified) at waterholes, to monitor the abundance of giraffe or of other species without idiosyncratic coat patterns.

AB  - The use and production of energy have a significant impact on the environment, including emissions of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. Most of the energy consumed in the world comes mainly from fossil fuel sources. In this way, international public policy agendas have been encouraging the replacement of this energy source by renewable energy sources. The energy reuse of waste can contribute to the greater energy security through diversification of the energy matrix. Thus, the objective of this study was to develop a mathematical model capable of estimating and optimizing the allocation of energy potential, from animals manure and sewage. To achieve this objective, a deterministic constructive algorithm coupled with nonlinear model parameters was implemented. Data used for waste and sewage production were collected in farms of municipality in the state of Minas Gerais, Brazil. As a result of the calculations, a total energy potential of 1913 GWh y-1. On average, the properties taken into account in the study resulted in an estimated energy potential of 17,236.20 +/- 55,137.63 kWh y-2; and those that did not have minimum potential, which economically enables the implantation of a local biogas plant, the potentials were allocated to the plants that serve a community. The average potential per plant varied between 36,792 and 54,663 kWh y-1 due to the 16 combinations between mathematical models and cases of financial analysis. A number between 35 and 52 corresponds to the number of plants that were allocated in the study municipalities and the average number of farms per plant ranged from 2.13 to 3.17. A model was adjusted to predict 92.4% of the variation in generation potential as a function of electricity consumption and farm production profit. Finally, it was validated that the perpestive of investment in renewable energy by a rural producer is dependent on the knowledge he has on the subject and on what he consumes on his property. The mathematical modeling to represent the optimization problem was implemented in a generic way, so it is capable of being applied to other energy systems, being able to point out good solutions considering environmental and financial issues. The results showed a robust, efficient, and adaptable model.

AB  - High temperatures (HTs) seriously affect the yield and quality of tea. Catechins, derived from the flavonoid pathway, are characteristic compounds that contribute to the flavour of tea leaves. In this study, we first showed that the flavonoid content of tea leaves was significantly reduced under HT conditions via metabolic profiles; and then demonstrated that two transcription factors, CsHSFA1b and CsHSFA2 were activated by HT and negatively regulate flavonoid biosynthesis during HT treatment. Jasmonate (JA), a defensive hormone, plays a key role in plant adaption to environmental stress. However, little has been reported on its involvement in HT response in tea. Herein, we demonstrated that CsHSFA1b and CsHSFA2 activate CsJAZ6 expression through directly binding to heat shock elements in its promoter, and thereby repress the JA pathway. Most secondary metabolites are regulated by JA, including catechin in tea. Our study reported that CsJAZ6 directly interacts with CsEGL3 and CsTTG1 and thereby reduces catechin accumulation. From this, we proposed a CsHSFA-CsJAZ6-mediated HT regulation model of catechin biosynthesis. We also determined that negative regulation of the JA pathway by CsHSFAs and its homologues is conserved in Arabidopsis. These findings broaden the applicability of the regulation of JAZ by HSF transcription factors and further suggest the JA pathway as a valuable candidate for HT-resistant breeding and cultivation.

AB  - Decellularization in tissue engineering preserves the extracellular matrix for the development of bioequivalent tissues. Detergent-based decellularization protocols can adversely affect the extracellular matrix (ECM) by destroying structural proteins. Furthermore, some of them are associated with residual cytotoxicity. The freezethaw method is not toxic, but the influence of its parameters on the results of the treatment has not been studied. This study explores the influence of a wide range of parameters of freeze-thaw protocols on the efficacy of decellularization and structural and mechanical properties of the ECM. The samples of sheep pericardium were decellularized in liquid nitrogen and phosphate-buffered saline for 5-50 cycles and subjected to histological and immunofluorescence analysis and tensile testing. A local decellularization was prominent for protocols with 20 and 30 cycles with 2-minute freezing and 2 or 5-minute thawing. Increasing the freeze-thaw duration to 5 or 10 min did not improve the results, and all the protocols with a low number of cycles did not result in effective decellularization. The ECM was well preserved and its mechanical properties were not significantly altered. One of the protocols resulted in sufficient decellularization which demonstrates the ability to successfully decellularize tissue and highlights the further need to investigate the influencing factors.

AB  - Data on the long-term consequences of a single episode of generalized seizures in infants are inconsistent. In this study, we examined the effects of pentylenetetrazole-induced generalized seizures in three-week-old rats. One month after the seizures, we detected a moderate neuronal loss in several hippocampal regions: CA1, CA3, and hilus, but not in the dentate gyrus. In addition, long-term synaptic potentiation (LTP) was impaired. We also found that the mechanism of plasticity induction was altered: additional activation of metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluR1) is required for LTP induction in experimental rats. This disturbance of the plasticity induction mechanism is likely due to the greater involvement of perisynaptic NMDA receptors compared to receptors located in the core part of the postsynaptic density. This hypothesis is supported by experiments with selective blockades of core-located NMDA receptors by the use-dependent blocker MK-801. MK-801 had no effect on LTP induction in experimental rats and suppressed LTP in control animals. The weakening of the function of core-located NMDA receptors may be due to the disturbed clearance of glutamate from the synaptic cleft since the distribution of the astrocytic glutamate transporter EAAT2 in experimental animals was found to be altered.

AB  - Background: Gallstone formation is a common digestive ailment, with unclear mechanisms underlying its development. Dysfunction of the gallbladder smooth muscle (GSM) may play a crucial role, particularly with a high-fat diet (HFD). This study aimed to investigate the effects of an HFD on GSM and assess how it alters contractility through changes in the extracellular matrix (ECM).Methods: Guinea pigs and C57BL/6 mice were fed either an HFD or normal diet (ND). Primary cultures of their (guinea pigs) gallbladder smooth muscle cells (GSMCs) were used for in vitro experiments. Histological stains, RNA-sequencing, bioinformatics analysis, three-dimensional tissue culture, real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR), Western blot, atomic force microscopy, and muscle tension measurements were performed.Results: Histological evidence indicated structural changes in the gallbladder muscle layer and ECM collagen deposition in the HFD group. The HFD group also showed increased expression of collagen, integrin family, and matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) and the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)-protein kinase B (PKB/Akt) signaling pathway. Compared with GSMCs cultured on Matrigel containing 1 mg/mL of collagen I, those cultured with 2 mg/mL showed a phenotype change from contractile to synthetic cells. Consistent with these findings, the HFD group also demonstrated increased ECM stiffness and decreased smooth muscle contractility.Conclusions: Our findings reveal a mechanism by which an HFD alters the ECM composition of the gallbladder muscle, activating the integrin/PI3K-Akt/MMP signaling pathway, thereby impacting GSMC phenotype and contractility. These insights enhance the understanding of gallstone formation mechanism and provide potential therapeutic targets to treat gallbladder dysfunction.

AB  - This article is the second part of the series analyzing the families recorded from 160 real cases in Switzerland between 1993 and 2007, focusing on species from orders Coleoptera, Hymenoptera, and Lepidoptera. A total of 46 distinct taxonomical units belonging to 15 families were identified. The most prominent was subfamily Silphinae with 9 recorded species, which was also the most dominant group in the dataset, occurring in 17.6% of all cases. It was closely followed by Dermestidae (12.6%), Histeridae (12.6%), and Staphylinidae (excluding Silphinae) (11.9%). The study highlights the importance and utility of a number of lesser-known species, at least in a forensic context, and gives insight into their ecology. We firmly believe that all insects matter. While not every species may become widely used, the more we learn about them, the greater the benefits for future criminal investigations.

AB  - Groundwater in the desert zone is important for supporting all life forms in these regions. This research focused on analyzing the quality of groundwater and the threats posed by nitrate contamination in the Continental Intercalary Aquifer (CI) in the Adrar region. Twenty-five groundwater samples were collected and assessed for pH, electrical conductivity, and major ions, employing hydrochemical diagrams, multivariate statistical analysis, and indices such as the Pollution Index of Groundwater (PIG), Nitrate Pollution Index (NPI), and Health Risk Assessment (HRA).The findings revealed the typical order of ion concentrations: Na+ > Ca2+ > Mg2+ > K+ for cations and Cl- > SO42- > HCO3- > NO3- for anions. These concentrations result from natural processes like evaporation and the dissolution of evaporites, along with anthropogenic influences, primarily from agricultural and urban sources. The PIG values categorized 28% of samples as having insignificant pollution, 48% as low, and 24% as high. Moreover, NPI results showed that 24% of samples had insignificant pollution, 44% displayed mild pollution, and 32% were moderately polluted. The Health Risk Assessment highlighted significant non-carcinogenic risks due to nitrate exposure. Hazard quotient values exceeded the safe threshold of 1 in 80% of samples for infants, 76% for children, and 64% for adults, indicating significant health risks. These findings underscore the critical need for targeted treatment strategies to ensure safe drinking water for the region's population. This comprehensive analysis demonstrates the critical interplay between natural and human factors in shaping groundwater quality and emphasizes the importance of continued monitoring and intervention to protect public health.

AB  - Streptococcus suis (S. suis) is a major swine pathogen throughout the world as well as an emerging zoonotic agent. Among the symptoms caused by S. suis, including septicemia, pneumonia, endo-carditis, arthritis, and meningitis, the latter is the most overlooked. In the present study, we explored the mechanism of action of berberine against S. suis meningitis by obtaining berberine-related action targets, porcine S. suis meningitis targets, and human S. suis meningitis targets from open databases. We constructed a protein-protein interaction (PPI) network by using the STRING database and employed Cytoscape 3.8.0 to screen for core targets. We performed Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) enrichment analyses through DAVID. We identified 31 potential targets of berberine, of which Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), fibronectin 1 (FN1), superoxide dismutase (SOD1), and catalase (CAT) were the four most critical targets. GO analysis revealed the enrichment of terms related to the response to oxidative stress and the inflammatory response. KEGG analysis revealed the enrichment of the interleukin 17 (IL-17), phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)-Akt, TLR, tumor necrosis factor (TNF), and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathways. In addition, the admetSAR results showed that berberine can cross the blood-brain barrier. The molecular docking results indicated key binding activity between TLR4-berberine and FN1-berberine. In summary, berberine protects against Streptococcus suis meningitis by regulating inflammatory response and oxidative stress in humans and pigs. Our study updates the current knowledge of the targets of S. suis meningitis to exploit new drugs in humans and pigs, to develop environmentally friendly and antibiotic-free animal-derived food products, and to improve the farming industry and economic development.

AB  - Herbivory severely affects plant growth, posing a threat to crop production. Calcium ion (Ca2+) signaling and accumulation of jasmonates (JAs) are activated in plant response to herbivore attack, leading to the expression of defense pathways. However, little is known about how the Ca2+ signal modulates JA biosynthesis. We used diverse techniques, including CRISPR/Cas9, UPLC-MS/MS and molecular biology methods to explore the role of ETHYLENE RESPONSE FACTOR 16 in Ca2+ signal-triggered JA burst during herbivore defense in tomato. Here we show that simulated herbivory induces GLUTAMATE RECEPTOR LIKE3.3/3.5 (GLR3.3/3.5)-dependent increases in electrical activity, Ca2+ influx and increases the abundance of CALMODULIN2 (CaM2) and ERF16 transcripts in tomato. The interaction between CaM2 and ERF16 promotes JA biosynthesis by enhancing the transcriptional activity of ERF16, which increases the activation of ERF16 expression and causes expression of LIPOXYGENASE D (LOXD), AOC and 12-OXO-PHYTODIENOIC ACID REDUCTASE 3 (OPR3), the key genes in JA biosynthesis. Mutation of CaM2 results in decreased JA accumulation, together with the expression of JA biosynthesis-related genes, leading to reduced resistance to the cotton bollworm Helicoverpa armigera. These findings reveal a molecular mechanism underpinning the Ca2+ signal-initiated systemic JA burst and emphasize the pivotal role of Ca2+ signal/ERF16 crosstalk in herbivore defense.

AB  - Arsenic (As) in sewage sludge poses a significant threat to environmental and human health, which has attracted widespread attention. This study investigated the value of adding sodium percarbonate (SP) on phosphorus (P) availability and As efflux detoxification through HS -P -As interactions. Due to the unique structure of humus (HS) and the similar chemical properties of P and As, the conditions for HS -P -As interaction are provided. This study discussed the content, morphology and microbial communities of HS, P and As by using metagenomic and correlation analysis. The results showed that the humification index in the experiment group (SPC) was 2.34 times higher than that in the control group (CK). The available phosphorus (AP) content of SPC increased from 71.09 mg/kg to 126.14 mg/kg, and SPC was 1.11 times that of CK. The relative abundance of ACR3/ArsB increased. Pst , Actinomyces and Bacillus commonly participated in P and As conversion. The correlation analysis revealed that the humification process was enhanced, the AP was strengthened, and the As was efflux detoxified after SP amendment. All in all, this study elucidated the key mechanism of HS -P -As interaction and put forward a new strategy for sewage sludge resource utilization and detoxification.

AB  - Marine mammals are a diverse group of aquatic animals that exhibit wide variation in body size, living conditions, breeding habitat, social behaviour and phylogeny. Although case studies about prenatal investment in cetaceans and pinnipeds have been investigated, comparative studies across different marine mammal taxonomic groups have not yet been conducted systematically. Here, six life history parameters from 75 marine mammal species were collected based on a meta-analysis of the existing literature, and prenatal investment patterns for different taxonomic groups were explored using an unsupervised artificial neural network of a self-organizing map (SOM). Most marine mammal species can be clearly divided into two clusters of small-bodied taxa (small-bodied toothed whales, pinnipeds) and large-bodied taxa (baleen whales, sperm whales and beaked whales, large-bodied toothed whales) based on their distribution within SOM feature maps. Gestation periods and breeding intervals are significantly shorter in pinnipeds than in small-bodied toothed dolphins despite being similar in body size, indicating their adaption to birthing and nursing on land or ice floes. Specific deep-dive feeding behaviour seems to have no impact on the prenatal investment of beaked whales and sperm whales, as these species exhibit a similar capital breeding strategy to baleen whales. Medium-bodied sirenians adopt an intermediate strategy between small-bodied and large-bodied toothed whales, suggesting their prenatal investment strategy is not affected by herbivorous habits. Overall, our results support the body-size hypothesis and breeding-substrate hypothesis and indicate that prenatal investment strategies of marine mammals are possibly not influenced by feeding habits or social behaviour. We suggest that effective conservation measures for small-bodied toothed whales and pinnipeds should prioritize the protection of habitats and minimize human disturbance, whereas conservation measures for large-bodied whales and beaked whales should focus on strategies to prevent substantial declines in population size.

AB  - Mammals tend to align their most energetically demanding phenological events with periods of peak resource availability. Their reproductive phenology is influenced by local resource availability, potentially leading to geographical variation in their breeding strategy. Although the Amazon is the world's epicenter of bat diversity, the reproductive phenology of Amazonian bats remains poorly known. Seasonality induces fluctuations in resource availability and most phyllostomid species, crucial agents of seed dispersal, pollination and arthropod suppression in the Neotropics, have been described to exhibit seasonal bimodal polyestry. However, current understanding of phyllostomid reproductive phenology is impaired by the paucity of comparative examinations of the phenologies of sympatric species, using consistent classification schemes based on the number and timing of annual peaks in pregnancy and lactation. Using a multi-year dataset from Central Amazonia, we examined the reproductive phenology of nine bat species (Artibeus concolor, A. obscurus, A. lituratus, Carollia brevicauda, C. perspicillata, Gardnerycteris crenulatum, Lophostoma silvicolum, Rhinophylla pumilio, and Trachops cirrhosus), as well as two feeding ensembles (i.e., frugivores and gleaning animalivores). Only three of the nine species exhibited a bimodal reproductive phenology. Six species and the frugivore ensemble showed unimodal reproductive phenology, while gleaning animalivores displayed an amodal pregnancy pattern. All species except L. silvicolum had their primary pregnancy peak during the mid-dry season. A reproductive peak during the early wet season, or local variation in the duration of the fruiting season may explain the deviation of our observations from the expected bimodal polyestry.

AB  - Heart failure is a leading cause of mortality worldwide, with myocardial injury as a major pathological contributor. Probiotics have shown cardioprotective effects, but their key gut metabolites remain unclear. In this study, Lacticaseibacillus paracasei DACN528, isolated from traditional fermented yak yogurt, significantly improved body weight (13.95% increase) and heart index (18.73% increase) and reduced serum cTnI and NT-proBNP levels by 54.96 and 22.05%, respectively, in a doxorubicin-induced mouse model of myocardial injury (all p < 0.05). Electrocardiographic abnormalities were attenuated, including reductions in QT interval (29.13%), PR interval (7.98%), and ST segment elevation (28.74%). Histological analyses revealed reduced myocardial fibrosis and apoptosis, with regulation of fibrosis- and apoptosis-related genes. DACN528 also modulated mitochondrial dynamics and autophagy by altering expression of Fis1, Drp1, Mfn2, and Parkin. Moreover, it reshaped gut microbiota composition by increasing beneficial taxa such as Lactobacillus and norank_f__Muribaculaceae while decreasing harmful ones such as Allobaculum. Metabolomic and correlation analyses identified seven microbial metabolites potentially involved in cardioprotection. Among them, 5-hydroxymethylfurfural showed protective effects in H9C2 cardiomyocytes. These findings provide mechanistic insights into probiotic-mediated myocardial protection and support DACN528 as a promising candidate for cardiovascular health interventions.

AB  - Broiler litter is a major source of ammonia (NH3) emissions in poultry production systems, negatively impacting both animal welfare and worker health. This study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of chemical additives in reducing NH3 volatilization and to identify the optimal application dosage for practical use. The research was conducted in two phases. In Phase I, four additives - aluminum sulfate (Al2(SO4)3), clinoptilolite zeolite, sodium bisulfate (NaHSO4), and magnesium sulfate (MgSO4) - were applied to spent broiler litter. Among them, NaHSO4 demonstrated the highest NH3 reduction efficiency (76.7 %). In Phase II, varying dosages of sodium bisulfate (2.5 %, 5 %, 7.5 %, and 10 % w/w) were tested, with the 7.5 % application achieving the highest mitigation performance (95.0 %). Additionally, sodium bisulfate treatment improved the ammonium nitrogen content of the litter, enhancing its agronomic value as a potential organic fertilizer. The findings highlight sodium bisulfate as a promising strategy for reducing NH3 emissions, offering both environmental and economic benefits. This approach may enhance air quality in poultry houses. It can also increase the nutrient value of litter, contributing to sustainable crop production. The laboratory-scale results offer a strong basis for future field studies. These studies are needed to validate the method under commercial production conditions.

AB  - The potential of probiotics to benefit digestion hasbeen widelyreported, while its utilization in high-risk patients and potentialadverse reactions have focused interest on postbiotics. A variabledata-independent acquisition (vDIA)-based spatial-omics strategy integratedwith unsupervised variational autoencoders was applied to profilethe functional mechanism underlying the action of Lactobacilluscasei-derived postbiotic supplementation in goat milkdigestion in an infant digestive system, from a metabolomics-peptidomics-proteomicsperspective. Amide and olefin derivatives were proved to elevate theactivities of pepsin and trypsin through hydrogen bonding and hydrophobicforces based on allosteric effects, and recognition of nine endopeptidasesand their cleavage to serine, proline, and aspartate were introducedby postbiotics, thereby promoting the generation of hydrophilic peptidesand elevating the bioaccessibility of goat milk protein. The peptidesoriginating from & alpha;s1-casein, & beta;-casein, & beta;-lactoglobulin,Ig-like domain-containing protein, & kappa;-casein, and serum amyloidA protein, with multiple bioactivities including angiotensin I-convertingenzyme (ACE)-inhibitory, osteoanabolic, dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPP-IV)inhibitory, antimicrobial, bradykinin-potentiating, antioxidant, andanti-inflammatory activities, were significantly increased in thepostbiotic supplementation group, which was also considered to potentiallyprevent necrotizing enterocolitis through inhibiting the multiplicationof pathogenic bacteria and blocking signal transducer and activatorof transcription 1 and nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer ofactivated B cells inflammatory pathways. This research deepened theunderstanding of the mechanism underlying the postbiotics affectinggoat milk digestion, which established a critical groundwork for theclinical application of postbiotics in infant complementary foods.

AB  - Endophytes play a pivotal role in plant growth, metabolism, and defense mechanisms. Many of these endophytes are known to promote plant growth and/or contribute in stress alleviation by producing an array of secondary metabolites and phytohormones. In agroecosystem, plants are continuously exposed to various biotic stressors which affect their growth and development as well as quality and quantity of the crop. This study for the first time, focuses on the growth promoting bacterial potential of endophytes in enhancing plant resistance against the polyphagous pest Spodoptera litura in Brassica juncea (Indian mustard). A total of the 30 bacterial and fungal endophytes were isolated from B. juncea and ten isolates namely, Acinetobacter sp. WEL105, Acinetobacter sp. WEL1051, Acinetobacter sp. WEL1052, Acinetobacter sp. WEL1072 and Acinetobacter sp. BJWEL1, Zasmidium sp. PWEL1031, Cladosporium sp. PWEL1032, Cladosporium sp. PWEL1033, Cladosporium sp. PWEL1034 and Cladosporium sp. PWEL104 were shortlisted based on their plant growth-promoting potential. Among these, Acinetobacter sp. WEL1072 and Acinetobacter sp. BJWEL1 supplementation showed significant increase in biomass, phytohormones production (indole acetic acid and gibberellic acid), phenol and condensed tannins concentrations. Endophyte-treated plants exhibited improved biomass and increased production of defence compounds, namely phenols, condensed tannins and serine protease inhibitors. Our study thus highlights the dual potential of endophytes in enhancing plant growth and strengthening defence mechanisms, thus offering a sustainable approach to agricultural pest management.

AB  - Microglia activation-induced neuroinflammation is a risk factor for cognitive dysfunction in the hippocampus during the early stages of neurodegenerative diseases. Exercise is an intrinsic remedy that plays a crucial role in enhancing the survival of neurons and reducing neuroinflammation in the brain. Among these theories, alterations in intracellular signaling pathways associated with neuronal growth and inflammation have been emphasized. Based on these observations and recent evidence demonstrating the beneficial effects of exercise on suppressing brain inflammation in the elderly, we examined cellular signaling pathways in the hippocampal formation of D-galactose-induced accelerated aging mice that underwent 8 weeks of treadmill exercise. To accomplish this, we utilized immunohistochemistry and Western blotting to detect the expression of hippocampal proteins, and qPCR to detect the expression of mRNA. We found that aerobic exercise significantly promoted the survival of hippocampal neurons, inhibited microglia activation, and decreased the expression of inflammatory cytokines TNF-alpha, IL-1 alpha, IL-1 beta, and chemokines CXCL-1, CXCR-2 in D-galactose model mice. Furthermore, exercise contributed to decreasing the microglia activation marker Iba1-positive cell count and average optical density and increasing the number of NeuN-immunopositive cells. Exercise also reduced RIPK1 and MAP3K5 expression in the hippocampus. Surprisingly, aerobic exercise significantly decreased the expression ratios of p-p65/p65, p-I kappa B alpha/I kappa B alpha, and p-JNK/JNK. Therefore, we hypothesized that exercise has an antiinflammatory effect on the hippocampus of mice in the D-galactose-induced aging model. This effect may be attributed to the ability of aerobic exercise to down-regulate the RIPK1-mediated NF-kappa B and JNK pathways.

AB  - A recognized risk of long-duration space travel arises from the elevated exposure astronauts face from galactic cosmic radiation (GCR), which is composed of a diverse array of energetic particles. There is now abundant evidence that exposures to many different charged particle GCR components within acute time frames are sufficient to induce central nervous system deficits that span from the molecular to the whole animal behavioral scale. Enhanced spacecraft shielding can lessen exposures to charged particle GCR components, but may conversely elevate neutron radiation levels. We previously observed that space-relevant neutron radiation doses, chronically delivered at dose-rates expected during planned human exploratory missions, can disrupt hippocampal neuronal excitability, perturb network long-term potentiation and negatively impact cognitive behavior. We have now determined that acute exposures to similar low doses (18 cGy) of neutron radiation can also lead to suppressed hippocampal synaptic signaling, as well as decreased learning and memory performance in male mice. Our results demonstrate that similar nervous system hazards arise from neutron irradiation regardless of the exposure time course. While not always in an identical manner, neutron irradiation disrupts many of the same central nervous system elements as acute charged particle GCR exposures. The risks arising from neutron irradiation are therefore important to consider when determining the overall hazards astronauts will face from the space radiation environment.

AB  - The dataset contains leaf venation architecture and functional traits for a phylogenetically diverse set of 122 plant species (including ferns, basal angiosperms, monocots, basal eudicots, asterids, and rosids) collected from the living collections of the University of California Botanical Garden at Berkeley (37.87 degrees N, 122.23 degrees W; CA, USA) from February to September 2021. The sampled species originated from all continents, except Antarctica, and are distributed in different growth forms (aquatic, herb, climbing, tree, shrub). The functional dataset comprises 31 traits (mechanical, hydraulic, anatomical, physiological, economical, and chemical) and describes six main leaf functional axes (hydraulic conductance, resistance and resilience to damages caused by drought and herbivory, mechanical support, and construction cost). It also describes how architecture features vary across venation networks. Our trait dataset is suitable for (1) functional and architectural characterization of plant species; (2) identification of venation architecture-function trade-offs; (3) investigation of evolutionary trends in leaf venation networks; and (4) mechanistic modeling of leaf function.

AB  - Major depressive disorder is a critical public health problem with a lifetime prevalence of nearly 17% in the United States. One potential therapeutic target is the interaction between hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated (HCN) channels and an auxiliary subunit of the channel named tetratricopeptide repeat-containing Rab8b-interacting protein (TRIP8b). HCN channels regulate neuronal excitability in the mammalian hippocampus, and recent work has established that antagonizing HCN function rescues cognitive impairment caused by chronic stress. Here, we utilize a high-throughput virtual screen to find small molecules capable of disrupting the TRIP8b-HCN interaction. We found that the hit compound NUCC-0200590 disrupts the TRIP8b-HCN interaction in vitro and in vivo. These results provide a compelling strategy for developing new small molecules capable of disrupting the TRIP8b-HCN interaction.

AB  - Calcitonin-gene-related peptide (CGRP) is a lateral olivocochlear (LOC) efferent neurotransmitter. Depression of sound-driven auditory brainstem response amplitude in CGRP-null mice suggests the potential for endogenous CGRP release to upregulate spontaneous and/or sound-driven auditory nerve (AN) activity. We chronically infused CGRP into the guinea pig cochlea and evaluated changes in AN activity as well as outer hair cell (OHC) function. The amplitude of both round window noise (a measure of ensemble spontaneous activity) and the synchronous whole-nerve response to sound (compound action potential, CAP) were enhanced. Lack of change in both onset adaptation and steady state amplitude of sound-evoked distortion product otoacoustic emission (DPOAE) responses indicated CGRP had no effect on OHCs, suggesting the origin of the observed changes was neural. Combined with results from the CGRP-null mice, these results appear to confirm that endogenous CGRP enhances auditory nerve activity when released by the LOC neurons. However, infusion of the CGRP receptor antagonist CGRP (8-37) did not reliably influence spontaneous or sound-driven AN activity, or OHC function, results that contrast with the decreased ABR amplitude measured in CGRP-null mice.

AB  - Glucocorticoids (GCs), a class of steroid hormones released through activation of the hypothal-amic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, perform many vital functions essential for survival, including orchestrating an organism's response to stressors by modulating physiological and behavioural responses. Assessing changes and variation in GC metabolites from faecal or urine samples allows for the non-invasive monitoring of HPA-axis activity across vertebrates. The time lag of hormone excretion differs between these sample matrices, which has implications for their suitability for studying effects of different temporal nature on HPA-axis activity. However, simultaneous comparisons of predictors of faecal and urinary GC metabolites (fGCs and uGCs, respectively) are lacking. To address this gap, we employ frequent non-invasive sampling to investigate correlates of fGCs and uGCs in wild chacma baboons (Papio ursinus) (n = 17), including long-term (dominance rank, season, female reproductive state) and short-term (time of day, daily weather conditions) factors. Correlated with increasing day length, fGCs gradually decreased from winter to summer. No seasonal effect on uGCs was found but 'rain days' were associated with increased uGCs. Pregnant females had significantly higher fGCs compared to cycling and lactating females, whereas uGCs were not statistically different across reproductive states. A circadian effect was observed in uGCs but not in fGCs. Dominance rank did not affect either fGCs or uGCs. Our study highlights the difference in inherent fluctuation between uGCs and fGCs and its potential consequences for HPA-axis activity monitoring. While uGCs offer the opportunity to study short-term effects, they undergo more pronounced fluctuations, reducing their ability to capture long-term effects. Given the increasing use of urine for biological monitoring, knowledge of this potential limitation is crucial. Where possible, uGCs and fGCs should be monitored in tandem to obtain a comprehensive understanding of short-and long-term drivers of HPA-axis activity.

AB  - The incomplete silencing of exogenous transcription factors (TFs) and the lack of endogenous counterpart activation hampers the application of porcine induced pluripotent stem cells (piPSCs). We used porcine, bovine and murine TFs to reprogram porcine fetal fibroblasts. Porcine TFs-derived piPSCs (ppiPSCs) showed the highest levels of endogenous pluripotency markers activation, were able to differentiate into three germ layers and primordial germ cell-like cells (PGCLCs) and integrated into neural ectoderm of E7.5 mouse embryos in vitro. The bovine TFs derived piPSCs (bpiPSCs) expressed endogenous pluripotency markers higher than murine TFs derived piPSCs (mpiPSCs), but both had limited differentiation ability in vitro and depended on continuous expression of exogenous TFs for the maintenance. RNA sequencing confirmed ppiPSCs had distinct global transcriptional profiling, upregulated Hippo, PI3K-Akt, MAPK and relevant pluripotency signaling pathways as porcine blastocyst inner cell mass and expressed PGC early related genes. In addition, a positive and a negative correlation between exogenous and endogenous TFs' expression level were observed in ppiPSCs and bpiPSCs lines, respectively. The TFs' protein structures in pig were more similar to cattle than to mouse. In conclusion, the species affinity of the exogenous TFs is a key element, and the own species origin of TFs is optimal for iPSCs generation and application.

AB  - At moderate to high fertilization rates, sandy-textured soils can leach much phosphorus (P) threatening surface water quality. High rates are used to compensate for P leaching, but there is also potential to reduce P leaching by using different P fertilizers. We examined the effect of poultry manure (PM), sheep manure (SM), triple superphosphate (TSP), sewage sludge of Sanandaj (SSS), sewage sludge of Toyserkan (SST), and biochars of Sanandaj and Toyserkan sewage sludges (BSSS and BSST, respectively) applied at a rate of 100 mg P kg(-1) (equivalent to 220 kg P ha(-1) yr(-1), the current regional practice for capital applications designed to raise and maintain soil P in the region) on P leaching over 10 pore volumes (equivalent to 589 mm rainfall) through a sandy clay loam soil widespread in Iran (and the Middle East). Phosphorus leaching losses decreased in the following order: TSP > SM > PM > SST > BSSS > control > SSS > BSST. The leachability of fertilized soil was best estimated by measurement of the mobile KCl-P fraction. At the capital application rate used, SSs or their biochars represented the least risk of P leaching and could be used in place of highly soluble manures or TSP to either protect water quality or maintain more P in the soil. However, this should only occur after confirming that this substitution does not impair agronomic performance.

AB  - The piggyBac+TET-on transposon induction system has a high efficiency in integrating exogenous genes in multiple cell types, can precisely integrate to reduce genomic damage, has a flexible gene expression regulation, and a strong genetic stability. When used in conjunction with somatic cell nuclear transfer experiments, it can precisely and effectively reveal the intrinsic mechanisms of early biological development. This study successfully reprogrammed black-boned sheep fibroblasts (SFs) into induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) using the piggyBac+TET-on transposon system and investigated their impact on early embryonic development. Seven exogenous reprogramming factors (bovine OCT4, SOX2, KLF4, cMyc, porcine NANOG, Lin-28, and SV40 Large T) were delivered into SFs, successfully inducing iPSCs. A growth performance analysis revealed that iPSC clones exhibited a raised or flat morphology with clear edges, positive alkaline phosphatase staining, and normal karyotypes. The transcriptome analysis indicated a significant enrichment of iPSCs in oxidative phosphorylation and cell proliferation pathways, with an up-regulated expression of the ATP5B, SDHB, Bcl-2, CDK1, and Cyclin D1 genes and a down-regulated expression of BAX (p < 0.05). Somatic cell nuclear transfer experiments demonstrated that the cleavage rate (85% +/- 2.12) and blastocyst rate (52% +/- 2.11) of the iPSCs were significantly higher than those of the SFs (p < 0.05). The detection of trilineage marker genes confirmed that the expression levels of endoderm (DCN, NANOS3, FOXA2, FOXD3, SOX17), mesoderm (KDR, CD34, NFH), and ectoderm (NEUROD) markers in iPSCs were significantly higher than in SFs (p < 0.01). The findings demonstrate that black-boned sheep iPSCs possess pluripotency and the potential to differentiate into all three germ layers, revealing the mechanisms by which reprogrammed iPSCs influence early embryonic development and providing a critical foundation for research on sheep pluripotent stem cells.

AB  - A revisiting of the Trivers-Willard hypothesis models optimal strategies for parental investment that are dependent on sex differences in the shape of offspring fitness function rather than in fitness variance, and can be used to predict the preferred offspring sex.
   The Trivers-Willard hypothesis (TWH) plays a central role in understanding the optimal investment strategies to male and female offspring. Empirical studies of TWH, however, yielded conflicting results. Here, we present models to predict optimal comprehensive multi-element parental strategies composed of primary sex ratio, brood size, resource allocation among offspring, and the resultant secondary sex ratio. Our results reveal that the optimal strategy depends on sex differences in the shape of offspring fitness function rather than in fitness variance. Also, the slope of the tangent line (through the origin) to the offspring fitness function can be used to predict the preferred offspring sex. We also briefly discuss links between the model and the empirical research. This comprehensive reformulation of TWH will offer a thorough understanding of multi-element parental investment strategies beyond the classical TWH.

AB  - The epidemiological profile of rabies virus within Mongolia remains poorly characterized despite 21,302 domestic animal cases being reported between 1970-2005. This lack of knowledge is particularly concerning given that roughly 26% of the population lives a pastoral herding lifestyle and livestock production contributes up to 18% of Mongolia's total gross domestic product (GDP). The gaps in knowledge of the rabies disease ecology within Mongolia combined with the lack of routine vaccination of domestic animals and wildlife poses a significant threat to the more than 60 million heads of livestock within Mongolia. Animal rabies case data from the General Authority for Veterinary Services and National Center for Zoonotic Diseases were used in this study. Each data point included year of report, an animal descriptor, geographic coordinates and the aimag (province) of origin. A total of 2,359 animal rabies cases were reported between 2012-2018. Cattle were the most commonly reported animal overall (861 cases), followed by goats (268), sheep (251) and dogs (221) within the domestic animal category. Red foxes were responsible for most reported wildlife cases (317) followed by wolves (151). Most rabid animals were reported in the Khuvsgul, Uvurkhangai and Govi-Altai aimags, and a positive correlation was found between livestock numbers per soum and the number of rabies cases reported. Rabies poses a significant threat to the Mongolian economy and the health of human and animal populations within Mongolia. The close association of the nomadic pastoralists with both domestic animals and wildlife represents a significant threat for disease emergence and necessitates studies that describe the ecology of rabies, which may threaten these populations.

AB  - Hypoxia-ischemia (HI) is a consequence of a lack of oxygen and glucose support to the developing brain, which causes several neurodevelopmental impairments. Environmental enrichment (EE) is considered an option to recover the alterations observed in rodents exposed to HI. The aim of this study was to investigate the impact of early EE on memory, hippocampal volume and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (Bbnf) and glucocorticoid receptor (Nr3c1) gene expression of mice exposed to HI. At P10, pups underwent right carotid artery permanent occlusion followed by 35 min of 8% O2 hypoxic environment. Starting at P11, animals were reared in EE or in standard cage (HI-SC or SHAM-SC) conditions until behavioral testing (P45). SHAM pups did not undergo carotid ligation and hypoxic exposure. Memory performance was assessed in the Y-maze, Novel object recognition, and Barnes maze. Animals were then sacrificed for analysis of hippocampal volume and Bdnf and Nr3c1 gene expression. We observed that animals exposed to HI performed worse in all three tests compared to SHAM animals. Furthermore, HI animals exposed to EE did not differ from SHAM animals in all tasks. Moreover, HI decreased hippocampal volume, while animals reared in early EE were not different compared to SHAM animals. Animals exposed to HI also showed upregulated hippocampal Bdnf expression compared to SHAM animals. We conclude that early EE from P11 to P45 proved to be effective in recovering memory impairments and hippocampal volume loss elicited by HI. Nevertheless, Bdnf expression was not associated with the improvements in memory performance observed in animals exposed to EE after a hypoxic-ischemic event.

AB  - This study aimed to highlight the low host specificity of Hippobosca equina (H. equina) that poses a danger in diseases transmission between different animal species as well as, identification of the collected flies using light microscope and molecular characterization of H. equina in Egypt. Two hundred and forty flies were collected weekly from different animal species from El-Faiyum, Al Qalyubia and Kafr El-Sheikh Governorates, Egypt at the period from May to September of 2020. Insects were phenotypically and genetically identified then classified into 170 (70.8%) males and 70 (29.2%) females. The highest prevalence of H. equina was noticed from mid-June to the end of August. The sequencing of COI gene of five H. equina fly collected from different hosts as (horse, pigeon, cattle, buffalo, and donkey) were submitted to the GenBank under the accession numbers of MZ452239, MZ452240, MZ461943, MZ461944, and MZ461945, respectively. For insect infestation control, fipronil and deltamethrin is monthly sprayed for animals, birds and their circumference give a best result in our control study in the field. Deltamethrin showed a success in the elimination process and control measures of external parasites of pigeon. (C) 2021 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier B.V. on behalf of King Saud University.

AB  - BACKGROUND Fungus-growing termites (Termitidae: Macrotermitinae) are common forest and agriculture pests. To evaluate the efficacy of termite baiting in suppressing field population of fungus-growing termites, a durable termite bait with hexaflumuron was evenly installed in a one-hectare forest area dominated by a fungus-growing termite, Odontotermes formosanus (Shiraki). Monthly monitoring of termite foraging activity on baits and wood stakes was conducted for 4 years to quantify efficacy of baits. To examine whether the hexaflumuron led to colony death, pesticides in fungus gardens of active and deceased nests were quantified using a LC-QTOF/MS. RESULTS After baiting, 50% and 90% of baits were fed upon 10 and 24 months, respectively. After 2 years of baiting, the monthly number of wood stakes occupied by termites was reduced from 34.7 +/- 1.8 to 17.6 +/- 2.5 (-49.1%), and the number of wood stakes consumed was reduced from 17.7 +/- 0.8 to 13.3 +/- 1.2 (-25.7%). Hexaflumuron was detected in deceased colonies, including five of six fungus gardens and the fungal tissue of Xyleria grown on fungus gardens, with a concentration of 0.31-20.11 mg kg(-1) dry weight. CONCLUSION This study demonstrated that durable hexaflumuron baits consumed by fungus-growing termites were further incorporated into fungus gardens, resulted in colony elimination and negative area-population effects, supporting that durable hexaflumuron baits are effective in suppressing field populations of fungus-growing termites.

AB  - Cyanogenic glucosides (CGs) play a key role in host-plant defense to insect feeding; however, the metabolic tradeoffs between synthesis of CGs and plant growth are not well understood. In this study, genetic mutants coupled with nondestructive phenotyping techniques were used to study the impact of the CG dhurrin on fall armyworm [Spodoptera frugiperda (J.E. Smith)] (FAW) feeding and plant growth in sorghum [Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench]. A genetic mutation in CYP79A1 gene that disrupts dhurrin biosynthesis was used to develop sets of near-isogenic lines (NILs) with contrasting dhurrin contents in the Tx623 bmr6 genetic background. The NILs were evaluated for differences in plant growth and FAW feeding damage in replicated greenhouse and field trials. Greenhouse studies showed that dhurrin-free Tx623 bmr6 cyp79a1 plants grew more quickly than wild-type plants but were more susceptible to insect feeding based on changes in green plant area (GPA), total leaf area, and total dry weight over time. The NILs exhibited similar patterns of growth in field trials with significant differences in leaf area and dry weight of dhurrin-free plants between the infested and non-infested treatments. Taken together, these studies reveal a significant metabolic tradeoff between CG biosynthesis and plant growth in sorghum seedlings. Disruption of dhurrin biosynthesis produces plants with higher growth rates than wild-type plants but these plants have greater susceptibility to FAW feeding.

AB  - Plants can detect herbivore-induced plant volatiles (HIPVs) from their damaged neighbours and respond by enhancing or priming their defenses against future herbivore attack. Plant communication and defense priming by volatile cues has been well documented, however, the extent to which plants are able to perceive and respond to these cues across different environmental contexts remains poorly understood. We investigated how abiotic changes that modulate stomatal conductance and/or defense signalling affect the ability of maize plants to perceive HIPVs and respond by priming their defenses. During light exposure, when stomata were open and conditions allowed for defense signal biosynthesis, the individual compounds indole and (Z)-3-hexenyl acetate primed maize defenses. Neither compound primed defenses under environmental conditions that closed stomata and/or altered defense signalling. Moreover, plants were not primed when exposed to indole or (Z)-3-hexenyl acetate in darkness (while stomata were closed) and then subjected to simulated herbivory in the light, to ensure defense induction. The full blend of HIPVs primed maize defenses in light conditions but suppressed defense induction during dark exposure and wounding. These findings indicate that environmental context is important for plant communication and defense priming and suggest that stomata play a role in plant perception of HIPVs.

AB  - It is likely that superficial corneal epithelial cells (SCECs) of the dromedary camels have a significant role in their survival at arid and semiarid regions. To the best of our knowledge, SCECs of camels' eyes have not been characterized previously using scanning electron microscopy (SEM), combined with morphometric analysis. Therefore, in the current study, we aim to describe the shape, topographical distribution, and density of SCECs associated with morphometric analysis using SEM. Twelve healthy adult camels' corneas were obtained immediately after slaughter. Each cornea has been divided into nine parts: central (C), middle dorsal (MD), middle ventral (MV), middle nasal (MN), middle temporal (MT), peripheral dorsal (PD), peripheral ventral (PV), peripheral nasal (PN), and peripheral temporal (PT). SCECs were distinguished and characterized into light, medium, and dark mosaics. The polygonal cells have been externally covered with microplicae that were more numerous above the light cells. The topographic distribution of light, medium, and dark cells revealed a well-defined concentration of light cells in excess of other cells in all parts as follows: PV (92.5%), PN (78.5%), MN (78%), MT (74.7%), PD (73.8%), PT (70.7%), MV (68.7%), MD (66.3%), and C (19.3%). The PV part recorded the highest density of light cells, while the C portion showed the lowest density for the same cells. We concluded that the light cells extensively predominate in all parts of the camels' cornea except the C part, indicating an adaptive modification to the harsh environment. Additionally, the PV and PN parts represent the permanent and endogenous source as well as a proliferative reserve for SCECs in dromedary camel.

AB  - The present study aimed to evaluate the antioxidant protective effects of the herbal extract of Crepis rueppellii (CR) against paracetamol (PCM)-induced nephrotoxicity in guinea pigs using hematological, biochemical, histological, and immunohistochemical methods. Thirty guinea pigs were divided into six groups: control, PCM (2 g/kg), CR1 group (100 mg/kg), CR2 group (200 mg/kg), CR1 (100 mg/kg) + PCM, and CR2 (200 mg/kg) + PCM. The hematological results showed that the PCM-treated groups experienced significant reductions in Hb, red blood corpuscles, packed cell volume, mean corpuscular volume, mean corpuscular hemoglobin, mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration, white blood cell, platelets, neutrophils, lymphocyte, and monocyte, in addition to albumin and total protein levels compared with the control group. In contrast, the groups treated with CR showed increases in all the abovementioned parameters. Morphologically, kidney tissues of PCM and CR-treated groups showed focal leukocytic infiltrations and extensive necrosis, while CR1 + PCM- and CR2 + PCM-treated groups revealed more pathological changes than PCM alone. The Bax immunohistochemical reaction showed strong positive reactions in both the PCM and CR-treated groups, while the CR + PCM-treated groups displayed very strong positive compared with the PCM-only group. In conclusion, the results from the hematological and biochemical parameters indicated that CR extract had an ameliorative effect against PCM toxicity.

AB  - Doppler shift compensation (DSC) is a unique feature observed in certain species of echolocating bats and is hypothesized to be an adaptation to detecting fluttering insects. However, current research on DSC has primarily focused on bats that are not engaged in foraging activities. In this study, we investigated the DSC performance of Pratt's roundleaf bat, Hipposideros pratti, which was trained to pursue insects in various motion states within a laboratory setting. Our study yielded three main results. First, H. pratti demonstrated highly precise DSC during insect pursuit, aligning with previous findings of other flutter-detecting foragers during orientation or landing tasks. Second, we found that the motion state of the insect prey had little effect on the DSC performance of H. pratti. Third, we observed variations in the DSC performance of H. pratti throughout the course of insect pursuit. The bats exhibited the highest DSC performance during the phase of maximum flight speed but decreased performance during the phase of insect capture. These findings of high precision overall and the time-dependent performance of DSC during insect pursuit support the hypothesis that DSC is an adaptation to detecting fluttering insects.

AB  - The limited knowledge of genomic noncoding and regulatory regions has restricted our ability to decipher the genetic mechanisms underlying complex traits in pigs. In this study, we characterized the spatiotemporal landscape of putative enhancers and promoters and their target genes by combining H3K27ac-targeted ChIP-Seq and RNA-Seq in fetal (prenatal days 74-75) and adult (postnatal days 132-150) tissues (brain, liver, heart, muscle and small intestine) sampled from Asian aboriginal Bama Xiang and European highly selected Large White pigs of both sexes. We identified 101,290 H3K27ac peaks, marking 18,521 promoters and 82,769 enhancers, including peaks that were active across all tissues and developmental stages (which could indicate safe harbor locus for exogenous gene insertion) and tissue- and developmental stage-specific peaks (which regulate gene pathways matching tissue- and developmental stage-specific physiological functions). We found that H3K27ac and DNA methylation in the promoter region of the XIST gene may be involved in X chromosome inactivation and demonstrated the utility of the present resource for revealing the regulatory patterns of known causal genes and prioritizing candidate causal variants for complex traits in pigs. In addition, we identified an average of 1,124 super-enhancers per sample and found that they were more likely to show tissue-specific activity than ordinary peaks. We have developed a web browser to improve the accessibility of the results (http://segtp.jxau.edu.cn/pencode/?genome=susScr11).

AB  - Background: Heat stress (HS) exposure has been linked to cognitive dysfunction. In reality, high temperature does not occur alone in environment, and ozone (O-3) and heatwaves usually co-exist in atmospheric environment. However, whether O-3 exposure exacerbates HS-induced cognitive impairment and the potential underlying mechanisms have not been explored experimentally. The aim of this study was to determine the co-effects and mechanisms of HS and O-3 on the cognitive dysfunction.
   Methods: 48 Sprague Dawley male rats were randomly divided into 4 groups: control, HS, O-3 and HS plus O-3 (HO3) groups. Rats in HS and HO3 group were exposed to 40 degrees C every morning from 9: 00 to 12:00 for 15 consecutive days. While rats in O-3 and HO3 groups were exposed to 0.7 ppm O-3 the same day from 14:00 to 17:00 for 15 days. Cognitive performance was examined with Morris water maze test. Neurodegeneration, glial activation, neuroinflammation, blood brain barrier (BBB) disruption and apoptosis were evaluated by Western blot, Elisa, immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence staining.
   Results: HS induced cognitive decline and neuronal damage in rats. Further studies showed that exposure of rats to HS could also induce glial activation, neuroinflammation and neuronal apoptosis in hippocampus, and decrease in the expressions of ZO-1, claudin-5 and occluding, indicative of BBB disruption. Impressively, the neuronal effects induced by HS, as depicted above, could be worsened by co-exposure to O-3 in rats.
   Conclusions: Co-exposure to O-3 promotes HS-induced cognitive impairment in rats possibly through glial-mediated neuroinflammation and BBB disruption.

AB  - The historical record of releases of 288 species of weed biological control agents in Australia was analysed to examine if considering the damage/host type relationship of agents can offer insights into why some agents and not others have proved to be effective in producing partial or complete control of the target weed. Specifically, the effectiveness of agents released in Australia was examined in relation to their feeding guild and the functional group (growth form) of the target weed. Biotrophic pathogens (rusts/smuts), sap feeders and root/crown feeders were effective in producing control more often than other guilds. Effectiveness of biological control across weed functional groups was somewhat similar, although herbaceous biennials/perennials tended to be more effectively controlled than other functional groups. Significant biological control was recorded for at least one case in each of the 31 of the 37 feeding-guild/weed functional group combinations for which there were data. Possible explanations for the greater success of some guilds are explored, as are caveats with using such inductive approaches to predict effectiveness in classical weed biological control.

AB  - Fungal attacks have become a major obstacle in tea plantations. Colletotrichum gloeosporioides is one of the most devastating fungal pathogens in tea plantations that can severely affect tea yield and quality. However, the molecular mechanism of resistance genes involved in anthracnose is still largely unknown in tea plants. Here, we found that the laccase gene CsLAC37 was involved in the response to fungal infection based on a transcriptome analysis. The full-length CDS of CsLAC37 was cloned, and its protein sequence had the closest relationship with the Arabidopsis AtLAC15 protein compared to other AtLACs. Tissue-specific expression analysis showed that CsLAC37 had higher expression levels in mature leaves and stems than in the other tissues. Subcellular localization showed that the CsLAC37 protein was predominantly localized in the cell membrane. The expression levels of CsLAC37 were upregulated at different time points under cold, salt, SA, and ABA treatments. qRT-PCR confirmed that CsLAC37 responded to both Pestalotiopsis-like species and C. gloeosporioides infections. Functional validation showed that the hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) content increased significantly, and POD activity decreased in leaves after antisense oligonucleotide (AsODN) treatment compared to the controls. The results demonstrated that CsLAC37 may play an important role in resistance to anthracnose, and the findings provide a theoretical foundation for molecular breeding of tea varieties with resistance to fungal diseases.

AB  - Tenebenal, as a new insecticide, with a novel action mode, has shown an excellent insecticidal effect, but there is no relevant report about how it can effectively control termite colonies. In this study, we evaluated the insecticidal effects of tenebenal at different concentrations by laboratory study, including the contact toxicity, stomach toxicity, and other insecticide effects of Reticulitermes flaviceps. The results showed that tenebenal had no repellent effect on R. flaviceps in concentrations ranging from 0 to 32 ppm. LC50 and LC90 of tenebenal on R. flaviceps were 3.752 and 8.278 ppm when treating termites with tenebenal for 24 h, respectively. The survival rate and food consumption of R. flaviceps significantly decreased with the increase of the tenebenal concentration from 1 to 8 ppm, and there was no significant difference in concentration between 8 and 16 ppm. Tenebenal had inhibitive effects on particle transfer, tunneling, carcass-burying, and cannibalism behavior of R. flaviceps with concentrations from 1 to 16 ppm. R. flaviceps are exposed to sand treatment with 16, 32, and 64 ppm of tenebenal for 1 h, and the mortality for both donor and recipient is 36%, 77%, and 100% on day 3, respectively. These results show that tenebenal has potential insecticidal effects and could be a new termiticide for termite control.

AB  - The internal representation of a path shape is an element that constructs an internal representation of an entire route or environment. In the present study, we examined the ability of rats to discriminate path shapes. The rats learned to discriminate between an oval-shaped runway and a square-shaped one and to respond to one of two response boxes on the two sides of the runways. After the learning sessions, we tested which of the inner and outer walls the rats used as cues for discrimination using different wall shapes. The results suggest that the rats used the shape of the inner walls for the discrimination. Subsequently, the learning sessions, in which different shapes of the inner and outer walls were used, continued. There was a tendency for the rats to show better performance when the shape of the inner walls was congruent with the rule in the original learning, suggesting again that the rats used the shape of the inner wall for the discrimination. In addition, similar results were obtained when the task was conducted in the dark, suggesting that rats can discriminate path shapes using non-visual information.

AB  - Plastocyanin functions as an electron carrier in the photosynthetic electron transport chain, located at the thylakoid membrane. In several species, endogenous plastocyanin levels are correlated with the photosynthetic electron transport rate. Overexpression of plastocyanin genes in Arabidopsis thaliana increases plant size, but this phenomenon has not been observed in crop species. Here, we investigated the effects of heterologous expression of a gene encoding a plastocyanin isoform from Arabidopsis, AtPETE2, in the oil seed crop Camelina sativa under standard growth conditions and under salt stress. AtPETE2 heterologous expression enhanced photosynthetic activity in Camelina, accelerating plant development and improving seed yield under standard growth condi-tions. Additionally, CsPETE2 from Camelina was induced by salt stress and AtPETE2 expression lines had larger primary roots and more lateral roots than the wild type. AtPETE2 expression lines also had larger seeds and higher total seed yield under long-term salt stress compared with non-transgenic Camelina. Our results demonstrate that increased plastocyanin levels in Camelina can enhance photosynthesis and productivity, as well as tolerance to osmotic and salt stresses. Heterologous expression of plastocyanin may be a useful strategy to mitigate crop stress in saline soils.

AB  - (1) Background: Huntington's disease (HD) is rare incurable hereditary neurodegenerative disorder caused by CAG repeat expansion in the gene coding for the protein huntingtin (HTT). Mutated huntingtin (mHTT) undergoes fragmentation and accumulation, affecting cellular functions and leading to neuronal cell death. Porcine models of HD are used in preclinical testing of currently emerging disease modifying therapies. Such therapies are aimed at reducing mHTT expression, postpone the disease onset, slow down the progression, and point out the need of biomarkers to monitor disease development and therapy efficacy. Recently, extracellular vesicles (EVs), particularly exosomes, gained attention as possible carriers of disease biomarkers. We aimed to characterize HTT and mHTT forms/fragments in blood plasma derived EVs in transgenic (TgHD) and knock-in (KI-HD) porcine models, as well as in HD patients' plasma. (2) Methods: Small EVs were isolated by ultracentrifugation and HTT forms were visualized by western blotting. (3) Results: The full length 360 kDa HTT co-isolated with EVs from both the pig model and HD patient plasma. In addition, a similar to 70 kDa mutant HTT fragment was specific for TgHD pigs. Elevated total huntingtin levels in EVs from plasma of HD groups compared to controls were observed in both pig models and HD patients, however only in TgHD were they significant (p = 0.02). (4) Conclusions: Our study represents a valuable initial step towards the characterization of EV content in the search for HD biomarkers.

AB  - Wind, rain, herbivores, obstacles, neighbouring plants, etc. provide important mechanical cues to steer plant growth and survival. Mechanostimulation to stimulate yield and stress resistance of crops is of significant research interest, yet a molecular understanding of transcriptional responses to touch is largely absent in cereals. To address this, we performed whole-genome transcriptomics following mechanostimulation of wheat, barley, and the recent genome-sequenced oat. The largest transcriptome changes occurred +/- 25 min after touching, with most of the genes being upregulated. While most genes returned to basal expression level by 1-2 h in oat, many genes retained high expression even 4 h post-treatment in barley and wheat. Functional categories such as transcription factors, kinases, phytohormones, and Ca2+ regulation were affected. In addition, cell wall-related genes involved in (hemi)cellulose, lignin, suberin, and callose biosynthesis were touch-responsive, providing molecular insight into mechanically induced changes in cell wall composition. Furthermore, several cereal-specific transcriptomic footprints were identified that were not observed in Arabidopsis. In oat and barley, we found evidence for systemic spreading of touch-induced signalling. Finally, we provide evidence that both the jasmonic acid-dependent and the jasmonic acid-independent pathways underlie touch-signalling in cereals, providing a detailed framework and marker genes for further study of (a)biotic stress responses in cereals.

AB  - Studies of 5800 samples of bone and tooth fossils of rodents, lagomorphs, and carnivores collected from loose deposits of Chernyshevskaya-III Cave (52 degrees 38 ' N, 58 degrees 53 ' E; Kizil district, Chelyabinsk oblast, Russia) have allowed for the composition and structure of small mammal communities that inhabited the Southern Trans-Urals in the final stage of the Atlantic period (5210 +/- 90 years BP, Ki-15500) of the Holocene to be described. The communities included 30 taxa belonging to three orders: Carnivora, Lagomorpha, and Rodentia, with six, two, and 22 species, respectively. The narrow-skulled vole (49%) dominated in the species structure of herbivorous small mammal communities. Codominants were the steppe lemming and the common vole (about 11% each). Steppe (19%) and meadow (18%) groups of species were widespread at that time. Forest and riverside species were also present (about 4% in each group). The existence of the zonal steppe type of small mammal communities with significant participation of mesophilic (mainly meadow) elements is reconstructed for the Southern Trans-Urals for that time. The data obtained reveal humid conditions in the study area during the final stage of the Atlantic phase of the Holocene period.

AB  - The study was conducted in Southwestern Kyrgyzstan, which is a transboundary territory. The presence of limestone rocks from the Carboniferous and Devonian age determines the availability of many under-ground sites. These characteristics make the area an important place for cave-dwelling bat species. Assess-ment of bat abundance, species richness, and conservation priority of each cave was estimated using the Bat Cave Vulnerability Index (BCVI) for the first time outside the tropics. The method revealed that two underground sites are the most threatened and in need of protection. These caves are easily accessible and under constant anthropogenic pressure. Significant maternity colonies of Rhinolophus ferrumequinum, Rh. lepidus, Myotis blythii and M. emarginatus were confirmed in five caves. The most abundant summer colonies were found for M. blythii in two of these caves. We report for first time a maternity colony of Rh. lepidus in Kyrgyzstan due to its long-term erroneous identification as Rh. hipposideros. The results show that the IUCN conservation status of Rh. hipposideros must be reviewed and changed to "Near Threatened" or "Vulnerable" for the Central Asia region. The study will be used as a baseline for future conservation research on cave-dwelling bats and underground habitats in the region.

AB  - BACKGROUD|: To clarify the variations in flavor characteristics among various Tibetan sheep breeds (Gangba, Huoerba, Sewa, Duoma and Awang) across different mutton portions (M. longissimus thoracis et lumborum, topside, thick flank and shoulder fillet), HS-SPME-GC-MS and HS-GC-IMS were performed with multivariate statistical analysis to characterize the volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in Tibetan sheep mutton. RESULTS: The results identified 89 and 75 VOCs using HS-SPME-GC-MS and HS-GC-IMS, respectively, with aldehydes, ketones and alcohols as the primary compound classes. The main flavor characteristic substances were 1-octen-3-ol, 3-hydroxy-2-butanone, 2,3-pentanedione, acetone, octanal, 2-pentylfuran, nonanal, hexanal, 1-hexanol, 2-butanone, 1-pentanol, heptanal, 2-pentanone, 1-penten-3-ol and benzaldehyde, contributing notes of fruity, floral, grassy, caramel, baking and creamy aromas. The contributing compounds of odor activity value > 1 were successfully determined, enabling the characterization of Tibetan sheep mutton flavor profiles. Fingerprints were applied to distinguish common and unique VOCs across different mutton portions from the studied breeds. Samples were effectively categorized by principal component analysis and partial least squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) according to their aroma characteristics, and a stable model (variable importance in projection (VIP)) was established through PLS-DA, highlighting hexanal, 1-hexanol, 2-butanone, 1-pentanol, heptanal, 1-octen-3-ol, 3-hydroxy-2-butanone, 2-pentanone, octanal, ethanol, acetone, 1-penten-3-ol, 2,3-pentanedione and acetic acid with VIP > 1. CONCLUSION: The findings reveal the VOC profiles of various mutton portions of Tibetan sheep breeds, offering insights for product development and enhancing the understanding of flavor in Tibetan sheep meat products.

AB  - There is a growing concern worldwide about the potential harmful effects of anesthesia on brain development, based on studies in both humans and animals. In infants, repeated anesthesia exposure is linked to learning disabilities and attention disorders. Similarly, laboratory studies in mice show that neonates exposed to general anesthesia experience long-term cognitive and behavioral impairments. Inhaled anesthetics affect the postsynaptic density (PSD)-95, discs large homolog, and zona occludens-1 (PDZ) domains. The disruption of the synaptic PSD95-PDZ2 domain-mediated protein interactions leads to a loss of spine plasticity and cognitive deficits in juvenile mice. The nitric oxide-mediated protein kinase-G signaling pathway enhances synaptic plasticity also by activating extracellular signal-regulated kinase, which subsequently phosphorylates cAMP-response element binding protein, a crucial transcription factor for memory formation. Exposure to isoflurane or postsynaptic density-95-PDZ2-wildtype peptides results in decreased levels of phosphorylated extracellular signal-regulated kinase (p-ERK) and phosphorylated cAMP-response element binding protein (p-CREB), which are critical for synaptic plasticity and memory formation. Pizotifen treatment after isoflurane or postsynaptic density-95-PDZ2-wildtype peptide exposure in mice prevented decline in p-ERK levels, preserved learning and memory functions at 5 weeks of age, and maintained mushroom spine density at 7 weeks of age. Protein kinase-G activation by components of the nitric oxide signaling pathway leads to the stabilization of dendritic spines and synaptic connections. Concurrently, the ERK/CREB pathway, which is crucial for synaptic plasticity and memory consolidation, is supported and maintained by pizotifen, thereby preventing cognitive deficits caused in response to isoflurane or postsynaptic density-95-PDZ2-wildtype peptide exposure. Activation of ERK signaling cascade by pizotifen helps to prevent cognitive impairment and spine loss in response to postsynaptic density-95-PDZ2 domain disruption.

AB  - PremiseGlandular trichomes are implicated in direct and indirect defense of plants. However, the degree to which glandular and non-glandular trichomes have evolved as a consequence of herbivory remains unclear, because their heritability, their association with herbivore resistance, their trade-offs with one another, and their association with other functions are rarely quantified.MethodsWe conducted a phylogenetic comparison of trichomes and herbivore resistance against the generalist caterpillar, Heliothis virescens, among tarweed species (Asteraceae: Madiinae) and a genetic correlation study comparing those same traits among maternal half-sibs of three tarweed species.ResultsWithin a tarweed species, we found no evidence that herbivore growth rate decreased on tarweed individuals or maternal sib groups with more glandularity or denser trichomes. However, tarweed species with more glandularity and fewer non-glandular trichomes resulted in slower-growing herbivores. Likewise, a trade-off between glandular and non-glandular trichomes was apparent among tarweed species, but not among individuals or sib groups within a species.ConclusionsOur results suggest that this key herbivore does not select for trichomes as a direct defense in tarweed species. However, trichomes differed substantially among species and likely affect herbivore pressure on those species. Our results demonstrate that trade-offs among plant traits, as well as inference on the function of those traits, can depend on scale.

AB  - Intramuscular fat (IMF) plays a crucial role in enhancing meat quality, enriching meat flavor, and overall improving palatability. In this study, Single-cell RNA sequencing was employed to analyze the longissimus dorsi (LD) obtained from Guangdong small-ear spotted pigs (GDSS, with high IMF) and Yorkshire pigs (YK, with low IMF). GDSS had significantly more Fibro/Adipogenic Progenitor (FAPs), in which the CD9 negative FAPs (FAP(CD9-)) having adipogenic potential, as demonstrated by in vitro assays using cells originated from mouse muscle. On the other hand, Yorkshire had more fibro-inflammatory progenitors (FIPs, marked with FAP(CD9+)), presenting higher expression of the FBN1-Integrin alpha 5 beta 1. FBN1-Integrin alpha 5 beta 1 could inhibit insulin signaling in FAP(CD9-), suppressing adipogenic differentiation. Our results demonstrated that fat-type pigs possess a greater number of FAP(CD9-), which are the exclusive cells in muscle capable of differentiating into adipocytes. Moreover, lean-type pigs exhibit higher expression of FBN1-Integrin alpha 5 beta 1 axis, which inhibits adipocyte differentiation. These results appropriately explain the observed higher IMF content in fat-type pigs.

AB  - Toxic breakdown products of young Camelina sativa (L.) Crantz, glucosinolates can eliminate microorganisms in the soil. Since microorganisms are essential for phosphate cycling, only insensitive microorganisms with phosphate-solubilizing activity can improve C. sativa's phosphate supply. In this study, P-33-labeled phosphate, inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry and pot experiments unveiled that not only Trichoderma viride and Pseudomonas laurentiana used as phosphate-solubilizing inoculants, but also intrinsic soil microorganisms, including Penicillium aurantiogriseum, and the assemblies of root-colonizing microorganisms solubilized as well phosphate from apatite, trigger off competitive behavior between the organisms. Driving factors in the competitiveness are plant and microbial secondary metabolites, while glucosinolates of Camelina and their breakdown products are regarded as key compounds that inhibit the pathogen P. aurantiogriseum, but also seem to impede root colonization of T. viride. On the other hand, fungal diketopiperazine combined with glucosinolates is fatal to Camelina. The results may contribute to explain the contradictory effects of phosphate-solubilizing microorganisms when used as biofertilizers. Further studies will elucidate impacts of released secondary metabolites on coexisting microorganisms and plants under different environmental conditions.

AB  - BACKGROUND Animal handling practices are one of the factors majorly affecting animal metabolism prior to slaughter. This phenomenon increases the occurrence of meat quality defects such as dark cutting-beef, causing high economical losses in the meat industry. Under this framework, the assessment of apoptosis onset in post mortem muscle was proposed as a novel approach to reveal biochemical characteristics in several Spanish bovine breeds (Asturiana de los Valles, Retinta and Rubia Gallega) managed under different production systems (intensive versus semi-extensive) and transport/lairage conditions (mixing versus not mixing with unfamiliar animals). To do so, the activities of initiator caspase 9 and executioner caspases 3/7 were determined in Longissimus thoracis et lumborum muscle at three early post mortem times (2, 8, and 24 h).
   RESULTS Breed effect and transport/lairage conditions were the most relevant factors that influenced both caspase activities over post mortem time, showing Rubia Gallega breed a completely different behavior compared to Asturiana de los Valles and Retinta breeds. Moreover, it is postulated that apoptosis cascade is initiated via the activation of caspase 9 under hypoxic or metabolic stress followed by the activation of executioner caspases 3/7.
   CONCLUSIONS Assessment of apoptosis on post mortem muscle can be a novel approach to study the influence of animal handling on muscle metabolism and post mortem cell death and its consequences on meat quality traits.

AB  - We are reporting for the first time the nesting behaviour, nesting substrate preference, nest architecture, biology and pollen preference of a wood boring bee, Lithurgus atratus in Ipomea carnea. The bee preferred to construct her nest in the reeds of Ipomoea carnea with peak nesting activity during August (24.67 +/- 4.04 nests), September (21.00 +/- 7.10 nests), June (20.10 +/- 6.24 nests), and July (19.67 +/- 4.73 nests). A single bee constructed three cells per nesting reed that measured 2.06 +/- 0.40 cm in length and 0.53 +/- 0.05 cm in width. The duration of egg, larval and pupal stages of L. atratus were 2.20 +/- 0.91, 13.90 +/- 0.99 and 10.10 +/- 1.37 days. The peak time of pollen foraging activity of L. atratus in Abelmoschus esculentus was recorded from 8 to 9 am (1.80 +/- 0.45 bees/flower) to 1-2 pm (2.40 +/- 0.54 bees/flower) with maximum activity of the adult bee in the nesting reeds noticed at 9-10 am (2.40 +/- 0.54 nests), 10-11 am (2.80 +/- 1.30 nests). The pollen grains of five host plants viz., okra (Abelmoschus esculentus), hibiscus (Hibiscus rosasinensis), elephant creeper vine (Argyreia nervosa), Indian blanket flower (Gaillardia pulchella) and hollyhock (Alcea rosea) were identified in the scopal load of foraging bees and in the brood provisions. The scopal and brood pollen analysis indicated a marked foraging preference of L. atratus towards the flowers of Malvaceae (63.4%). Our observations are the beginning of using this bee in many crop plants for managed pollination.

AB  - The Pongo fossil record of China extends from the Early Pleistocene to the Late Pleistocene, but to date, no late Middle Pleistocene samples of Pongo with precise absolute dating have been identified in southern China. Here, we report the recovery of 106 fossil teeth of Pongo from Ganxian Cave in the Bubing Basin, Guangxi, southern China. We dated the speleothems using Uranium-series and dated the two rhinoceros teeth using coupled electron spin resonance/Uranium-series dating methods to between 168.9 +/- 2.4 ka and 362 +/- 78 ka, respectively. These dates are consistent with the biostratigraphic and magnetostratigraphic age estimates. We further describe the fossil teeth from Ganxian Cave and compare them metrically to samples of fossil Pongo (i.e., Pongo weidenreichi, Pongo duboisi, Pongo palaeosumatrensis, Pongo javensis, and Pongo sp.) from the Early, Middle, and Late Pleistocene and to extant Pongo (i.e., Pongo pygmaeus and Pongo abelii) from Southeast Asia. Based on overall dental size, a high frequency of lingual cingulum remnants on the upper molars, and a low frequency of moderate to heavy wrinkling on the molars, we attribute the Ganxian fossils to P. weidenreichi. Compared with Pongo fossils from other mainland Southeast Asia sites, those from Ganxian confirm that dental size reduction of Pongo occurred principally during the Early and Middle Pleistocene. From the Middle to Late Pleistocene, all teeth except the P3 show little change in occlusal area, indicating that the size of these teeth remained relatively stable over time. The evolutionary trajectory of the Pongo dentition through time may be more complex than previously thought. More orangutan fossils with precise dating constraints are the keys to solving this issue.

AB  - Populations occupying peripheral areas of a current species range, particularly those located at rearing edges of the distributional ranges, have a high adaptive potential to environmental changes for the species, being of key conservation importance and, simultaneously, are heavily understudied. We provide the first description of the home-range size and foraging habitat preferences of the isolated northern-most population of the Mediterranean horseshoe bat (Rhinolophus euryale) living at the contact zone of the Carpathian Mountains and Pannonian Lowland, located similar to 300 km north of the core species range. The median size of the Minimum Convex Polygons (MCP) for all individuals throughout the study was 1.8 km(2) and was in accordance with data reported for the southern populations from the range-core. The MCP median size varied between the reproductive periods, being the largest (3.3 km(2)) in the pregnancy period, decreased dramatically (0.8 km(2)) during the lactation period and then increased again considerably (7.5 km(2)) in the post-lactation period. The Ecological Niche Modelling revealed the affinity of the bats to forage in a close distance to riverine habitats, but also in villages and forest edges, while they avoided closed forest areas and open habitats. The differences in habitat use in the study area as compared to the core range populations bring an evidence of ecological plasticity of the northern marginal populations of this species and its potential to exploit human-altered habitats, such as village interiors.

AB  - Adipose tissue, an important organ involved in energy metabolism and endocrine, is closely related to animal meat quality and human health. Transient receptor potential channel 1 (TRPC1), an ion transporter, is adipocytes' major Ca2+ entry channel. However, its function in fat deposition is poorly understood, particularly in pigs, which are both an ideal model for human obesity research and a primary meat source for human diets. In the present investigation, our findings demonstrate a prominent expression of TRPC1 within the adipose tissue of pigs with a strong fat deposition ability. Functional analysis showed that TRPC1 promotes primary preadipocyte proliferation and adipogenic differentiation. In vivo, transgenic mice expressing porcine TRPC1 exhibited aggravated high- fat diet-induced obesity, hepatic steatosis, and insulin resistance. Moreover, TRPC1 may facilitate adipogenesis via activating phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase/ AKT and beta-catenin signaling pathways. Our research underscores the pivotal role of porcine TRPC1 as a positive regulator in adipogenesis and lipid accumulation processes, providing a potential target for improving animal meat quality and treating obesity-related diseases in humans.

AB  - BACKGROUNDIt is widely documented that silicon (Si) application plays a crucial role in enhancing crop resistance against pests. However, such effects have been rarely tested in a field context together with varietal resistance and related to defense chemicals. A randomized 2 x 2 factorial combinations of variety [susceptible Taichung Native 1 (TN1) and moderately resistant Zhongzheyou8 (ZY8)] and Si application (treated at 300 kg SiO2 hm-2, +Si and untreated, -Si) was employed to test the hypothesis that Si amendment interacts with varietal resistance to suppress planthopper populations and damage caused by the rice leaf folder (RLF) and the rice stem borer (RSB) through modulation of defense-related chemicals.RESULTSThe results showed that varietal resistance and Si amendment decreased the overall size of planthopper populations, with ZY8 + Si treatment harboring lower populations than the other treatments. Likewise, both RLF and RSB damage were lower in ZY8 + Si than in TN1 - Si. Chemical analyses indicated that Si supplementation significantly increased plant contents of Si, soluble sugar, carbon:nitrogen (C:N) ratio, cellulose and oxalic acid. Compared with TN1 - Si plants, ZY8 + Si plants had lower N, but higher Si, soluble sugar, C:N ratio, lignin, cellulose, flavonoids, oxalic acid and total phenol. While the accumulation of N was positively correlated to pest population size or damage, the other chemicals each showed an overall negative correlation, with Si accumulation in significant negative correlation.CONCLUSIONThe current results demonstrate that Si amendment coupled with a resistant variety suppresses planthopper population size and lepidopteran pest damage, which is achieved in association with defense-related compounds.

AB  - Marine pollution is becoming ubiquitous in the environment. Observations of pollution on beaches, in the coastal ocean, and in organisms in the Antarctic are becoming distressingly common. Increasing human activity, growing tourism, and an expanding krill fishing industry along the West Antarctic Peninsula all represent potential sources of plastic pollution and other debris (collectively referred to as debris) to the region. However, the sources of these pollutants from point (pollutants released from discrete sources) versus non-point (pollutants from a large area rather than a specific source) sources are poorly understood. We used buoyant simulated particles released in a high-resolution physical ocean model to quantify pollutant loads throughout the region. We considered non-point sources of debris from the Antarctic Circumpolar Current, Bellingshausen Sea, Weddell Sea, and point source pollution from human activities including tourism, research, and fishing. We also determined possible origins for observed debris based on data from the Southern Ocean Observing System and Palmer Long-Term Ecological Research program. Our results indicate that point source pollution released in the coastal Antarctic is more likely to serve as a source for observed debris than non-point sources, and that the dominant source of pollution is region-specific. Penguin colonies in the South Shetland and Elephant Islands had the greatest debris load from point sources whereas loads from non-point sources were greatest around the southernmost colonies. Penguin colonies at Cornwallis Island and Fort Point were exposed to the highest theoretical debris loads. While these results do not include physical processes such as windage and Stokes Drift that are known to impact debris distributions and transport in the coastal ocean, these results provide critical insights to building an effective stratified sampling and monitoring effort to better understand debris distributions, concentrations, and origins throughout the West Antarctic Peninsula.

AB  - Cold stress negatively impacts the growth, development, and quality of Camellia sinensis (Cs, tea) plants. CBL-interacting protein kinases (CIPK) comprise a pivotal protein family involved in plant development and response to multiple environmental stimuli. However, their roles and regulatory mechanisms in tea plants (Camellia sinensis (L.) O. Kuntze) remain unknown. Here we show that CsCBL-interacting protein kinase 11 (CsCIPK11), whose transcript abundance was significantly induced at low temperatures, interacts and phosphorylates tau class glutathione S-transferase 23 (CsGSTU23). CsGSTU23 was also a cold-inducible gene and has significantly higher transcript abundance in cold-resistant accessions than in cold-susceptible accessions. CsCIPK11 phosphorylated CsGSTU23 at Ser37, enhancing its stability and enzymatic activity. Overexpression of CsCIPK11 in Arabidopsis thaliana resulted in enhanced cold tolerance under freezing conditions, while transient knockdown of CsCIPK11 expression in tea plants had the opposite effect, resulting in decreased cold tolerance and suppression of the C-repeat-binding transcription factor (CBF) transcriptional pathway under freezing stress. Furthermore, the transient overexpression of CsGSTU23 in tea plants increased cold tolerance. These findings demonstrate that CsCIPK11 plays a central role in the signaling pathway to cold signals and modulates antioxidant capacity by phosphorylating CsGSTU23, leading to improved cold tolerance in tea plants.

AB  - The presence of plastic debris in the marine environment has reached massive levels in the past decades. In marine environments, microplastics can exist for hundreds of years and the presence of microplastics in this environment has been reported since 1970 and since then has been considered ubiquitous. Mollusks are being used as microplastic pollution indicators, especially in coastal areas and bivalves are more often used in microplastic-monitoring studies. On the other hand, gastropods are poorly used as indicators for microplastic pollution, even though they are the most diverse group of mollusks. The sea hares of the genus Aplysia are herbivorous gastropods, important model organisms commonly used in neuroscience studies, isolating the compounds in their defensive ink. Until today, there is no previous record of the presence of MPs in Aplysia gastropods. Therefore, this study aims to investigate the presence of microplastics in tissues of A. brasiliana found in southeastern Brazil. We collected seven individuals of A. brasiliana from a beach in southeastern Brazil, dissected them to isolate the digestive tract and the gills, and digested the tissues with a solution of 10 % NaOH. In the end, 1021 microplastic particles were found, 940 in the digestive tissue, and 81 in the gills. These results represent the first record of the presence of microplastics in the Brazilian sea hare A. brasiliana.

AB  - In the present study authors studied the effect of caffeic acid (CA) in chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS) and dexamethasone (DEXA) model of depression. CUMS (21 days) and DEXA (1.5 mg/kg x 21 days) was used for the induction of depression and anxiety related behavior. Locomotor activity was determined using actophotometer. Depression related behavior was determined using tail suspension test (TST) and forced swim test (FST) whereas for the determination of anxiety related behavior elevated plus maze (EPM) test was used. Following behavioral studies, mice were sacrificed by decapitation method. Hippocampus was dissected and was used for the neurochemical assays including 5-HT (serotonin), glutamate, nitrite and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA). The results obtained suggested that the CA (25-100 mg/kg, i.p.) did not affect the activity count in CUMS exposed and DEXA treated mice. CA (50 mg/kg) evoked anxiogenic reactions in CUMS model by increasing the hippocampal nitrite and glutamate level while CA (50 mg/kg) exerted anxiolysis in DEXA model by reducing the level of 5-HT. In CUMS model, CA exerted antidepressant like effect by increasing the hippocampal nitric oxide (NO) level, in DEXA model CA exerted antidepressant like effect by reducing the hippocampal glutamate level. CA failed to reverse DEXA mediated nNOS inhibition and therefore decreases hippocampal glutamate level to exert antidepressant like effect. Thus, CA modulate anxiety and depression related neurobehavioral alterations in both CUMS and DEXA models.

AB  - Wild alfalfa is a ubiquitous legume crop and an important feed for livestock such as cattle and sheep. However, despite its agricultural significance, the potential of alfalfa as a medicinal raw material remains largely untapped, with particularly limited research focusing on the bioactivity of its phenolic compounds. This study aimed to systematically evaluate the phenolic profiles, antioxidant capacities, and antimicrobial effects of three common wild alfalfa species to explore their potential as sustainable sources of phytomedicinal ingredients. A comprehensive analysis was conducted on the growth characteristics, photosynthetic parameters and metabolic profiles of Medicago sativa (M. sativa) L., Medicago falcata (M. falcata) L. and Medicago ruthenica (M. ruthenica) L. collected from Hulunbuir Prairie, China. Phenolic compounds were quantified using HPLC-MS, while antioxidant activities were assessed via FRAP and ABTS assays. Antimicrobial efficacy was tested against gram-positive (Staphylococcus aureus [S. aureus], Bacillus subtilis) and gram-negative (Escherichia coli, Acinetobacter baumannii) bacteria using agar diffusion and microdilution techniques. M. falcata L. demonstrated the greatest plant height (81 cm) and basal stem diameter (5.7 mm), while M. sativa L. exhibited the highest photosynthetic rate (9.3 mu mol m-2 s-1) and chlorophyll content, indicating distinct species-specific adaptations. Phytochemical analysis showed that the leaves were rich in phenolic compounds including isoliquiritigenin and ferulic acid, while roots contained substantial l-phenylalanine and trigonelline. Leaf and root extracts of three wild alfalfa species exhibited notable antioxidant capacity, with M. ruthenica leaves showing the highest activity (FRAP: 149.2 +/- 2.7 mmol Fe (II)/g DW; ABTS: 100.5 +/- 2.8 mmol TE/g DW), highlighting their potential as natural antioxidant sources. The extracts exhibited selective antibacterial efficacy against gram-positive pathogens (S. aureus, etc.), demonstrating inhibition zones of 15.2-18.2 mm and MIC values of 313 mg/mL. Phenolic compounds in alfalfa possess biological activities such as antioxidant and antibacterial properties. Many phenolic compounds are difficult and expensive to synthesize, leading to supply shortages. Alfalfa, as a common and widely distributed crop, can provide a plant source for antioxidants and antimicrobials. This study provides new guidance to meet the demand for phytomedicinal ingredients. It offers data to support the development of medicines for human health.

AB  - Antenatal inflammation/infection is a major cause of neonatal apnoea and hypoventilation. Prostaglandin E2 (PGE(2)) is a key inflammatory mediator associated with depression of fetal and neonatal breathing. We aimed to determine whether antenatal ibuprofen, a cyclooxygenase inhibitor that reduces synthesis of PGE(2), restores fetal breathing movements (FBM) in late-gestation fetal sheep exposed to systemic lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Fetal sheep (125 days gestation, d; term similar to 148 d) were instrumentally monitored for continuous measurement of FBM and physiological parameters. At 130 d fetuses were randomly allocated between groups receiving i.v. saline (CTLSAL, n = 9), escalating doses of LPS (i.v.) over 3 days (LPSSAL, n = 8), or ibuprofen one hour after each LPS dose (LPSIBU, n = 8). Regular plasma samples were collected for PGE(2) assessment. At 135 d, cerebrospinal fluid and brainstem tissue were collected at autopsy for assessments of PGE(2) expression, and immunohistochemical quantification of astrocytes and microglia within key brainstem respiratory centres was performed to assess inflammation. LPS exposure increased PGE(2) levels in plasma, cerebrospinal fluid and the RTN/pFRG (p < 0.05) and decreased the incidence, amplitude and amount of the accentuated (>5 mmHg) FBMs. Ibuprofen reduced plasma and RTN/pFRG PGE(2) expression (p < 0.01 and p = 0.031, respectively) but did not restore FBMs. Astrocyte and microglial density increased in the RTN/pFRG, NTS and raphe nucleus in LPSIBU fetuses, compared to LPSSAL (p < 0.05). Antenatal ibuprofen treatment did not restore depressed FBM, despite reducing the circulating and brainstem PGE(2) levels in LPS-exposed fetal sheep. Other inflammatory pathways or more specific targeting of PGE(2) may be more effective in preventing apnoea caused by exposure to intrauterine infection/inflammation.

AB  - Nitrous oxide (N2O) is a major greenhouse gas (GHG) responsible for global warming. Improper fertilization in agricultural fields, particularly excessive nitrogen (N) application, accelerates soil N2O emissions. Though partial substitution with organic fertilizer has been implemented to mitigate these emissions, the effect on perennial systems, such as tea plantations, remains largely unexplored. Therefore, the present study monitored soil N2O emissions for a year in a tea plantation in South China under the following treatments: no N fertilizer (control, CK), chemical fertilizer alone (CF), replacing 40% of chemical fertilizer with organic fertilizer (CF + OF), and organic fertilizer alone (OF). Our results showed that the annual cumulative N2O emissions from the plantation soil ranged from 1.03 to 3.43 kg N2O-N ha-1. The cumulative N2O emissions, the yield-scaled N2O emissions (YSNE), and the N2O-N emission factor (EF) from the soil were the highest under the CF + OF treatment but the lowest under the OF treatment. Further analysis revealed that fertilization, mainly chemical fertilization, increased the soil ammonium (NH4+-N) and nitrate (NO3--N) levels by 182-387% and 195-258%, respectively, and tea yields by 120-170%. However, tea yield decreased gradually with increasing organic substitution. These results prove that complete organic substitution reduces soil N2O emissions and tea yield and suggest adopting an appropriate substitution rate for optimal effect. Further random forest (RF) modeling identified water-filled pore space (WFPS; 20.27% of total variation), soil temperature (Tsoil; 19.29%), and NH4+-N (18.27%) as the key factors significantly contributing to the changes in soil N2O flux. These findings provide a theoretical foundation for optimizing fertilization regimes for sustainable tea production and soil N2O mitigation.

AB  - The membership of Camelina sativa in the Brassicaceae family has generated substantial interest in its potential as a high-value crop for food, feed, and fuel. Despite the critical regulatory roles played by Thaumatin-like proteins (TLPs) in plant growth and development, their presence in C. sativa has not been previously reported. Through a comprehensive analysis of the C. sativa genome, 34 CsTLP genes have been identified. The chromosomal localization and gene duplication of CsTLPs suggest that the expansion of the gene family was significantly influenced by segmental duplication, while the evolution of CsTLPs was primarily driven by purification selection. Synteny analysis indicates that C. sativa shares a greater number of homologous genes with Arabidopsis thaliana. Additionally, RNA-seq analysis suggests that numerous members of the CsTLPs gene family may potentially participate in abiotic stress. Significantly, the expression of the CsTLP29 gene exhibited a remarkable decrease in response to four distinct stress conditions. The comprehensive examination of the CsTLPs gene family suggests that these genes may have a crucial function in the adaptation of C. sativa to stress and establishes a foundation for further exploration of the TLPs gene family in C. sativa.

AB  - Osseodensification enhances the stability of endosteal implants. However, pre-clinical studies utilizing osseodensification instrumentation do not account for the limited presence of trabeculae seen clinically. This study aimed to evaluate the effect of osseodensification instrumentation on osteotomy healing in scenarios with and without the presence of trabecular bone. A similar to 10 cm incision was made over the hip of twelve sheep. Trabecular bone was surgically removed from twelve sites (one site/animal; negative control (Neg. Ctrl)) and left intact at twelve sites (one site/animal; experimental group (Exp.)). All osteotomies were created using the osseodensification drilling protocol. Each osteotomy received an endosteal implant and was evaluated after 3 or 12 weeks of healing (n = 6 animals/time). Histology revealed increased woven and lamellar bone surrounding the implants in the Exp. group relative to the Neg. Ctrl group. The Exp. group demonstrated the presence of bone fragments, which acted as nucleating sites, thereby enhancing the bone formation and remodeling processes. Bone-to-implant contact (%BIC) and bone area fractional occupancy (%BAFO) were significantly higher in the Exp. group relative to the Neg. Ctrl group both at 3 weeks (p = 0.009 and p = 0.043) and 12 weeks (p = 0.010 and p = 0.008). Osseodensification instrumentation in the presence of trabecular bone significantly improved osseointegration. However, no negative influences such as necrosis, inflammation, microfractures, or dehiscence were observed in the absence/limited presence of trabeculae.

AB  - The sustainable utilisation of black soldier fly (BSF) for recycling organic waste into high-quality protein feed and organic fertiliser with a low environmental footprint is gaining momentum worldwide. Although BSF farming is becoming a rapidly growing agribusiness, studies on the BSF farming's economic aspects are limited. This study analysed the economic benefits of farming BSF for animal feeds and composted frass, called frass fertiliser (FF) production using experimental data. The BSF larvae were fed on brewery spent grain amended with sawdust, biochar, and gypsum to determine the cost-effective feed and other by-products production. The agronomic performance of FF on the maize crop was assessed using field experiments. Our results demonstrated that sourcing and preparing the waste substrate for rearing the BSF larvae accounts for 81-90% of the total BSF production cost. The utilisation of FF as an additional value-added product would increase farmer's net income by 5-15 folds compared to BSF farming alone. Feedstock amended with 20% biochar increased net income by 10-64% for BSF larvae and FF production than other feedstocks. Production of one megagram (Mg) of dried BSF larvae (USD 900) would generate 10-34 Mg of FF worth USD 3,000-10,200. Maize grown on plots treated with FF yielded 29-44% higher net income than maize harvested from plots amended with commercial organic fertiliser. Furthermore, smallholder insect farmers' direct use of FF for maize production would generate 30-232% higher net income than farmers purchasing similar FE. Our results demonstrate for the first time the role of insect farming in circular economy and justify the opportunities for future investments that would lead to enhanced sustainability for agricultural and food systems, especially for smallholder farmers in low- and middle-income countries.

AB  - Analyzing the information-rich content of RNA can help uncover genetic events associated with social insect castes or other social polymorphisms. Here, we exploit a series of cDNA libraries previously derived from whole-body tissue of different castes as well as from three behaviourally distinct populations of the Eastern subterranean termite Reticulitermes flavipes. We found that the number (similar to 0.5 M) of single nucleotide variants (SNVs) was roughly equal between nymph, worker and soldier caste libraries, but d N /ds (ratio of nonsynonymous to synonymous substitutions) analysis suggested that some of these variants confer a caste-specific advantage. Specifically, the d(N)/d(s) ratio was high (similar to 4.3) for genes expressed in the defensively specialized soldier caste, relative to genes expressed by other castes (similar to 1.7-1.8) and regardless of the North American population (Toronto, Raleigh, Boston) from which the castes were sampled. The populations, meanwhile, did show a large difference in SNV count but not in the manner expected from known demographic and behavioural differences; the highly invasive unicolonial population from Toronto was not the least diverse and did not show any other unique substitution patterns, suggesting any past bottleneck associated with invasion or with current unicoloniality has become obscured at the RNA level. Our study raises two important hypotheses relevant to termite sociobiology. First, the positive selection (d(N)/d(s) > 1) inferred for soldier-biased genes is presumably indirect and of the type mediated through kin selection, and second, the behavioural changes that accompany some social insect urban invasions (i.e., 'unicoloniality') may be detached from the loss-of-diversity expected from invasion bottlenecks.

AB  - Livestock manure (LSM) is a profitable waste if handled sensibly, but simultaneously it imposes several environmental and health impacts if managed improperly. Several approaches have been adopted globally to cartel the problem associated with LSM management and recovery of value-added products, still, technological innovation needs further upgradation in consideration with the environment, energy, and economy. This review delivered a vibrant portrait of manure management, which includes, bioenergy generation and resource recovery strategies, their current scenario, opportunities, challenges, and prospects for future researches along with global regulations and policies. Several bioenergy generation and nutrient recoveries technologies have been discussed in details, still, the major glitches allied with these technologies are its high establishment costs, operational costs, manure assortment, and digestate handling. This review also discussed the techno-economic assessment (TEA) and life cycle assessment (LCA) of LSM management operation in the context of their economical and environmental sustainability. Still, extensive researches needed to build an efficient manure management framework to advance the integrated bioenergy production, nutrients recycling, and digestate utilization with least environmental impacts and maximal economical gain, which has critically discussed in the current review.

AB  - Microplastics have caused great concern in recent years. However, few studies have compared the toxicity of different sizes of microplastics in fishes, especially commercial fishes, which are more related to human health. In the present study, we revealed the effects of varying sizes of microplastics on grass carp embryos and larvae using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and fluorescence imaging. Embryos were exposed to 80 nm and 8 mu m microplastics at concentrations of 5, 15, and 45 mg/L. Toxicity kinetics of various sizes of fluorescent microplastics were analyzed through microscopic observation in the larvae. Results found that nanoplastics could not penetrate the embryo's chorionic membrane, instead they conglutinated or aggregated on the chorion. Our results are the first to explore the defense mechanisms of commercial fish embryos against microplastics. Larvae were prone to ingesting their own excrement, resulting in microplastic flocculants winding around their mouth. For the first time, it was found that excreted microplastics could be reconsumed by fish and reaccumulated in the oral cavity. Microplastics of a certain size (1 mu m) could be accumulated in the nasal cavity. We speculate that the presence of a special groove structure in the nasal cavity of grass carp larvae may manage to seize the microplastics with a particular size. As far as we know, this is the first report of microplastics being found in the nasal passages of fish. Fluorescence images clearly recorded the toxicity kinetics of microplastics in herbivorous fish.

AB  - The Shank3 gene encodes the major postsynaptic scaffolding protein SHANK3. Its mutation causes a syndromic form of autism spectrum disorder (ASD): Phelan-McDermid Syndrome (PMDS). It is characterized by global developmental delay, intellectual disorders (ID), ASD behavior, affective symptoms, as well as extra-cerebral symptoms. Although Shank3 deficiency causes a variety of molecular alterations, they do not suffice to explain all clinical aspects of this heterogenic syndrome. Since global gene expression alterations in Shank3 deficiency remain inadequately studied, we explored the transcriptome in vitro in primary hippocampal cells from Shank3 increment 11(-/-) mice, under control and lithium (Li) treatment conditions, and confirmed the findings in vivo. The Shank3 increment 11(-/-) genotype affected the overall transcriptome. Remarkably, extracellular matrix (ECM) and cell cycle transcriptional programs were disrupted. Accordingly, in the hippocampi of adolescent Shank3 increment 11(-/-) mice we found proteins of the collagen family and core cell cycle proteins downregulated. In vitro Li treatment of Shank3 increment 11(-/-) cells had a rescue-like effect on the ECM and cell cycle gene sets. Reversed ECM gene sets were part of a network, regulated by common transcription factors (TF) such as cAMP responsive element binding protein 1 (CREB1) and beta-Catenin (CTNNB1), which are known downstream effectors of synaptic activity and targets of Li. These TFs were less abundant and/or hypo-phosphorylated in hippocampi of Shank3 increment 11(-/-) mice and could be rescued with Li in vitro and in vivo. Our investigations suggest the ECM compartment and cell cycle genes as new players in the pathophysiology of Shank3 deficiency, and imply involvement of transcriptional regulators, which can be modulated by Li. This work supports Li as potential drug in the management of PMDS symptoms, where a Phase III study is ongoing.

AB  - Apelin is an adipose tissue-derived hormone with many physiological functions, including the regulation of female reproduction. It acts through an orphan G protein-coupled receptor APJ/APLNR. The present study aimed to investigate the expression of apelin and its receptor APJ in the ovarian follicles and corpus luteum (CL) and the role of apelin on steroidogenesis and cell survival. Ovarian follicles were classified into four groups based on size and estradiol (E2) level in the follicular fluid as follows: (i) F1 (4-6 mm; <0.5 ng/mL) (ii) F2 (7-9 mm; 0.5-5 ng/mL) (iii) F3 (10-13 mm; 5-40 ng/mL) and (iv) F4 (dominant/pre-ovulatory follicle) (>13 mm; >180 ng/mL). The corpora lutea (CL) were categorized into early (CL1), mid (CL2), late luteal (CL3), and regressing (CL4) CL stages. Expression of apelin increased with follicle size, with significantly greatest in the dominant or pre-ovulatory follicle (P < 0.05). Expression of APJ was greater in large and dominant follicles than in small and medium follicles (P < 0.05). In CL, the mRNA and protein abundance of apelin and apelin receptor was greater during mid (CL2) and late luteal (CL3) stages as compared to early (CL1) and regressing (CL4) stages (P < 0.05). Both the factors were localized in granulosa and theca cells of follicles and small and large luteal cells of CL. The pattern of the intensity of immunofluorescence was similar to mRNA and protein expression. Granulosa cells were cultured in vitro and treated at 1, 10, and 10 ng/mL apelin-13 either alone or in the presence of the follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) (30 ng/mL) or insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) (10 ng/mL) for 48 h. The luteal cells were treated with apelin-13 at 1,10, and 100 ng/mL doses for 48 h. Apelin treatment at 10 and 100 ng/ml significantly (P < 0.05) increased E2 secretion, cytochrome P450 aromatase or CYP19A1 expression in GC. In luteal cells, apelin at 10 ng/mL and 100 ng/mL significantly (P < 0.05) increased progesterone (P4) secretion and HSD3B1 expression. In GCs, apelin, either alone or in combination, increased PCNA expression and inhibited CASPASE3 expression suggesting its role in cell survival. In conclusion, this study provides novel evidence for the presence of apelin and receptor APJ in ovarian follicles and corpora lutea and the stimulatory effect on E2 and P4 production and promotes GC survival in buffalo, suggesting the role of apelin in follicular and luteal functions in buffalo.(c) 2022 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - We report a new genus and species of Entelodontidae, Entelodontellus zhouliangi gen. et sp. nov. The new taxon is represented by a pair of mandibular halves which belong to the same individual. The left mandible preserves three molars and the right half preserves p4-m3. It can be distinguished from other entelodonts by presenting a large robust posterior mandibular tubercle, and a primitive dental morphology with a distinct paraconid and hypoconulid on m3. Phylogenetic analyses were carried out. Ten taxa and 10 characters were added to a previously published total-evidence matrix to produce a more comprehensive understanding of entelodontid phylogeny. Our phylogenetic analyses reveal that E. zhouliangi is positioned as one of the most basal taxa of Entelodontidae, inconsistent with the hypothesis that Eoentelodon is the ancestor of all the other entelodonts. The phylogenetic analyses also show that the family Entelodontidae is nested in Cetancodontamorpha, which is one of the four major radiations of Artiodactyla. It is more closely related to hippopotamus and cetaceans than to Suina.

AB  - The forebrain hemispheres are predominantly separated during embryogenesis by the interhemispheric fissure (IHF). Radial astroglia remodel the IHF to form a continuous substrate between the hemispheres for midline crossing of the corpus callosum (CC) and hippocampal commissure (HC). Deleted in colorectal carcinoma (DCC) and netrin 1 (NTN1) are molecules that have an evolutionarily conserved function in commissural axon guidance. The CC and HC are absent in Dcc and Ntn1 knockout mice, while other commissures are only partially affected, suggesting an additional aetiology in forebrain commissure formation. Here, we find that these molecules play a critical role in regulating astroglial development and IHF remodelling during CC and HC formation. Human subjects with DCC mutations display disrupted IHF remodelling associated with CC and HC malformations. Thus, axon guidance molecules such as DCC and NTN1 first regulate the formation of a midline substrate for dorsal commissures prior to their role in regulating axonal growth and guidance across it.

AB  - Exposure to anthropogenic environmental chemical mixtures could be contributing to the decline in male reproductive health. This study used the biosolid treated pasture (BTP) sheep model to assess the effects of exposure to low-dose chemical mixtures. Maternal BTP exposure was associated with lower plasma testosterone concentrations, a greater proportion of Sertoli cell-only seminiferous tubules, and fewer gonocytes in the testes of neonatal offspring. Transcriptome analysis highlighted changes in testicular mTOR signalling, including lower expression of two mTOR complex components. Transcriptomic hierarchical analysis relative to the phenotypic severity demonstrated distinct differential responses to maternal BTP exposure during pregnancy. Transcriptome analysis between phenotypically normal and abnormal BTP lambs demonstrated separate responses within the cAMP and PI3K signalling pathways towards CREB. Together, the results provide a potential mechanistic explanation for adverse effects. Exposure could lower gonocyte numbers through mTOR mediated autophagy, but CREB mediated survival factors may act to increase germ cell survival.

AB  - Cryptochrome 2 (Cry2) gene regulates circadian rhythm and affects reproduction and pregnancy. Therefore, this study aimed to explore polymorphisms of the Cry2 gene and their associations with litter size at different parity in Australian White (AuW) ewes. Five putative insertion or deletion mutations within the Cry2 gene were selected to study their association with litter size. Two novel deletion mutations were identified in intronic region of Cry2 gene and were genotyped by agarose gel electrophoresis and DNA sequencing. The polymorphism information content (PIC) indicated that both mutations were low polymorphism in tested groups. Statistical analysis revealed that the P1-Del-6-bp was significantly correlated with litter size at third parity (P = 0.010), in which individuals with insertion/deletion (ID) genotype had larger litter size than insertion/insertion (II) genotype (P < 0.05). Whereas, the P2-Del-6-bp was significantly correlated with litter size at first parity (P = 0.036), in which individuals with insertion/ insertion (II) genotype had larger litter size than insertion/deletion (ID) genotype (P < 0.05). Collectively, these findings may provide new insights to expedite molecular breeding in sheep through marker assisted selection strategies (MAS).(c) 2021 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - The rupture of the Fundao dam released about 50 million m(3) of mining tailings in the Doce river basin. To assess the potential for environmental contamination and the risks of residual exposure of the human population generated by these tailings, water and fish samples from the Doce river were collected 25 days after the accident and analyzed the physicochemical parameters of the water and levels of metals by ICP-MS, in addition to the temporal variability of the concentration of these elements through other studies. This was the first study to carry out an assessment of the health risk associated with the consumption of fish contaminated by metals from the areas affected by the disaster. The values of turbidity (5460 NTU), electrical conductivity (74.8 mu S cm(-1)), total dissolved solids (892 mg L-1) and total suspended solids (772 mg L-1) were above the maximum limit allowed by Brazilian legislation, due to the presence of large amounts of solid materials released after the dam rupture. The analysis of metals in water samples indicated high concentrations of Al (1,906.71 mu g L-1), Mn (370.32 mu g L-1), Fe (8,503.50 mu g L-1) and Hg (34.25 mu g L-1), while for the fish samples, only As (1,033.98 mu g kg(-1)) and Hg (herbivorous: 505.32 mu g kg(-1); predatory: 1,184.09 mu g kg(-1)) presented levels above those established by Brazilian legislation. The health risk assessment showed that the estimated daily intake for Hg was higher than the reference dose, reinforcing the need for monitoring the area affected by the disaster.

AB  - A multiphysics phase field framework for coupled electrochemical and elastoplastic behaviors is presented, where the evolution of complex solid-electrolyte is described by the variation of the phase field variable with time. The solid-electrolyte interface kinetics nonlinearly depends on the thermodynamic driving force and can be accelerated by mechanical straining according to the film rupture-dissolution mechanism. A number of examples in two- and three- dimensions are demonstrated based on the finite element-based MOOSE framework. The model successfully captures the pit-to-crack transition under simultaneous electrochemical and mechanical effects. The crack initiation and growth has been demonstrated to depend on a variety of materials properties. The coupled corrosion and crystal plasticity framework also predict the crack initiation away from the perpendicular to the loading direction.

AB  - Ichnology, the study of trace fossils, has the potential to complement information from traditional body fossil studies. Six ichnosites, containing an array of features interpreted with varying degrees of confidence as vertebrate coprolites, have recently been identified on the Cape south coast of South Africa. They are embedded in Pleistocene deposits from Marine Isotope Stage 6 or 5e through Marine Isotope Stage 5a. Bovid, carnivoran, elephant, and reptile origins are inferred. In the majority of cases, vertebrate tracks occur in association with the coprolites. Petrography studies confirm an organic component in all samples, confirming the potential of coprolites to contribute to palaeoenvironmental reconstruction. Although initial palynology and phytolith studies were negative, a diligent search for further sites and further testing may help in realizing this potential. More broadly, the six ichnosites demonstrate the capacity of cemented dune and beach surfaces on the Cape south coast to preserve coprolites in open-air settings, compared with previously known coprolite records from carnivore dens and archaeological sites.

AB  - True sawflies (Tenthredinoidea) have a substantial fossil record but are rarely encountered in Eocene ambers. Here we describe three new taxa in this superfamily from late Eocene ambers. dagger Rovnotaxonus aristovi gen. et sp. nov. is the first true sawfly reported from Rovno amber. Based primarily on characters in the fore wing venation, we assign the new taxon to Tenthredinidae: Allantinae: Allantini. We also describe two new species of Diprionidae from Baltic amber: dagger Eodiprion pectinatus sp. nov. from a female specimen and dagger Monodiprion gladius gen. et sp. nov. from a male previously reported as dagger Eodiprion sp. by Schedl (2008); we redescribe dagger Eodiprion Schedl, 2007 and provide emended diagnoses of the genus and of dagger Eodiprion groehni Schedl, 2007. We integrate all these fossils as well as dagger Sambia Vilhelmsen and Engel, 2012 (Tenthredinidae: Tenthredininae) previously described from Baltic amber in a combined data set assembled from previously published morphological and molecular data sets. We analyse the combined data set in a Bayesian framework and implement RoguePlots to evaluate the positions of the fossils. The diprionid fossils are unequivocally placed inside Diprionidae, in a polytomy with extant members of Diprioninae; the Monocteninae, the other subfamily currently recognized in the family, is not retrieved as monophyletic. dagger Rovnotaxonus is placed inside Allantinae and shares some characters with Taxonus. dagger Sambia is placed near the base of Tenthredininae. The evaluation of the phylogenetic position of the fossils treated here will make them available for future dating analyses of Tenthredinoidea, helping to further elucidate the evolutionary history of this significant lineage of herbivorous insects. Possible reasons for the comparatively low abundance of true sawflies in late Eocene ambers are discussed. http://zoobank.org/urn:lsid:zoobank.org:pubF2095774-CF02-4851-8D73-250B5718EF6F.

Herein we present a model based on Fe substitution in Na3V2(PO4)(2)F-3 (Na3V2-2xFe2x (PO4)(2)F-3), with the optimal stoichiometry at x=0.03, and discover this optimal concentration is mainly determined by the volcanic electronic conductivity and electron activation energy. Experimental measurements discover the electron charge transfer process from V to Fe ions. Initially, Fe ions hog the electrons upon increasing substitution, but gradually the overwhelming of the charge transfer leads to the drop of electron transition ability of the major V ions. Firstprinciple calculations confirm the volcanic trend and charge transfer process in electronic properties, resulting in the Fermi level moves close to conduction band and then moves away in n-type Na3V2(PO4)(2)F-3 crystal upon increasing substitution. Meanwhile, in situ electrochemical impedance spectroscopy detects the Na+ diffusivity increases monotonously upon increasing substitution. These findings unravel the mechanism for optimum transition metal substitution, providing a new understanding for similar phenomena in other cathode materials.

AB  - The present study set out to investigate the extent of tissue damage in camels naturally infected with Theileria camelensis. A total of 114 camels were screened for T. camelensis infection. Hematological and biochemical investigations were conducted to assess liver and kidney function, along with oxidant/antioxidant markers. The kidney and spleen were analyzed histologically and immunohistochemically, and the lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) level in spleen tissue was measured as a marker of spleen injury. Blood smear analysis revealed that 28 camels tested positive for T. camelensis infection. Infected camels exhibited significantly elevated creatinine levels, blood urea nitrogen, and liver enzymes. Additionally, a significant reduction in glutathione level was noted, accompanied by a marked increase in malondialdehyde, reflecting oxidative stress. Tissue degeneration was evident in both kidney and spleen, with increased collagen fiber deposition and a reduction in B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2) positive cells. The immune response against T. camelensis was indicated by elevated LDH levels and CD3 cell expression in the spleen. Overall, T. camelensis infection negatively impacted multiple organs, particularly the kidneys and spleen in dromedary camels.

AB  - Author summary The pig is an animal commonly used experimentally to study diseases of the heart, as well as investigate therapies to treat them, such as drugs. However, although similar, pigs differ from humans in certain aspects which may mean experimental results do not always directly translate between species. We propose a mathematical model of porcine electrophysiology which can serve as a tool to understand differences between the species and translate responses. Using new measurements along with values from literature, we built a computer model of porcine cardiac myocyte which replicated voltage and calcium behaviour over a range of pacing frequencies. The pig cell had a two-stage calcium release, unlike humans with a single stage. We predict that pigs and humans differ in the type of potassium current block that makes them most susceptible to cardiac arrhythmia. The model we developed can elucidate important differences between human and pig arrhythmia response.
   The pig is commonly used as an experimental model of human heart disease, including for the study of mechanisms of arrhythmia. However, there exist differences between human and porcine cellular electrophysiology: The pig action potential (AP) has a deeper phase-1 notch, a longer duration at 50% repolarization, and higher plateau potentials than human. Ionic differences underlying the AP include larger rapid delayed-rectifier and smaller inward-rectifier K+-currents (I-Kr and I-K1 respectively) in humans. AP steady-state rate-dependence and restitution is steeper in pigs. Porcine Ca2+ transients can have two components, unlike human. Although a reliable computational model for human ventricular myocytes exists, one for pigs is lacking. This hampers translation from results obtained in pigs to human myocardium. Here, we developed a computational model of the pig ventricular cardiomyocyte AP using experimental datasets of the relevant ionic currents, Ca2+-handling, AP shape, AP duration restitution, and inducibility of triggered activity and alternans. To properly capture porcine Ca2+ transients, we introduced a two-step process with a faster release in the t-tubular region, followed by a slower diffusion-induced release from a non t-tubular subcellular region. The pig model behavior was compared with that of a human ventricular cardiomyocyte (O'Hara-Rudy) model. The pig, but not the human model, developed early afterdepolarizations (EADs) under block of I-K1, while I-Kr block led to EADs in the human but not in the pig model. At fast rates (pacing cycle length = 400 ms), the human cell model was more susceptible to spontaneous Ca2+ release-mediated delayed afterdepolarizations (DADs) and triggered activity than pig. Fast pacing led to alternans in human but not pig. Developing species-specific models incorporating electrophysiology and Ca(2+-)handling provides a tool to aid translating antiarrhythmic and arrhythmogenic assessment from the bench to the clinic.

AB  - Biomass-derived carbon as energy storage materials have gradually attracted widespread attention due to their low cost, sustainability, and inherent structural advantages. Herein, hard carbon (H-1200) and porous carbon (PC-800) for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs), sodium-ion capacitors (SICs) half cells and sodium-ion hybrid capacitors (SIHCs) have been synthesized from the same biomass precursor of Camellia shells through different treatments. H-1200 synthesized by directly high-temperature carbonization possesses a rational graphitic layer structure and plentiful heteroatoms. When applied as anode for SIBs, it exhibits a reversible capacity of 365.5 mAh g(-1) at 25 mA g(-1) and capacity retention 89.0% after 400 cycles at 200 mA g(-1). Additionally, PC-800 prepared by catalytic carbonization of K2C2O4/CaC2O4 hybrid catalyst has a sophisticated porous structure and a high surface area of 2186.9 m(2) g(-1). When employed as a cathode for SICs, it delivers a maximum capacity 104.2 mAh g(-1) at 100 mA g(-1) and 35.0 mAh g(-1) at 5 A g(-1). Furthermore, the all carbon assembled SIHC (H-1200 parallel to PC-800) using H-1200 as anode and PC-800 as cathode, features a broad output voltage range (0.01 similar to 4.1 V), high energy density of 161.5 Wh kg(-1), power density of 12896.1 W kg(-1), and superior capacity retention of 90.32% after 10000 cycles at 10 A g(-1). This research result provide a new horizon for constructing low-cost and large-scale production of biomass derived carbon for energy storage materials.

AB  - Many herbivorous insect species are capable of hijacking plant development to induce novel plant organs called galls. In most groups of galling insects, the insect organs and molecular signals involved in gall induction are poorly understood. We focused on gall wasps (Hymenoptera:Cynipidae), the second largest clade of gall inducers (similar to 1,400 spp.), for which the developmental stages and organs responsible for gall development are unclear. We investigated the female metasomal anatomy of 69 gall-inducing and 29 non-gall-inducing species across each of the major lineages of Cynipoidea, to test relationships between this lifestyle and the relative size of secretory organs. We confirmed that the venom apparatus in gall-inducing species is greatly expanded, although gall-inducing lineages vary in the relative size of these glands. Among these gallers, we measured the largest venom gland apparatus relative to body size ever recorded in insects. Non-galling inquiline species are accompanied by a reduction of this apparatus. Comparative microscopic analysis of venom glands suggests varying venom gland content across the lineages. Some oak gallers also had enlarged accessory glands, a lipid-rich organ whose function remains unclear, and which has not been previously studied in relation to gall formation. Together, the massive expansion of secretory organs specifically in gall-inducing species suggests a role of these secretions in the process of gall formation, and the variance in size of venom glands, accessory glands, and the contents of these glands among gallers, suggests that gall formation across this clade is likely to employ a diversity of molecular strategies.

AB  - The livestock sector contributes significantly to resource use and pollution in food systems. Therefore, assessing and reducing the environmental impacts of livestock production under different farming systems has become an important area of solution-oriented research in sustainability sciences. A case study in northern China on beef cattle, pig, broiler, layer and dairy farm systems was used to analyze the water footprint (WF) and N emissions in producing units of products from cradle-to-farm-gate based on the life cycle assessment (LCA) approach. Possible ways to change feed components and manure management to reduce environmental impacts were assessed. The results showed that 98.1%-99.4% of the water consumption in beef, pork, chicken, egg and milk production was from feed production. The N losses in livestock products were mainly caused by ammonia (NH3) emission by 53.8-83.5%, nitrous oxide emission by 6.4-17.3%, and N leaching by 6.1-16.8%. Life cycle assessment indicated that the green, blue, grey and total WFs of livestock products could be reduced by 9.9-31.4%, 21.6-70.6%, (-9.8)-38.0%, and 14.7-32.4%, respectively, by optimizing the feed composition. Changing feed composition, improving housing facilities (such as by using padded floor for beef cattle, pig, and dairy farm systems), using household biogas facilities to treat manure or coupling all of the above strategies could reduce the nitrogen footprint (NF) by an average of 29.4%, 4.6%, 16.2% and 43.2%, respectively, for all farming systems. Changing feed composition, using a padded floor and using household biogas treatment on manure were effective practices in reducing water consumption and nitrogen emissions from livestock farming systems, with an overall positive influence on reducing the overall WF and NF for livestock systems in northern China.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Flystrike, primarily caused by Lucilia cuprina, is a major health and welfare issue for sheep wool industries. Current chemical-based controls can have limited effectiveness due to the emergence of resistance in the parasite. RNA interference (RNAi), which uses double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) as a trigger molecule, has been successfully investigated for the development of innovative pest control strategies. Although RNAi offers great potential, the efficient identification, selection of target genes and delivery of dsRNA represent challenges to be overcome for the successful application of RNAi for control of L. cuprina. RESULTS: A primary L. cuprina (blowfly) embryo cell line (BFEC) was established and confirmed as being derived from L. cuprina eggs by PCR and amplicon sequencing. The BFECs were successfully transfected with plasmids and messenger RNA (mRNA) expressing fluorescent reporter proteins and dsRNA using lipid-based transfection reagents. The transfection of dsRNA into BEFC in this study suggested decreased mRNA levels of target gene expression, which suggested RNAi-mediated knockdown. Three of the dsRNAs identified in this study resulted in reductions of in target gene mRNA levels in BFEC and loss of biological fitness by L. cuprina larvae in a feeding bioassay. CONCLUSION: This study confirms that the novel BFEC cell line can be used to improve the efficacy of dsRNA-mediated screening to accelerate the identification of potential target genes in the development of RNAi mediated control approaches for L. cuprina. The research models established in this study are encouraging with respect to the use of RNAi as a blowfly control method, however further improvement and validation are required for field applicationsnot prefect, and could be ongoing developing.

AB  - The proliferation of rumors on social media has caused serious harm to society. Although previous research has attempted to use deep learning methods for rumor detection, they did not simultaneously consider the two key features of temporal and spatial domains. More importantly, these methods struggle to automatically generate convincing explanations for the detection results, which is crucial for preventing the further spread of rumors. To address these limitations, this paper proposes a novel method that integrates both temporal and spatial features while leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) to automatically generate explanations for the detection results. Our method constructs a dynamic graph model to represent the evolving, tree-like propagation structure of rumors across different time periods. Spatial features are extracted using a Graph Convolutional Network, which captures the interactions and relationships between entities within the rumor network. Temporal features are extracted using a Recurrent Neural Network, which accounts for the dynamics of rumor spread over time. To automatically generate explanations, we utilize Llama-3-8B, a large language model, to provide clear and contextually relevant rationales for the detected rumors. We evaluate our method on two real-world datasets and demonstrate that it outperforms current state-of-the-art techniques, achieving superior detection accuracy while also offering the added capability of automatically generating interpretable and convincing explanations. Our results highlight the effectiveness of combining temporal and spatial features, along with LLMs, for improving rumor detection and understanding.

AB  - Camellia oleifera is an important woody oil plant. In this study, the transcriptomes and leaf nutrient contents of C. oleifera that displayed high-yield and low-yield group were studied. A C. oleifera clone with a stable yield was used for the control group. The genes that were differentially expressed in the groups with different yield were also screened. It was found that the contents of N, P, K, Mg, Zn, and Fe were lower in high-yield group than in low-yield and control group. High expression of aspartate aminotransferase in high-yield group may have promoted N conversion and absorption. Further, the high expression of malate dehydrogenase in high-yield group clones may have been directly related to yield. The yield difference and its cause were thus preliminarily expounded.

AB  - Simple Summary The measurement of stress hormones has become a widely used and effective tool for evaluating adrenocortical activity in animals. However, to correctly interpret stress measurements, the potential sampling bias resulting from an oversampling of individuals in different states of pregnancy has rarely been investigated. We found significant yearly variations in states of pregnancy, which is related to the conditions of the females due to the snow cover duration before and at the start of the reproductive period. These results are important for improving the interpretation of stress hormone concentrations in free-ranging populations during the breeding and reproductive periods. The measurement of glucocorticoid metabolites (GCMs) in faeces has become a widely used and effective tool for evaluating the amount of stress experienced by animals. However, the potential sampling bias resulting from an oversampling of individuals in different states of pregnancy has rarely been investigated. In this study, we validate a noninvasive method for measuring gestagen metabolites in female mountain hares (Lepus timidus) under controlled conditions. We also measured the concentration of gestagen metabolites of females in a free-ranging population during the early breeding and post-breeding periods from 2014 to 2019. We found significant yearly variations in gestagen metabolites, which were related to the condition of the females due to the snow cover duration before and at the start of the reproduction period. GCMs were significantly influenced by the gestagen metabolite levels. These results are important for improving the interpretation of GCM concentrations in free-ranging populations during the breeding and reproductive periods.

AB  - A vegetable cellulosic fibre extracted from the leaves of the Yucca Silver Plant (YSP) through water retting process is presented in this paper. The study explores the diverse applications of the extracted fibre, conducting a thorough characterisation encompassing physical, mechanical, morphological, and thermal properties. Archimedes' principle-based density test of YSP fibres revealed its average density to be 1.23173 g/cc. Its average tensile strength, tensile modulus and strain rate were determined according to ASTM D3379-75 to be 454.68MPa, 18.744GPa and 2.216%, respectively. The surface and cross-section morphological analysis of YSP fibre revealed an uneven texture and a polygonal and multicellular honeycomb structure. The presence of free functional groups for Cellulose, Hemicellulose and Lignin has been identified by FTIR analysis. Exposure of powdered YSP fibre to XRD revealed acrystallinity index of 54.106% and a crystallite size of 4.70 nm. TG and DTA investigations of YSP fibre disclosed that these fibres are thermally stable up to 226oC and the Kinetic activation energy to be 76 KJ/mol. Examining the findings suggests that the YSP plant possesses significant potential as a natural fibre resource. The fibres derived from this plant exhibit promise as reinforcement material in polymer matrix-based composites.

AB  - We measured the concentrations of Cr, Fe, Ni, Cu, Zn, Cd, Pb and Hg, and the stable isotope ratios (delta C-13 and delta N-15) in 87 fish samples within 12 economic fish species collected from the Dongting Lake, the second largest freshwater lake in China. With few exceptions in concentration of Cr, most of fish species showed lower concentrations of the 8 metals than legislation thresholds. Piscivorous fishes had significantly higher values of delta N-15 (possessing higher trophic level) and metal concentrations than planktivorous and herbivorous fishes. Moreover, demersal fishes showed higher concentrations of Cu, Zn, Cd and Pb than pelagic and benthopelagic fishes. We found positive correlations between concentrations of Fe, Pb and Hg and delta N-15 ratio, confirming the biomagnification of the three metals through trophic transfer. In contrast, fishes showed clear growth dilution effect for Ni, Zn, Cu, Pb and Hg, indicated by the negative correlations between their concentrations and fish weight or length. Multiple regression analysis demonstrated that growth dilution and biomagnification effects simultaneously governed the metal concentrations in fish muscle, and the two effects' importance varied among different metals. The human health risk assessment indicated that all 8 metals gave target hazard quotient (THQ) values < 1.0, i.e., the estimated daily intake (EDI) of metals did not exceed the oral reference dose (RfD), indicating a safe consumption of these fish species for consumer. Our study provides comprehensive approaches to better understand the determining processes and potential risk of heavy metals in freshwater lake fishes.

AB  - African swine fever (ASF) caused by the African swine fever virus (ASFV) is a significant threat to domestic pig populations because of its highly contagious nature and associated morbidity and mortality. The lack of an appropriate cell line for ASFV propagation has significantly hindered the development of a safe and effective vaccine. In this study, we aimed to identify a cell line that is highly receptive to ASFV by evaluating various genes to determine their ability to support ASFV infection and replication. Our investigation revealed the efficient infection of a porcine alveolar macrophage cell line iPAM, upon stable overexpression of the transmembrane protein 107 (TMEM107). An isolated monoclonal cell line iPAMpCDH-TMEM107-B6 that was derived from the parental iPAM cell line exhibited increased susceptibility to ASFV infection. Notably, iPAMpCDH-TMEM107-B6 cells concurrently expressed ASFV B646L and ASFV p30 proteins after infection with ASFV. Biological characterization of iPAMpCDH-TMEM107-B6 revealed an enhanced proliferative capacity without compromised phagocytic function, indicating the retention of key cellular traits following genetic modification. The iPAMpCDH-TMEM107-B6 cell line has significant potential for ASFV research and will facilitate tasks such as isolation, replication, and genetic manipulation. The establishment of ASFV-sensitive cell lines provides an in vitro research platform for ASFV investigations, thereby advancing our understanding of the pathogenic mechanisms and aiding in vaccine development efforts.

AB  - Background/Objectives: Cardiovascular diseases remain a leading cause of mortality and morbidity, and dyslipidaemia is one of the major risk factors. The widespread use of herbs and medicinal plants in traditional medicine has garnered increasing recognition as a valuable resource for increasing wellness and reducing the onset of disease. Several epidemiologic and clinical studies have shown that altering blood lipid profiles and maintaining gut homeostasis may protect against cardiovascular diseases. Methods: A randomised, active-controlled parallel human clinical trial (n = 52) with three herbal tea infusions (green (Camellia sinensis) tea with rhubarb root, green tea with senna, and active control green tea) daily for 21 days in a free-living healthy adult cohort was conducted to assess the potential for health benefits in terms of plasma lipids and gut health. Paired plasma samples were analysed using Afinion lipid panels (total cholesterol, LDL (low-density lipoprotein) cholesterol, HDL (high-density lipoprotein) cholesterol, triglycerides, and non-HDL cholesterol) and paired stool samples were analysed using 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing to determine bacterial diversity within the gut microbiome. Results: Among participants providing fasting blood samples before and after the intervention (n = 47), consumption of herbal rhubarb root tea and green tea significantly lowered total cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol, and non-HDL cholesterol (p < 0.05) in plasma after 21 days of daily consumption when compared with concentrations before the intervention. No significant change was observed in the senna tea group. In participants providing stool samples (n = 48), no significant differences in overall microbial composition were observed between pre- and post-intervention, even at the genus level. While no significant changes in overall microbial composition were observed, specific bacterial genera, such as Dorea spp., showed correlations with LDL cholesterol concentrations, suggesting potential microbiota-mediated effects of tea consumption. Diet and BMI was maintained in each of the three groups before and after the trial. Conclusions: It was found that drinking a cup of rhubarb root herbal or green tea infusion for 21 days produced beneficial effects on lipid profiles and maintained gut eubiosis without observable adverse effects in a healthy human cohort. More studies are needed to fully understand the effects of rhubarb root and green tea in fatty acid metabolism and gut microbial composition.

AB  - Honey bees are important and highly efficient pollinators of agricultural crops and have been negatively affected by insecticides in recent years. Circular RNA (circRNA) plays an important role in the regulation of multiple biological and pathological processes; however, its role in the honey bee brain after exposure to dinotefuran is not well understood. Here, the expression profiles and potential modulation networks of circRNAs in the brains of workers (Apis mellifera) were comprehensively investigated using RNA sequencing and bioinformatics. In total, 33, 144, and 211 differentially expressed (DE) circRNAs were identified on the 1st, 5th and 10th days after exposure to dinotefuran, respectively. Enrichment analyses revealed that the host genes of DE circRNAs were enriched in the Hippo signaling pathway-fly, Wnt signaling pathway, and neuroactive ligand-receptor interaction. circ_0002266, circ_0005080, circ_0010239 and circ_0005415 were found to have translational potential due to the presence of an internal ribosome entry site (IRES). An integrated analysis of the DE circRNA-miRNA-mRNA networks suggest that circ_0008898 and circ_0001829 may participate in the immune response to dinotefuran exposure by acting as miRNA sponges. Our results provide invaluable basic data on A. mellifera brain circRNA patterns and a molecular basis for further study of the biological function of circRNAs in the development and immune response of honey bees.

AB  - The distribution of agricultural and livestock products has been limited owing to the recent rapid population growth and the COVID-19 pandemic; this has led to an increase in the demand for food security. The livestock industry is interested in increasing the growth performance of livestock that has resulted in the need for a mechanical ventilation system that can create a comfortable indoor environment. In this study, the applicability of demand-controlled ventilation (DCV) to energy-efficient mechanical ventilation control in a pigsty was analyzed. To this end, an indoor temperature and CO2 concentration prediction model was developed, and the indoor environment and energy consumption behavior based on the application of DCV control were analyzed. As a result, when DCV control was applied, the energy consumption was smaller than that of the existing control method; however, when it was controlled in an hourly time step, the increase in indoor temperature was large, and several sections exceeded the maximum temperature. In addition, when it was controlled in 15-min time steps, the increase in indoor temperature and energy consumption decreased; however, it was not energy efficient on days with high-outdoor temperature and pig heat.

AB  - A liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry method that combines hydrophilic interaction chromatography with anion exchange chromatography leads to improved peaks for phosphorylated sugars in plant tissues.
   Assessing central carbon metabolism in plants can be challenging due to the dynamic range in pool sizes, with low levels of important phosphorylated sugars relative to more abundant sugars and organic acids. Here, we report a sensitive liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry method for analysing central metabolites on a hybrid column, where both anion-exchange and hydrophilic interaction chromatography (HILIC) ligands are embedded in the stationary phase. The liquid chromatography method was developed for enhanced selectivity of 27 central metabolites in a single run with sensitivity at femtomole levels observed for most phosphorylated sugars. The method resolved phosphorylated hexose, pentose, and triose isomers that are otherwise challenging. Compared with a standard HILIC approach, these metabolites had improved peak areas using our approach due to ion enhancement or low ion suppression in the biological sample matrix. The approach was applied to investigate metabolism in high lipid-producing tobacco leaves that exhibited increased levels of acetyl-CoA, a precursor for oil biosynthesis. The application of the method to isotopologue detection and quantification was considered through evaluating C-13-labeled seeds from Camelina sativa. The method provides a means to analyse intermediates more comprehensively in central metabolism of plant tissues.

AB  - Although the neurogenesis-enhancing effects of exercise have been extensively studied, the molecular mechanisms underlying this response remain unclear. Here, we propose that this is mediated by the exercise-induced systemic release of the antioxidant selenium transport protein, selenoprotein P (SEPP1). Using knockout mouse models, we confirmed that SEPP1 and its receptor low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 8 (LRP8) are required for the exercise-induced increase in adult hippocampal neurogenesis. In vivo selenium infusion increased hippocampal neural precursor cell (NPC) proliferation and adult neurogenesis. Mimicking the effect of exercise through dietary selenium supplementation restored neurogenesis and reversed the cognitive decline associated with aging and hippocampal injury, suggesting potential therapeutic relevance. These results provide a molecular mechanism linking exercise-induced changes in the systemic environment to the activation of quiescent hippocampal NPCs and their subsequent recruitment into the neurogenic trajectory.

AB  - Pigs as laboratory animals are used in preclinical studies aimed at developing medical devices for cardiac surgery. The anatomy of the cardiovascular system of these animals has been well studied and acknowledged as suitable for use and the testing of new cardiovascular devices developed for humans. However, there are no morphometric characteristics of the aortic root and thoraco-abdominal part of porcine aorta. This can lead to difficulties in experimental surgery and even result in the death of experimental animals due to the mismatch in the size of the implantable devices. Thus, such information is essential to enhance the efficiency of surgical technologies used for eliminating aortic pathologies in their various sections. The purpose of our research is to study the anatomy of the aorta in mini pigs and to assess whether the size, age, and sex of the animals affect the size of the main structures in their aortas. In addition, we attempted to compare the results obtained by transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) and angiography. We studied 28 laboratory mini pigs, dividing them into three groups by body weight (40-70 kg, 71-90 kg, and 90 kg). We did not find any relationship between the external somatometric characteristics of the animals and the size of their aortas. Animals have individual anatomical variability in their cardiovascular systems, which means that they need to be examined in terms of preoperative planning by any available method-echocardiography, angiography, or multispiral computed tomography (CT).

AB  - A sustainable increase in livestock productivity cannot be achieved without the use of sustainable animal feed. Due to the growing awareness of the long-term benefits of sustainability, there is an increasing interest in replacing traditional feed resources with the most sustainable feedstuffs in pig production. Rye production is relatively sustainable compared to wheat. This farm study investigated whether the newborn body weight as well as antibody transfer in piglets (serum immunoglobulin immunocrit) are affected by feeding rye instead of wheat grain to transition sows. A total of 237 sows and their piglets (n = 711) from three farms located in northern Germany participated in this study. During the transition period, the sows were fed either a wheat-based diet used as the control diet (CON) or a 30% rye diet (RYE) for 7 days before the calculated farrowing date. On the day of farrowing, piglet body weights within 24 h post-natal (PN) were recorded, and blood samples were taken from the lightest, medium, and heaviest piglets in each litter to determine the quantification of immunoglobulins in the piglets. Feeding rye-based diets to the sows showed no differences in the body weight of the newborns (within 24 h) compared to the CON group in all body weight categories, except on Farm C in light and medium piglets, where high BW were observed in the CON group. The immunocrit ratio did not show any differences between both feeding groups. A relationship between newborn body weight and immunocrit ratios in the CON and the RYE groups was observed only on farm A. Overall, this study showed that including amounts of rye up to 30% in sows' diets during the transition period had no negative effects on newborn piglet body weight or on antibody transfer and therefore can be considered an adequate replacement for wheat (up to 30%) in diets for transition sows. However, future research is needed to determine whether a higher proportion of rye may be used.

AB  - Previous studies have suggested that the Lower-to-Middle Paleolithic transition was associated with the earliest Neanderthals, but recent research has established that the oldest Neanderthal fossils and the first signs of their technologies and behavior appear from MIS 11 or possibly earlier. To understand these changes, re-evaluation of the evidence is necessary to determine if this transition corresponds to a progressive evolution rather than abrupt change. Orgnac 3 is a key and appropriate site to study this research context. Located in southern France, it yields a long stratigraphic sequence testifying the evolution of technical and subsistence behaviors of pre-Neanderthal human groups during a Middle Pleistocene interglacial-glacial cycle. In this article, a new chronological framework is provided for the sequence based on results of dating methods applied to various types of geological materials. Speleothems and volcanic minerals, dated in previous studies by U-series and 40Ar/39Ar, respectively, show periods of calcitic crystallization and regional volcanic activity. Other materials, such as heated flints and herbivore teeth, are directly related to evidence of anthropogenic activities and are analyzed in the present work by trapped-charge dating methods such as thermoluminescence and electron spin resonance combined with uranium series (ESR/U-series). The new thermoluminescence and ESR/U-series dates confirm the attribution of the Orgnac 3 stratigraphic sequence to the MIS 10-MIS 8 period and are discussed in relation to paleoenvironmental data derived from bioarchaeological studies. The paleoanthropological levels, including the emergence of Levallois technology, are dated to ca. 275 Ica (early MIS 8) and appear coeval to a wet and temperate period recorded locally, the Amargiers interstadial, defined in the regional palynological records. The implications of this reassessed chronology for the archaeological assemblages are discussed in the wider context of behavioral innovations from MIS 11 onward and their establishment in subsequent periods.

AB  - Disruption of the presenilin (ps) genes are the major genetic cause of familial Alzheimer's disease. The silkworm, Bombyx mori (B. mori), is an important model insect. The ps homologue gene in B. mori was identified and characterized. However, the role of ps in B. mori was poorly understood. Here, we found that Bmps was ubiquitously expressed in all the tested tissues during metamorphosis. In the current study, loss-of-function analysis of Bmps was performed by the binary transgenic CRISPR/cas9 system. Compared with the wild type, the developmental time of increment Bmps animals were significantly delayed. In addition, increment Bmps showed abnormal appendage including antenna, leg, wing and eye during pupal and adult stages. RNA-seq analysis indicated that apoptosis and proliferation related pathways were affected in increment Bmps. Moreover, the Hippo pathway was affected by Bmps depletion in brain and wing disc. Our results suggest that PS is essential for maintaining the dynamic balance of apoptosis and proliferation during metamorphosis.

AB  - Plant volatile organic compounds (VOCs) play crucial roles in mediating plant-environment interactions, including pest attraction and deterrence, as well as attracting pollinators and deterring herbivores. The Mediterranean fruit fly (medfly) is a significant pest in fruit crops, requiring precise monitoring to optimize control measures. Our study investigates the differences in VOC profiles between identified "hot spot" areas within orchards where medfly populations tend to concentrate, and "cold spots," where infestations are less frequent. Using solid-phase microextraction (SPME) and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS), we found that hot spots exhibited distinct VOC profiles, particularly an increase in compounds such as (E)-2-hexenal, (Z)-2-hexanol, (E,E)-2,4-hexadienal, and (E)-2-hexenyl acetate, which are known medfly attractants. These findings suggest that variations in orchard VOC emissions may provide a means of identifying regions at higher risk of infestation, thereby allowing for targeted pest management strategies. This study offers insights into VOC-mediated pest attraction and highlights the potential for refining monitoring systems based on spatial chemical variations in orchards.

AB  - Behavioral pattern separation and cognitive flexibility are essential cognitive abilities that are disrupted in many brain disorders. A better understanding of the neural circuitry involved in these abilities will open paths to treatment. In humans and mice, discrimination and adaptation rely on the integrity of the hippocampal dentate gyrus (DG) which receives glutamatergic input from the entorhinal cortex (EC), including the lateral EC (LEC). An inducible increase of EC-DG circuit activity improves simple hippocampal-dependent associative learning and increases DG neurogenesis. Here, we asked if the activity of LEC fan cells that directly project to the DG (LEC -> DG neurons) regulates the relatively more complex hippocampal-dependent abilities of behavioral pattern separation or cognitive flexibility. C57BL/6J male mice received bilateral LEC infusions of a virus expressing shRNA TRIP8b, an auxiliary protein of an HCN channel or a control virus (SCR shRNA). Prior work shows that 4 weeks post-surgery, TRIP8b mice have more DG neurogenesis and greater activity of LEC -> DG neurons compared to SCR shRNA mice. Here, 4 weeks post-surgery, the mice underwent testing for behavioral pattern separation and reversal learning (touchscreen-based location discrimination reversal [LDR]) and innate fear of open spaces (elevated plus maze [EPM]) followed by quantification of new DG neurons (doublecortin-immunoreactive cells [DCX+] cells). There was no effect of treatment (SCR shRNA vs. TRIP8b) on performance during general touchscreen training, LDR training, or the 1st days of LDR testing. However, in the last days of LDR testing, the TRIP8b shRNA mice had improved pattern separation (reached the first reversal more quickly and had more accurate discrimination) compared to the SCR shRNA mice, specifically when the load on pattern separation was high (lit squares close together or "small separation"). The TRIP8b shRNA mice were also more cognitively flexible (achieved more reversals) compared to the SCR shRNA mice in the last days of LDR testing. Supporting a specific influence on cognitive behavior, the SCR shRNA and TRIP8b shRNA mice did not differ in total distance traveled or in time spent in the closed arms of the EPM. Supporting an inducible increase in LEC-DG activity, DG neurogenesis was increased. These data indicate that the TRIP8b shRNA mice had better pattern separation and reversal learning and more neurogenesis compared to the SCR shRNA mice. This study advances fundamental and translational neuroscience knowledge relevant to two cognitive functions critical for adaptation and survival-behavioral pattern separation and cognitive flexibility-and suggests that the activity of LEC -> DG neurons merits exploration as a therapeutic target to normalize dysfunctional DG behavioral output.

AB  - Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE, EC 3.4.15.1) is a significant enzyme that regulates blood pressure. ACE inhibitors are often used in the treatment of hypertension. In this work, ACE was purified and characterized in one step with affinity chromatography from sheep kidneys. ACE was 10305-fold purified and specific activity was 19,075 EU/mg protein. The molecular weight and purity of ACE were found with SDS-PAGE and observed two bands at about 60 kDa and 70 kDa on the gel. The effects of reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH), an antioxidant compound, on purified ACE activity were also researched. NADH on ACE activity showed an inhibition effect. The inhibition type of NADH was determined to be non-competitive inhibition by the Lineweaver-Burk chart and IC50 and K-i values for NADH were 244.33 and 175.08 mu M, respectively. These results suggest that antioxidant substances might be efficient in preventing hypertension.

AB  - With the example of different groups of herbivorous mammals, it was demonstrated that the spatial, seasonal, and long-term dynamics of energy resources directly affects the level of their consumption by animals and determines changes in the intensity of the processes of reproduction, mortality, migration, and, eventually, the state and stability of populations. The supply of nutrients and energy is initially limited, which determines certain forms of environmental processes according to the hierarchy of the energy budget components. The energy balance of the organism acts as a universal integral index of the efficiency of the adaptive capacity of the organism to environmental factors at each moment of its life cycle.

AB  - Pain identification in farm animals is a welfare challenge worldwide. In the last decade, our research team validated the Unesp-Botucatu Cattle Acute Pain Scale (UCAPS) based on specific pain or discomfort behaviors and alterations to maintenance behaviors when the cattle experiences pain. Recently, for other specific -species pain scales, such as sheep, pigs, and horses, we have used algorithms to weigh the pain -related behaviors, ranking their heterogeneous importance. Because the ranking of cattle pain -related behaviors' importance is still unknown, we aimed to investigate whether UCAPS pain -related behaviors have different statistical weights and rank their importance. We used a dataset comprising behavioral scores from 40 bulls in the perioperative period subjected to surgical castration in our previous study. Bulls were filmed between 16 and 24 hours before castration, between 1 and 4 hours after castration, 1 hour after analgesia, and 24 hours after the end of the surgery. Three experienced observers assessed all videos blind to the timepoint. After watching each video, the observers decided whether they felt analgesia should be indicated for the individual (expert assessment) and score UCAPS behaviors. Each pain -related behavior was weighted using a multilevel binomial logistic regression. Among the 17 UCAPS behaviors, four were not significant ('Activity 1: restless, moves more than normal or lies down and stands up with frequency', 'Appetite 1: hyporexia', 'Wagging tail', and 'Licking wound'), suggesting minor importance. The algorithm highlighted 'Kicking', 'Hind limbs extended', 'Extends neck', 'Head down', and 'Interaction 2' (apathetic: may be isolated or may not accompany the other animals; does not react to tactile, visual and/or audible environmental stimuli) respectively, as the five most important pain -related behaviors within this sample. Statistical weighting might contribute to the acute pain scoring approach and selecting behaviors in the psychometric validation process for pain scales. In conclusion, the statistical weighting based on multilevel binomial logistic regression raised evidence for a ranking of the importance of UCAPS pain -related behaviors in determining the need for analgesia in bulls after surgical castration. These findings contribute to a better understanding of bulls' behavioral responses to acute pain, potentially improving pain identification and monitoring, and enhancing welfare.

AB  - Intraspecific sexual communication, crucial in reproductive interactions, often involves the interchange of signals like vibrations, visual signals, and chemical compounds like sex chemical cues. Within the arachnids, solifuges ("camel spiders") are an understudied group in terms of the detection of chemical compounds during mate searching and sexual interactions. In solifugids, the malleoli, chemoreceptor structures located on the ventral side of legs IV, are putative structures capable of capturing chemical signals. Our study focused on chemical male perception of female cues in Titanopuga salinarum (Ammotrechidae), examining associated behavioral modifications and the role of malleoli. We analyzed alterations in the motion pattern (activity pulse) and specific behaviors performed by males in association with female chemical stimuli. Using experimental arenas, we exposed males to female chemical cues stimuli similar to those available at the field. Stimuli comprised females (F) and cuticular extracts (CE), with corresponding controls. Males with intact malleoli (N = 26 with F, N = 20 with CE) were compared to those with malleoli removed (N = 21 with F, N = 17 with CE). We found partial evidence that males detect chemical cues of females deposited on the substrate. We observed no differences in the duration and number of the activity pulses spent in the zones with and without stimuli in any of the groups analyzed. However, the males exhibit significant changes in locomotion patterns in response to female chemical cues, suggesting a behavioral response to these stimuli. This finding suggests that the males of this species detect the female chemical cues and modify their behavior, and can quickly gather the necessary olfactory information where the stimulus is located. In addition, we found a possible condition-dependent regime for the detection of female cues by males, which would be expected from life-history characteristics of T. salinarum. Our findings prompt discussion from a sexual selection perspective, suggesting the importance of chemical communication in intraspecific interactions in this elusive but fascinating animal model.

AB  - Background: Lincomycin (LIN) is extensively used for treating diseases in livestock and promoting growth in food animal farming, and it is frequently found in both the environment and in food products. Currently, most of the methods for detecting lincomycin either lack sensitivity and precision or require the use of costly equipment such as mass spectrometers. Result: In this study, we developed a reliable high-performance liquid chromatography-ultraviolet detection (HPLC-UVD) method and used it to detect LIN residue in 11 types of matrices (pig liver and muscle; chicken kidney and liver; cow fat, liver and milk; goat muscle, liver and milk; and eggs) for the first time. The tissue homogenates and liquid samples were extracted via liquid-liquid extraction, and subsequently purified and enriched via sorbent and solid phase extraction (SPE). After nitrogen drying, the products were derivatized with p-toluene sulfonyl isocyanic acid (PTSI) (100 mu L) for 30 min at room temperature. Finally, the derivatized products were analyzed by HPLC at 227 nm. Under the optimized conditions, the method displayed impressive performance and demonstrated its reliability and practicability, with a limit of detection (LOD) and quantification (LOQ) of LIN in each matrix of 25-40 mu g/kg and 40-60 mu g/kg, respectively. The recovery ranged from 71.11% to 98.30%. Conclusions: The results showed that this method had great selectivity, high sensitivity, satisfactory recovery and cost-effectiveness-fulfilling the criteria in drug residue and actual detection requirements-and proved to have broad applicability in the field of detecting LIN in animal-derived foods.

AB  - The article presents the solution adopted in an existing blast furnace with only two safety valves to minimize the dust and gas emissions to the atmosphere, in case of emergency relief due to abnormal overpressure during operating issues in the blast furnace process. Before the implementation of the system, several openings of the emergency bleeder valves were observed: These led to sensitive pollutant emissions, also in terms of acoustic and visive events, with high impact on the surrounding environment. The new relief system, in addition to the existing bleeder valves, has been engineered with a Computational Fluid Dynamic (CFD) analysis using Ansys Fluent to find out the most effective solution and to minimize modifications on the plant. Few plant modifications, while guaranteeing the achievement of the target of reducing the bleeder openings, allow to reduce the plant shutdown costs for the modifications themselves and the maintenance costs during plant operation and to simplify the operating logic of the blast furnace overpressure control systems. The new installation increased the safety operation of the blast furnace, and it drastically reduced the bleeder valves openings-4% of the pre-intervention total opening time per year-and the associated emissions in spite of the rise of the pig iron production, as recorded by the monitoring and supervision system.

AB  - Sexually dimorphic performance has been observed across humans and rodents in many spatial tasks. In general, these spatial tasks do not dissociate the use of environmental and self-movement cues. Previous work has demonstrated a role for self-movement cue processing in organizing open field behavior; however, these studies have not directly compared female and male movement characteristics. The current study examined the organization of open field behavior under dark conditions in female and male rats. Significant differences between female and male rats were observed in the location of stopping behavior relative to a cue and the topography exhibited during lateral movements. In contrast, no sex differences were observed on measures used to detect self-movement cue processing deficits. These results provide evidence that female and male rats are similar in their use of self-movement cues to organize open field behavior; however, other factors may be contributing to differences in performance.

AB  - Corneal blindness can be treated by keratoplasty but a lack of readily available corneal donor tissue for this procedure remains a challenge. Cryopreservation can facilitate the long-term storage of tissue but effective protocols for cryopreserving cornea have yet to be developed. Mathematical modelling can guide protocol design, but previously used models are not comprehensive. A comprehensive model should describe the tissue's shrink-swell response and the cryoprotectant concentration throughout the tissue during cryoprotectant loading. Such a model exists for articular cartilage based on a biomechanical triphasic approach. We explored the applicability of this model for describing cryoprotectant permeation in porcine corneas by fitting it to experimental data for the permeation of dimethyl sulfoxide into porcine corneoscleral discs. The model provided as good of a fit for corneoscleral discs data as it did for articular cartilage data, presenting promise for its use in the design of cryopreservation protocols for corneas.

AB  - Camellia oleifera Abel. (C. oleifera) represents a significant woody edible oil species predominantly distributed in southern China. Timely flowering is essential for the growth, development and tea oil production of C. oleifera. However, the mechanisms underpinning this process remain insufficiently understood. In this study, it was demonstrated through time-course transcriptome analysis that we revealed that CoFKF1-like1 (CoFKF1) serves as a central regulatory gene in the flowering process of C. oleifera. The ectopic expression of CoFKF1 resulted in the induction of early flowering. Furthermore, it was observed that CoFKF1 interacts with the transcription factor CoMYB4 in a blue-light-dependent manner, facilitating its ubiquitination and subsequent degradation. Genetically, CoMYB4 was identified as functioning downstream of CoFKF1 by directly binding to the promoter of CoFT1 and repressing its promoter activity. In conclusion, these findings elucidate that CoFKF1 promotes flowering by reducing the stability of the CoMYB4 protein, thereby enhancing CoFT1 promoter activity. Collectively, the results provide critical insights into the flowering mechanisms of C. oleifera and present a promising avenue to optimise its flowering period via the CoFKF1-CoMYB4-CoFT1 module.

AB  - Encapsulationof fragrance in micro/nanocapsules can preserve itsown unique aroma in harsh environments and is the main way for leatherperfuming to cover the peculiar odor of traditional leather products.Despite the success of post loading fragrance, limited considerationhas been given to the tedious preparation procedures and the unacceptableloading efficiency. Herein, a highly efficient and straightforwardone-pot loading method was developed to prepare osmanthus fragrance-silicananocapsules (OF-SiO2 NCs) via hydrolysisand condensation reactions. The particle size could be easily controlledfrom 158 to 1063 nm with an OF loading efficiency of 10.2-18.7%,as desired by changing the solute content or altering the reactiontemperature. Simultaneously, the above factors were found to affectthe degree of ordered mesopores by promoting either the self-assemblyof the surfactant-silica micelles or the condensation of thesilica. The developed OF-SiO2 NCs were applied to perfumethe cow leather-wet blue and sheep leather-dyed crust, which improvedobviously the smelly odor. Moreover, up to two weeks of aromatic fragrancesustained release gave evidence of the highly incense retention time.These features highlight the potential use of OF-SiO2 NCsfor aromatic leather products.
   Aone-step strategy to synthesize OF-SiO2 NCswas reported, exhibiting excellent fragrance utilization to favorthe durable odor improvement of leather in resource-efficient ways.

AB  - A key feature in sheep biology is reproduction seasonality which concerns the cyclical occurrence of natural breeding, which therefore does not take place throughout the year. Since sheep are short-day breeders, the amount of daylight has an impact on their reproductive activity. The melatonin receptor subtype 1A (MTNR1A) gene is the primary gene that has been linked with seasonality. Nonetheless, information regarding the potential genetic association between other loci and the seasonality of sheep reproduction is scarce. Genome-wide association study (GWAS) is considered a cutting-edge methodology for comprehending the genetic architecture of complex traits since it enables the discovery of many markers linked to different features. In the present study, three indigenous Greek sheep breeds were investigated using GWAS-two of which presented strict patterns of reproduction seasonality, i.e., the Florina and Karagkouniko breeds, while the third one, i.e., the Chios breed had the ability to exhibit estrus throughout the year-in an attempt to detect the genetic loci linked with reproduction seasonality. All three breeds of investigated animals were purebred with Chios and Florina breeds originating from the Greek national stationary stock, whereas Karagkouniko originated from a commercial farm. Interestingly, a significant genetic differentiation of the national stationary stock groups was suggested by principal component analysis, phylogenetic analysis, and admixture and spatial point patterns, with these two breeds being less heterogeneous. This finding highlights the value of stationary stocks towards the maintenance of genetic integrity in indigenous sheep, demonstrating the Greek station's critical role in the conservation of native sheep breeds. On the other hand, according to the GWAS data analysis, no genetic loci were correlated with reproduction seasonality, emphasizing the MTNR1A gene as the main determinant of the seasonality in native non genetically improved breeds.

AB  - Biochars were prepared by pyrolyzing pig manure, cow dung, bamboo, corn straw, and sewage sludge at 400 and 600 degrees C; then, the environmental risks posed by heavy metals and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons in the biochars were assessed. The acid-extractable and reducible fraction contributions to the total Zn concentrations were 53.78% and 46.11% for cow dung biochar, 51.94% and 48.37% for sewage sludge biochar, and 13.51% and 7.99% for corn straw biochar prepared at 400 and 600 degrees C, respectively, that is, lower after pyrolysis at 600 than 400 degrees C. The polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon concentrations were 1376.09-2695.74 mg kg-1 for biochar prepared at 400 degrees C but much lower for biochar prepared at 600 degrees C. Superoxide dismutase and carboxylesterase activities were higher for Chironomus sp. larvae exposed to biochar than blank larvae, indicating that the biochars were toxic. The superoxide dismutase activities were 33.8 times higher for cow dung biochar prepared at 400 degrees C than the blanks. Multivariate statistical analysis indicated that extractable Cd and Cu in biochar cause aquatic toxicity. The bioavailabilities and toxicities of heavy metals in animal manure and sewage sludge decrease through pyrolysis to give biochar but heavy metals may remain toxic to aquatic organisms.

AB  - This study delved into the role of delta-like noncanonical notch ligand 2 (DLK2) in the cell cycle, proliferation, apoptosis, and differentiation of myoblasts, as well as its interaction with the classical Wnt/beta-catenin signaling pathway in regulating myoblast function. The research revealed that upregulation of DLK2 in myoblasts during the proliferation phase enhanced myoblast proliferation, facilitated cell cycle progression, and reduced apoptosis. Conversely, downregulation of DLK2 expression using siRNA during the differentiation phase promoted myoblast hypertrophy and fusion, suppressed the expression of muscle fiber degradation factors, and expedited the differentiation process. DLK2 regulates myoblasts function by influencing the expression of various factors associated with the Wnt/beta-catenin signaling pathway, including CTNNB1, FZD1, FZD6, RSPO1, RSPO4, WNT4, WNT5A, and adenomatous polyposis coli. In essence, DLK2, with the involvement of the Wnt/beta-catenin signaling pathway, plays a crucial regulatory role in the cell cycle, proliferation, apoptosis, and differentiation of myoblasts.

AB  - In the inflamed uterus, the production and secretion of prostaglandins (PGs) and noradrenergic innervation pattern are changed. Receptor-based control of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) production and secretion by noradrenaline during uterine inflammation is unknown. The aim of this study was to determine the role of alpha 1-, alpha 2- and beta-adrenoreceptors (ARs) in noradrenaline-influenced PG-endoperoxidase synthase-2 (PTGS-2) and microsomal PTGE synthase-1 (mPTGES-1) protein levels in the inflamed pig endometrium, and in the secretion of PGE2 from this tissue. E. coli suspension (E. coli group) or saline (CON group) was injected into the uterine horns. Eight days later, severe acute endometritis developed in the E. coli group. Endometrial explants were incubated with noradrenaline and/or alpha 1-, alpha 2- and beta-AR antagonists. In the CON group, noradrenaline did not significantly change PTGS-2 and mPTGES-1 protein expression and increased PGE2 secretion compared to the control values (untreated tissue). In the E. coli group, both enzyme expression and PGE2 release were stimulated by noradrenaline, and these values were higher versus the CON group. The antagonists of alpha 1- and alpha 2-AR isoforms and beta-AR subtypes do not significantly alter the noradrenaline effect on PTGS-2 and mPTGES-1 protein levels in the CON group, compared to noradrenaline action alone. In this group, alpha 1A-, alpha 2B- and beta 2-AR antagonists partly eliminated noradrenaline-stimulated PGE2 release. Compared to the noradrenaline effect alone, alpha 1A-, alpha 1B-, alpha 2A-, alpha 2B-, beta 1-, beta 2- and beta 3-AR antagonists together with noradrenaline reduced PTGS-2 protein expression in the E. coli group. Such effects were also exerted in this group by alpha 1A-, alpha 1D-, alpha 2A-, beta 2- and beta 3-AR antagonists with noradrenaline on mPTGES-1 protein levels. In the E. coli group, the antagonists of all isoforms of alpha 1-ARs and subtypes of beta-ARs as well as alpha 2A-ARs together with noradrenaline decreased PGE2 secretion versus noradrenaline action alone. Summarizing, in the inflamed pig endometrium, alpha 1(A, B)-, alpha 2(A, B)- and beta(1, 2, 3)-ARs mediate the noradrenaline stimulatory effect on PTGE-2 protein expression, while noradrenaline via alpha 1(A, D)-, alpha 2A- and beta(2, 3)-ARs increases mPTGES-1 protein expression and alpha 1(A, B, D)-, alpha 2A- and beta(1, 2, 3)-ARs are involved in PGE2 release. Data suggest that noradrenaline may indirectly affect the processes regulated by PGE2 by influencing its production. Pharmacological modulation of particular AR isoforms/subtypes can be used to change PGE2 synthesis/secretion to alleviate inflammation and improve uterine function.

AB  - The main purpose of the paper is to highlight the millennial tradition of large-scale sheep husbandry in Romania (transhumance practices from the past) by adapting technologies, to preserve this extensive system, even nowadays. The second aim of the paper is to identify the medicinal plants used by shepherds as part of extensive sheep farming. The phytogeographical resources underlying the development of the pastoral landscape are natural pastures and hayfields. Their floristic composition includes numerous plant species with a beneficial role for the health and wellbeing of sheep. The research was conducted in the "Marginimea Sibiului" area (Sibiu County), Romania, in the period 2016-2020. The employed methodology is complex and it is based, on the one hand, on the study and analysis of bibliographic resources and, on the other hand, on site visits to representative pastoral villages and interviews with shepherds who practised transhumance in the past. Data was collected from local and national authorities. Classical or traditional transhumance represents the seasonal movement of shepherds with sheep herds from the mountains to the plains in the autumn (from the 1st of October to the 1st of April) and back, in the spring, until the end of summer. It involves the movement of large herds (generally between 500 and 2000 head) of Turcana breed sheep, over distances between 100 and 500 km. The commute between the mountains and the plains is necessary in order to make efficient use of all available forage resources. The findings include the following: the number of sheep in Romania varied from 18,000 thousand head in 1985, to 14,062 thousand head in 1990, with the lowest value in 2001 (7,251 thousand head). After Romania joined the EU, the number increased, reaching 10,281 thousand head in 2020 (16.8% of the EU population). The distribution of sheep breeds in the country is the consequence of the shepherds' long-term experience, being closely related to the landscape conditions and the pedoclimatic characteristics. In the areas with large herds of sheep, pastoral villages were formed, grouped into 4 main centres, as well as centres derived from them (in the south-eastern part of the country, namely Dobrogea, and in counties located in the western area). Regarding the use of medicinal plants from the spontaneous flora for animals, it can be stated that the literature cites 49 plant species identified in the area. Of these, only 33 plant species, belonging to 21 families, are used on sheep breeds.

AB  - Hydrogen cyanide (HCN) occurs in living organisms and in the environment. This is a widely known poison but is also considered as a gasotransmitter. For most higher plants, microorganisms and animals HCN is toxic, especially at elevated concentrations. However, plants' sensitivity to this compound is lower than animals' due to the activity of an alternative oxidase in the mitochondrial respiration chain. All higher plants synthesize HCN as a co-product during the final step of ethylene biosynthesis, whilst some plant species release it from cyanogenic compounds, accumulated for diverse physiological purposes. This molecule is used as a toxic bomb against herbivores, as a source of nitrogen in N-deficient plants, or as a regulator of seed dormancy state. The toxicity of HCN is mainly due to the inhibition of the activity of several metalloenzymes: iron-containing enzymes, molybdoenzymes and enzymes that contain zinc or copper. HCN impacts cellular metabolism by modulation of the reactive oxygen species and reactive nitrogen species levels, and via modifications of proteins (S-cyanylation, oxidation). The aim of this work is to describe the dual (toxic and signalling) mode of cyanide action in plants at a cellular level.

AB  - In the natural environment, antlers have a significant mechanical structure that protects the deer head from injury. In this paper, the mechanical properties of antlers were evaluated through quasi-static compression tests and microstructural observation of samples from antlers, and the relationship between the sampling position, load direction, and microstructure and their mechanical properties were investigated. Compression experiments confirmed that the tines had the strongest mechanical properties, followed by the main beams and finally the brow tines. The mechanical properties of the test specimens subjected to axial compression were higher than those of lateral compression. The axial load test of the longitudinal sample of the tine of the antler has the best mechanical properties. Its specific energy absorption is 51.33 J/g, the peak crushing force is 1.26 kN, and the mean crushing force is 1.47 kN. There are many tubular structures in the transverse sections of antlers, and the distribution of fibers in the vertical direction is laminar with alternating rows forming a helical structure. Tubular structures were found to be prevalent in some of the better biomechanical structures by comparison. Numerical modeling simulations to describe the effect of tubular structures on the mechanical properties of antlers. The simulation results show that the increase in the size of the tubular structure improves its energy absorption within the variation of a 20% increase in the size of the long and short axis. These findings provide a theoretical and experimental basis for the design of energy-absorbing structures.Research Highlights In this paper, transverse and longitudinal samples were taken from the main beam, tine, and brow tine of antlers, and axial and lateral compression were carried out, respectively. In this paper, quasi-static compression experiments were carried out on antler samples to study the effects of sampling position, loading direction, and microstructure on antler mechanical properties. By means of microstructure observation and numerical modeling, it is determined that the size of the antler Havel tube has an effect on its mechanical properties.

AB  - This work attempts to evaluate dermal exposure (DE) of farm workers to dimethoate after 4 h of routine application to a lemon plantation. Dimethoate was measured on the workers' clothes as well as in stratum corneum (SC) and in saliva. In vitro permeation tests (IVPT) were performed through rat, pig and human skin and pig buccal, esophageal and sublingual mucosas. The mean of dimethoate DE was 342.19 +/- 487.14 mg/d, the percentage of toxic dose per hour was higher than the other pesticides, and the SC penetration factors ranged between 0.5 and 14.81 and 0.05-53.96 % for back of neck and arms respectively. In the supporting IVPT study, dimethoate absorption through human skin was 14.75 % and the default value in the absence of experimental data for this product is 70%. These results show that in family farming the deficiency of correct clothing during the application of pesticides leaves workers more vulnerable.

KW  - CORPUS
AB  - Biological relation networks contain rich information for understanding the biological mechanisms behind the relationship of entities such as genes, proteins, diseases, and chemicals. The vast growth of biomedical literature poses significant challenges in updating the network knowledge. The recent Biomedical Relation Extraction Dataset (BioRED) provides valuable manual annotations, facilitating the development of machine learning and pre-trained language model approaches for automatically identifying novel document-level (inter-sentence context) relationships. Nonetheless, its annotations lack directionality (subject/object) for the entity roles, which is essential for studying complex biological networks. Herein, we annotate the entity roles of the relationships in the BioRED corpus and subsequently propose a novel multi-task language model with soft-prompt learning to jointly identify the relationship, novel findings, and entity roles. Our results include an enriched BioRED corpus with 10 864 directionality annotations. Moreover, our proposed method outperforms existing large language models, such as the state-of-the-art GPT-4 and Llama-3, on two benchmarking tasks.Availability and implementation Our source code and dataset are available at https://github.com/ncbi-nlp/BioREDirect.

AB  - Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) infections are still a major problem in hospitals. The excellent safety profile, accessibility and anti-infective activity of tea extracts make them promising agents for the treatment of infected wounds. To investigate the possibility of sterilising MRSA-infected surfaces, including skin with tea extracts, we determined the MICs for different extracts from green and black tea (Camellia sinensis), including epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG), on a large number of clinical isolates of MRSA, selected to represent a high genetic diversity. The extracts were prepared to achieve the maximal extraction of EGCG from tea and were used as stable lyophilisate with a defined EGCG content. All extracts showed a complete inhibition of cell growth at a concentration of approx. 80 mu g/mL of EGCG after a contact time of 24 h. Time-kill plots were recorded for the extract with the highest amount of EGCG. The reduction factor (RF) was 5 after a contact time of 240 min. EGCG and tea extracts showed an RF of 2 in methicillin-sensitive S. aureus. Extracts from green and black tea showed lower MICs than an aqueous solution with the same concentration of pure EGCG. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to show a reduction of 99.999% of clinically isolated MRSA by green tea extract within 4 h.

AB  - Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1), a member of the proglucagon derived peptide family, is a highly effective incretin to reduce plasma glucose and inhibit food intake in mammals. The physiological function of GLP-1 has been elucidated in some 'glucose intolerant' carnivorous fishes. To lay a better understanding in fish glucose intolerance, we synthesized homologous GLP-1 peptide and explored its roles in appetite and glucose regulation under intraperitoneal (IP) injection in herbivorous grass carp which has higher glucose intolerance. The results showed that GLP-1 increased plasma glucose in grass carp. The hyperglycemic effect of the fish GLP-1 was mainly through promoting gluconeogenesis, accompanied by inhibition of glycogen synthesis and stimulation of glycogenolysis pathway. In addition, GLP-1 upregulated the expression of anorexigenic gene (cart) and decreased the orexigenic genes (npy and agrp) expression in grass carp hypothalamus as a conservative way to inhibit the appetite under GLP-1 injection after 2 h. Taken together, the hyperglycemic effect and anorectic role of GLP-1 were performed in a basically consistent manner across fishes with different food habits. What's more, the gene expressions of proglucagon yielded GLP-1 in foregut and hindgut of grass carp were significantly decreased after a meal within 24 h, indicating that fish might suppress the accumulation of plasma glucose by decreasing GLP-1 expression in a unique way to herbivorous fish. Therefore, this study provided a new perspective for illustrating the difference in glucose utilization among fishes with different food habits based on GLP-1.

AB  - This study was conducted to investigate the stability of five commercial vitamin A products in vitamin premixes and vitamin-trace mineral premixes. The five commercial products used were: Xinhecheng, Zhejiang medicine, Kingdomway, DSM, and BASF. The vitamin A products were stored in three vitamin premixes (for suckling, weanling, and finishing pigs) or in vitamin-trace mineral (VTM) premixes (for suckling, weanling, and finishing pigs). Vitamin premixes were stored in an environmentally controlled chamber set at 25 degrees C and 60% humidity. The VTM premixes were stored at room temperature (approximately 22 degrees C). Sampling was performed on d 0, 90, 180, 270, and 360. Stability was reported as the residual vitamin A activity (% of initial) at each sampling point. For the stability of vitamin premixes, all interactive and main effects of storage time and vitamin A product were not significant. For the stability of VTM premixes, there was no significant interaction effects between storage time, vitamin A product and main effect of vitamin A product, but the main effect of storage time was significant (p < 0.01). In conclusion, a longer storage time reduced vitamin A activity in VTM premixes but there was no difference in the stability of commercially available vitamin A.

AB  - Iassinae, a widely distributed group of herbivorous pest insects, is a subfamily of Cicadellidae. Previous studies on the phylogeny of Iassinae were mostly based on morphological characteristics, mitochondrial genomes, and molecular fragments (H3, 28S, and 12S), and their phylogenetic relationships were controversial. To better understand Iassinae, we analyzed the phylogenetic relationships among four genera in Iassinae with use of thousands of universal single-copy orthologs and ultraconserved elements extracted from 25 newly sequenced low-coverage whole genome data. Both marker sets provided consistent results across the maximum likelihood and coalescent-based species tree approaches. The phylogenetic results showed that the two genera Batracomorphus and Trocnadella were monophyletic groups, and Krisna a paraphyletic group. For the genus Gessius, we could not explain whether it is monophyletic or paraphyletic since only one species was involved. In this study, the phylogenetic relationship with use of universal single-copy orthologs and ultraconserved elements was stable, and all results supported that Batracomorphus is a sister group of Trocnadella, and that Gessius and Krisna possess a sister relationship. In addition, the divergence time showed that the divergence respectively. These results will help us to understand the phylogeny and evolutionary relationship of Iassinae.

AB  - Adverse experiences in early life can shape neuronal structures and synaptic function in multiple brain regions, leading to deficits of distinct cognitive functions later in life. Focusing on the pyramidal cells of the prelimbic cortex (PrL), a main subregion of the medial prefrontal cortex, the impact of early-life adversity (ELA) was investigated in a well-established animal model generated by changing the rearing environment during postnatal days 2 to 9 (P2-P9), a sensitive developmental period. ELA has enduring detrimental impacts on the dendritic spines of PrL pyramidal cells, which is most apparent in a spatially circumscribed region. Specifically, ELA affects both thin and mushroom-type spines, and ELA-provoked loss of spines is observed on selective dendritic segments of PrL pyramidal cells in layers II-III and V-VI. Reduced postsynaptic puncta represented by postsynaptic density protein-95 (PSD-95), but not synaptophysin-labelled presynaptic puncta, in ELA mice supports the selective loss of spines in the PrL. Correlation analysis indicates that loss of spines and postsynaptic puncta in the PrL contributes to the poor spatial working memory of ELA mice, and thin spines may play a major role in working memory performance. To further understand whether loss of spines affects glutamatergic transmission, AMPA- and NMDA-receptor-mediated synaptic currents (EPSCs) were recorded in a group of Thy1-expressing PrL pyramidal cells. ELA mice exhibited a depressed glutamatergic transmission, which is accompanied with a decreased expression of GluR1 and NR1 subunits in the PrL. Finally, upregulating the activation of Thy1-expressing PrL pyramidal cells via excitatory DREADDs can efficiently improve the working memory performance of ELA mice in a T-maze-based task, indicating the potential of a chemogenetic approach in restoring ELA-provoked memory deficits.

AB  - Orexin A, an endogenous peptide involved in several functions including reward, acts via activation of orexin receptors OX1 and OX2, Gq-coupled GPCRs. We examined the effect of a selective OX1 agonist, OXA (17-33) on cytosolic calcium concentration, [Ca2+](i), in neurons of nucleus accumbens, an important area in the reward circuit. OXA (17-33) increased [Ca2+](i) in a dose-dependent manner; the effect was prevented by SB-334867, a selective OX1 receptors antagonist. In Ca2+-free saline, the OXA (17-33)-induced increase in [Ca2+](i) was not affected by pretreatment with bafilomycin A1, an endo-lysosomal calcium disrupter, but was blocked by 2-APB and xestospongin C, antagonists of inositol-1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) receptors. Pretreatment with VU0155056, PLD inhibitor, or BD-1047 and NE-100, Sigma-1R antagonists, reduced the [Ca2+](i) response elicited by OXA (17-33). Cocaine potentiated the increase in [Ca2+](i) by OXA (17-33); the potentiation was abolished by Sigma-1R antagonists. Our results support an additional signaling mechanism for orexin A-OX1 via choline-Sigma-1R and a critical role for Sigma-1R in the cocaine-orexin A interaction in nucleus accumbens neurons.

AB  - Dopaminergic neurotransmission via dopamine D1 receptors (D1Rs) is considered to play an important role not only in reward-based learning but also in aversive learning. The contextual and auditory cued fear conditioning tests involve the processing of classical fear conditioning and evaluates aversive learning memory. It is possible to evaluate aversive learning memory in two different types of neural transmission circuits. In addition, when evaluating the role of dopaminergic neurotransmission via D1R, to avoid the effects in D1R-mediated neural circuitry alterations during development, it is important to examine using mice who D1R expression in the mature stage is suppressed. Herein, we investigated the role of dopaminergic neurotransmission via D1Rs in aversive memory formation in contextual and auditory cued fear conditioning tests using D1R knockdown (KD) mice, in which the expression of D1Rs could be conditionally and reversibly controlled with doxycycline (Dox) treatment. For aversive memory, we examined memory formation using recent memory 1 day after conditioning, and remote memory 4 weeks after conditioning. Furthermore, immunostaining of the brain tissues of D1RKD mice was performed after aversive footshock stimulation to investigate the distribution of activated c-Fos, an immediate-early gene, in the hippocampus (CA1, CA3, dentate gyrus), striatum, amygdala, and prefrontal cortex during aversive memory formation. After aversive footshock stimulation, immunoblotting was performed using hippocampal, striatal, and amygdalar samples from D1RKD mice to investigate the increase in the amount of c-Fos and phosphorylated SNAP-25 at Ser187 residue. When D1R expression was suppressed using Dox, behavioral experiments revealed impaired contextual fear learning in remote aversion memory following footshock stimulation. Furthermore, expression analysis showed a slight increase in the post-stimulation amount of c-Fos in the hippocampus and striatum, and a significant increase in the amount of phosphorylated SNAP-25 in the hippocampus, striatum, and prefrontal cortex before and after stimulation. These findings indicate that deficiency in D1R-mediated dopaminergic neurotransmission is an important factor in impairing contextual fear memory formation for remote memory.

AB  - Simple Summary Salmonella excretion at slaughter is considered a source of carcass contamination and human infections. To assess this potential risk, a survey on Salmonella shedding at slaughter in 1068 pigs from 24 farms was carried out. Almost one-third of these farms (27.3%) shed Salmonella. The monophasic variant of Salmonella Typhimurium, an emerging serotype of zoonotic importance, was the most frequent (46.9%). Antimicrobial resistance in Salmonella isolates was common, but resistance against antimicrobials of critical importance for humans was low, with the exception of tigecycline, a new tetracycline-derivative antimicrobial used to treat severe infections caused by extensively drug-resistant bacteria that is not used in food-producing animals. An abattoir-based strategy for the control of Salmonella shedding, consisting of the addition of formic acid esterified in the form of glycerides in drinking water while waiting for slaughter, was able to significantly reduce the proportion of pigs shedding Salmonella. It appears this strategy can contribute to mitigating the burden of abattoir environmental contamination. Pigs shedding Salmonella at slaughter are considered a source of carcass contamination and human infection. To assess this potential risk, the proportion of Salmonella shedders that arrive for slaughter was evaluated in a population of 1068 pigs from 24 farms. Shedding was present in 27.3% of the pigs, and the monophasic variant of Salmonella Typhimurium, an emerging zoonotic serotype, was the most prevalent (46.9%). Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) in Salmonella isolates was common, but few isolates showed AMR to antimicrobials of critical importance for humans such as third-generation cephalosporins (5%), colistin (0%), or carbapenems (0%). However, AMR to tigecycline was moderately high (15%). The efficacy of an esterified formic acid in the lairage drinking water (3 kg formic acid/1000 L) was also assessed as a potential abattoir-based strategy to reduce Salmonella shedding. It was able to reduce the proportion of shedders (60.7% in the control group (CG) vs. 44.3% in the treatment group (TG); p < 0.01). After considering clustering and confounding factors, the odds of shedding Salmonella in the CG were 2.75 (95% CI = 1.80-4.21) times higher than those of the TG, suggesting a potential efficacy of reduction in shedding as high as 63.6%. This strategy may contribute to mitigating the burden of abattoir environmental contamination.

AB  - Exposure to arsenic (As), an environmental toxicant, causes damages to the central nervous system (CNS) structure and function. Emerging epidemiological studies support that exposure to As, especially during the critical periods of the CNS development, may act as an environmental risk factor of autism spectrum disorders (ASD), which is characterized by behavioral changes, including abnormal social behaviors, restricted interests and repetitive behaviors. However, direct evidence supporting the cause-effect relationship between As exposure and the risk of ASD is still missing. Thus, we aimed to investigate whether As exposure during pregnancy and lactation led to autism-like behaviors in offspring mice in the present study. We established a mice model of Chemosphere (2022) exposure to As via drinking water during pregnancy and lactation and conducted a battery of behavioral tests to evaluate social behaviors, repetitive behaviors, anxiety behaviors and learning and memory ability in offspring mice. We found that perinatal exposure to As caused autism-like behaviors in male offspring, which demonstrated by abnormal social behaviors and repetitive behaviors. Anxiety-like behaviors, and learning and memory impairments, known as concomitant behavioral phenotypes in mice with autism-like behaviors, were also observed. Decreases of synaptic density, especially in cortex, hippocampus and cerebellum, are extensively observed in both ASD patients and animal models of ASD. Thus, immunofluorescence staining and western blotting were used to observe the expression of PSD-95 and SYP, well-known markers for presynaptic and postsynaptic membranes, to assess the synaptic density in offspring cortex, hippocampus and cerebellum. We found perinatal exposure to As decreased the expression of PSD-95 and SYP in these brain regions. This indicated that perinatal exposure to As caused decreases of synaptic density, a typical autism-like cellular alteration in brains, which may contribute to autism-like behaviors in offspring.

AB  - BackgroundAtherosclerosis is a chronic cardiovascular disease of great concern. However, it is difficult to establish a direct connection between conventional small animal models and clinical practice. The pig's genome, physiology, and anatomy reflect human biology better than other laboratory animals, which is crucial for studying the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis.MethodsWe used whole-genome sequencing data from nine Bama minipigs to perform a genome-wide linkage analysis, and further used bioinformatic tools to filter and identify underlying candidate genes. Candidate gene function prediction was performed using the online prediction tool STRING 12.0. Immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence were used to detect the expression of proteins encoded by candidate genes.ResultsWe mapped differential single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) to genes and obtained a total of 102 differential genes, then we used GO and KEGG pathway enrichment analysis to identify four candidate genes, including SLA-1, SLA-2, SLA-3, and TAP2. nsSNPs cause changes in the primary and tertiary structures of SLA-I and TAP2 proteins, the primary structures of these two proteins have undergone amino acid changes, and the tertiary structures also show slight changes. In addition, immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence results showed that the expression changes of TAP2 protein in coronary arteries showed a trend of increasing from the middle layer to the inner layer.ConclusionsWe have identified SLA-I and TAP2 as potential susceptibility genes of atherosclerosis, highlighting the importance of antigen processing and immune response in atherogenesis.
   In our previous research, we found that the clinical manifestations of atherosclerosis in Bama minipigs under the same HCFD dietary induction and feeding environment conditions were different (published separately). Three pigs were susceptible to atherosclerosis, and the remaining six pigs were non-susceptible to atherosclerosis. Excluding other controllable factors, we speculate that genetic factors may play a key role. Liver samples from nine pigs were used for whole-genome sequencing. According to the different susceptibility of pigs to atherosclerosis, we set some filtering conditions and used whole-genome linkage analysis to screen for mutations in exon regions that are not easily found. This identification and verification of new atherosclerosis susceptibility genes provides novel ideas for atherosclerosis research and treatment..image

AB  - Aim of study: To evaluate diets with different proportions of butterfly pea hay (BH) and cactus pear meal (CM) on the intake and digestibility of nutrients, productive performance, feeding behavior and physiological parameters of crossbred Boer kids.
   Area of study: Northwest of Brazil.
   Materials and methods: 32 crossbred Boer intact male goats were distributed in a randomized block design, with four treatments with different proportions of BH and CM in the diets, partially replacing elephant grass on a total dry matter (DM) basis: 0% BH + 0 % CM as a control, 83% BH + 17% CM, 67% BH + 33% CM, and 50% BH + 50% CM. Each treatment group included eight animals. The experiment lasted 84 days preceded by 15 days of adaptation.
   Main results: Kids fed the control diet had the greatest intake of neutral detergent fiber, hemicellulose, water intake via food, time to feed and the lowest feed conversion (p<0.05) compared to BH+CM diets. Diet 83% BH+17% CM provided less digestibility of neutral detergent fiber, greater efficiency of DM intake and lower efficiency of DM and neutral detergent fiber rumination (p<0.05) compared to other diets. Diet 67% BH+33% CM resulted in greater digestibility of dry and organic matter, weight gains and longer (p<0.05) chewing time (seconds/ cud) compared to other diets. Diet 50% BH+50% CM showed lower (p<0.05) intake of acid detergent fiber, time for rumination, efficiency of ingestion of neutral detergent fiber and rectal temperature, and longer (p<0.05) idle times compared to other diets.
   Research highlights: Partial substitution of elephant grass with 67% BH and 33% CM increased digestibility and weight gain of crossbred Boer kids, without changing nutrient and water intake in the finishing.

AB  - Diseases of the cornea are a frequent cause of blindness worldwide. Keratoplasty is an efficient method for treating severely damaged cornea. The functional competence of corneal endothelial cells is crucial for successful grafting, which requires improving the media for the hypothermic cornea preservation, as well as developing the methods for the evaluation of the corneal functional properties. The transport of water and ions by the corneal endothelium is important for the viability and optic properties of the cornea. We studied the impact of SkQ1 on the equilibrium sodium concentration in the endothelial cells after hypothermic preservation of pig cornea at 4C for 1, 5, and 10 days in standard Eusol-C solution. The intracellular sodium concentration in the endothelial cells was assayed using the fluorescent dye Sodium Green; the images were analyzed with the custom-designed CytoDynamics computer program. The concentrations of sodium in the pig corneal endothelium significantly increased after 10 days of hypothermic preservation, while addition of 1.0 nM SkQ1 to the preservation medium decreased the equilibrium concentration of intracellular sodium (at 37C). After 10 days of hypothermic preservation, the permeability of the plasma membrane for sodium decreased in the control cells, but not in the cells preserved in the presence of 1 nM SkQ1. Therefore, SkQ1 increased the ability of endothelial cells to restore the intracellular sodium concentration, which makes SkQ1 a promising agent for facilitating retention of the functional competence of endothelial cells during cold preservation.

AB  - Neurological disorders with onset before or at birth are a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in infants and children. Prenatal treatment has the potential to reduce or prevent irreversible neuronal loss and facilitate normal neurodevelopment. We hypothesized that antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) delivered to the amniotic fluid by intra-amniotic (IA) injection could safely distribute to the fetal central nervous system (CNS) and provide therapeutic benefit in the motor neuron disease spinal muscular atrophy (SMA), caused by mutations of the survival of motor neuron 1 gene (SMN1), leading to deficiency of SMN protein. Although the splice-switching ASO nusinersen ameliorates SMA when delivered postnatally, substantial deficits can remain in severely affected infants. Here, IA injection of ASOs into two mouse models of severe SMA increased SMN expression in the CNS. In SMA Delta 7 mice, which manifest pathology in utero, prenatal treatment improved motor neuron numbers, motor axon development, motor behavioral tests, and survival when compared with those in mice treated postnatally (between P1 and P3). To assess the feasibility of prenatal treatment in a large-animal model, ASOs were delivered midgestation to fetal sheep by IA or intracranial injection. ASOs delivered by IA injection distributed to the spinal cord at therapeutic concentrations and to multiple peripheral tissues without evidence of substantial toxicity to the fetus or mother. These data demonstrated that IA delivery of ASOs holds potential as a minimally invasive approach for prenatal treatment of SMA and possibly other severe, early-onset neurological disorders.

AB  - Hippodamia variegata (Goeze) (Coleoptera: Coccinellidae), is an important natural enemy of aphids, thrips, whiteflies, scale insects, psyllids, and mites. The successful use of this predator in biological control programs requires knowledge of its biology, mass rearing, and cold storage. In this study, we aimed to investigate the effects of different diets, including Agonoscena pistaciae, Aphis nerii (both nymphs and adults), and Ephestia kuehniella (eggs), along with three supplementary compounds (glycerol, trehalose, and proline), on the cold hardiness, lower lethal temperatures (LLT), critical thermal minimum (CTmin), and supercooling point (SCP) of H. variegata. We also explored the potential for rapid cold hardening to enhance the predator's cold tolerance. Our results indicate that both diets and cold acclimation have significant effects on the supercooling point depression and cold tolerance enhancement. The diet of E. kuehniella eggs showed the highest survival rate (89% at -2 degrees C/24 h) and the lowest supercooling point (-18.3 degrees C), making it the best option based on these two criteria. However, the addition of potential cryoprotectants did not significantly affect the supercooling capacity of the predator. The diet of E. kuehniella eggs also had the lowest CTmin (-1.71 degrees C) and lower lethal temperatures (LT50 = -4.0 degrees C), confirming its suitability as the best diet for H. variegata. Exposing the predator to rapid cold hardening can further enhance its cold tolerance. Our findings have important implications for the mass rearing and cold storage of H. variegata and its potential use in biological control programs.

AB  - Fungal endophytes can protect plants against herbivory and be used to control leaf-cutting ants. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the potential of endophytic colonization of Eucalyptus urophylla by three filamentous fungal species and their influence on the plant development and foraging behavior of Atta sexdens. The study design was completely randomized and comprised a factorial scheme of 4 x 3, three antagonistic fungal species (Escovopsis sp., Metarhizium anisopliae, and Trichoderma strigosellum) of the leaf-cutting ant, and one control and three inoculation methods (conidial suspension via foliar spray [FS] and soil drench [SD] inoculation, and seedlings inoculated with mycelium [SWM]). The SWM method allowed T. strigosellum to colonize all plant organs, and these plants exhibited higher height, leaf number, shoot dry mass, and total dry mass than the ones subjected to the other inoculation methods. The SWM method increased the plant height than the control plants and those inoculated with Escovopsis sp. and M. anisopliae. Trichoderma strigosellum, previously isolated from soil, colonized E. urophylla plants and positively influenced their development, as demonstrated by the SWM method. Trichoderma strigosellum promoted the increase in E. urophylla height compared with when the FS and SD methods were used (by 19.62% and 18.52%, respectively). Our results reveal that A. sexdens workers preferentially began cutting the leaves from plants not previously colonized by T. strigosellum. This behavior can be explained by modifications in the phenotypic traits of the eucalyptus leaves.

AB  - A 56-day study was carried out to examine the addition of live foods a biofloc technology (BFT) system on Penaeus vannamei postlarvae performance (PL25, initial weight: 0.15 g). Four treatments were designed, including 1) control: PL were only fed with an artificial diet (38% crude protein; 9%, crude fat) in a clear seawater system; 2) CBC: inclusion of copepod (Calanopia elliptica, 0.2 organisms/mL) in the BFT; 3) ABC: inclusion of Artemia nauplii (Artemia franciscana, 0.1 organisms/mL) in the BFT and 4) RBC: inclusion of rotifer (Brachionus rotundiformis, 0.3 organisms/mL) in the BFT. Postlarvae were stocked into twelve tanks that contained 200 L seawater (70 PL/tank). The mean values for water temperature, salinity, and dissolved oxygen were 31.0 degrees C, 36 ppt, and > 5 ppm, respectively. Total ammonia and nitrite nitrogen in BFT system were lower than the control. The highest and lowest weight gain (4296.5 vs. 3242.2%) was in CBC and the control, respectively. The best feed conversion ratio (FCR) value (1.22) was in CBC group. The gut's epithelial cell length in BFT groups was higher than the control. The highest total hemocyte count (152.2 x 10(5)/mL) and total plasma protein (122.31 g/L) were in CBC group (P < 0.05). The relative abundance of lysozyme, prophenoloxidase, superoxide dismutase, and catalase genes mRNA transcript in the hepatopancreas of shrimps reared in the BFT that supplemented with different live foods was higher than the control (P < 0.05). According to the findings of the present study, the inclusion of Calanopia elliptica at a density of 0.2 organisms/mL in BFT led to higher growth rate, better FCR, and greater immunocompetence in P. vannamei compare to rotifer and Artemia nauplii.

AB  - GolS is critical for the biosynthesis of galactinol and has been suggested to contribute to drought tolerance in various plants. However, whether GolS plays a role in drought response and the underlying transcriptional mechanism of GolS genes in response to drought stress in tea plants is still unclear. In this study, we found that drought stress promotes the accumulation of galactinol in tea leaves and that the expression of CsGolS2-1 and CsGolS2-2, which encode proteins capable of catalyzing galactinol biosynthesis, is continuously and dramatically induced by drought stress. Moreover, transgenic Arabidopsis plants expressing CsGolS2-1 and CsGolS2-2 were more drought-tolerant than WT plants, as evidenced by increased cell membrane stability. In addition, the drought-responsive transcription factor CsWRKY2 has been shown to positively regulate the expression of CsGolS2-1 and CsGolS2-2 by directly binding to their promoters. Furthermore, CsVQ9 was found to interact with CsWRKY2 and promote its transcriptional function to activate CsGolS2-1 and CsGolS2-2 expression. Taken together, our findings provide insights not only into the positive role played by CsGolS2-1 and CsGolS2-2 in the drought response of tea plants but also into the transcriptional mechanisms involved.

AB  - This study examined the effect of supplementation of freezing extender with isoglycyrrhizin (ISL), a natural antioxidant agent, on the quality and fertility potential of goat spermatozoa after cryopreservation. Forty ejaculates were collected from eight Chongming White rams and diluted with five concentrations of ISL: 0 (control group), 50, 100, 150, and 200 mu g/mL. The quality, motility parameters, antioxidant properties, mRNA expression of antioxidant and ferroptosis genes, and ability to induce fertilization, were evaluated following freezing/ thawing. Total motility and progressive motility were significantly increased in spermatozoa following the addition of 150 and 200 mu g/mL ISL. Superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px), and catalase (CAT) activities were enhanced in all ISL-supplemented groups compared to controls. Adding ISL decreased the levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS), malondialdehyde (MDA) and nitric oxide (NO). mRNA levels of ferroptosis-related genes, voltage-dependent anion channel protein 2 (VDAC2), voltage-dependent anion channel protein 3 (VDAC3), protein 53 (P53), and nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (NRF2) tended to decrease after adding ISL, whereas the levels of antioxidant genes glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4) and glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX5), tended to increase. The best spermatozoa quality and the strongest antioxidant properties were obtained after adding 150 mu g/mL ISL. Therefore, fresh semen, frozen semen, and frozen semen with 150 mu g/ mL ISL was used for in vitro fertilization of oocytes. The cleavage and blastocyst rates were significantly lower in frozen semen compared with fresh semen, whereas frozen semen containing 150 mu g/mL ISL showed a significant increase in cleavage and blastocyst rates compared with frozen semen. In conclusion, ISL can be used as an antioxidant in goat semen cryodilution, and the addition of ISL can improve the quality and antioxidant properties of frozen and thawed spermatozoa. ISL can also protect the ability of spermatozoa to be fertilized and develop; 150 mu g/mL ISL was the optimal concentration for addition.

AB  - The present study aimed to elucidate the effect of different levels of dietary protein during late pregnancy on the performance of Black Bengal does and their kids. Twelve does were divided into three groups, with four in each, and three diets, i.e., high protein (18% CP), medium protein (14% CP), and low protein (10% CP) were supplied for 50 days, commencing from 100 days post-coitum to parturition. During the first 100 days of pregnancy, uniform rations with similar ingredients were provided to fulfill the nutrient requirements depending on the live weight of does. All three diets were isocaloric (10.0 MJ/kg DM). Data were subjected to one-way ANOVA, and the significance of the difference among means was determined by Duncan's Multiple Range Test (DMRT). The main effects of diet and sex, as well as their interaction, were analyzed by two-way ANOVA by using the GLM procedure. The relative expression values of qPCR were calculated by using the 2(-Delta Delta Ct) analysis method. Live weight gain was significantly (p < 0.05) higher in high-protein-fed dams than other groups during the experimental period. The milk yield of does was significantly (p < 0.05) higher in high-protein-fed goats than in the low-protein group. The lactation length of does was significantly (p < 0.05) higher in the high- and medium-protein-fed does than in the low-protein-fed does. The duration of post-partum anestrus of does was significantly (p < 0.05) higher in the low-protein-fed dams than in the high-protein group. The birth weight of kids tended to be higher in the high-protein group but did not differ significantly among the treatment groups. In male kids, weaning weight, final weight, live weight gain, and average daily gain were significantly (p < 0.05) higher than in female kids. Weaning weight was higher (p < 0.05) in kids of the high-protein-fed does than the low-protein group. Final weight and live weight gain were significantly (p < 0.05) higher in kids of the high-protein-fed does than in the low-protein-fed group. On the other hand, average daily gain was significantly (p < 0.05) higher in kids of the high- and medium-protein-fed does than the low-protein group. The average body length and wither height of kids at the 32nd week was significantly (p < 0.05) higher in kids of high-protein-fed does than those of the low-protein-fed group. The average heart girth of kids at the 32nd week was significantly (p < 0.05) higher in kids of high-protein-fed does than the medium- and low-protein groups. The survival rate of kids was higher in the medium- and high-protein-fed does than in low-protein group. Hot carcass weight and ether extract content of meat were significantly (p < 0.05) higher in the high-protein group than in the other groups. The dressing percentage was significantly (p < 0.05) higher in the kids of high-protein-fed does than low-protein-fed goats. The expression of the H-FABP gene was significantly (p < 0.05) higher in kids of high-protein-fed does than those of the medium- and low-protein groups. In conclusion, maternal dietary protein levels positively influences the production performance of Black Bengal does and their kids.

AB  - Herein, our goal was to explore the creatine role in the fat suppression of grass carp (GC). In vivo, four semipurified diets containing 5% lipid (normal diet, ND), 8% lipid (high-fat diet, HFD), 8%lipid+1%creatine (HFD+CR1), and 8%lipid+2%creatine (HFD+CR2) were designed and formulated, which were fed to juvenile GC (18.51 +/- 0.04 g) for 56 days. HFD significantly increased the intraperitoneal fat index as well as the serum and hepatic triglyceride (TG), total cholesterol (TC), and nonesterified fatty acid (NEFA) levels compared to ND; these effects were all attenuated following the addition of creatine in HFD (p < 0.05). Relative to HFD, HFD+CR2 markedly enhanced lipid catabolic gene expressions in the hepatopancreas. This included peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha, adipose TG lipase (atgl), hormone-sensitive lipase, and carnitine palmitoyltransferase (cpt-1). The protein concentrations of mitochondrial respiratory chain complexes I/II/III/IV/V in the hepatopancreas were upregulated in fish fed HFD+CR1 and HFD+CR2 diets, relative to the HFD-fed fish diet (p < 0.05). In vitro, hepatocytes (L8824) preincubated with oleic acid for 24 h were exposed to varying concentrations of creatine (0, 10, 50, 100, 200, and 400 mu M) for another 24 h. The number of lipid droplets in each cell remarkably decreased as the concentration of creatine increased in the medium (p < 0.05). Creatine also markedly enhanced the relative transcript levels of genes related to lipolysis (such as agtl), beta-oxidation (such as cpt-1 and acyl-CoA dehydrogenase very long chain), and the mitochondrial respiratory chain (such as succinate dehydrogenase complex subunit A and cytochrome c-1). Collectively, the study demonstrates that dietary creatine can suppress lipid accumulation and increase lipid catabolic capacity in GC.

AB  - Alcohol use disorder (AUD) frequently co-occurs with dissociative disorders and disorders with dissociative symptoms, suggesting a common neurobiological basis. It has been proposed that facilitated information processing under the influence of alcohol, resulting in the formation of dissociated memories, might be an important factor controlling alcohol use. Access to such memories is facilitated under the effect of alcohol, thus further reinforcing alcohol use. To interrogate possible mechanisms associated with these phenotypes, we used a mouse model of dissociative amnesia, combined with a high-alcohol preferring (HAP) model of AUD. Dissociated memory was induced by activation of hippocampal extrasynaptic GABA type A receptor delta subunits (GABAAR8), which control tonic inhibition and to which ethanol binds with high affinity. Increased ethanol preference was associated with increased propensity to form dissociated memories dependent on GABAAR-8 in the dorsal hippocampus (DH). Furthermore, the DH level of GABAAR-8 protein, but not mRNA, was increased in HAP mice, and was inversely correlated to the level of miR-365-3p, suggesting an miRNA-mediated post-transcriptional mechanism contributing to elevated GABAAR-8. The observed changes of DH GABAAR-8 were associated with a severe reduction of excitatory projections stemming from GABAAR-8-containing pyramidal neurons in the subiculum and terminating in the mammillary body. These results suggest that both molecular and circuit dysfunction involving hippocampal GABAAR-8 receptors might contribute to the co-occurrence of ethanol preference and dissociated information processing.

AB  - ObjectiveHypoandrogenism, a condition linked to oxidative stress and hippocampal cell death, can lead to learning and memory disorders in aging men or those with hypogonadism. Recently, microRNAs such as miR-30a, miR-375, and miR-204 have been identified as regulators of cell death and memory formation. Flavonoid antioxidants that modulate microRNA expression offer a potential therapeutic approach for neurodegenerative conditions. This study examines the effects of the flavonoid chrysin on these microRNAs, cell death processes, and memory under hypoandrogenic stress.MethodsRats were assigned to six groups: control, hypoandrogenic, hypoandrogenic treated with chrysin (50 mg/kg and 75 mg/kg), and chrysin treated alone (50 mg/kg and 75 mg/kg). After 14 days, memory changes were assessed using the Morris water maze test, along with evaluations of oxidative stress enzymes, apoptosis and autophagy, miR-30a, miR-375, and miR-204 gene expression, and the number of dark neurons.ResultsHypoandrogenism increased apoptosis and autophagy gene expression, dark neurons, oxidative stress enzymes, and decreased memory and microRNA expression compared to controls. Treatment with chrysin (75 mg/kg) significantly reduced apoptosis and autophagy gene expression, dark neurons, and oxidative stress enzymes, and improved memory and learning. This group also showed modulation of miR-30a, miR-375, and miR-204 levels compared to the hypoandrogenic group.ConclusionHypoandrogenism led to neurodegeneration and memory impairment, likely due to oxidative stress affecting miR-30a, miR-375, and miR-204 regulation. Chrysin (75 mg/kg) potentially mitigates cell death processes and memory deficits in hypoandrogenism by modulating these microRNAs.

AB  - Listeria monocytogenes continues to be one of the most important public health challenges for the meat sector. Many attempts have been made to establish the most efficient cleaning and disinfection protocols, but there is still the need for the sector to develop plans with different lines of action. In this regard, an interesting strategy could be based on the control of this type of foodborne pathogen through the resident microbiota naturally established on the surfaces. A potential inhibitor, Bacillus safensis, was found in a previous study that screened the interaction between the resident microbiota and L. monocytogenes in an Iberian pig processing plant. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the effect of preformed biofilms of Bacillus safensis on the adhesion and implantation of 22 strains of L. monocytogenes. Mature preformed B. safensis biofilms can inhibit adhesion and the biofilm formation of multiple L. monocytogenes strains, eliminating the pathogen by a currently unidentified mechanism. Due to the non-enterotoxigenic properties of B. safensis, its presence on certain meat industry surfaces should be favored and it could represent a new way to fight against the persistence of L. monocytogenes in accordance with other bacterial inhibitors and hygiene operations.

AB  - Elimination of protein-rich waste materials is one of the vital environmental protection requirements. Using of nonnaturally occurring chemicals for their remediation properties can potentially induce new pollutants. Therefore, enzymes encoded in the genomes of microorganisms evolved in the same environment can be considered suitable alternatives to chemicals. Identification of efficient proteases that can hydrolyze recalcitrant, protein-rich wastes produced by various industrial processes has been widely welcomed as an eco-friendly waste management strategy. In this direction, we attempted to screen a thereto-halo-alkali-stable metagenome-derived protease (PersiProtease1) from tannery wastewater. The PersiProtease1 exhibited high pH stability over a wide range and at 1 h in pH 11.0 maintained 87.59% activity. The enzyme possessed high thermal stability while retaining 76.64% activity after 1 hat 90 degrees C. Moreover, 65.34% of the initial activity of the enzyme remained in the presence of 6 M NaCl, showing tolerance against high salinity. The presence of various metal ions, inhibitors, and organic solvents did not remarkably inhibit the activity of the discovered protease. The PersiProtease1 was extracted from the tannery wastewater microbiota and efficiently applied for biodegradation of real sample tannery wastewater protein, chicken feathers, whey protein, dehairing sheep-skins, and waste X-ray films. PersiProtease1 proved its enormous potential in simultaneous biodegradation of solid and liquid protein-rich industrial wastes based on the results.

AB  - Between July and September 2021, researchers collected 100 specimens of the Spanish slug, Arion vulgaris, and dissected their cadavers to examine them for parasitic nematodes. Molecular techniques were used to identify the nematodes, which confirmed the presence of Oscheius myriophilus, marking the first recorded instance of this nematode in a gastropod host. To test the virulence of Slovenian strains of O. myriophilus and Phasmarhabditis papillosa and their effects on the feeding behavior of the Spanish slug, grey field slug (Deroceras reticulatum), and vineyard snail (Cernuella virgata), laboratory bioassays were conducted using nematodes grown in vivo. Nematodes were applied at various doses ranging from 10 to 500 nematodes/gastropod. The results showed that O. myriophilus and P. papillosa caused significant mortality (82.5% +/- 2.5% at 15 C-circle) of the Spanish slug while being less effective against the vineyard snail and grey field slug. Nematodes were more virulent at a lower temperature (15 C-circle) than at the higher temperature (20 C-circle) tested in the experiment. Additionally, both nematode species significantly reduced gastropod herbivory. The potential use of O. myriophilus and P. papillosa as biological control agents against gastropods is discussed.

AB  - This paper studies the behavior monitoring of pigs using active electronic ear tags embedded with triaxial acceleration sensors. Ear-flapping can cause high variability and noise into the accelerometer data. To address this issue, a three-layer classification model is proposed. Each layer utilizes different window sizes, overlap rates, features, and machine learning models to effectively classify behaviors ranging from low to high locomotor activity. Model parameters for each layer calculate probabilities for different behaviors, and a probabilistic strategy merges consecutive time slices of the same behavior, similar to dynamic window effects. The experiment collected triaxial acceleration data from 16 sows over 274 days. Video data from surveillance cameras were used to annotate pigs' behaviors such as eating and walking. Data analysis shows that the first layer, using a logistic regression model with a 135.2-second window size, achieves a 0.95 recognition rate for low locomotor activity. The second layer, employing a logistic regression model with a 25.92-second window size, achieves a recognition rate of 0.76 for eating behavior. The third layer, using a support vector machine model with a 10.56-second window size, attains recognition rates of 0.88, 0.75, and 0.76 for sitting, walking, and high locomotor activity, respectively. The random forest based probabilistic strategy integrates the results of the three-layer classification model to classify behaviors throughout the day, achieving an average accuracy of 0.92. This three-layer classification model with a probabilistic strategy effectively classifies 24-hour behaviors and detects abnormalities such as lameness and vomiting in the experimental pigs.

AB  - Paeonia lactiflora Pall. is a world-famous ornamental plant, whose roots have been used as an important traditional Chinese medicine, Shaoyao, to treat diseases for more than 1,000 years. Because of the excellent curative effect of Shaoyao, its quality has attracted wide attention, however, there is a lack of comprehensive research on the different influencing factors of quality of Shaoyao. In this study, ultra-performance liquid chromatography-quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (UPLC-Q/TOF-MS) and high-performance liquid chromatography with diode-array detection (HPLC-DAD) were utilized to systematically analyze the Shaoyao of different ages, diameters and roots with "pockmarks." 60 metabolites were detected and identified from Shaoyao using the UPLC-Q/TOF-MS, of which 20 potential quality markers of dissected roots with and without "pockmarks" were selected for the first time using the orthogonal partial least squares discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA) and the variable importance for projection (VIP) plot. Then, a selective and accurate HPLC-DAD quantitative assay has been developed for the simultaneous determination of 11 bioactive components in Shaoyao. The results showed that the total content of five monoterpene glycosides including oxypaeoniflorin, albiflorin, paeoniflorin, lactiflorin, and benzoylpaeoniflorin and six phenols including gallic acid, catechin, methyl gallate, ethyl gallate, apiopaeonoside and benzoic acid in the 3-year-old Shaoyao was higher than that of 4-year-old and 5-year-old Shaoyao. In Shaoyao of the same age, the total content of five monoterpene glycosides and six phenols decreased with an increase in diameter. In addition, regardless of whether it is a whole or a divided root, the contents of five monoterpene glycosides and six phenols in Shaoyao with "pockmarks" were higher than those of Shaoyao without "pockmarks." In summary, this work has explored several factors that might affect the quality of Shaoyao, and provide a guide for more comprehensive quality evaluation in its further production, processing, and rational utilization.

AB  - Simple Summary The germplasm banks of wild species, such as Iberian red deer, are not widespread, mainly due to the difficulties of collecting and cryopreserving reproductive cells. Optimal freezing protocols under field conditions could be a breakthrough for these species. In this study, epididymal sperm was evaluated using two methods of sperm storage during refrigeration (tube and straw); four equilibration periods (0, 30, 60, and 120 min); and four methods of freezing (cryopreservation in liquid nitrogen vapors in a tank (control) or box, freezing in dry ice, or freezing over a metallic plate). The results showed that samples stored in straws during refrigeration produced less apoptotic spermatozoa and more viable spermatozoa withactive mitochondria. A long equilibration period (120 min) yielded a higher percentage of acrosomal integrity. Moreover, there was no difference in sperm quality between freezing in liquid nitrogen vapors in a tank or box. However, a worse quality was obtained when the samples were cryopreserved in dry ice or over a metallic plate compared to the control. Creating germplasm banks of wild species, such as the Iberian red Deer (Cervus elaphus hispanicus) can be challenging. One of the main difficulties is the obtention and cryopreservation of good-quality reproductive cells when the spermatozoa are obtained from epididymides after death. To avoid a loss of seminal quality during transport, developing alternative methods for cooling and freezing sperm samples under field conditions is necessary. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of different durations of equilibrium and different techniques of cooling and freezing on Iberian red deer epididymal sperm quality after thawing to optimize the processing conditions in this species. Three experiments were carried out: (I) evaluation of refrigeration in straws or tubes of 15 mL; (II) study of equilibration period (0, 30, 60, or 120 min); and (III) comparison of four freezing techniques (liquid nitrogen vapor in a tank (C), liquid nitrogen vapor in a polystyrene box (B), dry ice (DY), and placing straws on a solid metallic plate floating on the surface of liquid nitrogen (MP)). For all experiments, sperm motility and kinematic parameters, acrosomal integrity, sperm viability, mitochondrial membrane potential, and DNA integrity were evaluated after thawing. All statistical analyses were performed by GLM-ANOVA analysis. Samples refrigerated in straws showed higher values (p <= 0.05) for mitochondrial activity and lower values (p <= 0.05) for apoptotic cells. Moreover, the acrosome integrity showed significant differences (p <= 0.05) between 0 and 120 min, but not between 30 and 60 min, of equilibration. Finally, no significant differences were found between freezing in liquid nitrogen vapors in a tank or in a box, although there was a low quality after thawing when the samples were cryopreserved in dry ice or by placing straws on a solid metallic plate floating on the surface of liquid nitrogen. In conclusion, under field conditions, it would be possible to refrigerate the sperm samples by storing them in straws with a 120 min equilibration period and freezing them in liquid nitrogen vapors in a tank or box.

AB  - Background Information The endo-lysosomal system (ELS) comprises a set of membranous organelles responsible for transporting intracellular and extracellular components within cells. Defects in lysosomal proteins usually affect a large variety of processes and underlie many diseases, most of them with a strong neuronal impact. Mutations in the endoplasmic reticulum-resident CLN8 protein cause CLN8 disease. This condition is one of the 14 known neuronal ceroid lipofuscinoses (NCLs), a group of inherited diseases characterised by accumulation of lipofuscin-like pigments within lysosomes. Besides mediating the transport of soluble lysosomal proteins, recent research suggested a role for CLN8 in the transport of vesicles and lipids, and autophagy. However, the consequences of CLN8 deficiency on ELS structure and activity, as well as the potential impact on neuronal development, remain poorly characterised. Therefore, we performed CLN8 knockdown in neuronal and non-neuronal cell models to analyse structural, dynamic and functional changes in the ELS and to assess the impact of CLN8 deficiency on axodendritic development.
   Results CLN8 knockdown increased the size of the Golgi apparatus, the number of mobile vesicles and the speed of endo-lysosomes. Using the fluorescent fusion protein mApple-LAMP1-pHluorin, we detected significant lysosomal alkalisation in CLN8-deficient cells. In turn, experiments in primary rat hippocampal neurons showed that CLN8 deficiency decreased the complexity and size of the somatodendritic compartment.
   Conclusions Our results suggest the participation of CLN8 in vesicular distribution, lysosomal pH and normal development of the dendritic tree. We speculate that the defects triggered by CLN8 deficiency on ELS structure and dynamics underlie morphological alterations in neurons, which ultimately lead to the characteristic neurodegeneration observed in this NCL.
   Significance This is, to our knowledge, the first characterisation of the effects of CLN8 dysfunction on the structure and dynamics of the ELS. Moreover, our findings suggest a novel role for CLN8 in somatodendritic development, which may account at least in part for the neuropathological manifestations associated with CLN8 disease.

AB  - Hypoxia can adversely affect multiple organ systems. This study investigated the impact of intermittent hypoxia on serotonin levels and depression-like behaviors across distinct neuroanatomical regions. Sixteen adult female Wistar albino rats were divided into two groups: control (n = 8) and hypoxia (n = 8). The hypoxia group was exposed to a simulated altitude of 3000 for 5 h daily over 14 days. Behavioral assessments included locomotor activity (open field test) and depression-like behaviors (forced swimming test). Serotonin levels were quantified via ELISA in the prefrontal cortex, striatum, thalamus, hypothalamus, hippocampus, and serum. Intermittent hypoxia did not alter locomotor activity (p > 0.05) but significantly increased depression-like behavior (p < 0.05), accompanied by a pronounced reduction in swimming behavior (p < 0.0001), a marker associated with serotonergic function. Serotonin levels were significantly reduced in the prefrontal cortex (p < 0.005) and striatum (p < 0.05), while no changes were observed in other regions or serum (p > 0.05). These findings demonstrate that intermittent hypoxia induces depression-like behaviors and region-specific serotonin depletion, particularly in the prefrontal cortex and striatum. This underscores the need to evaluate hypoxia-related brain health implications in conditions such as sleep apnea and acute mountain sickness.

AB  - Simple Summary Foot-related lameness is one of the most significant welfare issues in farm animals. Contrary to dairy cows and meat sheep breeds, epizootiological data on foot-lesions and associated lameness in dairy sheep are scarce. In this study, data were collected from 30 representative intensive dairy sheep farms. Multivariate statistical analysis was used to produce a typology of intensive farming systems which resulted in the assignment of farms in two distinct clusters. Six hundred adult ewes were randomly selected from six flocks (three flocks per cluster) and a cross-sectional study was implemented to investigate the epizootiology and potential risk factors of foot-related lameness, foot-lesions and diseases. Ovine interdigital dermatitis and infectious footrot were the most common infectious foot diseases, while white line disease and hoof wall cracks were the most prevalent non-infectious lesions. Infectious footrot was the main cause of lameness and increased with age, whereas body condition score was associated with increased prevalence of ovine interdigital dermatitis. Comparisons between the clusters regarding foot-related lameness, foot-diseases and lesions at the animal, the limb, and the hoof level are presented, and relevant literature, mechanisms, hypotheses, and challenges of the field are discussed. Foot-related lameness, foot-diseases and lesions are emerging issues in dairy sheep; however, relevant epizootiological studies are scarce, and risk factors have not been elucidated. The objectives of this cross-sectional study were (i) to address this dearth of knowledge by investigating the epizootiology of lameness-related foot-lesions and diseases, and (ii) to assess the impact of potential risk factors on foot health, in intensive dairy sheep farms. Thirty farms were assigned in two representative clusters using a multivariate statistical analysis. Three farms per cluster and 100 multiparous milking ewes per farm (total n = 600) were selected and enrolled in the study. Foot-related lameness, ovine interdigital dermatitis (OID), infectious footrot (IFR), white line disease, hoof wall cracks, as well as health and welfare traits were recorded. Overall prevalence of foot-related lameness was 9.0% and was primarily associated with IFR; however, additional infectious and non-infectious foot diseases and lesions also contributed. Among infectious foot diseases, OID was the most prevalent (21.3%) followed by IFR (8.0%); WLD and hoof wall cracks were the most prevalent non-infectious foot-lesions (37.7% and 15.3%, respectively). IFR and OID prevalence increased with age (p < 0.05) and BCS (p < 0.01), respectively, suggesting that host-related factors and husbandry practices are important determinants of its occurrence.

AB  - In the wild cruciferous wintercress (Barbarea vulgaris), beta-amyrin-derived saponins are involved in resistance against insect herbivores like the major agricultural pest diamondback moth (Plutella xylostella). Enzymes belonging to the 2,3-oxidosqualene cyclase family have been identified and characterized in B. vulgaris G-type and P-type plants that differ in their natural habitat, insect resistance and saponin content. Both G-type and P-type plants possess highly similar 2,3-oxidosqualene cyclase enzymes that mainly produce beta-amyrin (Barbarea vulgaris Lupeol synthase 5 G-Type; BvLUP5-G) or alpha-amyrin (Barbarea vulgaris Lupeol synthase 5 P-Type; BvLUP5-P), respectively. Despite the difference in product formation, the two BvLUP5 enzymes are 98% identical at the amino acid level. This provides a unique opportunity to investigate determinants of product formation, using the B. vulgaris 2,3-oxidosqualene cyclase enzymes as a model for studying amino acid residues that determine differences in product formation. In this study, we identified two amino acid residues at position 121 and 735 that are responsible for the dominant changes in generated product ratios of beta-amyrin and alpha-amyrin in both BvLUP5 enzymes. These amino acid residues have not previously been highlighted as directly involved in 2,3-oxidosqualene cyclase product specificity. Our results highlight the functional diversity and promiscuity of 2,3-oxidosqualene cyclase enzymes. These enzymes serve as important mediators of metabolic plasticity throughout plant evolution.
   Mutational studies revealed functional differences in oxidosqualene cyclases that initiate the biosynthesis of insecticidal saponins in B. vulgaris subspecies that differ in herbivore resistance.J.G.: data analysis, homology modeling, phylogenetic analysis, manuscript preparation; P.o.E.: experimental design, all lab work, data handling and writing; B.K.: PARAFAC2 modeling and statistical analysis; S.B.: experimental design and writing.

AB  - Most ornithophilous plants have red flowers; this has been associated with 'the bee avoidance hypothesis', in which ornithophilous flowers may bear colors that are less conspicuous to bees than melittophilous flowers. In the genus Camellia, C. rusticana and C. japonica bear red flowers and yet recruit different pollinators; the former is entomophilous, while the latter is ornithophilous. C. japonica is considered to have been speciated from a common ancestor later than C. rusticana, accompanying a pollinator shift from insects to birds. Nevertheless, factors explaining the pollinator difference in camellias remain rudimentary. In this study, the color traits of the two camellias were investigated, to determine their color strategy to allure different pollinators.The behavior of bees towards the two camellias was examined by a two-choice assay. Flower color charac-teristics of the two camellias were analyzed with diffuse reflectance and fluorescence spectra. Based on the visual sensory system of bees and birds, the achromatic contrast, chromatic contrast, intensity, and spectral purity of the two species were evaluated, testing the bee avoidance hypothesis. Furthermore, the compounds responsible for the fluorescence, likely serving as a visual attractant, were identified by NMR and MS.Bees visited C. rusticana flowers almost exclusively and C. japonica hardly at all. Reflectance spectral data showed that C. rusticana petals are more conspicuous to bees than birds due to a UV-reflection secondary peak; and that C. japonica petals exhibited crucially low chromatic contrast against a leaf background to bees, sug-gesting them to be almost indistinguishable. On the other hand, C. japonica flowers appeared conspicuous to birds. The anthers of C. rusticana exhibited blue fluorescence derived from two anthranilates, while those of C. japonica did not.The two camellias offer different color strategies to be conspicuous to their respective pollinators, and C. japonica seemed to have evolved to avoid bees. Alterations in these color traits may have played a role in pollinator shift.

AB  - This study was conducted to evaluate the protective efficacy of modified live vaccines (MLVs) against porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRS) in nursery pigs in a worst case scenario where MLV does not match the genetic profile of the field isolate, different MLVs are used for sows and piglets, and piglets are naturally exposed to genetically distinct heterologous PRRS virus (PRRSV) isolates. We divided 76,075, 2-week-old piglets from a seropositive sow herd vaccinated with US1-MLV into four groups. US1-MLV, US2-MLV, and US3-MLV groups were vaccinated with PRRSV-2 MLV including Ingelvac (R) PRRS MLV (Boehringer Ingelheim, Ingelheim am Rhein, Germany), HP-PRRSV-2 based MLV (Harbin Veterinary Research Institute, CAAS, Harbin, China), and Prime Pac (R) PRRS (MSD Animal Health, Rahway, NJ, USA), respectively. The NonVac group was left unvaccinated. At 0, 14, 28, and 56 days post-vaccination (DPV), sera were assayed for the presence of PRRSV-specific antibodies using ELISA and serum neutralization (SN), and PRRSV RNA using PCR. Average daily gain (ADG) and survival rates were compared between treatment groups. The results demonstrated vaccinated groups significantly improved in ADG compared to the non-vaccinated control group. Only US1-MLV and US3-MLV were able to significantly reduce mortality associated with field PRRSV infection in nursery pigs. Pigs vaccinated with US3-MLV displayed significantly lower mortality and higher ADG compared to all other groups. Field isolates were isolated and genetically compared to all three MLV vaccines at the start of the trial. The MLV with closest genetic similarity to the field isolate was US2-MLV by ORF5 gene comparison. This provided the lowest protection judging by ADG improvement and mortality reduction, as compared to US1-MLV and US3-MLV. Separately, strains of Thai PRRSV-2 isolates collected in 2017, 2019, and 2020 in the study area were investigated for evolutionary changes. Over time, we observed a shift in PRRSV-2 isolates from lineage 8.7 to lineage 1. The field isolates found shared 82.59-84.42%, 83.75-85.74%, and 84.25-85.90% nucleotide identity with the US1-MLV, US3-MLV and US2-MLV based vaccine, respectively. Our findings suggest genetic similarity between field viruses and vaccine strains should not be used as a predictor of field performance. We found that zootechnical performance of piglets was best in US3-MLV, despite sows being treated with a different vaccine The results also support that different MLVs can be used at different stages of production. Finally, we concluded that the shift from lineage 8.7 to lineage 1 was due to shifts in the worldwide prevalence of PRRSV isolates during that period of time and not due to vaccine recombination between isolates. Overall, MLV vaccine selection should be based on production performance and safety profile.

AB  - Doxorubicin (DOX) is broadly used as a medication for cancer treatment. However, DOX has been connected with chemotherapy-related complications, for instance, cognitive impairment (chemobrain). Chemobrain developed in up to 70% of cancer patients; therapeutic is unavailable. This study investigated the preventive effect of pioglitazone (PIO) on neurotoxicity caused by (DOX) in the hippocampus. Forty rats were separated into four groups; control (normal saline 10 ml/kg), DOX (5 mg/kg, intraperitoneally every 3rd day, equivalent to 20 mg/kg cumulative dose), PIO (2 mg/kg in drinking water), and DOX+PIO (DOX, 5 mg/kg, intraperitoneally every 3rd day concurrently PIO, 2 mg/kg in drinking water) and duration of drug treatment lasted for 14 days. The animals were subjected to contextual fear memory tests to characterize the cognitive impairment following DOX treatment. ELISA assessed hippocampal protein expression related to inflammation, oxidative damage, and apoptosis. DOX-treatment produced significant reduction in freezing duration in contextual fear memory tests, which was reversed by PIO co-administration. DOX increased neuroinflammation, oxidative stress, apoptosis, and mitochondrial activity by increasing NF-kappa B and COX-2 levels, reducing SOD levels, and increasing Bax, caspase-3, and lipid peroxidation. However, DOX did not affect GSH or catalase levels. PIO co-administration reduces NF-kappa B, COX-2, MDA, Bax, and caspase-3 levels and improves mitochondrial activity and SOD expression. To sum up, DOX therapy accelerates cognitive decline in rats by increasing neuroinflammation, oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, lipid peroxidation, and apoptosis. PIO is a promising treatment for DOXinduced cognitive impairment.

AB  - Simple Summary Porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV2) is currently the smallest known animal virus, and the diseases caused by its infection have caused huge economic losses to the pig farming industry worldwide. The virus evolves rapidly and is divided into nine genotypes, some of which pose significant challenges in preventing and controlling the disease. In this study, the polymerase chain reaction technique and bioinformatic analysis were used to investigate PCV2 infection in pig farms in Jiangsu Province, China. The results showed that the infection rate of PCV2 in pig farms in Jiangsu Province has been increasing annually, with genotypes PCV2a, PCV2b, PCV2d, and PCV2i. The genomic characteristics of the recently confirmed genotype PCV2i were elucidated.Abstract Porcine circovirus-associated diseases, caused by porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV2), are widespread and result in significant economic losses to the global swine industry. PCV2 can currently be divided into nine genotypes (PCV2a to PCV2i), with the currently dominant one being the PCV2d genotype. In this study, 2675 samples from 804 pig farms in 13 cities in Jiangsu Province, China, were collected between 2014 and 2021 and subjected to polymerase chain reaction analysis to investigate the frequency and genetic diversity of PCV2. The results showed that 41.42% (1108/2675) of samples tested positive for PCV2. The researchers further analyzed the genetic characteristics of 251 PCV2 strains and found that they belonged to the following four genotypes: PCV2a, PCV2b, PCV2d, and PCV2i. The dominant genotype was PCV2d, with a frequency of 49.80% (125/251). The detection rate of PCV2b was significantly higher than those of PCV2a and PCV2i, at 35.46% (89/251), 7.57% (19/251), and 7.17% (18/251), respectively. The percentage of different genotypes of PCV2 varied irregularly over time. We have further revealed the fingerprint of PCV2i genomic nucleotides for the first time. In conclusion, this study illustrates the high frequency and evolutionary features of PCV2 in Jiangsu Province over the past few years.

AB  - Gastrointestinal nematodes (GIN) use flexible life history strategies to maintain their fitness under environmental challenges. Costs incurred by a challenge to one life trait can be recouped by increasing the expression of subsequent life traits throughout their life cycle. Anticipating how parasites respond to the challenge of control interventions is critical for the long-term sustainability of the practice and to further ensure that the parasites withstand favourable adaptive responses. There is currently limited information on whether distinct populations of a GIN species respond to the same environmental challenge in a consistent manner, with similar alterations to their life history strategies or comparable fitness outcomes. This study compared the life history traits and experimental fitness of three distinct Haemonchus contortus isolates exposed to environmental challenges at both the parasitic (i.e., passage through resistant or susceptible sheep) and free-living (i.e., exposure to diverse climatic conditions) life stages. The key findings show that H. contortus maintain their fitness under challenge with isolate-specific alterations to their life history strategies. Further, partial exploration of the H. contortus isolates transcriptomes using cDNA-AFLP methods confirmed disparate expression profiles between them. These results bring fresh insights into our understanding of the non-genetic adaptive processes of GIN that may hinder the efficacy of parasite control strategies.

AB  - Plants have developed tissue-specific defense strategies in response to various herbivores with different feeding habits. Although defense responses to leaf-chewing insects have been well studied, little is known about stem-specific responses, particularly in the pith, to stem-boring herbivores. To understand the stem-specific defense, we first conducted a comparative transcriptomic analysis of the wild tobacco Nicotiana attenuata before and after attack by the leaf-chewing herbivore Manduca sexta and the stem borer Trichobaris mucorea. When the stem-boring herbivore attacked, lignin-associated genes were upregulated specifically in the inner parenchymal cells of the stem, the pith; lignin also accumulated highly in the attacked pith. Silencing the lignin biosynthetic gene cinnamyl alcohol dehydrogenase enhanced the performance of the stem-boring herbivore but had no effect on the growth of the leaf-chewing herbivore. Two-dimensional nuclear magnetic resonance results revealed that lignified pith contains feruloyltyramine as an unusual lignin component in the cell wall, as a response against stem-boring herbivore attack. Pith-specific lignification induced by the stem-boring herbivore was modulated by both jasmonate and ethylene signaling. These results suggest that lignin provides a stem-specific inducible barrier, protecting plants against stem-boring insects.

AB  - General anesthesia is considered a risk factor for postoperative cognitive dysfunction. However, it is unclear what the neuronal and cognitive consequences of general anesthesia are and whether they can be treated. One possible pathomechanism is hippocampal neurogenesis. We investigated how the anesthetic isoflurane affects adult hippocampal neurogenesis and associated cognitive functions and whether the neurogenic stimulus of physical activity reverses isoflurane-induced changes. We exposed young adult mice to isoflurane (ISO) -half had access to a running wheel (ISO-RW). Both groups were compared with a control condition (CTR; CTR-RW). Cell proliferation and survival in the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus were quantified histologically 48 h and 3 weeks after anesthesia by bromodeoxyuridine incorporation. Cell phenotype was determined by expression of neuronal markers, and the extent of continuous endogenous neuronal proliferation was estimated from the number of doublecortin-positive cells. The Morris water maze was used to test hippocampus-dependent functions. We found that isoflurane decreased proliferation of neuronal progenitor cells, whereas survival of mature neurons remained intact. Consistent with intact neuronal survival, spatial memory associated with neurogenesis also proved intact in the Morris water maze despite isoflurane exposure. Physical activity attenuated the observed neuronal changes by preventing the decrease in newborn neuronal progenitor cells and the decline in continuous endogenous neuronal proliferation in isoflurane-treated animals. In conclusion, isoflurane selectively impairs neuronal proliferation but not survival or neurogenesis-linked cognition in adult mice. The observed adverse effects can be attenuated by physical activity, a cost-effective means of preventing the neurogenic consequences of general anesthesia.

AB  - Environmental enrichment (EE) has been a widely used tool to improve animal welfare, as well as to study brain plasticity. Traditional EE settings in the field of neuroscience employ highly complex cages with numerous objects and increased space, whereas more simple additions included for the control treatment are rarely considered in the experimental design. This leads to a lack of consistency of what neuroscientists designate as "standard housing," which might compromise the reproducibility of the results. Therefore, we employed standard-sized cages to study how different EE configurations can affect several biological markers of animal welfare. We first compared barren cages with cages containing nest material and a cardboard roll or cages having a complex set of elements. For this purpose, we studied anxiety-like behavior, corticosterone metabolites in feces, and cell survival in the hippocampus. Complex enrichment (CE) increased the concentration of corticosterone metabolites while also decreasing anxiety-like behavior. Interestingly, both simple and CEs were able to promote cell survival in the hippocampus, and this measure was positively correlated to corticosterone metabolites. Furthermore, in a second experiment, one of the elements of the CE was able to reduce anxiety-like behavior and blood glucose reactivity after exposure to a stressful situation. Altogether, this study calls attention about how sensitive experimental outcomes are to these simple EE elements. Even though EE is recommended by most guidelines for the care and use of laboratory animals, a detailed analysis of the EE protocol that is going to be implemented is highly encouraged.

AB  - The paper highlights the evolution of meat consumption in Romania between 2007 and 2022 based on statistical data retrieved from the National Institute of Statistics and also presents a recent 2024 diagnosis on Romanian meat consumption from field data acquired through a questionnaire survey to which 1002 people gave valid answers. For the average annual meat consumption in Romania it was found that it varies depending on the category: for beef it was a decreasing trend, for pork the trend was slightly increasing, and the consumption of mutton and goat meat had an insignificant variation. The central place in terms of meat consumption was occupied by poultry (34.78%), which had the most obvious increase. The questionnaire reflected that meat consumption is influenced by multiple factors including: age, income level, level of education, origin of meat etc. In the context of climate and geopolitical change, there is an increasing emphasis on finding alternatives for meat. The largest share of respondents to the questionnaire said that they will continue to consume meat, the rest preferring substitutes obtained from vegetables. Our results and the analysis, correlations and approaches done within this paper could serve as a basis for meat consumption patterns in Romania and may ground future marketing policies and sustainable development strategies in the food industry.

AB  - Adipose tissue metabolism plays a crucial role in sheep meat quality and the optimization of adipose tissue utilization. To reveal the molecular mechanisms of adipose tissue metabolism during growth in naturally grazing sheep, we investigated the mRNA and miRNA profiles in subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT) from naturally grazing Sunit sheep at 6, 18, and 30 months of age (Mth-6, Mth-18, and Mth-30). We identified 927 differentially expressed (DE) genes and 134 DE miRNAs in the SAT of sheep at different growth stages. Specifically, the expressions of ACACA, FASN, DGAT2, GPAM, SCD, ELOVL6, HSD17B12, TECR, PKM, TKT, PCK1, CD44, and THBS2S genes were significantly upregulated in Mth-18 and Mth-30 compared to that in Mth-6. These genes promoted fatty acid synthesis, triglyceride synthesis, gluconeogenesis, and extracellular matrix-receptor interaction and decreased glycolysis, leading to increased adipocyte proliferation and fat deposition. Notably, our findings suggested that the reduced activity of the AMPK signaling pathway may be regulated by CAMKK2 and PP2A during sheep growth. Furthermore, our results revealed several DE miRNAs, mml-miR-320b, chi-miR-1388-3p, bta-miR-6715, oar-miR-143, and miR-424, that potentially influence fat metabolism. Overall, this study provides a theoretical basis and new insights into the molecular mechanisms of adipose tissue metabolism during growth in naturally grazing sheep.

AB  - Theories on procrastination have proposed that the trade-off between the episodic future thinking (EFT) of positive outcome and negative engagement determines whether to pro-crastinate. Yet, the neural substrates underlying EFT affects procrastination remain poorly understood. Thus, we adopt a free construction method to obtain individuals' EFT thoughts toward procrastination tasks, and coded these thoughts based on the 2 (emotional valence: positive vs negative) x 2 (imaginary direction: outcome vs engagement) model of EFT (2 x 2 model). Next, a regression analysis was utilized to test the relationship between each dimension in the 2 x 2 model and execution willingness. To explore the neuroanatomical structures underlying EFT, the voxel-based morphometry (VBM) analysis was conducted to find out brain regions responsible for EFT. In addition, the resting-state functional con-nectivity (RSFC) analysis was also utilized to examine the neural pathways underlying EFT affects procrastination. Behavioral results showed combine the anticipated positive outcome with anticipated negative engagement can best predict execution willingness. The VBM analysis revealed that the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) was posi-tively correlated with anticipated positive outcome, while the right hippocampus was positively correlated with anticipated negative engagement. The RSFC results indicated that DLPFC functional connectivity with the right inferior frontal gyrus (RIFG) and left precuneus were positively associated with anticipated positive outcome, whereas the hippocampus connectivity with the left insula was positively associated with anticipated negative engagement. Structural equation model results suggest that EFT affects pro-crastination through the cognitive control pathway (DLPFC-IFG, DLPFC-precuneus) and emotional processing pathway (hippocampus-insula). Collectively, these findings suggest that task procrastination can be predicted by the interaction of the top-down cognitive control pathway and bottom-up emotional processing pathway.

AB  - Developing an automatic identification system for plant diseases caused by pathogens is of utmost significance regarding establishing an effective agricultural production. This study aims to tackle disease identification by uncovering the differences in morphological characteristics existing in the patterns of image texture features and multi-feature textures (LBP, TEM, HOG, GLCM and GABOR) of the cassava plants. To this end, a wide image database of the cassava plant has been classified by the proposed distributed structure-based classification system that is based on revealing hidden patterns existing in the image texture features. The results show that the proposed approach can uncover disease symptoms by examining the morphological distinctness of the employed image features. The diseases were classified by a distributed structured k-NN classifier that was employed in the binary approach. The system reached satisfactory accuracy rates for all classes considering the dataset contains images captured in natural conditions that have complex backgrounds. Moreover, the study can be implemented by utilizing additional image texture to obtain a more suitable pattern that has a higher capability of representing the symptoms of a wider class of diseases more efficiently.

AB  - The human endometrial decidualization is a transformative event in the pregnant uterus that involves the differentiation of stromal cells into decidual cells. While crucial to the establishment of a successful pregnancy, the metabolic characteristics of decidual cells in vivo remain largely unexplored. Here, we integrated the single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) datasets on the endometrium of the menstrual cycle and the maternal-fetal interface in the first trimester to comprehensively decrypt the metabolic characteristics of stromal fibroblast cells. Our results revealed that the differentiation of stromal cells into decidual cells is accompanied by increased amino acid and sphingolipid metabolism. Furthermore, metabolic heterogeneity exists in decidual cells with differentiation maturity disparities. Decidual cells with high metabolism exhibit higher cellular activity and show a strong propensity for signaling. In addition, significant metabolic reprogramming in amino acids and lipids also occurs during the transition from non-pregnancy to pregnancy in the uteri of pigs, cattle, and mice. Our analysis provides comprehensive insights into the dynamic landscape of stromal fibroblast cell metabolism, contributing to our understanding of the metabolism at the molecular dynamics underlying the decidualization process in the human endometrium.

Comparison of reproduction in two different migratory flows has shown a lower fecundity in the Puropyasina branch of the reindeer population, with 47 calves per 100 adult females recorded. These rates were 64 calves per 100 adult females in the second, Tareya-Pyasina local branch. In both migratory flows studied (n = 546) with various levels of barrenness, animals of all reproductive ages, ranging from two to 16 years, were involved in breeding in different age groups. However, the maximum contribution to reproduction belongs to seven-year-old females, the most numerous and fecund generation in both flows.

AB  - Prosystemin is a 200-amino acid precursor expressed in Solanaceae plants which releases at the C-terminal part a peptidic hormone called Systemin in response to wounding and herbivore attack. We recently showed that Prosystemin is not only a mere scaffold of Systemin but, even when deprived of Systemin, is biologically active. These results, combined with recent discoveries that Prosystemin is an intrinsically disordered protein containing disordered regions within its sequence, prompted us to investigate the N-terminal portions of the precursor, which contribute to the greatest disorder within the sequence. To this aim, PS1-70 and PS1-120 were designed, produced, and structurally and functionally characterized. Both the fragments, which maintained their intrinsic disorder, were able to induce defense-related genes and to protect tomato plants against Botrytis cinerea and Spodoptera littoralis larvae. Intriguingly, the biological activity of each of the two N-terminal fragments and of Systemin is similar but not quite the same and does not show any toxicity on experimental non-targets considered. These regions account for different anti-stress activities conferred to tomato plants by their overexpression. The two N-terminal fragments identified in this study may represent new promising tools for sustainable crop protection.

AB  - Plant nutrition status is closely associated with plant defense against insect herbivores. However, the way nitrogen supply regulates rice anti-herbivore is not clear. This study investigated the effects of low (LN, 0.3 mM) and high (HN, 3 mM) nitrate levels on rice resistance against the striped stem borer Chilo suppressalis (SSB), one of the major destructive rice pests. Seven-day-old rice seedlings were cultured with different nitrate levels for 30 days and then inoculated with third instars of SSB. LN significantly enhanced rice anti-herbivore defense and lowered the total nitrogen content in the plants, but increased the content of free amino acids after SSB infestation. Additionally, LN significantly increased the accumulation of phenolic acids and flavonoids, especially lignin, resulting in enhanced constitutive defense in SSB-infested plants. SSB feeding led to a rapid accumulation of secondary metabolites. HN application led to the accumulation of metabolites derived from cinnamic acid, p-coumaric acid, p-coumaric CoA, feruloyl CoA, and apigenin, while LN led to the accumulation of metabolites derived from 3-dehydroquinic acid, phenylalanine, acetyl CoA, and aspartic acid. Collectively, our finding suggests that nitrogen deficiency enhances rice anti-herbivore defense via constitutive defense by the accumulation of phenolic acids and flavonoids.

AB  - Exercise is accepted as a positive health behaviour; however, the mechanisms of exercise on neuroprotection and cognitive health are not completely understood. The purpose of this study was to explore the neurobiological benefits of chronic treadmill exercise in female and male mice through its role in microglial content and morphology, cerebral vascularization, and perineuronal net (PNN) expression. We further examined how these neurobiological changes relate to spatial memory outcomes. Adult mice were assigned to a sedentary or treadmill exercise group for eight weeks. During the final week, all mice were trained on a spatial memory task (Barnes maze) and brains were collected for immunohistochemistry. Exercised mice made fewer errors than sedentary mice during the first two days of training and probe trial. Females, regardless of exercise training, made fewer errors during Barnes maze training and demonstrated a greater frequency of spatial strategy use compared to males. Exercised mice, regardless of sex, had fewer PNNs in the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus compared to sedentary controls. The number of PNNs in the dorsal dentate gyrus was positively correlated with total errors during training. During the probe, greater errors correlated with more PNNs among the exercised group only. Microglia count and cerebral vascularization were not affected by exercise, although proportions of microglia type (ameboid, stout/thick, and thick/thin) were regulated by exercise in the ventral dentate gyrus. We conclude that exercise decreases PNNs in the dentate gyrus in both sexes and this may be related to better spatial learning and memory.

AB  - Painted lady butterflies (Vanessa cardui L., Nymphalidae) are generalist herbivores and serve as a model system across several fields of biology. While it has been demonstrated that V. cardui caterpillars can develop on different host plants, much of this work has been done on commercially sourced caterpillars, which could limit our understanding of wild V. cardui populations. In this study, we sought to explore possible differences in how commercial and wild V. cardui caterpillars may respond to feeding on different host plants, and subsequently, how their diet impacts immune response and survival. Here, we analyzed performance, survival, and immune response of wild and commercially sourced V. cardui caterpillars over several generations on diets that consisted of either 1 of 4 different host plant species or a mixed diet including all 4 species. Qualitatively, we observed that wild larvae had a better larval performance and hemocyte counts compared to the commercial larvae. The results demonstrate that both wild and commercially sourced caterpillars grew and survived best on the same diet treatments (mallow, narrowleaf plantain, and a mixed diet) during development across generations. Immune responses showed similar patterns across host plants between wild and commercial populations, with individuals showing lowered immune responses on dandelion and lupine and higher ones on mallow, plantain and the mixed diet; although the relative rankings on those 3 diets varied. Survival also demonstrated similar patterns, in that individuals reared on dandelion and lupine had the lowest survival.

AB  - Male and female mice pups were exposed to a low and high dose of a human relevant mixture of persistent organic pollutants (POPs) during pregnancy and lactation. Most compounds detected in the dams were found in offspring brains. The mice offspring exhibited changed expression of hippocampal genes involved in cognitive function (Adora2a, Auts2, Crlf1, Chrnb2, Gdnf, Gnal, Kcnh3), neuro-inflammation (Cd47, Il1a), circadian rhythm (Per1, Clock), redox signalling (Hmox2) and aryl hydrocarbon receptor activation (Cyp1b1). A few genes were differentially expressed in males versus females. Mostly, similar patterns of gene expression changes were observed between the low and high dose groups. Effects on learning and memory function measured in the Barnes maze (not moving, escape latency) were found in the high dose group when combined with moderate stress exposure (air flow from a fan). Mediation analysis indicated adaptation to the effects of exposure since gene expression compensated for learning disabilities (escape latency, walking distance and time spent not moving in the maze). Additionally, random forest analysis indicated that Kcnh3, Gnal, and Crlf1 were the most important genes for escape latency, while Hip1, Gnal and the low exposure level were the most important explanatory factors for passive behaviour (not moving). Altogether, this study showed transfer of POPs to the offspring brains after maternal exposure, modulating the expression level of genes involved in brain function. (C) 2021 The Author(s).

AB  - Understanding human sleep requires appropriate animal models. Sleep has been extensively studied in rodents, although rodent sleep differs substantially from human sleep. Here we investigate sleep in tree shrews, small diurnal mammals phylogenetically close to primates, and compare it to sleep in rats and humans using electrophysiological recordings from frontal cortex of each species. Tree shrews exhibited consolidated sleep, with a sleep bout duration parameter, tau, uncharacteristically high for a small mammal, and differing substantially from the sleep of rodents that is often punctuated by wakefulness. Two NREM sleep stages were observed in tree shrews: NREM, characterized by high delta waves and spindles, and an intermediate stage (IS-NREM) occurring on NREM to REM transitions and consisting of intermediate delta waves with concomitant theta-alpha activity. While IS-NREM activity was reliable in tree shrews, we could also detect it in human EEG data, on a subset of transitions. Finally, coupling events between sleep spindles and slow waves clustered near the beginning of the sleep period in tree shrews, paralleling humans, whereas they were more evenly distributed in rats. Our results suggest considerable homology of sleep structure between humans and tree shrews despite the large difference in body mass between these species. Dimanico et al investigated sleep in tree shrews using electrophysiological recordings and compared it to equivalent read-outs in rats and humans. They reported that there was considerable homology of sleep structure between humans and tree shrews despite the difference in body mass between these species.

AB  - Manure nutrients are beneficial when land applied but contribute to environmental degradation when lost as runoff or emissions. Applying manure nutrients to better meet agronomic crop needs has potential to reduce losses. However, transporting manure nutrients to nutrient deficient fields is commonly cost prohibitive. Densifying manure nutrients has the potential to reduce costs. Manure processing of separated manure solids via drying at 50 degrees C for 48 h reduced the mass by 62.8 %, where reduction by pyrolysis reduced the mass by 81.8 % and 83.4 % at 350 and 500 degrees C, respectively. Drying and pyrolysis retained and densified the manure phosphorus. Drying retained the nitrogen within the solids, but 37 to 47 % of nitrogen was lost through pyrolysis. Immediately after processing, available phosphorus decreased with increasing pyrolysis temperature. Incubation of manure solids and processed manures shows that processing decreased available phosphorus through the first 28 days, but following that initial period reached similar phosphorus availability.

AB  - In the present work, we employ a CALPHAD-integrated physics-based quantitative multi-phase field model to study the microstructure evolution in a multi-phase Ti-alloy. In this model we use the free energies obtained from TTTI3 thermodynamic database for Ti-based alloys using a CALPHAD approach. For numerical implementation of the model, we solve the governing equations in their weak form using the open-source MOOSE finite element framework. Our model is successfully able to capture all the possible orientational variants in Ti- alloy system. Moreover, we elucidate the complex interaction between the variants using two- and multi-particle simulations. We show that the elastic energies associated with the variants play significant role in their growth behavior. We also explore the effect of anisotropy in interfacial energy on the variant evolution.

AB  - Insects are attacked by a diverse range of microbial pathogens in the wild. In herbivorous species, larval host plants frequently play a critical role in mediating susceptibility to infection. Characterizing such plant-mediated effects on herbivore-pathogen interactions can provide insight into patterns of infection across wild populations. In this study, we investigated the effects of host plant use by two North American butterflies, Euphydryas phaeton (Nymphalidae) and Anartia jatrophae (Nymphalidae), on entomopathogen infection across a range of three doses. Both of these herbivores recently incorporated the same exotic plant, Plantago lanceolata (Plantaginaceae), into their host range and are naturally infected by the same entomopathogen, Junonia coenia densovirus (Parvoviridae), in wild populations. We performed two factorial experiments in which E. phaeton and A. jatrophae were reared on either P. lanceolata or a native host plant [Chelone glabra (Plantaginaceae) for E. phaeton; Bacopa monnieri (Plantaginaceae) for A. jatrophae] and inoculated with either a low, medium, or high dose of the virus. In E. phaeton, the outcomes of infection were highly dose-dependent, with inoculation with higher viral doses resulting in faster time to death and greater mortality. However, neither survival nor postmortem viral burdens varied depending upon the host plant that was consumed. In contrast, host plant use had a strong effect on viral burdens in A. jatrophae, with consumption of the exotic plant appearing to enhance host resistance to infection. Together, these results illustrate the variable influences of host plant use on herbivore resistance to infection, highlighting the importance of investigating plant-herbivore relationships within a tritrophic framework.

AB  - The current study aims to evaluate the health risk of heavy metals for humans and animals in the Angouran mining complex (northwest of Iran). Twenty-five plant species and their corresponding soils (natural soils) were collected along with mine tailings samples. The carcinogenic and non-carcinogenic risks of heavy metals (Zn, Pb, Cd, Cr, and Co) for humans using the hazard quotient (HQ) and hazard index (HI) were evaluated. Moreover, the health risk caused by forage feeding to grazing ruminants (cow and sheep) and the risk associated with animal products consumption by humans in the soil-plant-animal transfer system were assessed. The value of HI in natural soils (rangeland use) was less than one (HI < 1), while regarding tailings, the HQ via oral ingestion and the HI were greater than one (HI & HQ > 1). The range of total carcinogenesis risk in natural soils exceeded the target risk (Risk < 10(-6)) and for tailings, it showed the probability of cancer risk, 1 person per 3636 populations, which is much higher than the acceptable or tolerable range (10(-4) < Risk < 10(-6)). Regarding the animal health risk, the content of Pb and Cd in most of the animal organs was higher than the control values. In turn, dietary exposure to Pb and Cd is worrying for residents due to exceeding the provisional tolerable weekly intake (PTWI). This comprehensive study suggests the necessity of risk assessment of mining sites in Iran and immediate control measures to diminish pollutants.

AB  - Loop diuretics such as furosemide and bumetanide, which act by inhibiting the Na-K-2Cl cotransporter NKCC2 at the thick ascending limb of the loop of Henle, have been shown to exert anti-seizure effects. However, the exact mechanism of this effect is not known. For bumetanide, it has been suggested that inhibition of the NKCC isoform NKCC1 in the membrane of brain neurons may be involved; however, NKCC1 is expressed by virtually all cell types in the brain, which makes any specific targeting of neuronal NKCC1 by bumetanide impossible. In addition, bumetanide only poorly penetrates the brain. We have previously shown that loop diuretics azosemide and torasemide also potently inhibit NKCC1. In contrast to bumetanide and furosemide, azosemide and torasemide lack a carboxylic group, which should allow them to better penetrate through biomembranes by passive diffusion. Because of the urgent medical need to develop new treatments for neonatal seizures and their adverse outcome, we evaluated the effects of azosemide and torasemide, administered alone or in combination with phenobarbital or midazolam, in a rat model of birth asphyxia and neonatal seizures. Neither diuretic suppressed the seizures when admin-istered alone but torasemide potentiated the anti-seizure effect of midazolam. Brain levels of torasemide were below those needed to inhibit NKCC1. In addition to suppressing seizures, the combination of tor-asemide and midazolam, but not midazolam alone, prevented the cognitive impairment of the post-asphyxial rats at 3 months after asphyxia. Furthermore, aberrant mossy fiber sprouting in the hippocam-pus was more effectively prevented by the combination. We assume that either an effect on NKCC1 at the blood-brain barrier and/or cells in the periphery or the NKCC2-mediated diuretic effect of torasemide are involved in the present findings. Our data suggest that torasemide may be a useful option for improving the treatment of neonatal seizures and their adverse outcome.(c) 2022 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Background A major goal of evolutionary developmental biology is to discover general models and mechanisms that create the phenotypes of organisms. However, universal models of such fundamental growth and form are rare, presumably due to the limited number of physical laws and biological processes that influence growth. One such model is the logarithmic spiral, which has been purported to explain the growth of biological structures such as teeth, claws, horns, and beaks. However, the logarithmic spiral only describes the path of the structure through space, and cannot generate these shapes. Results Here we show a new universal model based on a power law between the radius of the structure and its length, which generates a shape called a 'power cone'. We describe the underlying 'power cascade' model that explains the extreme diversity of tooth shapes in vertebrates, including humans, mammoths, sabre-toothed cats, tyrannosaurs and giant megalodon sharks. This model can be used to predict the age of mammals with ever-growing teeth, including elephants and rodents. We view this as the third general model of tooth development, along with the patterning cascade model for cusp number and spacing, and the inhibitory cascade model that predicts relative tooth size. Beyond the dentition, this new model also describes the growth of claws, horns, antlers and beaks of vertebrates, as well as the fangs and shells of invertebrates, and thorns and prickles of plants. Conclusions The power cone is generated when the radial power growth rate is unequal to the length power growth rate. The power cascade model operates independently of the logarithmic spiral and is present throughout diverse biological systems. The power cascade provides a mechanistic basis for the generation of these pointed structures across the tree of life.

AB  - Premature neonates are submitted to an early-life oxidative stress from parenteral nutrition, which is vitamin C (VC) deficient and induces low endogenous levels of glutathione. The oxidative stress caused by these deficiencies may permanently affect liver glycolysis and lipogenesis. This study evaluates the short- and long-term effects of neonatal VC and cysteine deficient diets on redox and energy metabolism. Three-day-old Hartley guinea pigs from both sexes were given a regular or a deficient diet (VC, cysteine, or both) until week 1 of life. Half of the animals were sacrificed at this age, while the other half ate a complete diet until 12 weeks. Liver glutathione and the activity and protein levels of glucokinase, phosphofructokinase, and acetyl-CoA-carboxylase were measured. Statistics: factorial ANOVA (5% threshold). At 1 week, all deficient diets decreased glutathione and the protein levels of glucokinase and phosphofructokinase, while cysteine deficiency decreased acetyl-CoA-carboxylase levels. A similar enzyme level was observed in control animals at 12 weeks. At this age, VC deficiency decreased glutathione, while cysteine increased it. Acetyl-CoA-carboxylase protein levels were increased, which decreased its specific activity. Early-life VC and cysteine deficiencies induce neonatal oxidative stress and an adult-like metabolism, while predisposing to increased lipogenic rates during adulthood.

AB  - In this study, 17 microsatellite markers were used to analyze the genetic polymorphism, genetic differentiation, gene flow and genetic distance of Alashan desert Bactrian camel, Alashan Gobi Bactrian camel, Sunite Bactrian camel and Qinghai Bactrian camel.The results indicated that the number of effective alleles of the four Bactrian camel varieties ranged from 2.7302 to 3.0524, and average theoretical heterozygosity and average polymorphic information content were 0.6283 and 0.5546, respectively. Observational heterozygosity, expected heterozygosity and polymorphic information content of Qinghai Bactrian camel were all higher than those of the other three varieties, being 0.8922, 0.6490 and 0.5813, respectively, so Qinghai Bactrian camel was of rich genetic polymorphism. Average gene flow of the microsatellite markers was 12.3188 and average Fst value was 0.0199, namely 1.99% of genetic variation derived between subpopulations and 98.01% came inside the subpopulations, revealing that the genetic differentiation degree between Bactrian camel subpopulations was low. The genetic relationship between Sunite Bactrian camel and Alashan Gobi Bactrian camel was close, so it was classified into the first type and that between Sunite Bactrian camel and Alashan desert Bactrian camel as the second type, but the genetic relationship of Qinghai Bactrian camel and other three Bactrian camel varieties was distant.

AB  - BACKGROUNDPhaseolus lunatus, commonly known as the lima bean, is a leguminous crop cultivated in various regions worldwide. It is native to tropical America and is extensively grown in both tropical and temperate climates. Lima beans are highly nutritious and versatile, serving not only as a food and vegetable, but also as a source of green manure. During cultivation, lima beans can be vulnerable to numerous pests, including the spider mite, Tetranychus urticae. In large-scale outbreaks, T. urticae can cause significant yield losses or even crop failure, posing a serious threat to agricultural production. The treatment of lima bean plants with T. urticae or alamethicin (ALA) has been shown to enhance their insect-resistant defense responses. Understanding the transcriptional and metabolic mechanisms underlying these defense responses to T. urticae and ALA is crucial for improving herbivore resistance in lima bean crops.RESULTBy integrated analysis of transcriptomics and metabolomics data, we found that both T. urticae and ALA treatments significantly induced the flavonoid biosynthesis pathway. Both treatments increased the flavonoid content in lima bean leaves by upregulating the expression of key genes in this pathway, potentially contributing to enhanced resistance to phytophagous insects. Notably, quercetin has been shown to reduce the number of eggs per female and survival rate of T. urticae.CONCLUSIONThese findings provide a novel theoretical basis for understanding the response mechanisms of lima beans to T. urticae and ALA, while highlighting potential metabolites and genes that could be targeted to improve plant resistance to spider mite damage.

AB  - Gelatin is a natural polymer that can be derived from collagen through hydrolysis. It most extensively used in diverse fields, mainly in pharmaceuticals and therapeutic. Herein Gelatin was newly extracted from camel (Camelus dromedarius) skin and irradiated with gamma rays from 60Co source. Gelatin was optimized and characterization and functional properties were determined. The structural changes occurring after gamma-irradiation at doses from 5 to 30 kGy were reported by physico-chemical techniques such as electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and X-ray diffraction (XRD) for the first time. Results revealed that gelatin yield increased significantly (P<0.05) as the extraction temperature and time increased (19.71%) at 70 degrees C for 12 h. EPR spectroscopy demonstrated that 10 kGy of radiation-induced the decomposition of side groups. New peak positions (Paramagnetic centers) were located at around 3800 G. Moreover, an enhancement of EPR peak (3300 and 3400 G) (g-factor = 2.0) was detected. In addition, free radicals trapped in the crystalline regions were moved toward the boundary regions and the amorphous phases disappeared. XRD patterns showed a new peak at 2 theta= 65.8 degrees and a diminution of the relative intensity for the peak of 2 theta= 20.54 degrees after 30 kGy. FTIR measurements revealed structural deformations from 5 kGy through chain scission of C-H chains as well as the deformation of the C=O carboxyl groups with increasing gamma-radiation doses. The camel skin was thus proved to be a source of gelatin. Irradiation induced a structural deformation with desirable functionalities that make it a potent source of gelatin that could be used in food and biomedical applications.

AB  - ObjectiveTransient receptor potential ankyrin 1 (TRPA1) is an excitatory ion channel expressed on a subset of sensory neurons. TRPA1 is activated by a host of noxious stimuli including pollutants, irritants, oxidative stress and inflammation, and is thought to play an important role in nociception and pain perception. TRPA1 is therefore a therapeutic target for diseases with nociceptive sensory signaling components. TRPA1 orthologs have been shown to have differential sensitivity to certain ligands. Cinnamaldehyde has previously been shown to activate sensory neurons via the selective gating of TRPA1. Here, we tested the sensitivity of cinnamaldehyde-evoked responses in mouse and guinea pig sensory neurons to the pore blocker ruthenium red (RuR).ResultsCinnamaldehyde, the canonical TRPA1-selective agonist, caused robust calcium fluxes in trigeminal neurons dissociated from both mice and guinea pigs. RuR effectively inhibited cinnamaldehyde-evoked responses in mouse neurons at 30 nM, with complete block seen with 3 mu M. In contrast, responses in guinea pig neurons were only partially inhibited by 3 mu M RuR. We conclude that RuR has a decreased affinity for guinea pig TRPA1 compared to mouse TRPA1. This study provides further evidence of differences in ligand affinity for TRPA1 in animal models relevant for drug development.

AB  - Extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing Escherichia coli (ESBL-E. coli) have been reported in wildlife worldwide. Whether wildlife is a transient host of ESBL-E. coli or comprises an independently maintained reservoir is unknown. We investigated this question by longitudinally monitoring ESBL-E. coli in common vampire bats and nearby livestock in Peru. Among 388 bats from five vampire bat colonies collected over three years, ESBL-E. coli were detected at a low prevalence (10% in 2015, 4% in 2017 and 2018) compared to a high prevalence (48%) from 134 livestock sampled in 2017. All ESBL-E. coli were multidrug-resistant, and whole genome sequencing of 33 randomly selected ESBL-E. coli isolates (18 recovered from bats) detected 46 genes conferring resistance to antibiotics including third-generation cephalosporins (e.g., bla(CTX-M-55), bla(CTX-M-15), bla(CTX-M-65), bla(CTX-M-3), bla(CTX-M-14)), aminoglycosides, fluoroquinolones, and colistin (mcr-1). The mcr-1 gene is reported for the first time on a wild bat in Latin America. ESBL-E. coli also carried 31 plasmid replicon types and 16 virulence genes. Twenty-three E. coli sequence types (STs) were detected, including STs involved in clinical infections worldwide (e.g., ST 167, ST 117, ST 10, ST 156 and ST 648). ESBL-E. coli with identical cgMLST (ST 167) were detected in the same bat roost in 2015 and 2017, and several ESBL-E. coli from different bat roosts clustered together in the cgMLST reconstruction, suggesting long-term maintenance of ESBL-E. coli within bats. Most antibiotic resistance and virulence genes were detected in E. coli from both host populations, while ESBL-E. coli ST 744 was found in a bat and a pig from the same locality, suggesting possible cross-species exchanges of genetic material and/or bacteria between bats and livestock. This study suggests that wild mammals can maintain multidrug-resistant bacteria and share them with livestock.

AB  - Atoh1 overexpression is essential for hair cell (HC) regeneration in the sensory epithelium of mammalian auditory and vestibular organs. However, Atoh1 overexpression alone cannot induce fully mature and functional HCs in the mammalian inner ear. In the current study, we investigated the effect of Atoh1 constitutive overexpression in native HCs by manipulating Atoh1 expression at different developmental stages. We demonstrated that constitutive overexpression of Atoh1 in native vestibular HCs did not affect cell survival but did impair vestibular function by interfering with the subtype differentiation of HCs and hair bundle development. In contrast, Atoh1 overexpression in cochlear HCs impeded their maturation, eventually leading to gradual HC loss in the cochlea and hearing dysfunction. Our study suggests that time-restricted Atoh1 expression is essential for the differentiation and survival of HCs in the inner ear, and this is pivotal for both hearing and vestibular function re-establishment through Atoh1 overexpression-induced HC regeneration strategies.

AB  - Plants perceive signals associated with herbivore eggs and in response initiate ovicidal defence. However, which phytohormone pathways regulate this defence and which defensive compounds dominate it remains largely unknown. Here, we found that the hatching rate of eggs of white-backed planthopper (WBPH) Sogatella furcifera was significantly lower on a japonica rice variety P81 than an indica rice variety NB44. When infested by WBPH, P81 plants showed higher jasmonic acid (JA) and abscisic acid (ABA) responses than did NB44 plants; moreover, P81 plants produced the ovicidal compound benzyl benzoate and exhibited higher levels of some flavonoids, phenolamides, and volatiles than were found in NB44 plants. Impairing the ABA-signalling pathway, especially the JA-signalling pathway in P81 plants enhanced the survival of WBPH eggs. Decreasing levels of some flavonoids and phenolamides in P81 plants promoted WBPH egg survival. In vitro bioassays revealed that both naringenin and sakuranetin promote the ovicidal effect of benzyl benzoate on WBPH. The results demonstrate that JA- and ABA-signalling pathways jointly regulate the rice ovicidal defence against WBPH, and that benzyl benzoate, as well as some other compounds, such as naringenin and sakuranetin, contribute to the mortality of WBPH eggs.

KW  - IDENTIFICATION
AB  - Green tea made from albino buds and leaves has a strong umami taste and aroma. The cultivar 'Zhonghuang 2' (ZH2, Camellia sinensis) is a natural mutant with young shoots that are yellow in spring and green or yellow-green in summer. However, the mechanism of leaf color change remains unclear. Here, we found that young shoots of ZH2 were yellow at low temperature (LT) and green at high temperature (HT), indicating that ZH2 is a temperature-sensitive cultivar. Transmission electron microscopy analysis showed that the grana in the chloroplasts of young shoots grown at LT were poorly stacked, which caused a lack of photoreactions and chlorophyll. RNA-seq results showed 1279 genes differentially expressed in the young shoots grown at LT compared with those at HT, including genes related to cytochrome synthesis, chloroplast development, photosynthesis, and DNA methylation. A whole-genome bisulfite sequencing assay revealed that the dynamics of DNA methylation levels in the CG, CHG, and CHH contexts decreased under LT, and the change was most obvious in the CHH context. Furthermore, 72 genes showed significant changes in both expression and DNA methylation levels, and most of them were related to cytochrome synthesis, chloroplast development, photosynthesis, transcription factors, and signaling pathways. These results demonstrate that DNA methylation is involved in the LT-regulated albino processes of ZH2. Changes in DNA methylation levels were associated with changes in gene expression levels, affecting the structure and function of chloroplasts, which may have a phenotypic impact on shoot and leaf color.

AB  - Bamboo has shown promising potential as a sustainable and nutrient-rich fodder source for livestock, particularly in Ghana's transitional forest zones where traditional forage options are limited. This study evaluated the nutritional composition, in vitro rumen fermentation, and digestibility of the leaves of Oxytenanthera abyssinica (OA) and Bambusa vulgaris (BV) and incorporated them into a basal mix (Bmix) of Cenchrus purpureus and Bridelia ferruginea for goats. Additionally, a survey was conducted to assess adoption drivers of bamboo as a livestock fodder in the study area. The results show that both bamboo species had similar (p > 0.05) dry matter (91.7-92 %), crude protein (12.5-14.5 %), and crude fibre (26.3-28.9 %). OA had higher (p < 0.05) ash (12.4 %), Ca (0.48 %), Mg (0.15 %), flavonoids (0.885 mg/l) and oxalates (0.015 %), while BV had more P (0.18 %), K (2.31 %), Fe (65.6 mg/kg), Cu (20.49 mg/kg), Mn (12.9 mg/kg), acid detergent lignin (1.8 %-4.3 %), tannins (0.003 %), saponins (0.28 %) and total antioxidants (96.8 %). In vitro rumen fermentation showed OA+Bmix had the highest gas production (155.1 mL/200 mg DM) and VFAs (89.6 mmol/100 g), followed by BV+Bmix (gas: 146.8 mL/200 mg DM, VFAs: 84.3 mmol/100 g) and control (gas: 145.2 mL/200 mg DM, VFAs: 75.3 mmol/100 g). The OA+Bmix also had the lowest methane (14.1 mL/200 mg DM) and CO2 (69.0 mL/200 mg DM) compared to BV+Bmix (methane: 16.5 mL/200 mg DM, CO2: 72.3 mL/200 mg DM) and the control (methane: 24.3 mL/200 mg DM, CO2: 84.2 mL/200 mg DM). Similarly, OA+Bmix showed the highest nitrogen intake (9.22 g/day), digestibility (8.5 g/day) and retention (88.1 %), along with the highest digestibility for dry matter (58.7 %), crude protein (72.2 %), crude fibre (67.8 %) and ether extract (74.4 %), compared to BV+Bmix (intake: 6.96 g/day, digestibility: 6.47 g/day, retention: 83.2 %, dry matter: 48.3 %, crude protein: 56.8 %, crude fibre: 60.2 %, ether extract: 68.7 %) and the control (intake: 5.54 g/day, digestibility: 4.92 g/day, retention: 59.1 %, dry matter: 33.6 %, crude protein: 41.1 %, crude fibre: 31.6 %, ether extract: 47.2 %). In conclusion, bamboo leaves are nutrient-rich supplements that can improve rumen fermentation, nutrient digestibility and animal health. Their adoption is promising, driven by economic feasibility, accessibility and sustainability. Therefore, prioritising educational and financial support for their adoption is recommended.

AB  - Cold is a common problem that limits the distribution of Camellia. Camellia japonica (Naidong) is the northernmost species of camellia in China, which is a Tertiary remnant species that can adapt to large changes in temperature. An analysis of the transcriptional response of C. japonica (Naidong) to cold is very important for the planting and distribution of camellia. In this study, the rate of H2O2 levels, electrolyte leakage, chlorophyll and sugar content had a higher degree of cold response during 12-72 h period, than other periods (0-12h, 72h-120h) in C. japonica (Naidong) response to cold treatment. We constructed the first full-length C. japonica (Naidong) transcriptome and identified 4544 significantly differentially expressed genes (DEGs). A weighted gene coexpression network analysis showed that carbon metabolism, lipid metabolism, and transcription factors played important roles in the resistance of C. japonica (Naidong) to cold stress, and three hub transcription factor regulatory networks were constructed. In addition, overexpressing CjRAV1 led to cold sensitivity in Arabidopsis thaliana, thus CjRAV1 likely plays a negative regulatory role during cold stress in Camellia japonica. This study deepens our understanding of the regulatory mechanism of C. japonica (Naidong) under cold stress and will benefit genetic improvement of camellia.

AB  - Didymella bellidis is a phytopathogenic fungus that causes leaf spot on tea plants (Camellia sinensis), which negatively affects the productivity and quality of tea leaves in Guizhou Province, China. D. bellidis isolate GZYQYQX2B was sequenced using Pacific Biosciences and Illumina technologies, and assembled into a whole genome of 35.5 Mbp. Transcripts of D. bellidis isolate GZYQYQX2B were predicted from the assembled genome and were further validated by RNA sequence data. In total, 10,731 genes were predicted by integrating three approaches, namely ab initio and homology-based gene prediction, as well as transcriptomics data. The whole-genome sequence of D. bellidis will provide a resource for future research on trait-specific genes of the pathogen and host-pathogen interactions.

AB  - The role of histamine H3 receptors (H3Rs) in memory and the prospective of H3R antagonists in pharmacological control of neurodegenerative disorders, e.g., Alzheimer's disease (AD), is well-accepted. Therefore, the procognitive effects of acute systemic administration of H3R antagonist E169 (2.5-10 mg/kg, i.p.) on MK801-induced amnesia in C57BL/6J mice using the novel object recognition test (NORT) were evaluated. E169 (5 mg) provided a significant memory-improving effect on MK801-induced short- and long-term memory impairments in NORT. The E169 (5 mg)provided effects were comparable to those observed with the reference phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) inhibitor LY294002 and were abrogated with the H3R agonist (R)-ff-methylhistamine (RAMH). Additionally, our results demonstrate that E169 ameliorated MK801-induced memory deficits by antagonism of H3Rs and by modulation of the level of disturbance in the expression of PI3K, Akt, and GSK-3fi proteins, signifying that E169 mitigated the Akt-mTOR signaling pathway in the hippocampus of tested mice. Moreover, the results observed revealed that E169 (2.5-10 mg/kg, i.p.) did not alter anxiety levels and locomotor activity of animals in open field tests, demonstrating that performances improved following acute systemic administration with E169 in NORT are unrelated to changes in emotional response or in spontaneous locomotor activity. In summary, these obtained results suggest the potential of H3R antagonists such as E169, with good in silico physicochemical properties and stable retained key interactions in docking studies at H3R, in simultaneously modulating disturbed brain neurotransmitters and the imbalanced Akt-mTOR signaling pathway related to neurodegenerative disorders, e.g., AD.

AB  - The experimental study presented in this paper investigate the post-fire performance of through reinforced concrete (RC) beam to concrete-filled steel tube (CFST) column connection. A total of twelve connection spec-imens were tested under hogging moment. The connection specimens are grouped into two groups; group A -connections, without fire exposure and group F-connections that are exposed to fire. Two classical connection types were used in this study (type A and B) and one new connection type were proposed herein (type C) by associating additional steel plates to the connection zone. In addition, different beam reinforcement ratios were used. These parameters were considered to evaluate the strength, stiffness, joint classification, ductility, failure modes and strain response of the composite joints. Three failure modes of the connections were found. The connection specimens without fire exposure were found to be a rigid connection. The fire exposure significantly influenced the connection performance, and that influence is varied based on the connection type and beam reinforcement ratio. The proposed connection type is found to have the highest residual capacity among the other connection types. However, a comprehensive analysis of the post-fire behaviour of each connection type is illustrated.

AB  - The food resources in the field can effectively strengthen the ability of natural enemies to control the pest. Certain compounds, in addition to carbohydrates and amino acids, may improve the physiological performance of insects. Caffeine, for instance, has been shown to enhance pollinator memory and physiological reactions. However, little is known about how caffeine influences parasitoids. The control effectiveness and survival rate of the parasitoid (Snellenius manilae) were tested in this study after the parasitoids were fed solutions with different concentrations of caffeine. We examined caffeine concentrations of 10(-2), 10(-4), and 10(-6) (M) mixed with a 25% sucrose solution and a pure sucrose solution as a control group. The results show that a concentration of 10(-6 )caffeine solution significantly increased the parasitism rate of S. manilae by 10.76% when compared to the control group. Despite the significantly lower survival rate and male bias of S. manilae offspring in the 10-2 treatment, no further negative responses in growth performance, development time, or cocoon weight were observed. These findings suggest that an appropriate concentration of caffeine solution can have a positive impact on the control effectiveness of parasitoids in the laboratory. Our results highlight the potential of secondary compounds to increase the bio-control effectiveness. However, confirming the implications of these findings requires further field experiments.

AB  - Spermatogonial stem cells (SSCs) are the basis of spermatogenesis, a complex process supported by a specialized microenvironment, called the SSC niche. Postnatal development of SSCs is characterized by distinct metabolic transitions from prepubertal to adult stages. An understanding of the niche factors that regulate these maturational events is critical for the clinical application of SSCs in fertility preservation. To investigate the niche maturation events that take place during SSC maturation, we combined different '-omics' technologies. Serial single cell RNA sequencing analysis revealed changes in the transcriptomes indicative of niche maturation that was initiated at 11 years of age in humans and at 8 weeks of age in pigs, as evident by Monocle analysis of Sertoli cells and peritubular myoid cell (PMC) development in humans and Sertoli cell analysis in pigs. Morphological niche maturation was associated with lipid droplet accumulation, a characteristic that was conserved between species. Lipidomic profiling revealed an increase in triglycerides and a decrease in sphingolipids with Sertoli cell maturation in the pig model. Quantitative (phospho-) proteomics analysis detected the activation of distinct pathways with porcine Sertoli cell maturation. We show here that the main aspects of niche maturation coincide with the morphological maturation of SSCs, which is followed by their metabolic maturation. The main aspects are also conserved between the species and can be predicted by changes in the niche lipidome. Overall, this knowledge is pivotal to establishing cell/tissue-based biomarkers that could gauge stem cell maturation to facilitate laboratory techniques that allow for SSC transplantation for restoration of fertility.

AB  - Yeast beta-glucan is a natural antioxidant and has been reported to improve growth performance of piglets, but its application in improving pork quality is limited. This study investigated the effects of dietary yeast beta-glucan supplementation on meat quality, antioxidant capacity and gut microbiota of finishing pigs. In a 40-day experiment, ninety finishing pigs (Duroc x Landrace x Yorkshire, 70.47 +/- 0.04 kg) were randomly allocated into five treatments including a basal diet supplemented with 0, 50, 100, 200 and 400 mg/kg yeast beta-glucan. Results showed that yeast beta-glucan significantly increased pH(45) (min) (linear and quadratic, p < 0.01) and a*(45 min) (linear, p < 0.05), and reduced cooking loss (linear, p < 0.05) and drip loss (quadratic, p < 0.05) of meat in finishing pigs. Importantly, the 200 mg/kg group exhibited the highest values of pH(45 min) (p < 0.01) and the lowest values of drip loss (p < 0.05), accompanied by a decreased lactate content (p < 0.05) and glycolytic potential (p < 0.05). Dietary supplementation of 200 mg/kg yeast beta-glucan markedly increased catalase (CAT) (p < 0.05), superoxide dismutase (SOD) (p < 0.05) and total antioxidant capacity (T-AOC) (p < 0.01) activities in skeletal muscle. Moreover, WPS-2 abundance was decreased significantly in colonic digesta by 200 mg/kg yeast beta-glucan and exhibited a positive association with muscle lactate content and drip loss. Together, dietary 200 mg/kg yeast beta-glucan supplementation effectively improved pH value and the water-holding capacity of fresh meat through reducing muscle postmortem glycolysis, increasing antioxidant capacity and altering the gut microbiota composition of finishing pigs.

AB  - Simple Summary Oxidative stress negatively affects maternal health and fetal development. Catalase (CAT) is an oxidoreductase enzyme that catalyzes the decomposition of hydrogen peroxide into molecular oxygen and water, thereby protecting the cell from oxidative damage. This experiment was conducted to investigate the effects of maternal CAT supplementation on reproductive performance, antioxidant enzyme activities, mineral transport, and the mRNA expression of related genes in sows and offspring. It was observed that giving dietary CAT supplementation to pregnant sows may decrease the intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) rate and contribute to improving the maternal and fetal antioxidant status, potentially by modulating the activities of selected antioxidant enzymes and mRNA expression of related genes, as well as the transport of some mineral elements in the pregnant sows and their piglets. This finding provides a reasonable foundation for focused intervention studies in the future and may also provide insight into important aspects of mother-infant nutrition in both animals and humans. This experiment was conducted to investigate the effects of maternal catalase (CAT) supplementation on reproductive performance, antioxidant enzyme activities, mineral transport, and mRNA expression of related genes in sows and offspring. A total of 40 pregnant sows at 95 days of gestation with similar parity (3-5 parities) and back-fat thickness were assigned randomly and equally into the control (CON) group (fed a basal diet) and CAT group (fed a basal diet supplemented with 660 mg/kg CAT; CAT activity, 280 U/g). The reproductive performance was recorded, and the placenta and blood samples of sows and neonatal piglets, as well as the jejunum and ileum samples from neonatal boars (eight replicates per group), were collected. Results showed that dietary supplementation with CAT significantly decreased the intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) rate and increased the activity of serum CAT in neonatal piglets and umbilical cords (p < 0.05). In addition, CAT supplementation tended to improve total antioxidant capacity (T-AOC) levels in the maternal serum (p = 0.089) and umbilical cords of piglets (p = 0.051). The serum calcium (Ca), manganese (Mn), and zinc (Zn) of farrowing sows and Mn concentration in the umbilical cord, and serum Ca, magnesium (Mg), copper (Cu), and Mn of neonatal piglets were significantly increased (p < 0.05) in the CAT group. CAT supplementation downregulated mRNA expression of TRPV6 and CTR1 (p < 0.05), Cu/Zn SOD (p = 0.086) in the placenta and tended to increase the mRNA expression of the glutathione peroxidase 1 (GPX1) (p = 0.084), glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4) (p = 0.063), and CAT (p = 0.052) genes in the ileum of piglets. These results showed that the maternal CAT supplementation improved fetal growth by decreasing the IUGR rate, and modulated antioxidant activity, as well as mineral elements in the pregnant sows and their piglets.

AB  - Salt stress affects the plant growth and productivity worldwide and NHX is one of those genes that are well known to improve salt tolerance in transgenic plants. It is well characterized in several plants, such as Arabidopsis thaliana and cotton; however, not much is known about NHXs in tea plant. In the present study, NHX genes of tea were obtained through a genome-wide search using A. thaliana as reference genome. Out of the 9 NHX genes in tea, 7 genes were localized in vacuole while the remaining 2 genes were localized in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER; CsNHX8) and plasma membrane (PM; CsNHX9), respectively. Furthermore, phylogenetic relationships along with structural analysis which includes gene structure, location, and protein-conserved motifs and domains were systematically examined and further, predictions were validated by the expression analysis. The dN/dS values show that the majority of tea NHX genes is subjected to strong purifying selection under the course of evolution. Also, functional interaction was carried out in Camellia sinensis based on the orthologous genes in A. thaliana. The expression profiles linked to various stress treatments revealed wide involvement of NHX genes from tea in response to various abiotic factors. This study provides the targets for further comprehensive identification, functional study, and also contributed for a better understanding of the NHX regulatory network in C. sinensis.

AB  - Prickles are common structures in plants that play a key role in defense against herbivores. In the Rosa genus, prickles are widely present with great diversity in terms of form and density. For cut rose production, prickles represent an important issue, as they can damage the flower and injure workers. Our objectives were to precisely describe the types of prickles that exist in roses, their tissues of origin and their development. We performed a detailed histological analysis of prickle initiation and development in a rose F1 population. Based on the prickle investigation of 110 roses, we proposed the first categorization of prickles in the Rosa genus. They are mainly divided into two categories, nonglandular prickles (NGPs) and glandular prickles (GPs), and subcategories were defined based on the presence/absence of hairs and branches. We demonstrated that NGPs and GPs both originate from multiple cells of the ground meristem beneath the protoderm. For GPs, the gland cells originate from the protoderm of the GP at the early developmental stage. Our findings clearly demonstrate that prickles are not modified trichomes (which originate from the protoderm). These conclusions are different from the current mainstream hypothesis. These results provide a foundation for further studies on prickle initiation and development in plants.

AB  - Piles of agro-wastes resulting from quantum agro-industrial growth can be best utilized as animal feed, reducing envionmental impact by 50-95% depending on their nutritive value. However, palatability issues have limited their use, which can be addressed by combining them based on their nutritional value. Thus present three-phase study aimed to utilize these waste materials as animal feed by utilizing a self-fermentation approach. Six combinations of apple pomace (AP), spent mushroom compost (SMC) and wheat straw were self-fermented and analysed for quality in phase-I. Phase-II assessed the best combination obtained from phase-I as an antioxidant -enriched maize replacer (AEMR) by replacing maize (0-32%) in total mixed ration (TMR) under in-vitro ruminal conditions and two best TMR were assessed for nutrient utilization under metabolic trial. In phase-III, the three-month feeding effect of AEMR on the overall growth performance of male Gaddi goat kids was assessed. Findings showed that 85:7.5:7.5 proportion had optimal pH (3.92), significantly higher lactic acid (5.29 g 100-1 g DM), water soluble carbohydrates (2.29 g 100-1 g DM) and oxidative and microbial stability (Lactobacillus: 8.38 log10 cfu g-1). Fermentation also resulted in significant increase in antioxidant activities. AEMR exhibited a significant reduction in CH4 and NH3-N and higher volatile fatty acid production under in-vitro conditions at 32% level with no adverse effects on nutrient utilization. AEMR feeding also exhibited significantly improved feed conversion ratio (FCR) and serum lipid and oxidative profiles. In conclusion, AP and SMC in combined form can be utilized as an AEMR through self-fermentation at 32% level in TMR which may serve as a promising and sustainable approach for reducing environmental footprints and boosting eco-friendly livestock production.

AB  - Simple Summary The western flower thrips, Frankliniella occidentalis (Pergande) (Thysanoptera: Thripidae) is an economically damaging invasive pest that is difficult to control due to their resistance to insecticides. Utilizing plant-induced defense responses is a new strategy to increase plant resistance to F. occidentalis. A growing number of studies have shown that calcium plays an important role in enhancing plant resistance to pest-induced stresses. In this study, we found that exogenous calcium treatment could alter the composition of volatile compounds in kidney bean plants, repelling F. occidentalis while attracting its natural enemy, Orius similis Zheng (Hemiptera: Anthocoridae), and reducing the oviposition preference choice of F. occidentalis. This study provides a theoretical basis for the control of F. occidentalis. Frankliniella occidentalis is a destructive pest of horticultural plants, while Orius similis is a natural enemy of thrips. It has been demonstrated that exogenous calcium could induce plant defenses against herbivore attack. We examined whether CaCl2 supplementation altered the volatile emissions of kidney bean plants, which influence the oviposition preference of F. occidentalis. We also assessed the influence of volatile cues on O. similis. Using Y-tube olfactometer tests, we found that exogenous CaCl2 treatment inhibited the selectivity of F. occidentalis but attracted O. similis. In addition, CaCl2 treatment reduced the oviposition preference of F. occidentalis. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry analyses revealed that CaCl2 treatment altered the number and relative abundance of the volatile compounds in kidney bean plants and that (E)-2-hexen-1-ol, 1-octen-3-ol, beta-lonone, and (E,E)-2,4-hexadienal might be potential olfactory cues. Furthermore, the results of the six-arm olfactometer test indicated that 1-octen-3-ol (10(-2) mu L/mu L), beta-lonone (10(-2) mu L/mu L), and (E,E)-2,4-hexadienal (10(-3) mu L/mu L) repelled F. occidentalis but attracted O. similis. Overall, our results suggested that exogenous CaCl2 treatment induced defense responses in kidney bean plants, suggesting that CaCl2 supplementation may be a promising strategy to enhance the biological control of F. occidentalis.

AB  - The oral microbiota is essential for the maintenance of oral and systemic health but is poorly characterized in primates. We used positive reinforcement training to collect 20 oral samples from three infant, ten juvenile/subadult, and seven adult Sichuan golden snub-nosed monkeys (Rhinopithecus roxellana). We subjected these samples to 16S rRNA high-throughput sequencing, as well as bacterial culture and identification. The 16S rRNA sequencing data showed the diversity of the oral flora did not differ significantly across these three age groups, while at the phyla level, the dominant flora in the oral cavity were Firmicutes and Proteobacteria (totaling 77.62%), and the relative abundance of Firmicutes in the adults was significantly higher than in the juvenile/subadults. Meanwhile, Enterococcus was the most abundant genus in this population, and there was no significant difference in the oral flora at the genus level across the age groups. We also isolated several opportunistic pathogenic bacteria in the oral samples from noninfant, Sichuan golden snub-nosed monkeys. Although our sample size is small, particularly for infants, our study describes the characteristics of oral flora in captive, Sichuan golden snub-nosed monkeys of different age groups and provides important information about possibly pathogenic bacteria.

AB  - Sports-related muscle injuries account for 10-55% of all injuries, which is a growing concern, especially given the aging world population. To evaluate the process of skeletal muscle injury and compare it with muscle lesions observed in humans, we developed a novel in vivo model in sheep. In this model, muscle injury was induced by an ultrasound-guided transverse biopsy at the myotendinous junction of the medial gastrocnemius muscle. Twelve male sheep were examined at 3, 7, 14, and 28 days post-injury. Histological, immunofluorescence, and MRI analyses indicate that our sheep model could resemble key human clinicopathological features. Statistically significant differences (p < 0.05) were observed in collagen I, dMHC, alpha-SMA, and CD68 immunohistochemical detection when comparing injured and healthy muscles. The injured gastrocnemius muscle exhibited elevated levels of type I collagen, infiltration of CD68(+) macrophages, angiogenesis, and the emergence of newly regenerated dMHC(+) myofibers, which persisted for up to 4 weeks post-injury. Similarly, the progression of muscle injury in the sheep model was assessed using advanced clinical 3 T MRI and compared with MRI scans from human patients. The data indicate that the sheep muscle injury model presents features similar to those observed in human skeletal muscle injuries. This makes it a valuable large animal model for studying muscle injuries and developing novel therapeutic strategies.

AB  - The present study investigated the pharmacological mechanisms of the antidepressant-like effects of amantadine in mice and their influence on hippocampal neurogenesis. To improve the translational validity of preclinical results, reproducibility across laboratories and replication in other animal models and species are crucial. Single amantadine administration at doses of 50 and 75 mg/kg resulted in antidepressant-like effects in mice in the tail suspension test (TST), reflected by an increase in immobility time. The effects of amantadine were seen at doses that did not alter locomotor activity. The tyrosine hydroxylase inhibitor alpha-methyl-rho-tyrosine did not influence the anti-immobility effect of amantadine in the TST. Pretreatment with the alpha 1 adrenergic receptor antagonist prazosin, beta adrenergic receptor antagonist propranolol, alpha 2 adrenergic receptor antagonist yohimbine, and alpha 2 adrenergic receptor agonist clonidine did not alter the antidepressant-like effect of amantadine. However, amantadine's effect was blocked by the dopamine D2 receptor antagonist haloperidol and glutamate receptor agonist N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA). Repeated amantadine administration (50 mg/kg) also exerted an antidepressant-like effect, paralleled by an increase in hippocampal neurogenesis. The present results demonstrate that the antidepressant-like effects of amantadine may be mediated by its actions on D2 and NMDA receptors and likely involve hippocampal neurogenesis.

AB  - Sperm cryopreservation plays an important role in the artificial insemination (AI) industry of small ruminants. It, however the use of frozen-thawed goat semen is limited due to the insufficient number of sperm with good biological functions. Mitochondria are the most sensitive organelles to cryopreservation damage in sperm. This study was conducted to determine the effects of MitoQ, the mitochondrial-targeted antioxidant, in a plant-based extender on the quality parameters of Markhoz goat sperm after the freezing and thawing process. Semen samples were collected and diluted in the extender, divided into five equal aliquots and supplemented with 0, 1, 10, 100 and 1000 nM MitoQ and cryopreserved in liquid nitrogen. After thawing, sperm motility, membrane functionality, abnormal morphology, mitochondrial activity, acrosome integrity, lipid peroxidation (LPO), DNA fragmentation, reactive oxygen species (ROS) concentration, viability and apoptotic-like changes were measured. The use of 10 and 100 nM MitoQ resulted in higher (P <= 0.05) total motility (TM), progressive motility (PM), viability, membrane functionality, mitochondrial activity, and acrosome integrity compared to the other groups. On the other hand, LPO, apoptotic-like changes, DNA fragmentation and ROS concentration were lower (P <= 0.05) in MQ10 and MQ100 groups compared to the other groups. MitoQ has no effect (P>0.05) on sperm abnormal morphology and velocity parameters. In conclusion, MitoQ can reduce oxidative stress by regulating mitochondrial function during the cryopreservation process of buck sperm and could be an effective additive in the cryopreservation media to protect sperm quality.

AB  - A key question in pollination biology is that of how pollinators identify and choose foraging patches. Several approaches have been employed for this, including field studies and large greenhouse flight chambers. Most methods used to date are limited, though, by reliance on a combination of artificial flowers, large spatial scales, or lack of spatially distinct floral patches. To address this issue, we designed and tested a y-maze flight arena and tested it using the bumblebee Bombus impatiens and canola plants. Our results indicate that the system is not biased by environmental conditions, or by an innate "handedness" of Bombus impatiens. We found that bees made all the expected patch choices when presented with soil, plants without flowers, or plants with flowers. This new method is important and useful as it allows researchers to ask questions of both plant health and insect behavior and the chamber system is modular allowing for simple changes to the setup to focus on different questions.

AB  - Camalexin is the key phytoalexin in Arabidopsis thaliana and crops such as Camelina sativa. It is typically quantified by liquid chromatographic methods using camalexin dilutions as external standards. Alternatively, 6-fluoroindole-3-carboxaldehyde (6-FICA) is used as an internal standard with the advantage that identical conditions can be used for the analyte and standard, but two detectors are needed (ideally fluorescence for camalexin; UV for 6-FICA). We established an easy method to use readily available, cheap thiabendazole as a novel internal standard, facilitating the use of a fluorescence detector for standard and analyte for fast, reliable camalexin quantification in samples of diverse biological origin.

AB  - As a well-known cancer-related miRNA, miR-193b-3p is enriched in skeletal muscle and dysregulated in muscle disease. However, the mechanism underpinning this has not been addressed so far. Here, we probed the impact of miR-193b-3p on myogenesis by mainly using goat tissues and skeletal muscle satellite cells (MuSCs), compared with mouse C2C12 myoblasts. miR-193b-3p is highly expressed in goat skeletal muscles, and ectopic miR-193b-3p promotes MuSCs proliferation and differentiation. Moreover, insulin-like growth factor-2 mRNA-binding protein 1 (IGF2BP1) is the most activated insulin signaling gene when there is overexpression of miR-193b-3p; the miRNA recognition element (MRE) within the IGF1BP1 3 ' untranslated region (UTR) is indispensable for its activation. Consistently, expression patterns and functions of IGF2BP1 were similar to those of miR-193b-3p in tissues and MuSCs. In comparison, ectopic miR-193b-3p failed to induce PAX7 expression and myoblast proliferation when there was IGF2BP1 knockdown. Furthermore, miR-193b-3p destabilized IGF2BP1 mRNA, but unexpectedly promoted levels of IGF2BP1 heteronuclear RNA (hnRNA), dramatically. Moreover, miR-193b-3p could induce its neighboring genes. However, miR-193b-3p inversely regulated IGF2BP1 and myoblast proliferation in the mouse C2C12 myoblast. These data unveil that goat miR-193b-3p promotes myoblast proliferation via activating IGF2BP1 by binding to its 3 ' UTR. Our novel findings highlight the positive regulation between miRNA and its target genes in muscle development, which further extends the repertoire of miRNA functions.

AB  - Premise: Island plants have long interested biologists because of their distinctive morphological features and their isolation on small land areas in vast oceans. Studies of insular endemics may include identifying their ancestors, tracing their dispersal to islands, and describing their evolution on islands, including characters adaptive to island life. Thamnoseris is a monospecific fi c genus endemic to the Desventuradas Islands, Chile. Its origins and relationships are unresolved, given the challenges of getting to the islands and accessing plants there. Methods: Sequences from ITS of nrDNA and the complete chloroplast genome were employed to resolve phylogenetic relationships of Thamnoseris. . Results: Phylogenetic analyses of nuclear and chloroplast sequences showed Thamnoseris nested within or sister to Dendroseris, , the largest endemic genus in the Juan Fern & aacute;ndez Islands. Conclusions: Thamnoseris evolved from a common ancestor of all or most species of Dendroseris prior to the diversification fi cation of Dendroseris in the Juan Fern & aacute;ndez archipelago. The ancestor of Thamnoseris dispersed to the Desventuradas archipelago, which consists of the islands San Ambrosio and San F & eacute;lix, within the past 3 Ma (the age of San Ambrosio). This is the only known example of possible plant dispersa\l between the Juan Fern & aacute;ndez and Desventuradas Islands. We also mention two less likely biogeographic scenarios for the origin of Thamnoseris, , which has features not seen in Dendroseris: : small capitula with yellow fl orets; style branches barely divergent; and basally swollen subtending involucral bracts, all features associated with selfing fi ng and reduced dispersal. Goats and rabbits (now removed) reduced T. lacerata, , once very abundant on the Desventuradas Islands, to several plants, making it of extreme conservation concern and worthy of further study.

AB  - Bi-directional crosstalk between Ca2+ signaling and ROS modulates physiological processes as a part of a regulatory circuit including sperm function. The role of transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 (TRPV1) in this regard cannot be undermined. This is the first report demonstrating the Ca2+-sensitive TRPV1 channel to be under-expressed in spermatozoa of subfertile men, idiopathic infertile men, and normozoospermic infertile males with high ROS (idiopathic infertility and unilateral varicocele). To study the effect of TRPV1 in determining the fertility outcome, we compared the expression profile of TRPV1 in spermatozoa of male partners who achieved pregnancy by natural conception (NC+, n = 10), IVF (IVF+, n = 23), or ICSI (ICSI +, n = 9) and their respective counterparts with failed pregnancy NC (n = 7), IVF (n = 23), or ICSI (n = 10), by both immunocytochemistry and flow-cytometry. Reduced expression of TRPV1 in sperm of IVF & PLUSMN; and ICSI & PLUSMN; men with respect to that NC+ men imply its role in mediating successful fertilization. Unsuccessful pregnancy outcome with an underexpression of TRPV1 in sperm of NC-/IVF-/ICSI-men suggests its role in conception and maintenance of pregnancy. Since ROS is regarded as one of the major contributors to sperm dysfunction, the effect of H2O2 +/- TRPV1 modulators (RTX/iRTX) on acrosomal reaction and calcium influx was evaluated to confirm TRPV1 as a redox sensor in human sperm. A significant increment in the percentage of acrosome reacted spermatozoa along with augmented Ca2+-influx was observed after H2O2 treatment, both in the presence or absence of TRPV1 agonist resiniferatoxin (RTX). The effect was attenuated by the TRPV1 antagonist iodoresiniferatoxin (iRTX), indicating the involvement of TRPV1 in mediating H2O2 response. Enhancement of motility and triggering of acrosomal reaction post TRPV1 activation suggested that disruption of these signaling cascades in vivo, possibly due to down-regulation of TRPV1 in these subfertile males. Bioinformatic analysis of the crosstalk between TRPV1 with fertility candidate proteins (reported to influence IVF outcome) revealed cell death and survival, cellular compromise, and embryonic development to be the primary networks affected by anomalous TRPV1 expression. We therefore postulate that TRPV1 can act as a redox sensor, and its expression in spermatozoa may serve as a fertility marker.

AB  - The tea plant is a kind of ammonium-preferring crop, but the mechanism whereby ammonium (NH4+) regulate its growth is not well understood. The current study focused on the effects of NH4+ on tea plants. Transcriptomic analysis was performed to investigate the early- and late-stage NH4+ deprivation and resupply in tea plants shoots. Through short- and long-term NH4+ deficiency, the dynamic response to NH4+ stress was investigated. The most significant effects of NH4+ deficiency were found to be on photosynthesis and gene ontology (GO) enrichment varied with the length of NH4+ deprivation. Enriched KEGG pathways were also different when NH4+ was resupplied at different concentrations which may indicate reasons for tolerance of high NH4+ concentration. Using weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA), modules related to significant tea components, tea polyphenols and free amino acids, were identified. Hence, NH4+ could be regarded as a signaling molecule with the response of catechins shown to be higher than that of amino acids. The current work represents a comprehensive transcriptomic analysis of plant responses to NH4+ and reveals many potential genes regulated by NH4+ in tea plants. Such findings may lead to improvements in nitrogen efficiency of tea plants.

AB  - The main goal of this study was to assess the potential proteins of goat milk (i.e. alpha-s1-casein, alpha-s2-casein, beta-casein, kappa-casein, alpha-lactoglobulin and beta-lactalbumin) as precursors of antimicrobial peptides (AMPs). Bioinformatics tools such as BIOPEP-UWM (enzyme action) were used for the in silico gastrointestinal digestion via a cocktail of pepsin, trypsin, and chymotrypsin A. The antimicrobial activity of peptides was predicted by using four algorithms, including Random Forest, Support Vector Machines, Artificial Neural Network and Discriminant Analysis on CAMP(R3) online server, which works on Hidden Markov Models. Different online tools predicted the physiochemical properties, allergenicity, and toxicity of peptides as well. In silico gastrointestinal digestion simulation of proteins by enzymes cocktail yielded a total of 83 potential AMPs, with thirteen peptides being confident by all four algorithms. More AMPs were released from beta-casein (21) than from beta-lactoglobulin (16), alpha-s1-casein (15), alpha-s2-casein (12), kappa-casein (11) and alpha-lactalbumin (9). A total of 17 peptides were cationic, and the majority of the peptides were extended AMPs. These peptides were released from alpha-s1-casein (SGK, IQK), alpha-s2-casein (SIR, AIH, TQPK), beta-casein (GPVR, AVPQR, AIAR, GVPK, SQPK, PVPQK, IH, VPK), k-casein (AIPPK, QQR, IAK, TVPAK). All of the AMPs were anticipated to be non-toxic, and 54 of the 83 peptides were confirmed to be non-allergic, with the remaining 29 suspected of being allergenic and 31 to be predicted to have good water solubility. Further the molecular docking was used to evaluate the potent dihydropteroate synthase (DHPS) inhibitors. On the basis of ligand binding energy, 17 predicted AMPs were selected and then analyzed by AutoDock tools. Among the 17 AMPs, 3 AMPs were predicted as high-potent antimicrobial. Based on these findings, in silico investigations reveal that proteins of goat milk are a potential source of AMPs. These peptides can be synthesized and improved for use in the food sector. Practical applications Goat milk is regarded as a high-quality milk protein source. According to this study, goat milk protein is a possible source of AMPs, and therefore, most important AMPs can be synthesized and developed for use in the food sector.

AB  - Nutrition is essential for not only survival but also successful growth and reproduction. Dietary demands are increased in a diseased state due to the increased energy and nutritional requirements associated with immune response, inflammation and convalescence. The herbivorous bare-nosed wombat (Vombatus ursinus) is notably susceptible to sarcoptic mange, a disease caused by the mite, Sarcoptes scabiei, which causes debilitating pruritic skin disease and leads to secondary bacterial infections and increased wombat morbidity and mortality, as well as regionally variable population declines. It is unknown why wombats are so susceptible to sarcoptic mange and if nutrition may play a role in disease expression, particularly relating to seasonality. The objective of this study was to quantify the differences in the nutritive value, over four seasons, of plants (mostly grasses and sedges) that are available as food items for bare-nosed wombats. We collected plants over four seasons from five wombat habitats that were known to have wombats affected by sarcoptic mange. We found seasonal and site differences for macro and micronutrients in the plants analysed. Monitoring the diet quality of wombats in the wild is useful for managing their populations and understanding population dynamics in relation to food resource quality.

AB  - Endophytic fungi are a diverse group of microorganisms that live asymptomatically in healthy tissues of host and they have been reported from all kinds of plant tissues such as leaves, stems, roots, flowers, and fruits. In this study, fungal endophytes associated with tea leaves (Camellia sinensis) were collected from Kandy, Kegalle, and Nuwara Eliya districts in Sri Lanka and were isolated, characterized, and identified. A total of twenty endophytic fungal isolates belonging to five genera were recovered and ITS-rDNA sequence data were used to identify them. All isolated endophytic fungal strains belong to the phylum Ascomycota and the majority of these isolates were identified as Colletotrichum species. Phyllosticta capitalensis was the most commonly found fungal endophyte in tea leaves and was recorded in all three districts where the samples were collected. This is the very first investigation on fungal endophytes associated with C. sinensis in Sri Lanka based on molecular sequence data. In addition, a comprehensive account of known endophytic fungi reported worldwide on Camellia sinensis is provided.

AB  - The hippocampus is a crucial brain region involved in the process of forming and consolidating memories. Memories are consolidated in the brain through synaptic plasticity, and a key mechanism underlying this process is called long-term potentiation (LTP). Recent research has shown that cholecystokinin (CCK) plays a role in facilitating the formation of LTP, as well as learning and memory consolidation. However, the specific mechanisms by which CCK is involved in hippocampal neuroplasticity and memory formation are complicated or poorly understood. This literature review aims to explore the role of LTP in memory formation, particularly in relation to hippocampal memory, and to discuss the implications of CCK and its receptors in the formation of hippocampal memories. Additionally, we will examine the circuitry of CCK in the hippocampus and propose potential CCK-dependent mechanisms of synaptic plasticity that contribute to memory formation.

AB  - Granulosa cells (GCs) are pivotal in the development of ovarian follicles, serving not only as supportive cells but also as the primary producers of steroid hormones. The proliferation of these cells and the synthesis of steroid hormones are crucial for follicular development and atresia. In our study, GCs were isolated using follicular fluid aspiration and subsequently identified through immunofluorescence. We investigated the impact of varying concentrations of N-acetylcysteine (NAC) at 50, 100, 500, and 1000 mu mol/L on sheep GCs, focusing on antioxidant levels, proliferation, apoptosis, and steroid hormone secretion. The phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/protein kinase B (Akt) inhibitor LY294002 was used to explore the molecular mechanism of NAC on GCs proliferation and steroid hormone secretion in sheep. Our findings indicate that all concentrations of NAC tested promoted GC proliferation and suppressed apoptosis in sheep GCs. Notably, 100 mu mol/L NAC exhibited the most pronounced effect on GC proliferation after 48 h. The expression levels of CCND1, CDK4, and Bcl-2 were significantly elevated in all NAC concentration groups, whereas Bax expression was notably reduced. Furthermore, all NAC concentrations led to a significant reduction in reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels and an increase in the expression of CAT and SOD1. NAC also significantly enhanced the expression of CYP19A1 and 3 beta-HSD, as well as the secretion of estradiol (E2) and progesterone (P4) by GCs. In summary, NAC activates the PI3K/AKT signalling pathway, thereby promoting the proliferation of GCs and the secretion of E2 and P4 by sheep GCs in vitro.

AB  - To control sawfly populations that cause a forest management problem due to feeding damage, it is necessary to understand the mechanism of eruptive outbreak in erratic intervals by clarifying the responses of natural enemies to the host population fluctuations. In this study, we investigated annual beech sawfly population fluctuations and its predator, ichneumonid parasitoid wasps (as specialists) and predatory soldier beetles (as generalists). In addition, yearly responses of predators to the host emerging patterns were examined using structural equation modeling. The results revealed that ichneumonid wasps showed a non-delayed synchronous response to erratic fluctuation of the host population, resulting in the maintenance of a constant parasitism ratio. In contrast, soldier beetle population, which tends to moderately fluctuate while maintaining a specific density, showed a low-intensity delayed response without significance in the model. These predator populations without strong delayed density-dependent response are quite unlikely to highly densify causing mass mortality to the host population in the both the current and following years of outbreak. In places where eruptive outbreaks of sawfly species repeatedly occur in erratic intervals, sawfly populations are possibly maintained in high density due to the low mortality ratio caused by predators.

AB  - We examined differences in the physiology and life history between dimorphs of the common pistachio psyllid, Agonoscena pistaciae (Burckhardt and Lauterer) (Hemiptera: Aphalaridae), and how they differ in elicitating host plant production of key metabolites and volatile compounds involved in the recruitment of herbivores and natural enemies. Summer morphs had higher activities of glutathione S-transferase, carboxylesterase, acetylcholinesterase, and cytochrome P450 monooxygenase, superoxide dismutase, catalase, peroxidase, phenoloxidase, and a higher total protein content compared to winter morphs, whereas the latter had higher amounts of lipid, carbohydrate, and glycogen. Winter morphs were heavier, with a higher chitin content and longer preoviposition period, but greater fecundity and longevity than summer morphs. A lower LC50 to thiamethoxam for winter morphs resulted in higher mortality following exposure to the recommended rate of this insecticide in a greenhouse trial. Feeding by winter morphs elicited more strongly the release of volatile compounds known to be attractive to other herbivores, whereas feeding by summer morphs elicited more strongly the release of volatiles implicated in the attraction of natural enemies. Feeding by psyllids increased the concentrations of nitrogenous compounds, carbohydrates, vitamins, and amino acids in plants, the winter morph eliciting larger changes and more improved host plant quality. We conclude that winter morphs are more vulnerable targets for chemical control in early spring, whereas management of summer morphs could rely more on conservation biological control.

AB  - Simple Summary An early resolution of osteoarthritis (OA), through minimally invasive orthobiological solutions, would be important to enable a return to daily and sport activities, and delay prosthesis solutions. No study has yet evaluated amniotic epithelial stem cells (AECs) in OA. They could be considered a valid alternative to adipose derived cells, expanded or concentrated, because they differentiate into three lineages and express mesenchymal and embryonic markers, without a tumorigenic phenotype. The innovative aspects of this study are the comparison of three injective orthobiological treatments, the in vivo use of AECs in OA, and the evaluation of structural and inflammatory fronts of OA for up to six months. The challenge of osteoarthritis (OA) is to find a minimally invasive orthobiological therapy to contrast OA progression, on inflammatory and structural fronts. The aim of the present study is to compare the effects of an intra-articular injection of three orthobiological treatments, autologous culture expanded adipose-derived mesenchymal stromal cells (ADSCs), autologous stromal vascular fraction (SVF) and allogenic culture expanded amniotic epithelial stem cells (AECs), in an animal model of OA. OA was induced in 24 sheep by bilateral lateral meniscectomy and, at 3 and 6 months post-treatment, the results were analyzed with macroscopy, histology, histomorphometry, and biochemistry. All the three treatments showed better results than control (injection of NaCl), but SVF and AECs showed superiority over ADSCs, because they induced higher cartilage regeneration and lower inflammation. SVF showed better results than AECs at 3 and 6 months. To conclude, SVF seems to be more favorable than the other biological options, because it is easily obtained and rapidly used after harvesting, with good healing potential. AECs cause no discomfort and could be also considered for the treatment of OA joints.

AB  - Exobasidium vexans is an important tropical phytopathogenic fungus that causes blister blight in tea. Despite its devastating impact on tea cultivation, this pathogen remains poorly studied. In this study, fresh symptomatic leaf samples of blister blight were collected from the main tea-growing regions of Sri Lanka and from Northeast and Eastern India, where the disease was originally reported. Fresh collections obtained from each locality were characterized based on micromorphological characters and molecular data and an epitype was designated. A molecular phylogeny based on the ITS (ribosomal nuclear internal transcribed spacer 1, 5.8S, internal transcribed spacer 2), 28S rDNA (largest subunit of ribosomal gene partial sequence), and TEF-1 alpha (translation elongation factor-1 alpha) revealed that E. vexans collections represent a monophyletic clade closely related to E. reticulatum. This study provides crucial insights into the phylogenetic position and genetic diversity of E. vexans, offering a foundation for future studies on its biology, epidemiology, and management to mitigate impact on global tea production.

AB  - Eunotia is a large, taxonomically complex genus globally distributed, with many endem-ics described. In tropical regions of South America many Eunotia taxa have been reported and de-scribed. In 1933 Frenguelli reported 55 different taxa of this genus from the Iber. wetland with a high rate of endemism. One of the species reported by this author with the highest number of in-fraspecific taxa was Eunotia camelus, originally described from Cayenne and whose type material was later documented by Reichardt, allowing a better understanding of this species. E. camelus has been reported worldwide in its distribution and there has been great confusion about the identity and distribution of this supposedly cosmopolitan species. The purpose of the present study is to detail with LM and SEM observations, taxa of E. camelus and its close allies reported in the Iber. wetland ecosystem by Frenguelli, and to consider the biogeographic distribution of this species complex. We analyzed samples from both recent and historical collections from different geograph-ic areas: Esteros del Iber. (Argentina), Banka Island (Indonesia) and Kolhapur, Western Ghats (India). As a result we conclude that the E. camelus complex originally reported from the Iber. in fact contains four different species: Eunotia camelus, Eunotia juga comb. nov. stat. nov., Eunotia ectorii nom. nov. stat. nov., and Eunotia carambolensis nov. spec. Furthermore, these taxa are not conspecific with those described from Indonesia and India. Our observations show that E. camelus is not a cosmopolitan or pantropical species, but it and its close allies rather comprise a group of morphologically similar species, each with a much more limited distribution.

AB  - Betaine is one of the most widely used attractants in feed formulations. Its dietary inclusion in aquafeeds positively influences several growth performance metrics and feed utilization of aquatic animals. In this study, a meta-analysis was conducted to quantify the effects of dietary supplementation of betaine on the specific growth rate (SGR), feed conversion ratio (FCR), protein efficiency ratio (PER), and survival (SUR) of several aquaculture species reared under different environmental conditions. Standardized mean differences (Hedge 's g ) were computed to quantify the primary outcomes. Likewise, the influence of several moderators such as aquaculture species, feeding behavior, experimental duration, and percentage of betaine supplementation in aquafeeds on Hedge 's g effect sizes for SGR, FCR, PER, and SUR was determined by a mixed-effects model. The results indicated improved SGR, FCR, and PER in both carnivorous and omnivorous/herbivorous species fed on betainesupplemented diets relative to the control. Although SUR was higher in control groups relative to the betainesupplemented groups, no significant differences were noted. Higher values for betaine inclusion level tended to lower SUR whereas lower values improved the SUR. Furthermore, longer experimental durations exhibited higher values for SUR compared to shorter experimental durations. The dietary betaine requirement of aquaculture animals was estimated to be 0.99 % based on broken-line regression between the betaine inclusion level in aquafeed and SGR effect sizes.

AB  - Pigments are compounds of importance to several industries, for instance, the food industry, where they can be used as additives, color intensifiers, and antioxidants. As the current trend around the world is shifting to the use of eco-friendly commodities, demand for natural dyes is increasing. Melanins are pigments that are produced by several microorganisms. Pseudomonas putida ESACB 191, isolated from goat cheese rind, was described as a brown pigment producer. This strain produces a brown pigment via the synthetic Mueller-Hinton Broth. This brown compound was extracted, purified, analyzed by FTIR and mass spectrometry, and identified as eumelanin. The maximum productivity was 1.57 mg/L/h. The bioactivity of eumelanin was evaluated as the capacity for scavenging free radicals (antioxidant activity), EC50 74.0 & PLUSMN; 0.2 mu g/mL, and as an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor, with IC50 575 & PLUSMN; 4 mu g/mL. This bacterial eumelanin did not show cytotoxicity towards A375, HeLa Kyoto, HepG2, or Caco2 cell lines. The effect of melanin on cholesterol absorption and drug interaction was evaluated in order to understand the interaction of melanin present in the cheese rind when ingested by consumers. However, it had no effect either on cholesterol absorption through an intestinal simulated barrier formed by the Caco2 cell line or with the drug ezetimibe.</p>

AB  - Restricted repetitive behaviors (RRB) are one of two diagnostic criteria for autism spectrum disorder and common in other neurodevelopmental and psychiatric disorders. The term restricted repetitive behavior refers to a wide variety of inflexible patterns of behavior including stereotypy, self-injury, restricted interests, insistence on sameness, and ritualistic and compulsive behavior. However, despite their prevalence in clinical populations, their underlying causes remain poorly understood hampering the development of effective treatments. Intriguingly, numerous animal studies have demonstrated that these behaviors are reduced by rearing in enriched environments (EE). Understanding the processes responsible for the attenuation of repetitive behaviors by EE should offer insights into potential therapeutic approaches, as well as shed light on the underlying neurobiology of repetitive behaviors. This review summarizes the current knowledge of the relationship between EE and RRB and discusses potential mechanisms for EE's attenuation of RRB based on the broader EE literature. Existing gaps in the literature and future directions are also discussed.

AB  - A balanced and moist wound environment and surface increases the effect of various growth factors, cytokines, and chemokines, stimulating cell growth and wound healing. Considering this fact, we tested in vitro and in vivo water evaporation rates from the cellulose dressing epicite(hydro) when combined with different secondary dressings as well as the resulting wound healing efficacy in a porcine donor site model. The aim of this study was to evaluate how the different rates of water evaporation affected wound healing efficacy. To this end, epicite(hydro) primary dressing, in combination with different secondary dressing materials (cotton gauze, JELONET(lozenge), AQUACEL (R) Extra (TM), and OPSITE lozenge Flexifix), was placed on 3 x 3 cm-sized dermatome wounds with a depth of 1.2 mm on the flanks of domestic pigs. The healing process was analyzed histologically and quantified by morphometry. High water evaporation rates by using the correct secondary dressing, such as cotton gauze, favored a better re-epithelialization in comparison with the low water evaporation resulting from an occlusive secondary dressing, which favored the formation of a new and intact dermal tissue that nearly fully replaced all the dermis that was removed during wounding. This newly available evidence may be of great benefit to clinical wound management.

AB  - The goal of this study was to evaluate how glucose and fructose affected the adipose differentiation of pig newborn mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs). Cells were grown with or without inosine in 7.5 mM glucose (substituted with 1.5 or 6 mM fructose). MSCs displayed adipose morphology after 70 days of differentiation. Fructose stimulated the highest levels of PPAR gamma and C/EBP beta. Fructose at 6 mM, but not glucose at 7.5 mM or fructose at 1.5 mM, promotes differentiation of MSCs into adipocytes and increases 11-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (11 beta-HSD1) and NADPH oxidase 4 (NOX4) mRNA in the absence of hepatic effects (as simulated by the inosine). Fructose and glucose increased xanthine oxide-reductase (XOR) catalytic activity almost 10-fold and elevated their products: intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) pool, extracellular H2O2 pool by 4 orders of magnitude, and uric acid by a factor of 10. Therefore, in our experimental model, differentiation of MSCs into adipocytes occurs exclusively at the blood concentration of fructose detected after ingestion by people on a high fructose diet. Practical applications The results of this study provide new evidence for fructose's adipogenic potential in mesenchymal stem cells, a model in which its effects on XOR activity had not been studied. The increased expression of genes such as C/EBP beta, PPAR gamma, and NOX4, as well as the increased XOR activity and high production of ROS during the differentiation process in the presence of fructose, coincides in pointing to this hexose as an important factor in the development of adipogenesis in young animals, which could have a great impact on the development of future obesity.

AB  - The study was conducted to determine the effect of the administration of different doses of PMSG (Pregnant mare's serum gonadotropin) on reproductive performance in ewes of the Staroplaninski Tsigai breed. The experiment was conducted at the beginning of the estrous season (July-August) on 30 Staroplaninski Tsigai ewes. 3 groups of 10 animals were formed (1 control and 2 experimental groups). Induction of synchronous estrus was performed with vaginal tampons containing 60 mg of medroxyprogesterone acetate (MAP). In both experimental groups, the vaginal tampons remained in the ewes vagina for 12 days, and on the day of removal of the tampons, the ewes of the 1st experimental group were injected with 400IU PMSG and those of the 2nd experimental group 500IU group. Animals in the control group were not treated according to the above scheme. The insemination was natural with siring rams, by the hand release method. In the ewes of the 1st experimental group (400IU), estrus was synchronized in 100% of the animals at the 56th hour. While in the 2nd experimental group (500IU), the estrous synchronization was recorded in 90% of the animals, with one ewe did not show any estrous traits and was not inseminated. In the control group, which included non-treated animals according to the adopted estrous synchronization scheme, no ewes were recorded in estrus and were not inseminated. The results show that the two doses of gonadotropin (400UI and 500UI) increased the studied reproductive indicators in Staroplaninski Tsigai ewes, at the beginning of the estrous season. The following values of the reproductive indicators were reported in the two experimental groups: 1st experimental group - fertility - 90.0%, 155.5% biological fecundity and 44.4% twinning; 2nd experimental group - 70.7% fertility, 150.0% biological fecundity and 33.2% twinning. The gestation length of ewes in the present study averaged 146 days.

AB  - Reproductive and condition parameters' dependency on immune status in seasonally reproducing ruminants such as red deer have not been outlined to date. We determined T and B blood lymphocytes; the concentration of IgG, cAMP, haptoglobulin, and 6-keto-PGF1 alpha in blood plasma; and the mRNA and protein expression of PG endoperoxide synthase 2, 5-lipoxygenase, PGE2 synthase (PGES), PGF2 alpha synthase (PGFS), PGI2 synthase (PGIS), leukotriene (LT)A4 hydrolase, and LTC4 synthase (LTC4S) in the uterine endo- and myometrium, on the 4th (N = 7) and 13th (N = 8) days of the estrous cycle, in anestrus (N = 6) and pregnancy (N = 8) in hinds. An increase in CD4+ T regulatory lymphocyte percentage during the estrous cycle and anestrus compared with pregnancy was recorded; the opposite effect was observed for CD21+ B cells (p < 0.05). cAMP and haptoglobin concentration were elevated during the cycle, as was IgG on the fourth day of the cycle, whereas 6-keto-PGF1 alpha concentration was the highest in pregnancy, and the nearest in anestrus similarly were LTC4S, PGES, PGFS, and PGIS protein expression in the endometrium (p < 0.05). We showed an interaction between the immune system activation and AA-metabolite production in the uterus throughout different reproductive stages. IgG, cAMP, haptoglobin, and 6-keto-PGF1 alpha concentrations are valuable candidates for markers of reproductive status in hinds. The results help expand our knowledge of the mechanisms underlying seasonal reproduction in ruminants.

AB  - The aim of this study was to investigate the influence of genotype (GT) and seasonality (NP) on the quality parameters of sow colostrum and evaluate the efficiency of the radial immunodiffusion (RID) analysis and the Brix refractometer in determining the IgG concentration. This study was conducted on 240 sows that originated from two genotypes, namely GT1 (TOPIGS, n = 120) and GT2 (Pig Improvement Company, n = 120), during the three farrowing periods: the winter farrowing period (WNP, n = 80), the summer farrowing period (SMP, n = 80) and the spring farrowing period (SSP, n = 80). The significant interaction effect was observed for protein (p < 0.0001), lactose (p < 0.05) and non-fat solids (SNT) (p < 0.001). At the same time, the interaction effect influenced the IgG concentration measured with the Brix refractometer (p < 0.0001) and RID (p < 0.0001). Pearson's correlation coefficient showed that Brix percentage was positively correlated with RID results (r = 0.52, p < 0.0001), while the Bland-Altman plots indicated a mean bias of -1.93. Partial eta-squared analysis (eta(2)) showed that the genotype explained the largest proportion of variance in fat content (eta(2) = 0.136) and IgG concentration (eta(2) = 0.164), while interaction effects were largest for protein (eta(2) = 0.072). The results of this study show that genotype and seasonality influence sow colostrum quality, which indicates the importance of genotype-seasonality interactions in breeding programs for optimizing the colostrum quality and piglet survival.

AB  - Fisetin has been shown to be beneficial for brain injury and age-related brain disease via different mechanisms. The purpose of this study was to determine the presence of senescent cells and the effects of fisetin on cellular senescence in the brain and other vital organs in old sheep, a more translational model. Female sheep 6-7 years old (N = 6) were treated with 100 mg/kg fisetin or vehicle alone on two consecutive days a week for 8 weeks. All vital organs were harvested at the time of sacrifice. Histology, immunofluorescence staining, and RT-Q-PCR were performed on different regions of brain tissues and other organs. Our results indicated that fisetin treatment at the current regimen did not affect the general morphology of the brain. The presence of senescent cells in both the cerebral brain cortex and cerebellum and non-Cornu Ammonis (CA) area of the hippocampus was detected by senescent-associated beta-galactosidase (SA- beta-Gal) staining and GL13 (lipofuscin) staining. The senescent cells detected were mainly neurons in both gray and white matter of either the cerebral brain cortex, cerebellum, or non-CA area of the hippocampus. Very few senescent cells were detected in the neurons of the CA1-4 area of the hippocampus, as revealed by GL13 staining and GLB1 colocalization with NEUN. Fisetin treatment significantly decreased the number of SA- beta-Gal(+) cells in brain cortex white matter and GL13(+) cells in the non-CA area of the hippocampus, and showed a decreasing trend of SA- beta-Gal(+) cells in the gray matter of both the cerebral brain cortex and cerebellum. Furthermore, fisetin treatment significantly decreased P16(+) and GLB1(+) cells in neuronal nuclear protein (NEUN)(+) neurons, glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP)(+) astrocytes, and ionized calcium binding adaptor molecule 1 (IBA1)(+) microglia cells in both gray and white matter of cerebral brain cortex. Fisetin treatment significantly decreased GLB1(+) cells in microglia cells, astrocytes, and NEUN+ neurons in the non-CA area of the hippocampus. Fisetin treatment significantly decreased plasma S100B. At the mRNA level, fisetin significantly downregulated GLB1 in the liver, showed a decreasing trend in GLB1 in the lung, heart, and spleen tissues, and significantly decreased P21 expression in the liver and lung. Fisetin treatment significantly decreased TREM2 in the lung tissues and showed a trend of downregulation in the liver, spleen, and heart. A significant decrease in NRLP3 in the liver was observed after fisetin treatment. Finally, fisetin treatment significantly downregulated SOD1 in the liver and spleen while upregulating CAT in the spleen. In conclusion, we found that senescent cells were widely present in the cerebral brain cortex and cerebellum and non-CA area of the hippocampus of old sheep. Fisetin treatment significantly decreased senescent neurons, astrocytes, and microglia in both gray and white matter of the cerebral brain cortex and non-CA area of the hippocampus. In addition, fisetin treatment decreased senescent gene expressions and inflammasomes in other organs, such as the lung and the liver. Fisetin treatment represents a promising therapeutic strategy for age-related diseases.

AB  - The objective of this study was to investigate the influence of different reproductive stages and livestock management conditions on the pattern of the daily rhythm of total locomotor activity in Pampinta dairy ewes. We recorded 24 hour(h)/day of total locomotor activity in 10 Pampinta dairy ewes during 2 differ-ent stages of 60 days each: in stage 1, the animals were pregnant and not lactating, and were subjected to a natural 10/14 light/dark (L/D) cycle with an ambient temperature of 17 degrees C and relative humidity of 70%; in stage 2, the animals were lactating. During stage 2, the animals were divided into 2 equal groups, one group was milked 1 time a day with an automatic machine, and the animals of the other group only suckled the lamb. During this stage, all animals were subjected to a natural 13/11 L/D photoperiod with an ambient temperature of 25 degrees C and relative humidity of 73%. A trigonometric statistical model was used to describe the main rhythmic parameters: mesor, amplitude, acrophase, and robustness of rhythm. Our results showed a daily rhythm of total locomotor activity in all periods considered. Two-way for repeated measure analysis of variance (ANOVA) was applied to study the effect of time (days of monitoring) and the experimental conditions on the studied parameters. The onset and offset times were defined as the time points at which the threshold amount of activity was reached at the rising and declining limbs of the daily pattern. The daily rhythm of total locomotor activity was different in the 2 stages considered and between the 2 groups during stage 2. The highest daily amount of activity per 24 hours was observed in the nursing ewes followed by the ewes milked by an automatic machine and pregnant ewes. Robust-ness of rhythm was highest in nursing ewes followed by the pregnant ewes and the ewes milked by an automatic machine. Only the acrophase was similar in the 2 stages and between the 2 groups of lactating ewes. In conclusion, the daily rhythm of total locomotor activity in Pampinta dairy ewes showed a low robustness value and was influenced by the different management conditions. The lamb's presence, and the consequent maternal care, strengthen the robustness of rhythm. Considering the total locomotor ac-tivity as an index of wellness in livestock, further studies are necessary to establish the characteristics of the daily rhythm of total locomotor activity in Pampita dairy ewes for the improvement of the wellness of this species widely used in Argentina.(c) 2022 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Biomphalaria glabrata snails constitute the main vector of schistosomiasis in Brazil, and Bauhinia monandra Kurz, the leaves of which contain BmoLL lectin with biocidal action, is a plant widely found on continents in which the disease is endemic. This work describes the composition of B. monandra preparations and the effect on embryos and adult snails, their reproduction parameters and hemocytes. We also describe the results of a comet assay after B. glabrata exposure to sublethal concentrations of the preparations. Additionally, the effects of the preparations on S. mansoni cercariae and environmental monitoring with Artemia salina are described. In the chemical evaluation, cinnamic, flavonoid and saponin derivatives were detected in the two preparations assessed, namely the saline extract and the fraction. Both preparations were toxic to embryos in the blastula, gastrula, trochophore, veliger and hippo stages (LC50 of 0.042 and 0.0478; 0.0417 and 0.0419; 0.0897 and 0.1582; 0.3734 and 0.0974; 0.397 and 0.0970 mg/mL, respectively) and to adult snails (LC50 of 6.6 and 0.87 mg/mL, respectively), which were reproductively affected with decreased egg deposition. In blood cell analysis, characteristic cells for apoptosis, micronucleus and binucleation were detected, while for comet analysis, different degrees of nuclear damage were detected. The fraction was able to cause total mortality of the cercariae and did not present environmental toxicity. Therefore, B. monandra preparations are promising in combating schistosomiasis since they can control both the intermediate host and eliminate the infectious agent, besides being safe to the environment.

AB  - BACKGROUND Due to the development of insecticide resistance in mosquitoes, with worldwide mosquito-borne diseases resurgence in recent years, recent advances in proteome technology have facilitated a proteome-wide analysis of insecticide resistance-associated proteins in mosquitoes. Understanding the complexity of the molecular basis of insecticide resistance mechanisms employed by mosquitoes will help in designing the most effective and sustainable mosquito control methods. RESULTS After 30 generations, insecticide-selected strains showed elevated resistance levels to the cypermethrin used for selection. Proteome data allowed the detection of 2892 proteins, of which 2885 differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) achieved quantitative significances in four stages (egg, larvae, pupae, adult) of Culex pipiens pallens cypermethrin-resistant strain as compared to the susceptible strain. Among them, a significant enrichment of proteins, including cuticular proteins, enzymes involved in the detoxification (cytochrome P450, glutathione S-transferases, esterase, ATP-binding cassette) and some biological pathways (oxidative phosphorylation, hippo signalling) that are potentially involved in cypermethrin resistance, was observed. Thirty-one representative DEPs (cytochrome P450, glutathione S-transferase, cuticle protein) during Cx. pipiens pallens developmental stages were confirmed by a parallel reaction monitoring strategy. CONCLUSIONS The present study confirmed the power of isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantification for identifying concomitantly quantitative proteome changes associated with cypermethrin in Cx. pipiens pallens. Proteome analysis suggests that proteome modifications can be selected rapidly by cypermethrin, and multiple resistance mechanisms operate simultaneously in cypermethrin-resistance of Cx. pipiens pallens, Our results interpret that an up-regulated expression of proteins and enzymes like cytochrome P450, glutathione S-transferases, esterase etc. has an impact in insecticide resistance. Previously neglected penetration resistance (cuticular proteins) may play an important role in the adaptive response of Cx. pipiens pallens to insecticides. This information may serve as a basis for future work concerning the possible role of these proteins in cypermethrin resistance in mosquito Cx. pipiens pallens.

AB  - Meat color traits directly influence consumer acceptability and purchasing decisions. Nevertheless, there is a paucity of comprehensive investigation into the genetic mechanisms underlying meat color traits in pigs. Utilizing genome-wide association studies (GWAS) on five meat color traits and the detection of selection signatures in pig breeds exhibiting distinct meat color characteristics, we identified a promising candidate SNP, 6_69103754, exhibiting varying allele frequencies among pigs with different meat color characteristics. This SNP has the potential to affect the redness and chroma index values of pork. Moreover, transcriptome-wide association studies (TWAS) analysis revealed the expression of candidate genes associated with meat color traits in specific tissues. Notably, the largest number of candidate genes were observed from transcripts derived from adipose, liver, lung, spleen tissues, and macrophage cell type, indicating their crucial role in meat color development. Several shared genes associated with redness, yellowness, and chroma indices traits were identified, including RINL in adipose tissue, ENSSSCG00000034844 and ITIH1 in liver tissue, TPX2 and MFAP2 in lung tissue, and ZBTB17, FAM131C, KIFC3, NTPCR, and ENGSSSCG00000045605 in spleen tissue. Furthermore, single-cell enrichment analysis revealed a significant association between the immune system and meat color. This finding underscores the significance of the immune system associated with meat color. Overall, our study provides a comprehensive analysis of the genetic mechanisms underlying meat color traits, offering valuable insights for future breeding efforts aimed at improving meat quality.

AB  - >44 million United States residents depend on private drinking water wells that are federally unregulated. Maintaining a clean groundwater supply for populations without access to public water systems is essential to supporting public health and falls to state regulators and private well owners. Yet, monitoring practices do not reflect the fact that groundwater pollution risk varies seasonally and with proximity to nearby surface-contaminated sites. Examination of nearly 50,000 well water samples across North Carolina, ranked second nationally in domestic well dependence and swine production, from 2013 to 2018 reveals a uniform sampling schedule but a variable risk of bacterial contam-ination within each calendar year. We document a threshold of 32.2 degrees C (90 degrees F) where total coliform bacteria and Escherichia coli (E. coli) detection in private well water spikes near swine lagoons but is absent from "upstream" wells and otherwise unexplained by a variety of other known contamination sites. Closing the gap between perceived and actual risks of drinking water contamination has potential to improve public health. State regulations and federal guidelines should consider coordinating domestic well sampling with seasonally and spatially fluctuating risks of groundwater contamination. Findings from this study are generalizable, having implications for other parts of the world with water sources that have the potential to get contaminated by nearby surface sources of human and animal waste, such as manure applications and leaching septic systems.

AB  - Tea waste as a potential biofuel and bio fertilizer was analyzed. Samples were collected from various tea species and torrefied to five different temperatures. All samples were analyzed for their proximal composition and calorific value. From the results, stoichiometric properties were calculated. A phytotoxicity test was performed, and the germination index was measured. Tea waste torrefied at 350 degrees C may be suitable biofuel reaching the calorific value of 25-27 MJ kg(-1), but with quite a high share of ash, up to 10%, which makes its use technically challenging and may lead to operating issues in a combustion chamber. The same biochar may be a suitable fertilizer for increasing the germination index, therefore, applicable to the soil. The non-torrefied sample and the sample treated at 250 degrees C are not suitable as fertilizers for being toxic. The total phenolic content in waste black tea was reduced from 41.26 to 0.21 mg g(-1), depending on the torrefaction temperature. The total flavonoid content was also reduced from 60.49 to 0.5 mg g(-1). The total antioxidant activity in the non-torrefied sample was 144 mg g(-1), and after torrefaction at 550 degrees C, it was 0.82 mg g(-1). The results showed that black tea waste residues have the potential for further use, for example, in agriculture as a soil amendment or as a potential biofuel.

AB  - Muscle development is closely related to meat quality and production. CircRNAs, with a closed-ring structure, have been identified as a key regulator of muscle development. However, the roles and mechanisms of circRNAs in myogenesis are largely unknown. Hence, in order to unravel the functions of circRNAs in myogenesis, the present study explored circRNA profiling in skeletal muscle between Mashen and Large White pigs. The results showed that a total of 362 circRNAs, which included circIGF1R, were differentially expressed between the two pig breeds. Functional assays showed that circIGF1R promoted myoblast differentiation of porcine skeletal muscle satellite cells (SMSCs), while it had no effect on cell proliferation. In consideration of circRNA acting as a miRNA sponge, dual-luciferase reporter and RIP assays were performed and the results showed that circIGF1R could bind miR-16. Furthermore, the rescue experiments showed that circIGF1R could counteract the inhibitory effect of miR-16 on cell myoblast differentiation. Thus, circIGF1R may regulate myogenesis by acting as a miR-16 sponge. In conclusion, this study successfully screened candidate circRNAs involved in the regulation of porcine myogenesis and demonstrated that circIGF1R promotes myoblast differentiation via miR-16, which lays a theoretical foundation for understanding the role and mechanism of circRNAs in regulating porcine myoblast differentiation.

AB  - Graphene oxide nanosheets (GO) were reported to alter neurobiological processes involving cell membrane dynamics. GO ability to reversibly downregulate specifically glutamatergic synapses underpins their potential in future neurotherapeutic developments. Aberrant glutamate plasticity contributes to stress-related psychopathology and drugs which target dysregulated glutamate represent promising treatments. We find that in a rat model of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), a single injection of GO to the lateral amygdala following the stressful event induced PTSD-related behavior remission and reduced dendritic spine densities. We explored from a mechanistic perspective how GO could impair glutamate synaptic plasticity. By simultaneous patch clamp pair recordings of unitary synaptic currents, live-imaging of presynaptic vesicle release and confocal microscopy, we report that GO nanosheets altered the probability of release enhancing the extinction of synaptic plasticity in the amygdala. These findings show that the modulation of presynaptic glutamate release might represent an unexplored target for (nano)pharmacological interventions of stress-related disorders.
   Synaptic potentiation with increased dendritic spine density is a signature of fear memory consolidation in the lateral amygdala. Small graphene oxide reduces synaptic release and potentiation, preventing dendritic spine increase and fear behaviour.

AB  - Microsensors are able to accurately quantify nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions in microenvironments at high spatiotemporal resolution: yet, limited studies have been conducted on agricultural soils due to the inability to obtain electrical signal under conditions of low soil moisture. This study improved the calibration of a microelectrode for measuring N2O emissions from agricultural soil. The microelectrode was applied to evaluate the effect of long-term fertilization with mineral fertilizer (NPK), complemented with pig manure (MNPK), straw (SNPK), or without fertilizer (CK), all with and without urea addition, on N2O emissions from the soil, with explicit separation of the rhizosphere and the bulk soil compartments. The use of soil solution instead of pure water for calibration of the microelectrode doubled the signal and significantly improved the sensor sensitivity. The optimal electrolytic concentration of the soil solution, expressed as water: soil ratio, was found at the maximum vertex of the quadratic equation fitted on the slope values of the calibration equations for different soil solutions. The application of the calibrated microelectrode revealed significantly higher N2O emission from the rhizosphere compared to the bulk soil, accounting for 60% of the total emission. For the bulk soil, MNPK significantly increased N2O emissions compared to SNPK and NPK, whereas the differences between these treatments for the rhizosphere soil were insignificant. The statistical modeling revealed significant relation of the N2O emission with soil inorganic nitrogen contents and an additive effect of treatment (MNPK and SNPK), urea addition and rhizosphere soil. This study provides novel insights into the use of microelectrodes for measuring N2O emissions from the soil microenvironment and also points on the rhizosphere compartment and the management practices of agroecosystems able to reduce the N2O emission from agriculture.

AB  - Territorial Life Cycle Assessment (TLCA) appears a promising method to support informed decision making of local actors in territorial agricultural production systems (TAPS), by assessing environmental impacts of agricultural activities and potential strategies. The objectives of this study were to i) adapt TLCA methodology to integrated environmental assessment of TAPS and ii) evaluate TLCA?s contribution to supporting informed decision making by assessing scenarios of change in TAPS. A TLCA of the agricultural sector was performed for a territory in the Aube department in France, including main crops and animal production types from raw material extraction to the first stage of processing. Exchanges of agricultural products and by-products among agricultural subsectors were considered by allocating impacts, which prevented double-counting them. Two contrasting scenarios were assessed with TLCA ? development of on-farm biogas production and reintroduction of sheep grazing ? and compared to the current situation. Results were expressed per unit area (ha), per unit biomass produced (kg) and per percentage contribution to total impacts of the territory before and after processing (at and beyond the farm gate, respectively). The main contributors (cereal and oilseed crops) did not have the highest impact at the farm scale (per ha and per kg), which highlights that contribution to total impacts of the territory is a relevant addition to the impacts per functional unit. Consideration of exchanges showed that TLCA can be used to assess effects of material interactions (biomass flows) between sectors. Scenario results showed no significant differences in impacts, except for higher water resource depletion for the biogas scenario, because most differences between scenarios were smaller than uncertainties in the input data. Other challenges were identified, such as the need to evaluate consequences of changes beyond the territory gate when performing TLCA of scenarios or the utility of characterizing the network of biomass flows in more detail. In conclusion, the methodological framework that was developed successfully identified environmental hotspots and reflected environmental impacts of material interactions between actors. Finally, it can estimate environmental impacts of future strategies, as long as uncertainty is reduced; thus, it shows potential as a decision-support tool.

AB  - Many countries have banned the use of antibiotics in livestock feed due to the development of antibiotic-resistant bacteria. Therefore, it is necessary to identify suitable alternatives to antibiotics in order to maintain intestinal health and improve piglet performance after weaning. The objective of this study was to evaluate how the intake of two functional foods-potato protein concentrate (PP) and Saccharomyces boulardii (Sb), either isolated or combined-would affect productive performance and some digestive morphophysiological responses after two weeks post-weaning. We evaluated five diets: SB, with Sb; PPC, with PP; PPC-SB, with a combination of PP and Sb; C-, without antibiotics, Sb, or PP; and C+, with antibiotics. Neither the absence of antibiotics in the diet nor the inclusion of PP and Sb affected performance or digestive organ development during the post-weaning phase. Piglets fed the C+ diet and the PP-Sb combination had higher concentrations of occludin proteins and longer villi in the jejunum compared to those fed C-, PPC, and SB. The use of Sb alone or in combination with PP increased fecal Lactobacillus, while antibiotics reduced coliform bacteria. The PP-Sb combination prevented the atrophy of the jejunal villi and promoted adhesion between enterocytes in the jejunum. Including these functional foods in piglet diets contributed to maintaining intestinal health during the critical post-weaning phase. However, further research is needed to validate and enhance the conclusions of this study.

AB  - Abamectin is an insecticide, miticide and nematicide that has been extensively used in agriculture for many years. The excessive use of abamectin inevitably pollutes water and soil and might even cause adverse effects on aquatic biota. However, it is currently unclear how abamectin exposure causes neurotoxicity in aquatic organisms. Herein, the early neural system development was assessed in zebrafish embryos following abamectin exposure. After treatment with a concentration gradient of abamectin (0.055, 0.0825, 0.11 mg/L), the survival rate, average heart rate, pericardial edema area and yolk sac edema were all documented in zebrafish embryos (96 hpf). It was found that after abamectin exposure, embryonic brain development was impaired, and motor behaviors were also affected. The fluorescence intensity was reduced in the transgenic embryos (Eno2: GFP). The activities of acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and ATPase were decreased, and the expression of neurodevelopment-related genes, such as sox10, gap43, grin1b, abat, gad1b, grin2b, nestin and glsa, were all inhibited in zebrafish embryo treatment with abamectin. Furthermore, the reactive oxygen species (ROS) were triggered upon exposure to abamectin in zebrafish embryos along with the accumulation of ROS, eventually resulting in neuroapoptosis in the developing embryonic brain. In conclusion, neurodevelopmental toxicity was caused by oxidative stress-induced apoptosis in zebrafish embryos following abamectin exposure.

AB  - During the long-term orbital flight, exposure to microgravity negatively affects the astronauts' development of cognition, characterized by learning and memory decline. Gastrodia elata Blume (GEB) has a significant pro-tective effect on cognitive impairment and has been used in Asia for centuries as a functional product. A previous study demonstrated that GEB could improve memory loss in mice caused by circadian rhythm disorders. However, the effects of GEB on cognitive dysfunction caused by weightless environments have not been inves-tigated. In this study, mice received daily treatment with GEB (0.5, 1 g center dot kg- 1d- 1, i.g) and Huperzine A(Hup, 0.1 mg center dot kg- 1d-1, i.g) orally until the end of the behavioral test (New object recognition test (NORT). Malondialde-hyde (MDA) and nitric oxide (NO) levels were detected by kits, and expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), protein kinase B (AKT), phosphorylated Akt (P-AKT), synaptophysin (SYN) and postsynaptic density 95(PSD95) in hippocampus were detected by western blotting. The results show that administration of GEB (0.5, 1 g center dot kg- 1d-1, i.g) and Hup (0.1 mg center dot kg- 1d- 1, i.g) remarkably reverse HLS-induced learning and behavioral memory disorders, which were associated with significant changes in MDA and NO levels. Addi-tionally, the protein expressions of BDNF, P-AKT/AKT, SYN, and PSD95 were significantly increased in the hippocampus. In summary, our findings will improve the reference for developing GEB as a functional product that improves memory decline.

AB  - The ability to remember sequences of events is fundamental to episodic memory. While rodent studies have examined sex and estrous cycle in episodic-like spatial memory tasks, little is known about these biological variables in memory for sequences of events that depend on representations of temporal context. We investigated the role of sex and estrous cycle in rats during training and testing stages of a cross-species validated sequence memory task (Jayachandran et al., 2019). Rats were trained on a two four-odor sequence memory task delivered on opposite ends of a linear track. Training occurred in six successive stages starting with learning to poke in a nose-port for >= 1.2 s; eventually demonstrating sequence memory by holding their nose in the port >= 1 s for in-sequence odors and <1 s for out-of-sequence odors. Performance was analyzed across sex and estrous cycle (proestrus, estrus, metestrus, and diestrus), the latter being determined by cellular composition of a daily vaginal lavage. We found no evidence of sex differences in asymptotic sequence memory performance, similar to humans performing an analogous task (Readers et al., 2021). Likewise, no differences in sequence memory performance were found across the estrous cycle. Some caveats are that males acquired out-of-sequence trials faster during training with a 3-odor sequence, but this apparent advantage did not carry over to the 4-odor sequence. Additionally, males had shorter poke times overall which seem consistent with a decreased overall response inhibition because they occurred regardless of sequence demands. Together, these results suggest sex and estrous cycle are not major factors in sequence memory capacities.

AB  - Camelina sativa is an important polyploid oilseed crop with multiple favourable agronomic traits. Capturing the leaf transcriptome of 48 accessions of C. sativa suggests allelic variation for gene expression levels and notably sub-genome dominance, both of which could provide opportunities for crop improvement. Flowering time (FT) is a crucial factor affecting the overall yield of crops. However, our understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying FT regulation in C. sativa are still limited, partly due to its complex allohexaploid genome. In this study, weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA), expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) analysis and transcriptome-wide association study (TWAS) were employed to explore the FT diversity among 48 C. sativa accessions and dissect the underlying molecular basis. Our results revealed a FT-related co-expressed gene module highly enriched with SOC1 and SOC1-like genes and identified 10 significant FT-associated single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) defining three haplotype groups; thus providing a molecular basis for future genetic improvements in C. sativa breeding.

AB  - Plants produce a wide variety of metabolites in order to defend themselves against herbivore insects. To cope with the adverse effects of secondary metabolites, insects have also developed a variety of mechanisms including production of digestive and detoxifying enzymes. These enzymes provide benefit to insects by converting complex molecules into simpler form as well as help in detoxification of deleterious plant metabolites. The current study evaluated the effect of ethyl acetate extract of Alpinia galanga on digestive and detoxifying enzymes of Spodoptera litura (Fab). The larvae were fed on diet treated with different concentrations of the extract viz. 500, 1000, 1500, 2000 and 2500 ppm and the enzyme activity was observed after 48 and 96 hrs of feeding. The results revealed that the activity level of digestive enzymes viz. alpha-amylase, alpha and beta-glucosidases, alpha and beta-galactosidases and lipases decreased due to consumption of treated diet by the larvae. Similarly detoxifying enzymes viz. phosphatases and glutathione-S-transferases were also found to be suppressed. In conclusion, ethyl acetate extract of A. galanga exhibited enzyme inhibitory activity against S. litura.

AB  - Hypoxia may be associated with alterations in bone remodeling, but the published results are contradictory. The aim of this study was to characterize the bone morphometry changes subject to hypoxia for a better understanding of the bone response to hypoxia and its possible clinical consequences on the bone metabolism. This study analyzed the bone morphometry parameters by micro-computed tomography (mu CT) in rat and guinea pig normobaric hypoxia models. Adult male and female Wistar rats were exposed to chronic hypoxia for 7 and 15 days. Additionally, adult male guinea pigs were exposed to chronic hypoxia for 15 days. The results showed that rats exposed to chronic constant and intermittent hypoxic conditions had a worse trabecular and cortical bone health than control rats (under a normoxic condition). Rats under chronic constant hypoxia were associated with a more deteriorated cortical tibia thickness, trabecular femur and tibia bone volume over the total volume (BV/TV), tibia trabecular number (Tb.N), and trabecular femur and tibia bone mineral density (BMD). In the case of chronic intermittent hypoxia, rats subjected to intermittent hypoxia had a lower cortical femur tissue mineral density (TMD), lower trabecular tibia BV/TV, and lower trabecular thickness (Tb.Th) of the tibia and lower tibia Tb.N. The results also showed that obese rats under a hypoxic condition had worse values for the femur and tibia BV/TV, tibia trabecular separation (Tb.Sp), femur and tibia Tb.N, and BMD for the femur and tibia than normoweight rats under a hypoxic condition. In conclusion, hypoxia and obesity may modify bone remodeling, and thus bone microarchitecture, and they might lead to reductions in the bone strength and therefore increase the risk of fragility fracture.

AB  - Simple SummaryThe use of equine chorionic gonadotrophin (eCG) in protocols for estrus synchronization in sheep is currently challenged, so it is necessary to implement alternatives (i.e., human chorionic gonadotropin; hCG), mainly during the anestrous season. Therefore, we compared the reproductive outcomes, including estrus induction, ovulatory follicle dynamics, and pregnancy outputs in anestrus Dorper sheep treated with insertion of one intravaginal progesterone-loaded CIDR + either saline, eCG, or hCG. The administration of hCG at the time of CIDR removal was effective at inducing estrus, resume ovulations, and ovarian cyclicity, yet, in a narrow window of time, it is a scenario that may limit the implementation of an artificial insemination protocol.This research aimed to evaluate whether the administration of hCG at the time of removal of a progesterone device may be effective at inducing estrus and ovulations in sheep during the natural seasonal anestrous, by comparing reproductive outputs (induction and duration of estrus, follicle development, ovulation, ovulation rate, and pregnancy rates) in ewes treated with eCG or only saline solution at the time of CIDR removal. Whereas results demonstrated no response in the control non-treated group, the largest rate of narrowly synchronized estrus signs and ovulations occurred in the eCG-group. The administration of hCG was effective at inducing estrus, promote follicular growth and a delayed yet significant ovulation (> 84%) on day 10 after CIDR removal; moreover, an increased embryonic implantation rate was also observed. Moreover, if the hCG ewes remain exposed to active males for some days, said strategy could be adopted, aiming to induce pregnancies by natural mating in a short period of time.

AB  - Grapevine (Parthenolecanium persicae (F.)) and frosted (Parthenolecanium pruinosum (Coq.)) scale insects may cause long-term physiological damage to grapevines. Although they persist in major grape-growing regions of Australia, the reproductive and population growth potential of these insect pests is poorly understood. The reproductive output of gravid adult females of grapevine and frosted scales was studied under lab and field conditions on Riesling, Chardonnay and Sauvignon Blanc cultivars of European grapevine Vitis vinifera L. The intrinsic rate of increase of grapevine and frosted scales was also studied on Riesling and Chardonnay cultivars, respectively. Gravid adult females of grapevine scale have a larger body length and body mass and higher fecundity than those of frosted scale. Egg and first instar sizes were smaller for grapevine scale than for frosted scale. Egg incubation period, post-oviposition by adult females, was affected by grapevine cultivars, being 20 days on Chardonnay and 19 days on Riesling for grapevine scale and 18 days on Chardonnay and Riesling and 22 days on Sauvignon Blanc for frosted scale. Neither fertility nor fecundity was affected by grapevine cultivar. The intrinsic rate of increase (r(m)) was 0.28 per month for grapevine scale on Riesling and 0.29 per month for frosted scale on Chardonnay. The finite rate of increase (lambda) for grapevine and frosted scales was 1.28 and 1.33 months, respectively, and the population doubling time (DT) was 2.5 and 2.40 months for grapevine and frosted scales, respectively. Based on these observations, the population of grapevine and frosted scales is likely to persist in vineyards and may rise to outbreak levels that require management.

AB  - Perinatal undernutrition sensitizes offspring to the development of chronic adult metabolic diseases, including cognitive dysfunction, which poses significant public health issues. Undernutrition is the most powerful condition of physiological stress, and epidemiological studies indicate detrimental effects on cognitive function and behavior in human offspring exposed to inadequate perinatal nutrition, leading to increased peroxidation of PUFAs in the brain. To address these issues, the present study investigated the protective effects of the antioxidant nutraceuticals astaxanthin (AsX) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) on the protective effect of DHA in the presence of antioxidants on the cognitive dysfunction and oxidative stress induced by perinatal undernutrition. Using a Wistar rat model, AsX and DHA improved learning and memory skills in perinatally undernourished offspring. The cognitive parameters included the RAM and NOR tests, and the oxidative stress parameters were assessed by the estimation of GSH, MDA, total nitrite, and TAC. This study revealed spatial learning, memory dysfunction, and abnormal exploratory behavior in offspring exposed to perinatal undernutrition at different time points in postnatal life, and these effects were ameliorated by AsX and DHA. Similarly, oxidative stress induced by perinatal undernutrition was also ameliorated by AsX and DHA. Induced oxidative stress was significantly correlated with cognitive function. This study revealed the potential of AsX and DHA supplementation during the perinatal period for the future development of cognitive dysfunction.

AB  - The Transient Receptor Potential Melastatin 8 (TRPM8) channel is a temperature-sensitive, calcium permeable ion channel and purported testosterone receptor. To determine how the hormone environment influences the expression of TRPM8 in gonadal tissue and areas of the brain important for reproduction, tissue from western white-faced cross-bred ewes, rams, and gonadectomized males (wethers; n = 6 per group) approximately 6 mo of age were collected. TRPM8 mRNA expression was greater (P = 0.01) in prostate of rams than wethers. Testes had greater (P = 0.004) expression of TRPM8 mRNA than the ovary. Differences in protein expression was similar with the testes having greater (P = 0.007) TRPM8 protein than the ovary. Protein expression did not differ (P = 0.6) in the prostate due to presence (ram) or absence (wether) of the testes. In the brain, TRPM8 varied in the amygdala with rams tending (P = 0.07) to express more mRNA which was reflected in greater (P = 0.04) number of neurons staining positive for TRPM8 in the central amygdala. Differences among ewes and wethers were not detected. This pattern was not observed (P & GE; 0.16) in the hypothalamus or olfactory bulb. To determine if TRPM8 was associated with the expression of ram sexual behavior, brains from rams categorized as high (n = 4) or low (n = 3) sexual activity were collected and blocked. Presence of TRPM8 channels was verified in the amygdala and hypothalamus of rams but was absent in the ventral tegmental area. Numbers of neurons staining positive for TRPM8 did not differ by expression of sexual behavior (P & GE; 0.2) in any area quantified. While expression of TRPM8 is more robust in tissues from intact males, expression of the channel does not appear to be important in the expression of sexual behavior.

AB  - The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of seasonal heat stress (HS) on productive performance, physiological responses, metabolism, and hematological profile of hair breed male lambs finished in feedlot. Twenty Dorper x Katahdin male lambs (body weight = 34.6 +/- 1.4 kg and age = 4.5 months) were housed in individual pens and exposed to environmental conditions of summer HS (n = 10, temperature = 28.3 +/- 4.0 degrees C and THI = 77.2 +/- 5.4 units) or winter thermoneutrality (n = 10, temperature = 19.2 +/- 2.6 degrees C and THI = 64.0 +/- 3.0 units). Each season, a 30-day feeding test was conducted to measure study variables. Compared to thermoneutral lambs, heat-stressed lambs had lower (P < 0.01) growth rate and feed efficiency without changing dry matter intake. Heat-stressed lambs presented higher (P < 0.01) rectal temperature and respiratory rate through the daytime than termoneutral lambs. On most sampling days, summer HS caused lower (P < 0.01) serum concentrations of glucose, cholesterol, total protein, urea, potassium, and thyroid hormones, but higher (P < 0.01) serum triglyceride and chlorine values. Overall serum concentrations of cortisol and insulin were unaffected by summer HS. The blood of heat-stressed lambs showed lower (P <= 0.03) erythrocyte and platelet counts, hemoglobin, and hematocrit, but higher (P <= 0.03) erythrocyte size and leucocyte count than the blood of thermoneutral lambs. In conclusion, hair breed male lambs in response to chronic conditions of summer HS had slow growth but avoided hyperthermia due to the activation of physiological, metabolic and endocrine adjustments.

AB  - Hippocampus reidi represents the most abundant species of the genus Hippocampus along the Brazilian coast. Despite being charismatic, the species is globally threatened due to habitat degradation and commercial exploration, especially in Brazil, which is the leader in exportation and consumption of the species. Through mitochondrial (cytochrome b and control region) and nuclear (1(st) intron S7) data, the current study investigates the variation and genetic structure of H. reidi along the Brazilian coast, from Par & aacute; to Santa Catarina states. The mitochondrial data indicate the presence of two lineages: (1) North/Northeast and (2) South/Southeast, which was partially recovered by nuclear data. This scenario could be related to temperature differences and circulation patterns of the Brazil and North-Brazil currents, which define these groups into biogeographic sub- provinces. The lineages occur in sympatry in Bahia state, which can be explained by the occurrence of secondary contact during the last glacial maximum. Despite presenting two lineages, for management and conservation, three units are indicated: (1) North/Northeast, (2) Bahia, and (3) South/Southeast. The North/ Northeast unit proved to be more vulnerable, presenting the lowest genetic diversity indices, representing a priority for future conservation actions.

TI  - Investigating the potential risk of cadmium exposure on seizure severity and anxiety-like behaviors through the ferroptosis pathway in epileptic mice: An integrated multi-omics approach

AB  - Cadmium, a toxic heavy metal from industrial activities, poses a neurotoxic risk, especially to children. While seizures are common in children, the link between cadmium and seizure activity is unclear. Ferroptosis, an iron dependent cell death, is key in seizure-induced hippocampal damage and related anxiety. This study aims to elucidate these mechanisms and assess the broader implications of cadmium exposure. Our research contributes in three significant areas: Firstly, through a combination of observational studies in long-term cadmium-exposed workers, Mendelian randomization analysis, NHANES analysis, urinary metabolomics, and machine learning analysis, we explored the impact of long-term cadmium exposure on inflammatory cytokines, ferroptosis-related gene expression, and lipid and iron metabolism. Secondly, by harnessing public databases for human disorders and metal-associated gene targets, alongside therapeutic molecular analyses, we identified critical human gene targets for cadmium toxicity in seizures and proposed melatonin as a promising therapeutic agent. Finally, utilizing mouse behavioral assays, T2 MRI, and MRS, we provide evidence of how prolonged cadmium exposure disrupts iron and lipid metabolism in the brain, triggering ferroptosis in the hippocampus.
