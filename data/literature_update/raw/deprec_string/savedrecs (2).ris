AB  - Islands off southern Australia once harboured three subspecies of the mainland emu (Dromaius novaehollandiae), the smaller Tasmanian emu (D. n. diemenensis) and two dwarf emus, King Island emu (D. n. minor) and Kangaroo Island emu (D. n. baudinianus), which all became extinct rapidly after discovery by human settlers. Little was recorded about their life histories and only a few historical museum specimens exist, including a number of complete eggs from Tasmania and a unique egg from Kangaroo Island. Here, we present a detailed analysis of eggs of dwarf emus, including the first record of an almost complete specimen from King Island. Our results show that despite the reduction in size of all island emus, especially the King Island emu that averaged 44% smaller than mainland birds, the egg remained similar sized in linear measurements, but less in volume and mass, and seemingly had a slightly thinner eggshell. We provide possible reasons why these phenomena occurred.

AB  - Chronic morphine impairs cued fear extinction, which may contribute to the high prevalence of anxiety disorders and the replase of opiate addiction. This work investigated the effects of forced exercise with different intensities on cued fear extinction impairment and alternations of hippocampal BDNF and apoptotic proteins induced by chronic morphine. Rats were injected with bi-daily doses of morphine or saline for ten days and then received a cued or contextual fear conditioning training, which was followed by fear extinction training for four consecutive days. Cued, but the not contextual fear response was impaired in morphine-treated rats. Then, different saline or morphine-treated rats underwent forced exercise for 4-weeks with light, moderate or high intensities. Subsequently, rats received a cued fear conditioning followed by four days of extinction training, and the expression of hippocampal BDNF and apoptotic proteins was determined. A relatively long time after the last injection of morphine (35 days), rats again showed cued fear extinction failure and reduced hippocampal BDNF, which recovered by light and moderate, but not high exercise. Light and moderate, but not high-intensity treadmill exercise enhanced the up-regulation of Bcl-2 and down-regulation of the Box proteins in both saline- and morphine-treated rats, which shifted the balance between pro-apoptotic and anti-apoptotic factors in favor of cell survival. These findings highlight the impact of exercise up to moderate intensity in the recovery of cued extinction failure, more likely via BDNF in addicted individuals.

AB  - Understanding the factors shaping species distributions is essential for predicting their responses to environmental change. The genus Hemorrhois (horseshoe whip snakes) comprises ecologically diverse colubrid snakes found across the Mediterranean Basin, North Africa, the Middle East, and Central Asia. Despite this broad range, their ecological niches and distributional dynamics remain understudied. This study employs ecological niche modeling (ENM) to assess the biogeography, niche differentiation, and potential climate-driven range shifts of H. algirus, H. hippocrepis, H. nummifer, and H. ravergieri under future climate scenarios. Using species occurrence data and bioclimatic variables, I constructed ensemble models to predict suitable habitats, evaluate niche overlap, and quantify potential range changes. Results indicate significant variation in climate-driven distributional responses among species. Hemorrhois algirus is projected to expand across North Africa, whereas H. hippocrepis, H. nummifer, and H. ravergieri may face range contractions under high-emission scenarios. Niche analyses suggest moderate overlap between H. algirus and H. hippocrepis, implying historical and ecological connectivity, while H. nummifer and H. ravergieri display distinct environmental preferences. Climatic and geographic barriers-such as the Sahara Desert, the Dardanelles and Istanbul Straits, the Alps, and the Pyrenees Mountains-play crucial roles in shaping their evolutionary trajectories. Given the increasing threats of climate change and habitat loss, this study underscores the need for conservation strategies prioritizing habitat connectivity, species-specific management, and climate refugia. By integrating ecological and evolutionary perspectives, this research contributes to understanding Mediterranean and Western Palearctic reptile biogeography and their responses to environmental change.

AB  - In mammals, olfactory communication between conspecifics is crucial in modulating reproductive function. In anestrous does (i.e. female goats), exposure to hair from sexually active bucks (SAB, i.e. male goats) triggers a luteinizing hormone response that may induce ovulation, the "male effect." However, the chemicals in buck hair responsible for this effect and the sensory pathways used by the females to detect this information remain insufficiently understood. In this study, we investigated whether sensory cells from the main olfactory epithelium (MOE) and the vomeronasal organ (VNO) of does respond differently to olfactory stimuli from SAB versus wethers (CAS, i.e. castrated bucks) and how this response is influenced by the female reproductive status (breeding season, anestrous, or ovariectomized (OVX)). To explore this possibility, we stimulated freshly dissociated cells of MOE and VNO cells with chloroform/methanol and aqueous extractions from buck hair, and we assessed cell activation using calcium imaging. Regardless of the extraction method, we observed more cells activated by SAB hair compounds than by those from CAS males. More MOE cells from anestrous were activated by both chloroform and aqueous extracts from SAB than MOE cells from breeding season, or OVX does. Most of these responses originated from non-mature olfactory neurons. These findings suggest that females can discriminate buck sexual activity through sensory detection by the MOE and VNO. The increased response in the MOE to SAB hair compounds during the anestrous period suggests that the MOE may play a more significant role in the "male effect" during this period.

AB  - Nonsessile animals could partition the use of resources in different axes, reducing the effects of competition and allowing coexistence. Here, we investigated the spatial and trophic niche dimensions in four lizard assemblages in the Neotropical semiarid Caatinga to investigate the determinants of resource use and the extent to which lizards partition their niches. We sampled each lizard assemblage once, for 10 days, in the dry season of 2017 and 2018. In two lizard assemblages, we detected nonrandom niche overlap patterns that were higher or lower than expected by chance. The high niche overlap patterns suggest that either there is intense current competition for available microhabitats or an abundance of microhabitats. The lower niche overlap may be influenced by the presence of species adapted to sandy habitats (psammophilous), suggesting that spatial partitioning detected has historical basis, which is supported by the pPCA results and by the lack of patterns in the realized niche distribution of species across niche space. We detected trophic niche partitioning in three lizard assemblages. In one assemblage, we discovered random spatial and trophic niche overlap patterns, revealing that competition is not a determining factor in the structure of that assemblage. In fact, phylogenetic effects were predominantly the main determinants of resource use in the four studied lizard assemblages. Arid and semiarid habitats cover about one third of land surface of the world. Comparisons between our findings and those from other regions of the world may aid identify general trends in the lizard ecology of dry environments.

AB  - Copy number variation (CNV) represents a significant reservoir of genetic diversity within the genome and exhibits a strong association with economically valuable traits in livestock. The manifestation of aggressive behavior in pigs has detrimental effects on production efficiency, immune competency, and meat quality. Nevertheless, the impact of CNV on the aggressive behavior of pigs remains elusive. In this investigation, we employed an integrated analysis of genome and transcriptome data to investigate the interplay between CNV, gene expression changes, and indicators of aggressive behavior in weaned pigs. Specifically, a subset of pigs comprising the most aggressive pigs (MAP, n = 12) and the least aggressive pigs (LAP, n = 11) was purposefully selected from a herd of 500 weaned pigs following a mixing procedure based on their composite aggressive score (CAS). Subsequently, we thoroughly analyzed copy number variation regions (CNVRs) across the entire genome using next-generation sequencing techniques, ultimately revealing the presence of 6869 CNVRs. Using genome-wide association study (GWAS) analysis and evaluating variance-stabilizing transformation (VST) values, we successfully identified distinct CNVRs that distinguished the MAP and LAP counterparts. Among the prioritized CNVRs, CNVR-4962 (designated as the top-ranked p-value and VST value, No. 1) was located within the Solute Carrier Organic Anion Transporter Family Member 3A1 (SLCO3A1) gene. The results of our analyses indicated a significantly higher (p < 0.05) copy number of SLCO3A1 in the MAP compared to the LAP. Furthermore, this increased copy number exhibited a positive correlation with the CAS of the pigs (p < 0.05). Furthermore, we integrated genomic data with transcriptomic data from the temporal lobe to facilitate the examination of expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL). Importantly, these observations were consistent with the mRNA expression pattern of SLCO3A1 in the temporal lobe of both MAP and LAP (p < 0.05). Consequently, our findings strongly suggest that CNVs affecting SLCO3A1 may influence gene expression through a dosage effect. These results highlight the potential of SLCO3A1 as a candidate gene associated with aggressive traits in pig breeding programs.

AB  - Zooplankton play a key role in marine food webs, transferring energy from the base of the food web to higher trophic levels. In the Arctic, warming is altering nutrient availability and primary productivity, which could alter zooplankton-mediated transfer of energy through food webs. The Barents Sea Opening is warming rapidly, and has a strong influence on the Arctic as it is a prominent gateway for North Atlantic water advected into the polar region. Trophic position (TP) is an important metric because it identifies the location of an organism within a food web and therefore provides insight on food web functioning. Using nitrogen isotopes of amino acids in copepods, we investigated how the food web baseline and TP of the keystone Calanus species change in response to environmental gradients along the Barents Sea Opening in summer between 2010 and 2016. Spatial and interannual variation in net primary production and the North Atlantic Oscillation index both strongly influenced the nitrogen isotope baseline. We demonstrate that protistan microzooplankton play a key role in the diets of Calanus spp., accounting for 1-2 TP steps determined using alanine (TPAla) and that this varied spatially and interannually; however, the TP of Calanus spp. determined using glutamic acid (TPGlu = 2.2 +/- 0.2) indicated consistent herbivorous feeding. Flexibility in the diet of Calanus spp. under differing environmental conditions suggests that Calanus spp. may be able to adapt to changing food availability created by environmental instability driven by climate change.

AB  - A high embryo loss rate has been reported in llamas. As strategies that lead to an increase in plasma progesterone (P4) concentration might improve fertility, the aim of the present study was to evaluate if the administration of hCG on Day 7 post-mating is useful to develop an accessory corpus luteum (CL), increasing plasma P4 concentration. Twenty (n = 20) female llamas, ranging between 5 and 10 years of age and four (n = 4) males of proven fertility, ranging between 8 and 10 years of age were included in the study. Accessory CL developed in all treated llamas after hCG administration and plasma P4 concentration was significantly greater in treated than in control females (P`0.0001). The diameter and vascularization of the original CL were not affected by treatment in pregnant llamas. However, in treated non-pregnant llamas, corpus luteum diameter was greater than in the control group from Day 14 postmating until the end of the study (P`0.001). In treated llamas, the accessory CL was detected throughout the study in pregnant and non-pregnant females, but its vascularization started to decrease around Day 16 post-mating in non-pregnant animals (P`0.05). In conclusion, hCG treatment on Day 7 post mating was useful to induce an accessory CL and increase plasma P4 concentration in llamas. Thus, this treatment could be considered as a useful strategy to improve pregnancy rates in llama herds. (c) 2021 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Trained immunity has been described as the memory capacity of the innate immune system. Several microbial components have been shown to induce trained immunity. Research on the potential of probiotics to trigger these effects has been limited to a few in vitro studies but remains completely unknown in vivo. Components from the probiotic Debaryomyces hansenii CBS 8339 (Dh) have been shown to induce innate immune memory in goat kids and calves. In the present study, stimulating innate immune cells from newborn goats with probiotic Dh increased respiratory burst activity and nitric oxide production, while cell phagocytosis was unaffected. Glucose uptake was enhanced in goat's cells stimulated with Dh, but lactate production was decreased. In newborn goats, after the training scheme (via oral probiotic administration), cell phagocytosis, nitric oxide production and glycolysis - through the upregulation of AKT and HIF1A gene expression, glucose consumption and lactate production- were enhanced. The expression of IL1B gene was similar between the D. hansenii and control groups. Moreover, the potential long-lasting effects were assessed 30 days after initiation of the training scheme. Cell phagocytosis, respiratory burst and myeloperoxidase activity were enhanced, while glycolytic parameters remained unaffected. Altogether, the results of the present study suggest that the immune training scheme may induce trained immunity by the probiotic D. hansenii in newborn goats. However, our findings were not conclusive regarding the long-lasting (one-month) effects of trained immunity by probiotics.

AB  - Aim The Amazon-Orinoco plume is the major biogeographical barrier between the Great Caribbean and the Brazilian Province. No study has so far addressed the influence of this barrier in a broad chrono-phylogenetic context. Here, we evaluate the effects of the Amazon-Orinoco plume barrier on the patterns of diversification of Western Atlantic reef fishes through time. Location Tropical Western Atlantic. Taxon Reef Fishes (Percomorpha). Methods We compiled DNA sequence data of 21 molecular markers from sister species/population pairs across 33 reef-fish families in the Greater Caribbean biogeographical region and the Brazilian Province. The data included estimated divergence times between sister-pairs based on previously published phylogenies and 94 newly proposed time-trees. Divergence dates were compared with variations in the sedimentation discharge rate of the Amazon River and sea-level fluctuations. To address the hypothesis that fishes with different adult sizes are affected differently by the Amazon-Orinoco plume, we used a phylogenetic least squares regression to test the relationship between maximum total body length and divergence times between the Caribbean and Brazilian sister-pairs. Results We identified an increase in the rates of lineage diversification between sister-pairs of the Greater Caribbean and Brazilian Province reef fishes in the past 2.4 million years, in accordance with the period of higher sedimentation rates of the Amazon River and the more frequent sea-level fluctuations in the Pleistocene. A strong relationship between total body length and effectiveness of the barrier through time was confirmed, with smaller species typically diverging earlier in periods when sedimentation rates of the Amazon River were significantly lower. Conclusions The strong biogeographical signal detected in this study across different lineages of reef fishes clearly indicates that the Amazon-Orinoco plume played a significant role in the diversification of the Atlantic reef-fish fauna. The temporal pattern of diversifications indicates a correlation between the permeability of the plume, sea-level fluctuations, variability in the volume of the discharge and fish body size, with the barrier's influence being weaker on larger fishes.

AB  - Livestock protection measures are necessary to protect livestock from wolf attacks but are highly controversial in the agricultural community. This qualitative study referred to the theory of planned behavior to explore the social elements that influence farmers' intention to use or reject livestock protection measures. Data were collected from 45 sheep farmers on 4 alpine pastures in the Alpine province of Bolzano, Italy, using semistructured interviews. Results show, first, a predominantly negative attitude toward livestock protection measures because of perceived technical constraints, excessive workload, and emotional stress. Second, family, friends, and other sheep farmers were the most important referent groups and could trigger social stress to support or hinder the use of protection measures. Third, perceived behavioral control was constrained by a lack of professional advice in the province regarding protection measures and a lack of funding for additional costs involved. Intentions to use these measures in the future were equally positive and negative, with the sheer inevitability of needing protection measures to allow continued grazing cited as the primary motivator. These findings underline the importance of considering social factors in management plans and conflict mitigation actions and serve as a basis for further, more detailed studies.

AB  - Biomass and pig manure have distinct compositions and the co-pyrolysis of them has gained much attention. However, the influence of volatiles interaction on the properties of the char was still unclear. In this study, lignin was selected as the model component of biomass with pig manure for co-pyrolysis at 600 degrees C. The results indicate that volatiles from co-pyrolysis promoted re-condensation reaction, resulting in the higher char yield (48.0% in co-pyrolysis versus 31.0% in pyrolysis of single manure) and the formation of more aromatics in bio-oil. The co-pyrolysis also facilitated the dehydrogenation and dehydration reactions, which accounted for the elimination of oxygen and nitrogen contents and thus a higher carbon content (64.7% in the co-pyrolysis versus the averaged value of 46.4% from the pyrolysis of single feedstock), higher crystallinity and thermal stability of the char. The in-situ diffuse reflection infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy (DRIFTS) characterization results demonstrated that the functionalities abundances of char with temperature was influenced by volatiles interaction via accelerating the carbonization reaction. In addition, the high heating value (HHV) of char was obviously improved by cross-interaction of volatiles during co-pyrolysis (24.4 MJ/Kg in co-pyrolysis versus averaged value of 15.1 MJ/Kg from single pyrolysis), implying that the co-pyrolysis enhanced the energy density of the resulting char.

AB  - A multidisciplinary approach considers integral control and favors biological control measures, whereby it is crucial to conduct a comprehensive examination of the existence of potential candidates to prevent the spread and destroy generative propagation of insects, in particular the invasive ones. Such an integral approach makes it possible to create conditions required for restoration and protection of stocks of seeds and forest cultures, as well as seed stocks for human consumption. This would ensure the future use of species whose seeds are kept for restoration of rare species, and most importantly, for keeping stocks with enormous economic and social importance. This paper provides an overview of occurrence and use of potentially harmful Bruchinae insect, honey locust seed beetle, the use of which in practice would be compliant with the principles of sustainable development, given the proven competition with bean weevil. The researched Bruchinae species Megabruchidius tonkineus (Pic, 1904) has recently been proven not to be monophagous in Serbia, and to attack and infest bean seeds in addition to Kentucky coffee tree seeds. During a three-year research (in the period 2019 - 2021), analyses were conducted on data from statistically important samples from 3 localities across the county (3 experimental host plants per locality). The second Bruchinae beetle is the best-known bean pest Acanthoscelides obtectus Say. The two noted seed predators were over this period subjected to various laboratory examinations in order to collect data on their general impact on one another. Such a combination or community may form the key for adoption of the host to the pests, modifying the plants themselves phenotypically, genetically and chemically, and in turn the probability of attack by a known seed predator.

AB  - Although it is time consuming, performing direct observations of the feeding choices of grazing herbivores remains the reference method because it does not require any destructive vegetation sampling and limits bias associated with the use of indirect markers. It is also the only method for characterizing the use of vegetation patches. These observations are usually performed during the diurnal period only; however, equids graze 16 h per day on average, with 20-50% of their grazing occurring during the nocturnal period. The objective of this paper was to test the representativeness of diurnal observations of horses' feeding choices to characterize their daily diet. We used an experimental dataset of 54 paired observations of the diurnal and daily (24-h period) diet composition in horses grazing a pasture with differing sward characteristics according to the stocking rate and season. Four classes of bites were considered based on the sward height and vegetation stage, which are key factors affecting selection by horses. The H0 indicated that the 24-h observations of horses' feeding choices among the four bite types could be correctly predicted by diurnal observations. Using a chi-square test of adequacy to a multinomial distribution, we expected the set of variables to follow a chi-square distribution, with k-1 (k = four bite types) degrees of freedom, under H0. We first used a Kolmogorov-Smirnov test, which showed adequate observed values relative to the expected distribution (p = 0.67). Then, a Bayesian approach was used to estimate the chi-square distribution with parameter upsilon that best fit our data, and we found that the probability that H0 was true, which was defined as p (upsilon <= 3), was equal to p = 0.92. An analysis of the chi-square residuals did not reveal any bias in the prediction of the different bite types. Finally, the Bray-Curtis similarity indexes used to characterize prediction quality were very high (i.e., > 90%) regardless of the stocking rate and season. All these results indicate a high level of confidence in the hypothesis that the effects of sward structure on the daily diet composition of grazing horses can be predicted by diurnal observations. This methodological advance will help increase the number of observation days and animals in future studies and accurately define the number of factors that can be tested simultaneously.

AB  - Maize double-cropping production systems in Mediterranean areas have a great nitrogen extraction capacity and high nitrogen (N) requirements. This study aims to assess whether in these farming systems, animal manure can be applied, using adequate management practices, at levels exceeding the maximum annual amount of livestock manure established in the European Nitrate Directive for vulnerable zones (170 kg N ha-1) without increasing the risk of water nitrate contamination. We compare the risk of nitrate leaching under two fertilisation strategies, one with synthetic fertilisers and the second with a maximised application of pig slurry, exceeding the limits of the EU Nitrate Directive, in two soil types. Crop yields, N extraction and nitrate concentrations below the crop root zone were not affected by the fertilisation strategies at each site. The results show that pig slurry can be applied above the limit of 170 kg N ha-1 under the conditions of the study, up to 360 kg N ha-1, without increasing the risk for nitrate leaching.

AB  - Copy number variations (CNVs) critically influence individual genetic diversity and phenotypic traits. In this study, we employed whole-genome resequencing technology to conduct an in-depth analysis of 50 pigs from five local swine populations [Rongchang pig (RC), Wuzhishan pig (WZS), Tibetan pig (T), Yorkshire (YL) and Landrace (LR)], aiming to assess their genetic potential and explore their prospects in the field of animal model applications. We identified a total of 96,466 CNVs, which were subsequently integrated into 7112 non-redundant CNVRs, encompassing 1.3% of the swine genome. Functional enrichment analysis of the genes within these CNVRs revealed significant associations with sensory perception, energy metabolism, and neural-related pathways. Further selective scan analyses of the local pig breeds RC, T, WZS, along with YL and LR, uncovered that for the RC variety, the genes PLA2G10 and ABCA8 were found to be closely related to fat metabolism and cardiovascular health. In the T breed, the genes NCF2 and CSGALNACT1 were associated with immune response and connective tissue characteristics. As for the WZS breed, the genes PLIN4 and CPB2 were primarily linked to fat storage and anti-inflammatory responses. In summary, this research underscores the pivotal role of CNVs in fostering the diversity and adaptive evolution of pig breeds while also offering valuable insights for further exploration of the advantageous genetic traits inherent to China's local pig breeds. This facilitates the creation of experimental animal models tailored to the specific characteristics of these breeds, contributing to the advancement of livestock and biomedical research.

AB  - The population development of Asian elephants (Elephas maximus) has been greatly affected by the intensification of human activities. In this study, development of the Asian elephant population under the influence of human disturbance was analyzed logically, with expansion of the rubber forest area as the main influencing factor. The ecological-economic model of Asian elephant population development was constructed using the logical analysis method, the population growth model and the integrated environmental-economic control model. The results are as follows: (1) Theoretically, the ecological-economic model could be applied to the analysis of wildlife conservation and regulation and management policies; (2) The data show that in 2016, the intrinsic growth rate of Asian elephants in Xishuangbanna was 0.0216 head/day, which has a strong proliferation capacity, meaning the population will continue to grow under natural conditions. However, at present, the population development of Asian elephants has been negatively affected by human interference, which has reduced the population growth rate of Asian elephants to 0.0193 head/day, and this impact has a tendency to intensify; (3) From 2004 to 2016, the investment rate of Asian elephants increased by 0.182, while the anti-interference protection rate of Asian elephants decreased by 0.227. The overall development trend of Asian elephants was from equilibrium point one (golden age) to equilibrium point two (dark age).

AB  - Natural resource governance challenges are often highly complex, particularly in Indigenous contexts. These challenges involve numerous landscape-level interactions, spanning jurisdictional, disciplinary, social, and ecological boundaries. In Eeyou Istchee, the James Bay Cree Territory of northern Quebec, Canada, traditional livelihoods depend on wild food species like moose. However, these species are increasingly being impacted by forestry and other resource development projects. The complex relationships between moose, resource development, and Cree livelihoods can limit shared understandings and the ability of diverse actors to respond to these pressures. Contributing to this complexity are the different knowledge systems held by governance actors who, while not always aligned, have broadly shared species conservation and sustainable development goals. This paper presents fuzzy cognitive mapping (FCM) as a methodological approach used to help elicit and interpret the knowledge of land-users concerning the impacts of forest management on moose habitat in Eeyou Istchee. We explore the difficulties of weaving this knowledge together with the results of moose GPS collar analysis and the knowledges of scientists and government agencies. The ways in which participatory, relational mapping approaches can be applied in practice, and what they offer to pluralistic natural resource governance research more widely, are then addressed.

AB  - The carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) mineralisation rates of five digestates were studied and compared with pig slurry, compost, and a solid fraction of digestate in aerobic incubation experiments. The objective was to identify the most relevant drivers of C and N mineralisation based on the physicochemical properties of the products. Net organic nitrogen mineralisation of digestates (N-min,N-net) was on average 30%, although the range was relatively wide, with digestate from pig manure (39%) reaching double the value of digestate from sewage sludge (21%). The total carbon to total nitrogen (TC:TN) (r = -0.83, p < 0.05) and ammonium nitrogen to total nitrogen (NH4+-N:TN) (r = 0.83, p < 0.05) ratios of the products were strongly correlated with N-min,N-net, adequately mirroring the expected fertilising potential of the products. The digestates had C sequestration values between 50 and 81% of applied total organic carbon (TOC), showcasing their potential to contribute to C build-up in agricultural soils. The carbon use efficiency of the amended soils was negatively correlated with dissolved organic carbon (DOC) (r = -0.75, p < 0.05) suggesting that catabolic activities were promoted proportionately to the DOC present in these products. Ratios of DOC:TOC (r = -0.88, p < 0.01) and TC:TN (r = 0.92, p < 0.01) were reliable predictors of the fraction of C that would remain one year after its incorporation and thus could be used as simple quality parameters to denote the C sequestration potential of digestates prior to their use in the field.

AB  - Background: Molybdenum (Mo) is an essential trace element for animals, but too much intake can cause adverse effects. Due to the metabolic characteristics of goats and other ruminants, they are more susceptible to the cumulative effects of Mo toxicity. A high Mo intake can cause multi-organ toxicity in ruminants, but the mechanism of damage to the pancreas is still unclear. The aim of this study was to systematically analyze the key regulatory pathways of pancreatic injury induced by Mo in goats using a metabolomics approach. Methods: Twenty male Yudong Black goats (22.34 +/- 1.87 kg, six months) were randomly divided into a control group (fed a basal diet) and the Mo group (fed a basal diet supplemented with 50 mg<middle dot>kg-1 Na2MoO4<middle dot>2H2O). After 60 days of continuous feeding, their pancreatic tissues were collected and the mineral elements, antioxidant capacity, and inflammatory factors were examined. Untargeted metabolomics based on HILIC UHPLC-Q-EXACTIVE MS was used to analyze changes in metabolites. The core regulatory mechanisms were revealed by KEGG enrichment analysis. Results: The results demonstrated that goats in the Mo group showed obvious clinical signs, such as lethargy, loss of appetite, and unsteady gait. The pancreatic tissue of goats in the Mo group exhibited significantly elevated levels of Mo and copper, accompanied by a marked reduction in antioxidant capacity and concurrent increases in inflammatory cytokine levels. Between the Mo group and control group, 167 differentially expressed metabolites were identified. KEGG enrichment analysis showed that it disrupted multiple metabolic pathways, including glycine, serine, and threonine metabolism, cysteine and methionine metabolism, and butanoate metabolism. Conclusions: This study mainly revealed, at the metabolomics level, that Mo exposure would disrupt the metabolic pathways related to antioxidant capacity in goat pancreata. It provides new insights into the molecular mechanisms of Mo-induced pancreatic injury in goats.

AB  - Simple Summary This study addresses the analysis of the morphometric differences based on quantitative traits in the different historical genetic lines of the Spanish Merino sheep breed. The results show the existence of significative differences both in the measurements taken and in the indexes calculated between the different genetic lines. This result could indicate how different genetic lines within the autochthonous Merino breed have developed due to the chosen management models and the adaptation to the specific ecosystems in which the sheep have been bred in pure, closed conditions for centuries, which have been maintained to the present day. Our study complements a previous genomic approach, in which the different historical lines of the breed were characterized, showing the genuine genetic pool of the Spanish Merino, the origin of all the Merino and Merino derived breeds in the world. The Merino breed, which originates from Spain, is the most emblematic livestock breed in the world, since it is the first with a worldwide extension and has had an important impact on the genetic origin of several of the main current sheep populations. For this reason, it is of vital importance to typify the historical genetic lines of the original Spanish Merino breed and thereby ensure the conservation of its variability. In the present study, we used 337 purebred animals (males and females) registered in the Genealogical Book of the Native Merino Breed. All the animals were descendants of herds from six ancestral genetic lines (Maesso, Egea, Granda, Lopez-Montenegro, Hidalgo, and Donoso). Significant differences were found in all the morphometric traits and indexes between the different genetic lines. Using discriminant analysis, 84% of the animals were classified correctly into their historical genetic lines. Furthermore, the distances between the lines, calculated by a cluster test, showed that Hidalgo, Maesso, and Donoso had the most clearly defined lines, while the Granda, Lopez-Montenegro, and Egea lines were more similar to each other. All this demonstrates the rich genetic variability existing in the genuine gene pool of the Merino sheep breed.

AB  - Simple Summary The genetic diversity and phylogenetic relationships among wild boars in major regions of the world were assessed using genome-wide data from the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau (QTP), southern and northern regions of China, Europe, Northeast Asia, and Southeast Asia. We clarified the close phylogenetic relationship of QTP wild boars with those in southern China. In addition, genome-wide selection signal analysis based on cross-population extended haplotype homozygosity, fixation index parameters, and run of homozygosity island recognition technology was performed to obtain a series of candidate genes related to the plateau adaptability of wild boar, such as TSC2, TELO2, VCP, SLC5A1, and SLC5A4. In particular, SLC5A1 and SLC5A4 are involved in glucose homeostasis and may be the key to the plateau adaptability of wild boars. This study enhances our understanding of the genetic mechanism of high-altitude adaptation in wild boars.Abstract The Qinghai-Tibet Plateau (QTP) wild boar is an excellent model for investigating high-altitude adaptation. In this study, we analyzed genome-wide data from 93 wild boars compiled from various studies worldwide, including the QTP, southern and northern regions of China, Europe, Northeast Asia, and Southeast Asia, to explore their phylogenetic patterns and high-altitude adaptation based on genome-wide selection signal analysis and run of homozygosity (ROH) estimation. The findings demonstrate the alignment between the phylogenetic associations among wild boars and their geographical location. An ADMIXTURE analysis indicated a relatively close genetic relationship between QTP and southern Chinese wild boars. Analyses of the fixation index and cross-population extended haplotype homozygosity between populations revealed 295 candidate genes (CDGs) associated with high-altitude adaptation, such as TSC2, TELO2, SLC5A1, and SLC5A4. These CDGs were significantly overrepresented in pathways such as the mammalian target of rapamycin signaling and Fanconi anemia pathways. In addition, 39 ROH islands and numerous selective CDGs (e.g., SLC5A1, SLC5A4, and VCP), which are implicated in glucose metabolism and mitochondrial function, were discovered in QTP wild boars. This study not only assessed the phylogenetic history of QTP wild boars but also advanced our comprehension of the genetic mechanisms underlying the adaptation of wild boars to high altitudes.

AB  - Wild pig (Sus scrofa Linnaeus, 1758) social behaviour affects disease transmission and landscape-level population management. Recent research has incorporated analysis of social structure to better understand the risk of disease transmission in wild pigs, although the relationship between overall social structure of wild pigs remains unclear. Here, we seek to improve understanding of the spatial and temporal dynamics of wild pig social structure and contact rates to better inform management strategies. Using GPS tracking data, we measured home range overlap, and estimated contact rates of wild pigs at four study sites in the southern USA to identify pairwise social associations (i.e., contacts) based on synchronous movement. Contact rate was strongly associated with home range overlap, but exhibited substantial variation, especially at moderate levels of home range overlap. We found that female-female dyads had higher contact rates and longer duration phases of social association compared to female-male and male-male dyads. We found male-male dyads tended to experience social associations farther from their home range centers than female-female or female-male dyads. Social associations between wild pig dyads are highly dynamic in their spatial and temporal structure. Further, dyads with strong social associations still experience substantial time apart. Our findings highlight the challenges of predicting spatial and social associations in wild pig social pairs due to their dynamic social structure over space and time.

AB  - Giant clams (Tridacna and Hippopus) are large marine bivalves occupying tropical and subtropical reefs in the Indo-Pacific. Giant clam populations have declined in many areas of the Indo-Pacific and continue to be threatened by harvesting and environmental change. The small giant clam (Tridacna maxima) occurs throughout the Indo-Pacific and has been subject to several phylogeographic studies across its range. However, given its broad range, there are several areas where the genetic diversity and connectivity of T. maxima populations has not been characterised. Here, we analyse the mitochondrial marker cytochrome oxidase 1 (CO1) to examine the genetic diversity and connectivity of T. maxima in two regions: Australia's Coral Sea Marine Park and the Cook Islands. Samples were collected from 13 reefs within the Coral Sea Marine Park and ten islands within the Cook Islands archipelago. Tridacna maxima across the sampled region of the Coral Sea did not display any population structure, whereas significant population structure was detected for T. maxima within the Cook Islands. For the Cook Islands, most pairwise comparisons involving an island in the northern group (Manihiki) were significant, as were comparisons for Palmerston (a more centrally located island) and the southern islands, Rarotonga and Mangaia. Both regions displayed high haplotype diversities (> 0.90), indicating that they are important repositories of genetic diversity. Additional CO1 data from throughout T. maxima's distribution showed that the Coral Sea clams belonged to the clade occurring in the South-Western Pacific Ocean, whilst those from the Cook Islands belonged to a unique clade found in the Central Pacific Ocean. This clade extended from Fiji in the west to French Polynesia in the east and the atolls of Palmyra and Tarawa (Kiribati) in the north. Our assessment of genetic diversity and population structure in these regions will assist with management decisions for the species.

AB  - Camels have been essential to human survival and development across the arid Central Asian steppes, particularly in Kazakhstan, where the breeding of one-humped and two-humped camels is a longstanding tradition supporting the nomadic lifestyle. This study aimed to assess the genetic diversity and population structure of these camels across their distribution range in Kazakhstan. Blood samples from 100 individuals were collected from five locations, Almaty (ALA), Atyrau (ATR), Shymkent (SHK), Kyzylorda (KZL), and Taraz (TRZ), and genotyped using 17 microsatellite markers. All loci were polymorphic, with a mean observed heterozygosity of 0.707 in C. dromedarius and 0.643 in C. bactrianus. The highest expected heterozygosity (He = 0.939) was observed at VOLP67 in C. bactrianus and at VOLP03 in C. dromedarius. Genetic differentiation was low (FST = 0.021), indicating a weak population structure between the two species with substantial gene flow (Nm = 19.972). The hybrid analysis identified 31% hybrids, including F1, F2, and backcrosses, with the highest frequencies in KZL and TRZ, moderate frequencies in ATR, and lowest frequencies in SHK and ALA. These patterns, consistent with STRUCTURE clustering, reflect widespread but regionally variable hybridization. The phylogenetic analysis revealed three clades, separating Bactrian camels (ALA), dromedaries (SHK), and a hybrid group (ATR, KZL, and TRZ). These findings enhance our understanding of the genetic diversity of Kazakhstan's camels and support effective conservation, breeding strategies, and genotyping applications in camel husbandry.

AB  - The study assessed the adaptive ability of two Indian goat breeds, Barbari (n = 10) and Sirohi (n = 10), to different seasons in their natural habitat. Hematological, physiological, biochemical and electrolyte variations were compared across winter and summer. Physiological responses such as respiration rate, pulse rate, rectal temperature, and skin temperature increased significantly (p < 0.01), while hematological responses decreased significantly (p < 0.01) during the summer . Blood urea nitrogen levels were higher , while blood glucose concentrations were lower during the summer. Among the estimated blood electrolytes, decreased sodium (Na+) and chloride (Cl-) ions were observed during the winter, while lower concentrations of potassium (K+) ions were noted in the summer. The Sirohi breed showed reduced levels of variation in the responses observed during the experiment. The study concluded that the Sirohi breed's superior resilience in semi-arid climates, with smaller response variations compared to the Barbari breed is due to their adaptive ability across different seasons.

AB  - Self-supervised learning guided by masked image modeling, such as masked autoencoder (MAE), has attracted wide attention for pretraining vision transformers in remote sensing. However, MAE tends to excessively focus on pixel details, limiting the model's capacity for semantic understanding, particularly for noisy synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images. In this article, we explore spectral and spatial remote sensing image features as improved MAE-reconstruction targets. We first conduct a study on reconstructing various image features, all performing comparably well or better than raw pixels. Based on such observations, we propose feature guided MAE (FG-MAE): reconstructing a combination of histograms of oriented gradients (HOG) and normalized difference indices (NDI) for multispectral images, and reconstructing HOG for SAR images. Experimental results on three downstream tasks illustrate the effectiveness of FG-MAE with a particular boost for SAR imagery (e.g., up to 5% better than MAE on EuroSAT-SAR). Furthermore, we demonstrate the well-inherited scalability of FG-MAE and release a first series of pretrained vision transformers for medium-resolution SAR and multispectral images.

AB  - Background Protease inhibitors are defense proteins widely distributed in the plant kingdom. By reducing the activity of digestive enzymes in insect guts, they reduce the availability of nutrients and thus impair the growth and development of the attacking herbivore. One well-characterized class of protease inhibitors are Kunitz-type trypsin inhibitors (KTIs), which have been described in various plant species, including Populus spp. Long-lived woody perennials like poplar trees encounter a huge diversity of herbivores, but the specificity of tree defenses towards different herbivore species is hardly studied. We therefore aimed to investigate the induction of KTIs in black poplar (P. nigra) leaves upon herbivory by three different chewing herbivores, Lymantria dispar and Amata mogadorensis caterpillars, and Phratora vulgatissima beetles. Results We identified and generated full-length cDNA sequences of 17 KTIs that are upregulated upon herbivory in black poplar leaves, and analyzed the expression patterns of the eight most up-regulated KTIs via qRT-PCR. We found that beetles elicited higher transcriptional induction of KTIs than caterpillars, and that both caterpillar species induced similar KTI expression levels. Furthermore, KTI expression strongly correlated with the trypsin-inhibiting activity in the herbivore-damaged leaves, but was not dependent on damage severity, i.e. leaf area loss, for most of the genes. Conclusions We conclude that the induction of KTIs in black poplar is controlled at the transcriptional level in a threshold-based manner and is strongly influenced by the species identity of the herbivore. However, the underlying molecular mechanisms and ecological consequences of these patterns remain to be investigated.

AB  - To reverse range-wide population declines, managers of black-tailed and mule deer (Odocoileus hemionus) require information on the vital rates and life stages most influential to population growth to target effective management actions. We extracted black-tailed and mule deer vital rates from a range-wide literature review and used hierarchical models to summarize vital rates, their variability, and how they correlate with one another. We then used matrix models and life-stage simulation analysis to determine the individual vital rates that contributed most to annual population growth rate (i.e., lambda). Annual adult female survival explained the greatest amount of variation (62%) in lambda. Annual juvenile survival explained 44% of the variation in lambda, whereas summer or winter juvenile survival by themselves were far less informative. Winter fawn:doe ratios, a metric often collected by management agencies, explained only 10% of the variation in lambda. Given an adult female survival of 0.84, our simulations estimated a lambda of 1.0 (95% credible interval = 0.88-1.14), indicating equal probability that a population would increase or decrease. Simulations further indicated that given adult survival rates <70%, the population would always decline, but as survival increased lambda increased linearly. In contrast, estimates of lambda plateaued when annual juvenile survival reached approximately 0.5, indicating higher survival rates yielded diminishing returns to population stability. Using simulated values within the observed range of vital rate values across the species' geographical distribution, the mean lambda was 0.975 and in 61% of the simulations, lambda was <1. After 20 years, we estimated that this distribution of lambda values would cause populations to decrease in 92% of instances with a mean decrease of 44%. Our results align with observed declines in mule deer populations throughout their range over recent decades and indicate that these trends will continue until management can improve survival of adult females.

AB  - Intraspecific aggression, or agonism, is a widespread intrasexual selective behavior important to understanding animal behavioral ecology and reproductive systems. Such behavior can be studied either by direct observation or inferred from wound/scar frequency in extant species but is difficult to document in extinct taxa, limiting understanding of its evolution. Among extant archosaurs, crocodylians display extensive intrasexual aggression, whereas birds show extreme visual/vocal intersexual display. The evolutionary origin of this behavioral divergence, and pattern in non-avian dinosaurs, is unknown. Here we document the morphology, frequency, and ontogeny of intraspecific facial bite lesions (324 lesions) in a large sample of tyrannosaurids (202 specimens, 528 elements) to infer patterns of intraspecific aggression in non-avian theropods. Facial scars are consistent in position and orientation across tyrannosaurid species, suggesting bites were inflicted due to repeated/postured behavior. Facial scars are absent in young tyrannosaurids, first appear in immature animals (similar to 50% adult skull length), are present in similar to 60% of the adult-sized specimens, and show aggressor:victim size isometry. The ontogenetic distribution of bite scars suggests agonistic behavior is associated with the onset of sexual maturity, and scar presence in approximately half the specimens may relate to a sexual pattern. Considered in a phylogenetic context, intraspecific bite marks are consistent and widely distributed in fossil and extant crocodyliforms and non-maniraptoriform theropods, suggesting a potential plesiomorphic behavior in archosaurs. Their absence in maniraptoriform theropods, including birds, may reflect a transition from honey cranial ornamentation and crocodylian-like intrasexual aggression to avian-like intersexual display with the evolution of pennaceous feathers.

AB  - Phenological shifts have the potential to change species interactions, but relatively few studies have used experimental manipulations to examine the effects of variation in timing of an interspecific interaction across a series of life stages of a species. Although previous experimental studies have examined the consequences of phenological timing in plant-herbivore interactions for both plants and their herbivores, less is known about their effects on subsequent plant reproduction. Here, we conducted an experiment to determine how shifts in the phenological timing of monarch (Danaus plexippus) larval herbivory affected milkweed (Asclepias fascicularis) host plant performance, including effects on growth and subsequent effects on flower and seed pod phenology and production. We found that variation in the timing of herbivory affected both plant growth and reproduction, with measurable effects several weeks to several months after herbivory ended. The timing of herbivory had qualitatively different effects on vegetative and reproductive biomass: early-season herbivory had the strongest effects on plant size, whereas late-season herbivory had the strongest effects on the production of viable seeds. These results show that phenological shifts in herbivory can have persistent and qualitatively different effects on different life stages across the season.

AB  - Synaptic scaffold proteins (e.g., liprin-alpha, ELKS, RIM, and RIM-BP) orchestrate ion channels, receptors, and enzymes at presynaptic terminals to form active zones for neurotransmitter release. The underlying mechanism of the active zone assembly remains elusive. Here, we report that liprin-alpha proteins have the potential to oligomerize through the N-terminal coiled-coil region. Our structural and biochemical characterizations reveal that a gain-of-function mutation promotes the self-assembly of the coiled coils in liprin-alpha 2 by disrupting intramolecular interactions and promoting intermolecular interactions. By enabling multivalent interactions with ELKS proteins, the oligomerized coiled-coil region of liprin-alpha 2 enhances the phase separation of the ELKS N-terminal segment. We further show that liprin-alpha 2, by regulating the interplay between two phase separations of ELKS and RIM/RIM-BP, controls the protein distributions. These results imply that the complicated protein-protein interactions allow liprin-alpha to function with the active zone scaffolds and compartmentalize protein assemblies to achieve comprehensive functions in the active zone.

AB  - Different anatomical locations of the body skin show differences in their gene expression patterns depending on different origins, and the inherent heterogeneous information can be maintained in adults. However, highly resolvable cellular specialization is less well characterized in different anatomical regions of the skin. Pig is regarded as an excellent model animal for human skin research in view of its similar physiology to human. In this study, single-cell RNA sequencing was performed on pig skin tissues from six different anatomical regions of Chenghua (CH) pigs, with a superior skin thickness trait, and the back site of large white (LW) pigs. We obtained 233,715 cells, representing seven cell types, among which we primarily characterized the heterogeneity of the top three cell types, including smooth muscle cells (SMCs), endothelial cells (ECs), and fibroblasts (FBs). Then, we further identified several subtypes of SMCs, ECs, and FBs, and discovered the expression patterns of site-specific genes involved in some important pathways such as the immune response and extracellular matrix (ECM) synthesis in different anatomical regions. By comparing differentially expressed genes of skin FBs among different anatomical regions, we considered TNN, COL11A1, and INHBA as candidate genes for facilitating ECM accumulation. These findings of heterogeneity in the main skin cell types from different anatomical sites will contribute to a better understanding of inherent skin information and place the potential focus on skin generation, transmission, and transplantation, paving the foundation for human skin priming.

AB  - Tree diseases affecting Camellia japonica have emerged as a significant threat to the health and longevity of this ornamental tree, particularly in countries where this tree species is widely distributed and cultivated. Among these, Pestalotiopsis spp. have been frequently reported and are considered one of the most impactful fungal pathogens, causing leaf blight or leaf spot, in multiple countries. Understanding the etiology and distribution of these diseases is essential for effective management and conservation of C. japonica populations. The traditional methods based on pathogen isolation and pure culture cultivation for diagnosis of tree diseases are labor intensive and time-consuming. In addition, the frequent coexistence of the major pathogens with other endophytes within a single C. japonica tree, coupled with inconsistent symptom expression and the occurrence of pathogens in asymptomatic hosts, further complicates disease diagnosis. These challenges highlight the urgent need to develop more rapid, accurate, and efficient diagnostic or monitoring tools to improve disease monitoring and management on trees, including C. japonica. To address these challenges, we applied a metagenomic approach to screen fungal communities within C. japonica trees. This method enabled comprehensive detection and characterization of fungal taxa present in symptomatic and asymptomatic tissues. By analyzing the correlation between fungal dominance and symptom expression, we identified key pathogenic taxa associated with disease manifestation. To validate the metagenomic approach, we employed a combined strategy integrating metagenomic screening and traditional fungal isolation to monitor foliar diseases in C. japonica. The correlation between dominant taxa and symptom expression was confirmed. Simultaneously, traditional isolation enabled the identification of a novel species, Pestalotiopsis, as the causal agent of leaf spot disease on C. japonica. In addition to confirming previously known pathogens, our study led to the discovery and preliminary characterization of a novel fungal taxon with pathogenic potential. Our findings provide critical insights into the fungal community of C. japonica and lay the groundwork for developing improved, rapid diagnostic tools for effective disease monitoring and management of tree diseases.

AB  - Plants emit diverse volatile organic compounds from their leaves and roots for protection against biotic and abiotic stress. An important signaling cascade activated by aboveground herbivory is the jasmonic acid pathway that stimulates the production of volatile organic compounds. So far it remains unclear if the activation of this pathway also leads to enhanced volatile organic compound emissions from conifer roots, and how the interplay of above- and below-ground defenses in plants are affected by multiple stressors. Therefore, we simultaneously analyzed needle and root volatile organic compound emissions of Picea abies saplings, as well as CO2 and H2O fluxes in response to aboveground jasmonic acid treatment, heat stress and their interaction in a controlled climate chamber experiment. Continuous online volatile organic compound measurements by proton-transfer time-of-flight mass-spectrometry showed an inverse pattern of total needle and root volatile organic compound emissions, when plants were treated with jasmonic acid and heat. While needle sesquiterpene emissions increased ninefold 1 day after jasmonic acid application, total root volatile organic compound emissions decreased. This was mainly due to reduced emissions of acetone and monoterpenes by roots. In response to aboveground jasmonic acid treatment, root total carbon emitted as volatile organic compounds decreased from 31% to only 4%. While volatile organic compound emissions aboveground increased, net CO2 assimilation strongly declined due to jasmonic acid treatment, resulting in net respiration during the day. Interestingly, root respiration was not affected by aboveground jasmonic acid application. Under heat the effect of jasmonic acid on volatile organic compound emissions of needles and roots was less pronounced. The buffering effect of heat on volatile organic compound emissions following jasmonic acid treatment points towards an impaired defense reaction of the plants under multiple stress. Our results indicate efficient resource allocation within the plant to protect threatened tissues by a rather local volatile organic compound release. Roots may only be affected indirectly by reduced belowground carbon allocation, but are not involved directly in the jasmonic acid-induced stress response.

AB  - Depredation by cetaceans on fisheries is a major issue globally, both in terms of conservation and fisheries economics. The present study conducted in Cyprus, Eastern Mediterranean Sea, aimed to understand the extent, level, and type of cetacean depredation on the albacore tuna pelagic longline fishery, and in particular to quantify and evaluate the economic consequences of depredation and identify potential dolphin-longline conflict areas and mitigation practices for management. The data were obtained from fisher's logbooks, interviews and onboard observations between June and August 2018. A novel and simple approach was applied to estimate the depredation rate and economic loss by using simple calculations including the number and weight of depredated fish, landings and fishing effort. The results revealed that there is an estimated economic loss per fishing trip of 313.07 +/- 486.19 EUR and an estimated annual economic loss for the entire fleet of 259,272 EUR from depredation caused by cetaceans. The study also estimated that 16,639 albacore tunas were depredated in 2018 and the depredation rate ranged between 0% to 100% with a mean depredation rate of 17% per fishing trip. Depredation by the common bottlenose dolphin and striped dolphin was reported in more than 50% of their fishing trips. Other species that were found to be involved in depredation were the neon flying squid, the shortfin mako shark and the Risso's dolphin. This is the first official record worldwide of depredation from the common bottlenose dolphin, the striped dolphin and the neon flying squid on the pelagic longline albacore tuna fishery. A total bycatch of 62 individuals of common bottlenose dolphins and one individual of stripped dolphin were reported in interviews as a result of depredation on bait and catch. The study also identified depredation hotspots and possible depredation mitigation measures. Such information could support the development of management action plans and measures to minimise interactions between cetaceans and pelagic longlines.

AB  - Fire, herbivores, and climatic factors are all major drivers of savanna and grassland dynamics, and they interact in complex ways, which are still in the process of being explored. In particular, herbivores can reduce fire intensity by removal of biomass, and this could be reinforced by herbivores' attraction to recently burned sites, although grassland resilience may limit the temporal depth of such effects. Fire temperature is the most common fire metric reported for grassland fire, but additional aspects of fire behavior can also be measured. Using a set of controlled, replicated experiments, we examined the effects of year of burn, herbivory by livestock and wildlife, previous burn, and weather history on fire behavior in an African savanna. Multiple measures of fire behavior (minimum fire temperature, flame front speed, fire residence time, maximum flame height, and flame length) in 36 controlled burns were positively intercorrelated. Burns conducted in 2018 were significantly cooler, especially at heights >0.5 m above the ground, than those in 2013, a wetter year with more grass fuel. Grass fuel loads and fire temperatures were reduced by the presence of livestock and wildlife. Our sampling methods did not for the most part reveal expected differences in fire temperatures or other behaviors between the reburned plots and those burned for the first time in 2018, with or without herbivores, suggesting strong postfire resilience in this semiarid savanna rangeland.

AB  - Natural selection and artificial breeding are crucial methods for developing new animal groups. The Baiyu black goats and Chuanzhong black goats are indigenous goat breeds from distinct ecological regions in Sichuan Province, with dramatically different growth and reproductivity. This study aimed to systematically elucidate the differences in production performance and genetic traits between Baiyu black goats and Chuanzhong black goats. We quantified growth and reproductive attributes for both breeds. Furthermore, we conducted a comprehensive analysis of genetic diversity, population structure, and selection signatures using whole-genome resequencing data. This dataset included 30 individuals from the Baiyu black goat breed, 41 from the Chuanzhong black goat breed, and an additional 59 individuals representing Chengdu grey goats, Tibetan cashmere goats, and Jianchang black goats, totaling 130 individuals across five goat breeds. The comparative analysis of production performance revealed that the weight and body size of Chuanzhong black goats were significantly higher than those of Baiyu black goats (p < 0.01). At the same time, the average kidding rate and kid-weaning survival rate of Chuanzhong black goats were also notably superior to those of Baiyu black goats (p < 0.01). The Baiyu black goats exhibited a more abundant genetic diversity and distinct genetic differences compared to the Chuanzhong black goat, according to an analysis grounded on genomic variation. The Baiyu black goats are more closely related to Tibetan cashmere goats, whereas Chuanzhong black goats share a closer genetic relationship with Chengdu grey goats. Additionally, we employed the pi, Fst, and XP-EHH methodologies to identify genes related to immunity (TRIM10, TRIM15, TRIM26, and TRIM5), neurodevelopment (FOXD4L1, PCDHB14, PCDHB4, PCDHB5, PCDHB6, and PCDHB7), reproduction (BTNL2 and GABBR1), body size (NCAPG, IBSP, and MKNK1), and meat quality traits (SUCLG2 and PGM5). These results provide a theoretical basis for further resource conservation and breeding improvement of the Baiyu black goat and Chuanzhong black goat.

AB  - Camelina sativa (L.) Crantz. is an annual oilseed crop within the Brassicaceae family. C. sativa has been grown since as early as 4000 BCE. In recent years, C. sativa received increased attention as a climate-resilient oilseed, seed meal, and biofuel (biodiesel and renewable or green diesel) crop. This renewed interest is reflected in the rapid rise in the number of peer-reviewed publications (>2300) containing "camelina" from 1997 to 2021. An overview of the origins of this ancient crop and its genetic diversity and its yield potential under hot and dry growing conditions is provided. The major biotic barriers that limit C. sativa production are summarized, including weed control, insect pests, and fungal, bacterial, and viral pathogens. Ecosystem services provided by C. sativa are also discussed. The profiles of seed oil and fatty acid composition and the many uses of seed meal and oil are discussed, including food, fodder, fuel, industrial, and medical benefits. Lastly, we outline strategies for improving this important and versatile crop to enhance its production globally in the face of a rapidly changing climate using molecular breeding, rhizosphere microbiota, genetic engineering, and genome editing approaches.

AB  - This study aimed to evaluate and compare seasonal variations of Hippocampus reidi population structures in two Brazilian coastal areas. Samples were collected from the rocky shores of Urca and Duas Irmas Island by freediving along fixed transects. All seahorses observed in the study were recorded, measured, and identified by sex and reproductive stage. Seahorse behavior and fish depth were also registered. All individuals were photo-identified to estimate recapture rates. Holdfast used by seahorses was also recorded. Results showed low densities at both sites; sex ratio and juvenile/adult proportion did not appear to vary with season. The seahorse height differed between the two areas but did not vary with season nor sex. Seahorses in both sites were found in shallow waters (i.e. up to 4 meters), and the depth did not vary by season nor sex. Males were more frequently recaptured than females in both areas. All seahorses were reproductively active year-round, peaking at rainy periods in both areas. The seahorses were more often recorded while resting and seemed to anchor on seaweed. Though in different bays, seahorse population structure and seasonality appeared similar. These data provide useful baseline data for future population assessments.

AB  - This study aims to assess the small ruminant value chain in Al-Ruwaished District, Jordan, to identify the potential intervention areas that could improve the production efficiency and guarantee the sustainability of the small ruminant sector in this area. Sheep breeding is the source of livelihood for most of the people in Al-Ruwaished District, which is characterized by the large number of sheep and goats. We surveyed 5.0% of the small ruminant holders in the study area and conducted individual interviews and surveys with the potential actors in the value chain to undertake a small ruminant value chain analysis. From the survey, we found that the small ruminant value chain consists of five core functions, namely, input supply, production management, marketing, processing, and consumption. Despite the large number of holdings that gives an impression of the stability to the small ruminant sector, the surveyed results show a clear fragility in the value chain of small ruminants in this area. The small ruminant production system is negatively impacted by climate change, especially continuous drought. In addition, the high prices of feed that the farmer cannot afford with clear and real absence of the governmental and nongovernmental support activities also impact the development of the value chain. The results of strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats (SWOT) analysis reveal that the major constraints faced by this value chain could be divided into external and internal threats. Specifically, the most prominent external threats are the nature of the desert land and continuous drought, while the major internal threats are the absence of appropriate infrastructure, shortage of inputs, and weakness in the production management and marketing. We proposed solutions to these challenges to ensure the sustainability and effectiveness of the sector, such as the formulation of emergency response plans to severe weather, qualifying farmers' skills, and establishment of agricultural cooperative societies.

AB  - Simple Summary The genetic characterization of native sheep breeds from the Tunisian-Italian Mediterranean corridor, the earliest westward introduction route of sheep breeding from the domestication center, was carried out using microsatellite markers in order to compare the genetic diversity level between both Mediterranean sides' local sheep breeds, and to investigate their level of risk for conservation purposes. Sampling concerned both private and public/institutional farms of all the native Tunisian breeds in the case of the southern Mediterranean side, and one center Italian and the Venetian native breeds from the northern side. The results revealed that the genetic diversity level of the Tunisian native breeds was higher than that of the Italian ones, with a lower inbreeding level. The comparison between private and public farms in terms of genetic diversity, consanguinity, and conservation decisions highlighted the superiority of the public/institutional breeding management strategies over private ones in both Tunisian and Italian cases. The present study illustrated the efficiency of genomic characterization in making genetic diversity evaluations and preservation decisions of native and well-adapted sheep breeds in both developing and developed countries' rearing conditions. Non-commercialized sheep breeds known as local or native breeds are well adapted to their environmental constraints and constitute precious genetic resources that need prioritization for genetic diversity characterization and preservation. The aim of the present study was to assess the genetic diversity level and the related preservation decisions of very old and traditional native Mediterranean sheep breeds from Tunisia and Italy using 17 microsatellite markers. In total, 975 sheep were sampled from five Tunisian, one Center Italian, and four Venetian native breeds. Both private and publicly available farms were considered for each breed for breeding strategies' comparison purposes. The microsatellite set used was highly informative (PIC = 0.80 +/- 0.08), with a total of 383 alleles. Moderate genetic differentiation was revealed between the native sheep of the two Mediterranean sides (global overall loci F-ST = 0.081). The genetic diversity level was higher in the case of the Tunisian native breeds compared to the Italian ones, as evidenced by higher mean allelic richness, higher expected and observed heterozygosities, and lower inbreeding levels. Priority for conservation suggestions was carried out for each private or public breed population based on the contribution of each population to the diversity of the whole data. The four Venetian breeds, already undergoing conservation, the Tunisian dairy breed, and the very ancient Maghrebian breed, would be favored for conservation. In conclusion, our results highlighted the importance of the analyzed Mediterranean native sheep breeds as valuable inherited genetic reservoirs and supported previous conservation decisions made for the threatened breeds.

AB  - Co-composting of sheep manure and jujube branch, a potential technology of waste management in Xinjiang, China, is currently undermined by the low degradation rate of jujube branch waste. This study investigated the potential to improve the co-composting process by the addition of expanded perlite, a potential additive more economical than biochar and zeolite. Expanded perlite was added into the co-compost system in the ratios 0%, 1%, 5% and 10% based on the initial compost volume. Addition of expanded perlite extended the thermophilic phase up to 8 days and helped to increase the speed of compost maturation. Expanded perlite enhanced the degradation of organic matter by accelerating the decomposition of cell wall hemicelluloses during the very early stages and cellulose during the thermophilic and cooling stages. Moreover, total nitrogen was improved by 10.2% and 11.8% through adding 5% and 10% expanded perlite, respectively. From both economic and functionality perspectives, expanded perlite is a potential additive to compost, and 5% EP is a suitable ratio to co-composting mixes of sheep manure and jujube branch.

AB  - Biomass is a fundamental metric in ecology and conservation, widely used to inform questions related to community structure, energetics and function. Despite the ubiquity of biomass in broader ecological research, avian ecology and conservation has been based primarily on measures of abundance. Here, we re-examine a recent study in avian conservation that found a net loss of three billion North American birds from 1970-2017. We augment this analysis by calculating change in overall avian biomass during the same period. Counterintuitively, we find that avian biomass across the continent has increased by 11% despite a 29% decline in abundance. Substantial restructuring in the biomass of trophic communities has occurred, with herbivores, omnivores, vertivores, frugivores and scavengers seeing net increases, while invertivores, granivores, nectarivores and aquatic predators have exhibited declines. We suggest that avian biologists can benefit from increased inclusion of biomass as a metric of trophic- and community-level ecosystem function.

AB  - Feral cats are some of the most destructive invasive predators worldwide, particularly in insular environments; hence, density-reduction campaigns are often applied to alleviate the predation mortality they add to native fauna. Density-reduction and eradication efforts are costly procedures with important outcomes for native fauna recovery, so they require adequate planning to be successful. These plans should include empirical density-reduction models that can guide yearly culling quotas, and resource roll-out for the duration of the culling period. This ensures densities are reduced over the long term and that resources are not wasted. We constructed a stochastic population model with cost estimates to test the relative effectiveness and cost-efficiency of two main culling scenarios for a 10-year eradication campaign of cats on Kangaroo Island, Australia: (a) constant proportional annual cull (one-phase), and (b) high initial culling followed by a constant proportional maintenance cull (two-phase). A one-phase cull of at least 0.35 of the annual population size would reduce the final population to 0.1 of its original size, while a two-phase cull with an initial cull of minimum 0.6 and minimum 0.5 maintenance cull would reduce the final population to 0.01 of its initial size within the 10-year time frame. Cost estimates varied widely depending on the methods applied (shooting, trapping, aerial poison baits, Felixer (TM) poison-delivery system), but using baiting, trapping and Felixers with additional shooting to meet culling quotas was the most cost-effective combination (minimum cost: AU$19.56 million; range: AU$16.87 million-AU$20.69 million). Our model provides an adaptable and general assessment tool for cat reductions in Australia and potentially elsewhere, and provides relative culling costs for the Kangaroo Island campaign specifically.

AB  - In order to identify types of forage that inhibit pasture contamination, an evaluation was performed of the effect of the forage legumes Trifolium repens (white clover), Trifolium pratense (red clover) and Lotus corniculatus (bird's-foot-trefoil) on the survival and migration of infective larvae (L3) of gastrointestinal nematodes (GIN) of sheep. An experimental area of 441 m(2) was divided into four blocks, subdivided into areas of 1.20 x 1.20 in which the three forage legumes were separately overseeded. After growth of the forage in each subdivision, experimental units were established that were later artificially contaminated with sheep faeces containing GIN eggs. Between October and December 2018, pasture, faecal and soil samples were collected on four occasions during weeks 1, 2, 4 and 8 after the deposition of faeces. In week 6, the forage legumes in all the experimental units were mown to simulate grazing. The number of L3 was quantified to determine their survival in the pasture, faeces and soil. In addition, the horizontal migration of L3 was measured at two distances from the faecal pellets (10 and 30 cm), as well as their vertical migration at two heights of the plant stems, that is, lower half and upper half. Larvae vertical migration was affected by the forage species (P < 0.001), in that bird's-foot-trefoil contained fewer larvae in the upper stratum. Bird's-foot-trefoil restricted the migration of L3 to the upper stratum of the plant, which could potentially decrease the risk of infection by intestinal nematodes in grazing sheep.

AB  - Global change poses new challenges for pest management. Omnivorous predatory arthropods play an important role in pest management, yet their potential has not been fully explored. Not only do they consume prey, but their plant-feeding induces plant defences that decrease herbivores' performance, and increases production of volatiles that attract natural enemies. Growing evidence from different plant-arthropod systems indicates the generality of plant defence induction following omnivore plant-feeding. Furthermore, these responses appear to affect other organisms (e.g. plant viruses), altering multi-trophic interactions. Here, we review the dual role of omnivores (as predators and plant inducers), identify knowledge gaps and provide future perspectives to increase our understanding of omnivores' multiple functions, and how this can be applied to advance plant protection strategies.

AB  - Main conclusionCultivated tomato presented lower constitutive volatiles, reduced morphological and chemical defenses, and increased leaf nutritional quality that affect its resistance against the specialist herbivore Tuta absoluta compared to its wild relatives.Plant domestication process has selected desirable agronomic attributes that can both intentionally and unintentionally compromise other important traits, such as plant defense and nutritional value. However, the effect of domestication on defensive and nutritional traits of plant organs not exposed to selection and the consequent interactions with specialist herbivores are only partly known. Here, we hypothesized that the modern cultivated tomato has reduced levels of constitutive defense and increased levels of nutritional value compared with its wild relatives, and such differences affect the preference and performance of the South American tomato pinworm, Tuta absoluta-an insect pest that co-evolved with tomato. To test this hypothesis, we compared plant volatile emissions, leaf defensive (glandular and non-glandular trichome density, and total phenolic content), and nutritional traits (nitrogen content) among the cultivated tomato Solanum lycopersicum and its wild relatives S. pennellii and S. habrochaites. We also determined the attraction and ovipositional preference of female moths and larval performance on cultivated and wild tomatoes. Volatile emissions were qualitatively and quantitatively different among the cultivated and wild species. Glandular trichomes density and total phenolics were lower in S. lycopersicum. In contrast, this species had a greater non-glandular trichome density and leaf nitrogen content. Female moths were more attracted and consistently laid more eggs on the cultivated S. lycopersicum. Larvae fed on S. lycopersicum leaves had a better performance reaching shorter larval developmental times and increasing the pupal weight compared to those fed on wild tomatoes. Overall, our study documents that agronomic selection for increased yields has altered the defensive and nutritional traits in tomato plants, affecting their resistance to T. absoluta.

AB  - The Moroccan Spiny-tailed lizard Uromnstyx nigriventris is a desert agamid species distributed from western Algeria to Morocco northeast to southwest of the Atlas range. In spite of a few studies investigating its dietary habits information regarding the daily food intake rate of this non-drinking desert species under natural conditions is lacking. Our study aimed at assessing the daily food consumption in spring and autumn calculated as dry matter intake (DM1), using calibrated faecal and nitrogenous waste outputs collected during 12 days from unfed wild-caught adult lizards originating from a desert area in southeastern Morocco. We used microhistological analyses to identify plant fragments in faecal pellets. Percentages of dry weights of individual plant species in individual diets were estimated from their fragment density, using the Sparks and Macheleck's conversion method. The obtained results indicate that these herbivorous lizards fed on a total of 18 different plant species belonging to 17 genera and nine plant families depending on the season. The total faecal and nitrogenous waste outputs were significantly correlated to the DM1 of captive lizards. The combination of the two methods along with the moisture content of the plant species consumed allowed estimating the lizards' daily water intake rate (W IR). Estimated values of both DMI and WIR were compared to those predicted from body weight using allometric (or scaling) equations derived from isotopic measurements of field metabolic rate and water influx in free-ranging herbivorous lizards. The obtained results have important implications for conservation such as captive-breeding programmes and habitat restoration.

AB  - Simple Summary Yaks (Bos grunniens) are one of the most remarkable domestic animals; however, they generally suffer from malnutrition for almost 8 months of the year, which results in yaks displaying a circannual rhythm with seasonal changes. Yaks are ruminant animals whose utilization of dietary nitrogen efficiency is only about 15.9-19.0%; a large amount of N is excreted in feces and urine. A nutritional method could be taken to improve the utilization rate of dietary nutrients and regulate the synthesis of protein. Methionine makes up the first two limiting amino acids in a corn-soybean-meal-based diet for ruminants; therefore, we added the methionine analogues to the diet to investigate its role in yaks, eventually to find an efficient way to feed yaks. This experiment was conducted to investigate the effects of methionine analogues 2-hydroxy-4-methylthio butanoic acid isopropyl ester (HBMi) on growth performance, nutrient apparent digestibility, serum metabolite, serum free amino acids, and rumen fermentation parameters of yaks. Twenty-four male Maiwa yaks (252.79 +/- 15.95 kg) were randomly allocated to four dietary treatments: basic diet (CON), or three HBMi (MetaSmart (MS); Adisseo Inc., Antony, France) supplementation treatments: MS1 (5 g), MS2 (10 g), and MS3 (15 g). The results showed that the increase in the supplemented MS levels linearly increased the average daily gain (p < 0.05), while the serum alkaline phosphatase activity and malondialdehyde content were increased when yaks were fed with 15 g/d MS (p < 0.05). The diet supplemented with MS linearly increased the percentages of glutamic acid and proline, and linearly or quadratically decreased the percentages of isoleucine, phenylalanine, and valine (p < 0.05). Furthermore, supplementation of 10 g/d and 15 g/d MS increased ruminal microbial crude protein (p < 0.05). The ratio of acetate to propionate in the MS2 group was lower than those in CON and MS1 groups (p < 0.05). In summary, a diet supplemented with 10 g/d MS could be an effective way to improve the growth performance of fattening yaks without negative effects.

AB  - Silicon (Si) is agronomically beneficial due to positive effects it provides to plant development, including the increased defensive response capacity against attack of herbivorous insects. This study evaluated the effects of applications of Si sources via soil and foliar sprays on yellow passion fruit biochemistry and Si-induced resistance to feeding preference and development of the major passion fruit pest, Dione juno juno. Two independent experiments were conducted with applications of calcium silicate (78-88% SiO2) via soil and as foliar sprays with the commercial product AgriSil (R) (98% SiO2) to plants of Passiflora edulis f. flavicarpa in a greenhouse. Four doses were tested for each Si source plus a control treatment. Biochemical analyses in the plants included the concentrations of Si and total phenolics, and activities of the enzymes peroxidase (POX), phenylalanine ammonia lyase (PAL), and polyphenol oxidase (PPO). Si-induced resistance to D. juno juno was investigated in feeding assays in the laboratory and on the insect's development on potted-plants in the greenhouse. As main results, calcium silicate favoured the increase in Si content and the activities of POX and PAL, in addition to negatively affecting larvae feeding preference, leaf area consumed, and adult-stage parameters of D. juno juno. Agrisil led to increased Si content, total phenolics concentration, and POX activity, but did not affect the feeding preference, performance, and development of D. juno juno. Calcium silicate is promising for use in integrated pest management and could provide benefits to passion fruit production by reducing the economic losses by D. juno juno attack.

AB  - Bloom-forming algae Phaeocystis globosa is one of the most successful blooming algae in the oceans due to its capacity to sense grazer-associated chemical cues and respond adaptively to these grazer-specific cues with opposing shifts in phenotype. P. globosa produces toxic and deterrent compounds as chemical defenses. However, the origin of the signals and underlying mechanisms that triggered the morphological and chemical defenses remain enigmatic. Rotifer was chosen to establish an herbivore-phytoplankton interaction with P. globosa. The influences of rotifer kairomone and conspecific-grazed cue on morphological and chemical defenses in P. globosa were investigated. As a result, rotifer kairomones elicited morphological defenses and broad-spectrum chemical defenses, whereas algae-grazed cues elicited morphological defenses and consumer-specific chemical defenses. According to multi-omics findings, the difference in hemolytic toxicity caused by different stimuli may be related to the upregulation of lipid metabolism pathways and increased lipid metabolite content, while the inhibition of colonial formation and development of P. globosa may be caused by the downscaled production and secretion of glycosaminoglycans. The study demonstrated that zooplankton consumption cues were recognized by intraspecific prey and elicited consumer-specific chemical defenses, highlighting the chemical ecology of herbivorephytoplankton interactions in the marine ecosystem.

AB  - Soil cadmium stress alters the structure and function of the phyllosphere microbe community differently between male and female poplar plants, resulting in increased pathogen resistance of males compared to females
   Microorganisms associated with the phyllosphere play a crucial role in protecting plants from diseases, and their composition and diversity are strongly influenced by heavy metal contaminants. Dioecious plants are known to exhibit sexual dimorphism in metal accumulation and tolerance between male and female individuals. Hence, in this study we used male and female full-siblings of Populus deltoides to investigate whether the two sexes present differences in their phyllosphere microbiome structures and in their associated resistance to the leaf pathogenic fungus Pestalotiopsis microspora after exposure to excess soil cadmium (Cd). We found that Cd-treated male plants grew better and accumulated more leaf Cd than females. Cd stress reduced the lesion areas on leaves of both sexes after pathogen infection, but male plants exhibited better resistance than females. More importantly, Cd exposure differentially altered the structure and function of the phyllosphere microbiomes between the male and female plants, with more abundant ecologically beneficial microbes and decreased pathogenic fungal taxa harbored by male plants. In vitro toxicity tests suggested that the sexual difference in pathogen resistance could be attribute to both direct Cd toxicity and indirect shifts in the phyllosphere microbiome. This study provides new information relevant for understanding the underlying mechanisms of the effects of heavy metals involved in plant-pathogen interactions.

AB  - Simple Summary The synchronization process of yak estrus plays a crucial role in enhancing the reproductive success rate of yaks and safeguarding the continuation of the species. Metabolomics, a branch of bio-chemistry, primarily focuses on the quantitative analysis of all metabolites within an organism, aiming to identify the relative relationships between metabolites and physiological changes. It serves as a valuable tool for delving into the molecular mechanisms and responses of metabolic pathways under various perturbations. In this study, metabolomics methods were utilized to analyze blood samples collected from non-estrus yaks as well as those that underwent hormonally induced synchronized estrus to identify differential metabolites. The research results provide a theoretical basis for the optimization and application of synchronized estrus technology in yaks, promoting the healthy development of the yak industry.Abstract The yak is a unique species of livestock found in the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau and its surrounding areas. Due to factors such as late sexual maturity and a low rate of estrus, its reproductive efficiency is relatively low. The process of estrus synchronization in yaks plays a crucial role in enhancing their reproductive success and ensuring the continuation of their species. In order to clarify the characteristics of the serum metabolites of yak estrus synchronization, the yaks with inactive ovaries were compared with the estrus synchronization yaks. In this study, yaks were divided into the inactive ovaries group (IO), gonarelin-induced yak estrus group (GnRH), and chloprostenol sodium-induced yak estrus group (PGF). After the completion of the estrus synchronization treatment, blood samples were collected from the jugular veins of the non-estrus yaks in the control group and the yaks with obvious estrus characteristics in the GnRH and PGF groups. Metabolites were detected by ultra-high performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry, and differential metabolites were screened by multivariate statistical analysis. The results showed that a total of 70 significant differential metabolites were screened and identified in the GnRH vs. IO group, and 77 significant differential metabolites were screened and identified in the PGF vs. IO group. Compared with non-estrus yaks, 36 common significant differential metabolites were screened out after the induction of yak estrus by gonarelin (GnRH) and cloprostenol sodium (PGF), which were significantly enriched in signaling pathways such as the beta oxidation of very long chain fatty acids, bile acid biosynthesis, oxidation of branched chain fatty acids, steroidogenesis, steroid biosynthesis, and arginine and proline metabolism. This study analyzed the effects of gonadotropin releasing hormone (GnRH) and prostaglandin F (PGF) on the reproductive performance of yaks treated with estrus synchronization, which provides a theoretical basis for the optimization and application of yak estrus synchronization technology and promotes the healthy development of the yak industry.

AB  - The rise of angiosperms to ecological dominance and the breakup of Gondwana during the Mesozoic marked major transitions in the evolutionary history of insect-plant interactions. To elucidate how contemporary trophic interactions were influenced by host plant shifts and palaeogeographical events, we integrated molecular data with information from the fossil record to construct a time tree for ancient phytophagous weevils of the beetle family Belidae. Our analyses indicate that crown-group Belidae originated approximately 138 Ma ago in Gondwana, associated with Pinopsida (conifer) host plants, with larvae likely developing in dead/decaying branches. Belids tracked their host plants as major plate movements occurred during Gondwana's breakup, surviving on distant, disjunct landmasses. Some belids shifted to Angiospermae and Cycadopsida when and where conifers declined, evolving new trophic interactions, including brood-pollination mutualisms with cycads and associations with achlorophyllous parasitic angiosperms. Extant radiations of belids in the genera Rhinotia (Australian region) and Proterhinus (Hawaiian Islands) have relatively recent origins.conifer hosts on the newly formed land masses. However, when conifers became less common, some of the beetles switched to feeding and developing larvae on flowering plants instead, diversifying again.Understanding how changes in the availability of plants and the Earth's geography have affected insects in the past can help scientists understand evolutionary history as well as current ecosystem stability and biodiversity. With further research, this may help scientists to devise strategies to better manage and preserve ecosystems.

AB  - There is increasing interest across Europe in adopting forest management strategies, which promote species and structural diversity through the use of irregular silvicultural systems, an approach often described as continuous cover forestry (CCF). However, there is little information about the proportion of CCF practised across the continent or about the knowledge gaps and other obstacles that limit its use. A survey of respondents in 33 European countries sought to address these issues. The results indicated that the silvicultural systems associated with CCF were single stem, group selection and irregular shelterwood. Rotational forest management (RFM) was more frequent than CCF in about 66 per cent of countries, whereas in 25 per cent the reverse was true. We estimated that between 22 and 30 per cent of European forests are managed through CCF, although good data are lacking. The main knowledge gaps were: uncertainties arising from climate change (e.g. appropriate species choice, carbon storage in CCF), using CCF to increase forest resilience, deployment of mechanized harvesting systems, lack of knowledge about CCF amongst professional foresters and better information on economic implications of this approach. Major obstacles included: little awareness of CCF amongst forest owners, limited competence in CCF within the forestry profession and a scarcity of skilled forest workers to implement this approach, high ungulate populations damaging natural regeneration, a sawmilling sector geared to processing medium-sized logs, subsidy regimes favouring practices associated with RFM and a lack of experience in transforming plantation forests to more diverse structures. Better information on the use of different silvicultural systems is essential to allow policymakers and other stakeholders to monitor progress in diversifying forests. Establishment of a continental network of long-term operational trials (e.g. expanding the existing Association Futaie Irreguliere network) would improve professional understanding of CCF, would demonstrate this approach to forest owners and other stakeholders and could provide a valuable platform for supporting research.

AB  - The western capercaillie (Tetrao urogallus) is a species of conservation concern that has been experiencing a severe decline in many regions of Europe. The poor breeding success rather than mortality of full-grown birds has been suggested to be responsible for its decline, been the nest loss a potential driver of the low productivity (number of chicks per female and year) of capercaillie. Working in a capercaillie population in the Pyrenees, we aimed to provide further insights into nest predation by monitoring 82 artificial nests (58 of them with camera traps), and estimating the population density of predators using camera traps and applying random encounter model and camera trap distance sampling. Pine/stone martens -Martes foina, Martes martes- were the species with higher nest predation rates (23%) despite being the less abundant (0.49 ind/km(2)), followed by foxes -Vulpes vulpes- (11%) and a population density of 3.37 ind/km(2), and wild boar -Sus scrofa- (4%) and 6.95 ind<middle dot>km(- 2); predators could not be identified at 27% of the events. After fitting statistical models on the nest predation data, we observed that the martens' encounter rate (i.e. number of martens detected per camera and day) and the altitude had a positive significant effect on the artificial nest predation probability. While caution is recommended in artificial nest experiments, our results are valuable highlighting the importance of martens and red foxes when addressing nest predation to promote the breeding success and population recovery of western capercaillie populations.

AB  - Background: Insights into the genetic basis of complex traits and disease in both human and livestock species have been achieved over the past decade through detection of genetic variants in genome-wide association studies (GWAS). A majority of such variants were found located in noncoding genomic regions, and though the involvement of numerous regulatory elements (REs) has been predicted across multiple tissues in domesticated animals, their evolutionary conservation and effects on complex traits have not been fully elucidated, particularly in ruminants. Here, we systematically analyzed 137 epigenomic and transcriptomic datasets of six mammals, including cattle, sheep, goats, pigs, mice, and humans, and then integrated them with large-scale GWAS of complex traits. Results: Using 40 ChIP-seq datasets of H3K4me3 and H3K27ac, we detected 68,479, 58,562, 63,273, 97,244, 111,881, and 87,049 REs in the liver of cattle, sheep, goats, pigs, humans and mice, respectively. We then systematically characterized the dynamic functional landscapes of these REs by integrating multi-omics datasets, including gene expression, chromatin accessibility, and DNA methylation. We identified a core set (n = 6359) of ruminant-specific REs that are involved in liver development, metabolism, and immune processes. Genes with more complex cis-REs exhibited higher gene expression levels and stronger conservation across species. Furthermore, we integrated expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) and GWAS from 44 and 52 complex traits/diseases in cattle and humans, respectively. These results demonstrated that REs with different degrees of evolutionary conservation across species exhibited distinct enrichments for GWAS signals of complex traits. Conclusions: We systematically annotated genome-wide functional REs in liver across six mammals and demonstrated the evolution of REs and their associations with transcriptional output and conservation. Detecting lineage-specific REs allows us to decipher the evolutionary and genetic basis of complex phenotypes in livestock and humans, which may benefit the discovery of potential biomedical models for functional variants and genes of specific human diseases.

AB  - While sheep can detect and discriminate human emotions through visual and vocal cues, their reaction to human body odors remains unknown. The present study aimed to determine whether sheep (Ovis aries) can detect human odors, olfactorily discriminate stressed from non-stressed individuals, and behave accordingly based on the emotional valence of the odors. Axillary secretions from 34 students were collected following an oral examination (stress odor) or a regular class (non-stress odor). Fourteen female and 15 male lambs were then exposed to these odors through a habituation-dishabituation procedure. The habituation stimulus was presented four times for one minute, followed by the dishabituation stimulus presented once for one minute. Behavioral variables included spatiality relative to target odors, approach/withdrawal, ear positioning, sniffing, ingestion, and vocalization. Both female and male lambs more often positioned their ears backwards/forwards, and asymmetrically when exposed to the dishabituation stimulus, but regardless of their stress or non-stress value. They also changed their approach behavior when exposed to the dishabituation stimuli. Lambs displayed some behavioral signs of discrimination between the habituation and dishabituation odors, but regardless of their relation to stress or non-stress of human donors. In sum, this exploratory study suggests that young sheep respond negatively to the odor of unfamiliar humans, without showing any specific emotional contagion related to the stress odor. This exploratory study suggests young ovines can detect human body odor, a further step toward understanding the human-sheep relationship.

AB  - Koocanusa Reservoir (KOC) is a waterbody that spans the United States (U.S.) and Canadian border. Increasing concentrations of total selenium (Se), nitrate + nitrite (NO3-, nitrite is insignificant or not present), and sulfate (SO42-) in KOC and downstream in the Kootenai River (Kootenay River in Canada) are tied to expanding coal mining operations in the Elk River Watershed, Canada. Using a paired watershed approach, trends in flow-normalized concentrations and loads were evaluated for Se, NO3-, and SO42- for the two largest tributaries, the Kootenay and Elk Rivers, Canada. Increases in concentration (SO42- 120%, Se 581%, NO3- 784%) and load (SO42- 129%, Se 443%, NO3- 697%) in the Elk River (1979-2022 for NO3-, 1984-2022 for Se and SO42-) are among the largest documented increases in the primary literature, while only a small magnitude increase in SO42- (7.7% concentration) and decreases in Se (-10%) and NO3- (-8.5%) were observed in the Kootenay River. Between 2009 and 2019, the Elk River contributed, on average, 29% of the combined flow, 95% of the Se, 76% of the NO3-, and 38% of the SO42- entering the reservoir from these two major tributaries. The largest increase in solute concentrations occurred during baseflows, indicating a change in solute transport and delivery dynamics in the Elk River Watershed, which may be attributable to altered landscapes from coal mining operations including altered groundwater flow paths and increased chemical weathering in waste rock dumps. More recently there is evidence of surface water treatment operations providing some reduction in concentrations during low flow times of year; however, these appear to have a limited effect on annual loads entering KOC. These findings imply that current mine water treatment, which is focused on surface waters, may not sufficiently reduce the influence of mine-waste-derived solutes in the Elk River to allow constituent concentrations in KOC to meet U.S. water-quality standards.

AB  - Decentralisation of environmental governance (DEG) proliferated around the world in the 1990s, inspired, in part, by theories of common-pool resource governance that argued that local communities could sustainably manage valuable but non-excludable resources given a set of proper institutional design principles. However, many species of wildlife, such as predators that consume livestock or herbivores that destroy crops, are considered undesirable by local communities; this challenges the applicability of DEG models for managing wildlife in these contexts. Numerous scholars have proposed methods to generate economic value from locally undesired wildlife species to incentivise their conservation, but the overall success of these approaches has been mixed. We explore the intersection of DEG and the management of wildlife entangled in human-wildlife conflict and challenge the assumption that simple models of devolution and decentralisation will lead to the successful governance of wildlife in such circumstances. We argue that conflict species governance is potentially compatible with DEG but requires a fuller consideration of institutions at multiple scales than is typically included in common-pool resource theory or decentralisation. Multiple mechanisms of accountability may be especially important in securing the conservation of wildlife in conflict scenarios.

AB  - The aim of the study was to evaluate the dietary supplementation effect of alfalfa and Prangos pabularia hay on feed intake, growth performance, in-vivo and in-saco nutrient degradability in Kari sheep. A total of 36 Kari sheep were randomly weighed and offered the following four type of ration: A, total mix ration (TMR) + alfalfa (AL) 70 % and Prangos pabularia (PP) 0 % (control); B, TMR + 24% PP: 46 % AL; C, TMR + 46% PP 24 % AL and D, TMR + 70% PP: AL 0 % on dry matter basis were fed to experimental sheep for a period of 90 days. The dry matter intake, crude protein intake and organic matter intake (g/day) were significantly (P<0.05) affected in treatment groups. In-vivo nutrient digestibility, dry matter, organic matter, crude protein, crude fat, nitrogen-free extract (NFE), ash were significantly higher (P<0.05) in treatment groups, while in in-sacco degradability the DM and OM degradability at different time intervals (2h, 4h, 8h, 12h, 18h and 24 h) were significantly (P<0.05) higher in ration C and D. The initial body weight was significantly improved in treatment groups compared to control, while daily intake, average daily gain, and feed conversion efficiency were not affected. It is concluded that the dietary supplementation of alfalfa and Prangos pabularia hay increase the dry matter intake, digestibility and growth performance of Kari sheep.

AB  - In recent years, legged robots have been more and more widely used on non-structured terrain, and their foot structure has an important impact on the robot's motion performance and stability. The structural characteristics of the yak foot sole with a high outer edge and low middle, which has excellent soil fixation ability and is an excellent bionic prototype, can improve the friction between the foot and the ground. At the same time, the foot hooves can effectively alleviate the larger impact load when contacting with the ground, which is an excellent anti-slip buffer mechanism. The bionic foot end design was carried out based on the morphology of the yak sole; the bionic foot design was carried out based on the biological anatomy observation of yak foot skeletal muscles. The virtual models of the bionic foot end and the bionic foot were established and simulated using Solidworks 2022 and Abaqus 2023, and the anti-slip performance on different ground surfaces and the influence of each parameter of the bionic foot on the cushioning effect were investigated. The results show that (1) the curved shape of the yak sole has a good anti-slip performance on both soil ground and rocky ground, and the anti-slip performance is better on soil ground; (2) the curved shape of the yak sole has a larger maximum static friction than the traditional foot, and the anti-slip performance is stronger under the same pressure conditions; (3) the finger pillow-hoof ball structure of the bionic foot has the greatest influence on the buffering effect, and the buffering effect of the bionic foot is best when the tip of the bionic foot touches the ground first.

AB  - Introduction: During the early stage of pregnancy trophoblast cells adapt to adverse uterine environments characterized by oxygen and nutrient deprivation. Autophagy is an intracellular degradation process that aims to promote cell survival in response to stressful conditions. Autophagy activation passes through the mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR), also known as a placental nutrient sensor. Here, we tested the hypothesis that ovine trophoblast cells may adapt to a suboptimal environment through an mTOR dependent regulation of cell survival with relevant implications for key placental functionality. Methods: Primary ovine trophoblast cells subjected to mTOR inhibitor and low-nutrient conditions were used to explore how autophagy affects cellular functionality and expression of solute carriers' genes (SLCs). Results: Autophagy activation was confirmed both in rapamycin-treated and low-nutrient conditions, through the detection of specific autophagic markers. However, p-mTOR activation seems to be severely modified only following rapamycin treatment whereas 24h of starvation allowed p-mTOR reactivation. Starvation promoted migration compared to normal culture conditions whereas all trophoblast functional activities were decreased in rapamycin treatment. Interestingly in both conditions, the autophagy-activated environment did not affect the progesterone release. mRNA expression of amino acid transporters remains largely undisturbed except for SLC43A2 and SLC38A4 which are downregulated in starved and rapamycin-treated cells, respectively. Discussion: The study demonstrates that sheep trophoblast cells can adapt to adverse conditions in the early stage of placentation by balancing, in an mTOR dependent manner, nutrient recycling and transport with relevant effects for in vitro functional properties, which could potentially impact conceptus development and survival.

AB  - The palaeontological material from the Dacian Basin provides a complete and well-represented record of faunal succession during the important faunal turnover called the Pachycrocuta event. The present study describes fossil remains of ruminants (Cervidae, Bovidae, Giraffidae) from the Early Pleistocene of Valea Graunceanului, Fantana lui Mitilan and other smaller sites from the Oltet River Valley. The article discuss the taxonomic context, eco-morphology and functional morphology of the described taxa and dynamics of biogeographic distribution. The commutity of ruminant species from the Dacian Basin before the Pachycrocuta event is dominated by Pliocene holdovers: Pliotragus ardeus, Gazellospira torticornis, Rucervus radulescui, Metacervocerus rhenanus and Mitilanotherium inexspectatum. This assemblage also contains new forms for Western Eurasia as Dama eurygonos, Eucladoceros dicranios, Eucladoceros ctenoides, Alces sp. and Bison (Eobison) sp. This specific regional fauna of ruminants became extinct during the Pachycrocuta faunal turnover and was replaced by a more cold-adapted assemblage of ruminants (Megalovis latifrons, Eucladoceros sp., Dama sp., Praemegaceros obscurus and its specialised diminished form Praemegaceros cf. mosbachensis) that show a greater affinity with coeval Levant faunas. The revealed dynamics of paleobiogeographic zones from the Early Pleistocene of southeastern Europe supports the hypothesis of early hominin dispersals in Western Eurasia via Balkan-Anatolia path.

AB  - Species involved in human-wildlife conflicts are likely to generate polarized framings in the media. Because media contribute to shaping public opinion, an analysis of wild species in the media helps documenting perceptions and attitudes towards wildlife.The case of the Asian elephant is illustrative because of its ambivalent perception, holding strong cultural and symbolic dimensions, but also feared due to increasing damages and casualties. Through this case, we investigate how media portray an endangered species, both feared and revered. We used text mining, social network and lexical analysis to analyze 11,000 news articles dealing with Asian elephants over 13 years. We found a multifaceted image of the species with various framings. Most prevalent topics were local events recounting damages on crops, villagers' and elephants' deaths. Media also covered various topics from international traffic to conflict mitigation and conservation programs. Thematic articles depicted an institutional representation of human-elephant interactions focusing on global trends and management schemes, using a technical and sanitized lexicon. Conversely, event-driven reports were anchored in spatial and temporal lexicon, recounting elephant encounters and their specific behaviors, while quoting inhabitants with a highly emotional narrative. Our study suggests that event-driven articles highlighted the emotional response to damages caused by individual elephants rather than the demonization of the species. We suggest that, in the context of human-wildlife conflicts, fear and trauma should be better acknowledged to help reducing discrepancies found in media narratives before it fosters other sentiments such as anger and frustration that may impede conservation efforts.

AB  - Velvet antler is a precious traditional Chinese medicine used for thousands of years. This study investigated the anti-colitis effects of water extracts of Formosan sambar deer (SVAE) and red deer (RVAE) to identify the possible mechanisms and the bioactive compounds using a dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced colitis mouse model. The mechanism of action and the ameliorating effects of SVAE and RVAE on DSS-induced colitis were evaluated using a mouse model. Ultra-high performance liquid chromatography-mass/mass and gas chromatography-mass/mass were applied to identify the bioactive components of the SVAE and RVAE water extracts. The results revealed that both high-dose SVAE and RVAE could ameliorate the symptoms of colitis due to reduced systemic inflammatory responses, enhanced intestinal barrier integrity by restoration of tight junction proteins, and improved gut dysbiosis. The potentially bioactive components of SVAE and RVAE were identified as small molecules (<3 kDa). Further identification by untargeted metabolomics analysis suggested that l-carnitine, hypoxanthine, adrenic acid, creatinine, gamma-aminobutyric-lysine, oleic acid, glycine, poly-& gamma;-glutamic acid, and eicosapentaenoic acid in VAWEs might be involved in ameliorating the symptoms of colitis. This study provided evidence for the potential usage of SVAE and RVAE as anti-colitis agents.

AB  - This study investigated the impact of early life interactions on stress resilience of weaner pigs. The hypotheses tested were that reduced maternal contact increases the stress response of pigs to weaning, and that positive human contact during lactation reduces, the stress response of pigs to weaning. Ninety-eight litters were allocated to a 2x2 factorial randomised block design for treatments maternal contact (MC+) / reduced maternal contact (MC-); and positive human contact (HC+) / control (HC-). Modified farrowing crates were used to reduce maternal contact (MC-). Litters in the HC+ treatment received five minutes of daily positive human interaction (stroking). Treatments ceased at weaning (22 days old). Forty-three pigs were mixed into pens of the same treatment at weaning. Behavioral observations were conducted for 2 hours post-weaning and for 4 hours at 2 weeks post-weaning, along with behavioural responses to humans and isolation at 3 and 4 weeks post-weaning, respectively. Cortisol, haptoglobin and IgA concentrations were collected the day prior to weaning at rest, two hours post-weaning, one hour following isolation and at 4 weeks post-weaning and at 5 weeks post-weaning at rest (basal). End weight and survival were also recorded. Results showed that in the first 90 minutes after weaning, HC+ pigs exhibited more inactive behaviours (P<0.05), and less aggressive and eating behaviours (P<0.05) along with more social behaviours (P<0.05) at 90-120 minutes compared to HC- pigs. These findings suggest a quicker stabilisation of behaviour following weaning. While maternal contact did not affect play, aggressive, social or drinking behaviours (P>0.05), MC+ pigs exhibited more eating and active behaviours (P<0.05) from 30 to 60 minutes post<bold>-</bold>weaning. There were no significant treatment effects (P<0.05) on the physiological measures except at 5 weeks post-weaning where the IgA concentrations of the MC-/HC+ pigs remained steady while those of the other pigs increased five fold (P=0.002). While there were no treatment effects (P<0.05) on the behaviour of pigs at rest at 2-weeks post-weaning, in response to isolation at 4 weeks post-weaning or on performance post-weaning, there was limited evidence that the MC- pigs were less fearful of humans in the test at 3 weeks post-weaning. Based on the behavioural response of pigs immediately following weaning, early positive handling assisted pigs to cope with the stress of weaning. While previous research provided evidence of maternal contact on stress resilience during lactation, the present study provides limited evidence of maternal contact on stress resilience of the weaned pig.

AB  - The bats of Saudi Arabia consist of 30 species and 21 genera within 9 families (Pteropodidae, Rhinopomatidae, Rhinolophidae, Emballonuridae, Nycteridae, Hipposideridae, Miniopteridae, Molossidae, and Vespertilionidae). Some species have been recorded from only one locality: Epomophorus labiatus, Hipposideros megalotis and Asellia patrizii. The taxonomy of some species was updated. Details on the past and present distribution of the bats were included along with available data on their habitat preference and biology. An analysis of the bat fauna of Saudi Arabia revealed that they have six major zoogeographical affinities; Afrotropical (eight species), Saharo-Sindian (three species), Afrotropical-Palaearctic (four species), Palaearctic (four species), oriental (one species), and Afrotropical-oriental (two species). Asellia patrizii stands as an endemic species known only from Eretria, Ethiopia, and Farasan Island in Saudi Arabia, and Rhyneptesicus nasutus is considered as a Middle East endemic species with distribution confined to Iraq, Iran, and Afghanistan, reaching as far as western Arabia. At least six more species are suspected to occur in Saudi Arabia, since they have been reported from neighboring Yemen. The threats to and conservation status of the bats of Saudi Arabia were highlighted.

AB  - Dry permafrost is a challenging environment for microbial life due to cold, dry, and often oligotrophic conditions. In 2016, Elephant Head, Antarctica, was confirmed as the second site on Earth to contain dry permafrost. It is geographically distinct from the McMurdo Dry Valleys where dry permafrost has been studied previously. Here, we present the first study of the microbial activity, diversity, and functional potential of Elephant Head dry permafrost. Microbial activity was measured using radiorespiration assays with radiolabeled acetate as a carbon source at 5, 0, and -5(degrees)C. Low, but detectable, rates of microbial activity were measured in some samples at 0 and -5(degrees)C. This is distinct from previous studies of McMurdo Dry Valley dry permafrost which concluded that dry permafrost represents a cold- arid limit to life on the planet. The isolation of cold-adapted organisms from these soils, including one capable of subzero growth, further supports that the Elephant Head dry active layer and dry permafrost harbor viable microbial life, which may be active in situ. Metagenomic, 16S rRNA gene, and internal transcribed spacer and amplicon sequencing identified similar microbial communities to other Antarctic and cold environments. The Elephant Head microbial community appears to be adapted for survival in cold, dry, and oligotrophic conditions based on the presence of cold adaptation and stress response genes in the metagenomes. Together, our results show that dry permafrost environments do not exclude active microbial life at subzero temperatures, suggesting that the cold, dry soils of Mars may also not be as inhospitable as previously thought.

AB  - At present, the effect of multiple antibiotics on aerobic composting process and its mechanism are not clear. So in this study, broiler manure containing different doses of Doxycycline (DOX) and Gatifloxacin (GAT) were used as raw materials and mixed with rice hull for aerobic composting, and the effects of the combination of multiple antibiotics on the process parameters of broiler manure composting and the succession of bacterial and fungal community structures were systematically analyzed. Our results showed that at the initial period of composting, the combination of multiple antibiotics led to a delayed temperature and pH increase (T1: 57.0 degrees C, T2: 48.3 degrees C, T3: 45.5 degrees C on Day 3 for temperature and T1: 7.44, T2: 7.1, T3: 6.88 on Day 5 for pH), and a slow total nitrogen decrease (T1: 1.56%, T2: 1.82%, T3: 1.74% on Day 5). Although these effects decreased gradually with the degradation of antibiotics, the relative abundance of Actinobacteriota (T1: 13.29%, T2: 10.57%, T3: 8.99%) and Bacteroidota (T1:27.52%, T2:40.03%, T3:39.81%)) were still influenced by multiple antibiotic residuals until the end of composting period. Higher levels of antibiotics had more lasting effects on the bacterial community (T3 > T2). However, the combination of these two antibiotics did not significantly promote or inhibit the succession of the fungal community structure. The heatmaps showed that composting stage had a greater effect on the microbial community structures than antibiotics. The results provided a theoretical reference for composting broiler manure containing DOX and GAT.

AB  - Simple Summary: Alternatives to surgical castration are an important issue in pig production due to societal concerns regarding animal welfare. Castration of piglets is a common practice to avoid boar taint, an unpleasant taste (urine/fecal like) of meat from uncastrated male pigs. In view of abandoning surgical castration and introduction of new alternatives, such as raising entire male pigs and applying immunocastration, several new issues are emerging. These include boar taint occurrence in case of entire male pigs and a deteriorated raw material (meat, fat) quality, which can affect consumer perception. Therefore, more information is needed about the consumer acceptance of products from the different alternatives. In the present study, two types of dry-cured meat products were assessed to give some insights into the sensory characteristic and consumers' liking of the products coming from immunocastrated, entire male and surgically castrated animals.<br></p>
   <br></p>
   Consumer studies on acceptability of pork from immunocastrates (IC) and entire males (EM) are of primary importance, if these alternatives are to replace surgical castration (SC) of piglets. Data on the sensory traits and consumers acceptance of IC and EM meat products are still limited. Therefore, the purpose of the study was to (1) describe the sensory profile by quantitative descriptive analysis and (2) test the perception and consumer liking of salami (dry-fermented sausage) and pancetta (dry-cured belly) from EM, IC and SC animals. The consumer tests included the scaling method and check-all-that-apply. Profiling showed that EM products were scored lower in the overall sensory quality compared to IC or SC. EM products differed mainly from IC and SC in the intensity of the manure, sweat odor and flavor, persistent impression and texture (hardness, gumminess and easy to fragment). Salami samples did not differ in liking. In pancetta, the differences were significant for odor liking and visual quality (expected liking). Consumers did not perceive EM products as inferior in terms of liking, while sensory profiling indicated differences for boar taint presence and texture. Using meat originating from IC did not result in any differences in consumers acceptance as compared to products from SC.</p>

AB  - The Late Cretaceous of Western North America (Laramidia) supported a diverse dinosaur fauna, with duckbilled dinosaurs (Hadrosauridae) being among the most speciose and abundant members of this assemblage. Historically, collecting and preservational biases have meant that dinosaurs from Mexico and the American Southwest are poorly known compared to those of the northern Great Plains. However, evidence increasingly suggests that distinct species and clades inhabited southern Laramidia. Here, a new kritosaurin hadrosaurid, represented by the anterior part of a skull, is reported from the late Campanian of the Cerro del Pueblo Formation, similar to 72.5 Ma, in Coahuila, Mexico. The Cerro del Pueblo Formation kritosaur was originally considered to represent the same species as a saurolophine from the Olmos Formation of Sabinas, but the Sabinas hadrosaur is now considered a distinct taxon. More recently, the Cerro del Pueblo Formation kritosaur has been referred to Kritosaurus navajovius. We show it represents a new species related to Gryposaurus. The new species is distinguished by its large size, the shape of the premaxillary nasal process, the strongly downturned dentary, and massive denticles on the premaxilla's palatal surface, supporting recognition of a new taxon, Coahuilasaurus lipani. The dinosaur assemblage of the Cerro del Pueblo Formation shows higher diversity than the contemporaneous fauna of the Horseshoe Canyon Formation in Alberta. Furthermore, Kritosaurini, Lambeosaurini, and Parasaurolophini all persist into the latest Campanian in southern Laramidia after disappearing from northern Laramidia. These patterns suggest declining herbivore diversity seen at high latitudes may be a local, rather than global phenomenon, perhaps driven by cooling at high latitudes in the Late Campanian and Maastrichtian.

AB  - Meat, fruit, seeds and other high-energy bear foods are often highly localized and briefly available and understanding which factors influence bear consumption of these foods is a common focus of bear conservation and ecology. However, the most common bear foods, graminoids and forbs, are more widespread but of lower quality. We poorly understand how herbage consumption impacts bear physiology, such as endocrine system function that regulates homeostasis and stress responses. Here, we described bear diets with a novel approach, measuring the concentration of chlorophyll in bear scats (faecal chlorophyll) to index the proportion of the recent diet that was composed of leaves fromgraminoids and forbs. We measured faecal chlorophyll and faecal cortisol in 351 grizzly (Ursus arctos, n = 255) and black bear (Ursus americanus, n = 96) scats from Yellowstone National Park in 2008-2009. We compared models of faecal chlorophyll and faecal cortisol concentrations considering the effects of spatial, dietary, scat and bear-specific factors including species. Faecal chlorophyll levels were the strongest predictor of faecal cortisol in a manner that suggested an endocrine response to a low-energy diet. Both compounds were highest during the spring and early summer months, overlapping the breeding season when higher energy foods were less available. Effects of scat composition, scat weathering, bear age, bear sex, species and other factors that have previously been shown to influence faecal cortisol in bears were not important unless faecal chlorophyll was excluded from models. The top models of faecal chlorophyll suggested grazing was primarily influenced by spatial attributes, with greater grazing closer to recreational trails, implying that elevated cortisol with grazing could be a response to anthropogenic activity. Our results confirm that higher stress hormone concentrations correspond with lower quality diets in bears, particularly grazing, and that faecal chlorophyll shows promise as a metric for studying grazing behaviour and its consequences.

AB  - The Enemy Release Hypothesis (ERH) predicts that the escape from natural enemies, such as specialist herbivores, may explain the invasiveness of some invasive alien plants, maximizing their investment in growth and reproduction. This release from natural enemies might decrease the investment in expensive defense mechanisms (i.e., digestibility reducers) against the attack of specialist enemies, whilst increasing the investment in defenses (i.e., cheap toxins) and tolerance against the attack of generalist herbivores, as exposed by the Shifting Defense Hypothesis (SDH). To test this, we conducted a greenhouse experiment to compare morphological and physiological traits of Carpobrotus edulis, collected in its native (South Africa) and introduced (Chile and Spain) ranges, attacked by the generalist spittlebug Philaenus spumarius and the specialist scale insect Pulvinariella mesembryanthemi. Our results do not support the ER and SD hypotheses. We found that C. edulis plants collected from native and introduced ranges showed no significant differences in growth and defensive compounds studied for both controls and those plants under attack by the generalist P. spumarius (i.e., showing no increase in biomass or changes in biochemical defenses). In contrast, the specialist herbivore P. mesembryanthemi induced the production of total phenols and tannins and reduced the growth and survival of C. edulis plants. Overall, we found strong evidence that C. edulis is negatively affected by the attack of its specialist herbivore, but not by that of generalist herbivore, regardless of origin. The observed tolerance to generalist herbivores suggests the intriguing possibility of trait selection, allowing C. edulis plants to tolerate generalist herbivores more than specialists.

AB  - Traditionally, paleontologists have relied on the morphological features of bones and teeth to reconstruct the evolutionary relationships of extinct animals.(1) In recent decades, the analysis of ancient DNA recovered from macrofossils has provided a powerful means to evaluate these hypotheses and develop novel phylogenetic models.(2) Although a great deal of life history data can be extracted from bones, their scarcity and associated biases limit their information potential. The paleontological record of Beringia(3)-the unglaciated areas and former land bridge between northeast Eurasia and northwest North America-is relatively robust thanks to its perennially frozen ground favoring fossil preservation.(4,5)( )However, even here, the macrofossil record is significantly lacking in small-bodied fauna (e.g., rodents and birds), whereas questions related to migration and extirpation, even among well-studied taxa, remain crudely resolved. The growing sophistication of ancient environmental DNA (eDNA) methods have allowed for the identification of species within terres- trial/aquatic ecosystems,(6-12 )in paleodietary reconstructions,(13-19) and facilitated genomic reconstructions from cave contexts(8,20)(-2)(2) Murchie et al.(6,23 )used a capture enrichment approach to sequence a diverse range of faunal and floral DNA from permafrost silts deposited during the Pleistocene-Holocene transition.(24) Here, we expand on their work with the mitogenomic assembly and phylogenetic placement of Equus caballus (caballine horse), Bison priscus (steppe bison), Mammuthus primigenius (woolly mammoth), and Lagopus lagopus (willow ptarmigan) eDNA from multiple permafrost cores spanning the last 40,000 years. We identify a diverse metagenomic spectra of Pleistocene fauna and identify the eDNA co-occurrence of distinct Eurasian and American mitogenomic lineages.

AB  - The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of different extenders on the quality of European red deer epididymal sperm stored at 5 degrees C. Epididymal spermatozoa were collected post mortem from 10 stags and diluted with three extenders (Bovidyl (R), BoviFree (R), and BioXcell (R)) and stored at 5 degrees C. Sperm motility (TMOT), motility parameters (system CASA), plasma membrane integrity (SYBR-14(+)/PI-), acrosomal membrane integrity (FITC-PNA-/PI-), mitochondrial activity (JC-1/PI), viability, and apoptotic-like changes (YOPRO/PI) were evaluated. The analyses were conducted on the first and successive days of storage (D1-D7). The applied extender, storage time, and the interactions between these factors significantly (p < 0.001) affected most of the analyzed parameters whose values were highest in sperm samples stored in Bovidyl (R), regardless of storage time. In Bovidyl (R), BoviFree (R), and BioXcell (R) extenders, TMOT values were estimated at 83%, 63%, and 59%, respectively, on D3. The extenders significantly influenced DNA integrity on D7. The percentage of dead sperm increased from D3. The quality of stored sperm cells was significantly influenced by the extenders' biochemical composition. BoviFree (R) and BioXcell (R) contain glycerol which could contribute to deteriorating the quality of spermatozoa stored at 5 degrees C. Sperm cells stored in the egg yolk-based extender (Bovidyl (R)) were characterized by the highest viability and functionality.

AB  - This study aimed to investigate the changes in the blood metabolic profiles of grazing yaks during the cold season to reveal their physiological status and seek the nutrients needed to be supplemented. Six castrated yaks (3 years old) with 166.8 kg (standard deviation = 5.3) of liveweight grazed in the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau were used as experimental animals without supplementary feeding. Blood samples of each animal were collected in October and December 2015, and March 2016 for the analysis of serum biochemicals and metabolome. Results showed serum indices involved in protein metabolism in grazing yaks showed greater differences during the cold season than the metabolisms of energy or minerals. Cold stress in December had minor effects on the serum metabolic profiles of yaks compared with those in October. Yaks in October and December shared seven differential serum metabolites and enrichments of the "arachidonic acid metabolism" and "glycine, serine, and threonine metabolism" pathways compared with those in March caused by the shortage of feeds. Summarily, the nutrient deficiency would be influential on the physiological status of grazing yaks during the cold season, especially on the protein metabolism, which could be improved by supplementary feeds.

AB  - Excessive accumulation of periphyton biofilms could cause a series of environmental problems in the South-toNorth Water Diversion (SNWD) Canal. To better understand the determinants of periphyton biofilms, we applied generalized linear models (GLMs) and structural equation modelling (SEM) to compare and quantify the relative importance of multiple factors on the periphyton biofilm biomasses in the SNWD Canal and its upstream Danjiangkou Reservoir. The excessive accumulation of periphyton biofilms in the SNWD Canal was obviously higher than that of the reservoir. Our data indicate that water temperature is the most important abiotic factor for explaining the biofilm biomass. Biotic factors for explaining the biofilm biomasses are quite different in the two ecosystems. Evidence from GLMs and SEM shows that prawns (Macrobrachium nipponense) have a significant negative direct effect on the reservoir biofilm biomass, while gobies (Rhinogobius giurinus) have a significant positive indirect effect via molluscs on the canal biofilm biomass. The Bayesian mixing models from stable isotope data also verify that biofilms are a major component of the reservoir prawn diets (72.5 +/- 1.9%). However, in the canal, biofilms are the major component of the canal mollusc diets (70.2 +/- 19.8%), and a rather high proportional contribution of molluscs is found for the goby diets (67.4 +/- 8.0%). These results suggest the main paths of benthic food chains in the two ecosystems. In this study, we reveal the determinants of periphyton biofilm accumulation, which may provide useful information for biomanipulation in the SNWD and its upstream reservoir.

AB  - Camellia sect. Chrysantha is an important rare and protected plant species. Some golden Camellia species grow in karst soil while others grow in acidic soil. In order to study the adaptation mechanism of golden Camellia to the karst environment, four species of golden Camellia growing in the karst soil (Camellia pubipetala, Camellia perpetua, Camellia grandis, and Camellia limonia) and four species growing in the acidic soil (Camellia nitidissima, Camellia euphlebia, Camellia tunghinensis, and Camellia parvipetala) were selected for this study. Combining the metagenome and transcriptome, the structure and function of the rhizosphere microbial communities and the gene expression in roots of golden Camellia were analyzed. The results showed that the rhizosphere microbial communities in different golden Camellia were significantly different in abundance of Acidobacteria, Actinobacteria, Candidatus_Rokubacteria, Nitrospirae, Planctomycetes, and Candidatus_Tectomicrobia. The proportion of Candidatus_Rokubacteria was significantly higher in the rhizosphere soil of four species of golden Camellia grown in karst areas, compared to C. nitidissima, C. euphlebia, and C. tunghinensis. The linear discriminant analysis Effect Size showed that C. parvipetala was similar to karst species in the enrichment of ABC transporters and quorum sensing. During the transcriptome analysis, numerous upregulated genes in four karst species, including CYP81E, CHS, F3H, C12RT1, NAS, and CAD, were found to be enriched in the secondary metabolite synthesis pathway in the KEGG library, when compared to C. tunghinensis. This study provides information for plant adaptation mechanisms on the rhizosphere soil microbial composition and gene expression in secondary metabolic pathways to karst habitats and its distribution in karst areas.

AB  - A large amount of estrogen is introduced into the feed to improve livestock growth, excessive residual estrogen would exist in the excrements. The accumulation of estrogen can cause the water and soil pollution around the farm, further inhibit growth and induce caner for organisms and human. Anaerobic digestion (AD) could effectively remove estrogen in livestock manure while the mechanism is still unclear. In this study, the mechanism of estrogen removal by AD was explored during AD process of pig manure. Estrone (E1), estradiol (E2) estriol (E3) and ethinylestradiol (EE2) were selected as research subjects. The removal rates of E1, E2, E3 and EE2 were 19.14, 28.62, 25.83 and 11.81%. Dissolved organic matters (DOM), especially humic acid, play an important role in reducing bioavailability of estrogen. Estrogen will be absorbed by DOM through structures such as aromatic ring and amides. Estrogen may also promote the growth of microorganisms which could degrade estrogen, such as Rhodococcus, Sphingomonas and Pseudomonas. The amount of these microorganisms and dissolved microbial metabolites did not change obviously. This study would give a new explanation for the removal of estrogen and can provide theoretical support for harmless treatment of pig manure.

AB  - Herbivorous insects from diverse feeding guild cause defoliation with different intensity and dissimilar tissue effects. We studied the effects on water relations and morpho-structural and hydraulic traits of Prunus avium leaves caused by two different patterns of artificial herbivory (the window feeding and cut treatments) that mimic the effect of insects such as Caliroa cerasi and lepidopteran larvae. The cut treatment resulted in higher leaf dry mass per area and leaf hydraulic conductance in the remaining tissue in relation to the window feeding treatment and the control. The window feeding treatment increased the tissue elasticity and decrease the stomatal conductance. Although each herbivory pattern affected to different leaf traits, all changes were on traits relevant to drought resistance. These results contribute to improve our understanding on plant-herbivore interactions.

AB  - Protecting rare, endemic, and endangered species requires careful habitat evaluation to set strategic plans for mitigating biodiversity loss and prioritizing conservation goals. The endangered Asian elephant (Elephas maximus) exemplifies the urgent need for targeted conservation efforts, given its challenging habitat conditions. This study examines the impact of climate and land use changes on the suitable habitat distribution of Asian elephants. Utilizing ten predictor variables, including climatic, topographic, and land use data, and employing six ensemble Species Distribution Models (SDMs) alongside Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 data, the study estimates spatial changes and potential habitat expansions for Asian elephants across Tropical Asia. Occurrence data were gathered from field surveys in Bangladesh and the Global Biodiversity Information Facility database for Sri Lanka, Myanmar, Bhutan, Cambodia, India, Laos, Nepal, Thailand, and Vietnam. To evaluate habitat suitability, the analysis considered two distinct socioeconomic pathways (SSP 245 and SSP 370) across two future periods (2041-2060 and 2061-2080). Results reveal a strong correlation between isothermality and habitat suitability, with higher isothermality enhancing the habitat conditions for Asian elephants. Among the SDMs, the random forest model demonstrated the highest performance. Projected scenarios indicate significant habitat fragmentation by 2061-2080, heightening the risk of species' vulnerability. Specifically, in SSP 245, the north zone is anticipated to experience a higher rate of habitat loss (588.443 km2/year), whereas, in SSP 370, the west zone is expected to face a more severe rate of habitat loss (1,798.56 km2/year). The eastern zone, which includes Cambodia, Vietnam, Laos, Thailand, and southern Myanmar, is notably at risk, with an estimated habitat loss of 14.8 million hectares. Anticipated changes in climate and land cover will impact the availability of essential resources such as food, water, and shelter, potentially driving the species to relocate to different elevation belts. The outcomes of the consensus map highlighting critical habitats and future fragmentation scenarios will support effective conservation and management strategies for the species.

AB  - Inducible defense is an important anti-insect strategy in plants. This study investigated whether larval feeding by Hyphantria cunea at low-density and high-density levels can initiate inducible defense responses in the low-fitness host plant Tilia amurensis on the 7th- and 21th-day post-feeding. The results revealed significant alterations in the nutrient composition (e.g., amino acids, soluble sugars, and total proteins) within T. amurensis, with notable decreases observed on the 7th-day post-feeding, followed by increases on the 21st day, respectively. Specifically, the low-density feeding group prompted significant increases in tannin, total phenols, and total flavonoids on the 7th day, whereas the high-density feeding group induced significant decreases in these compounds. Conversely, total alkaloid levels exhibited an inverse pattern, with lignin contents notably decreasing. By the 21st-day post-feeding, all secondary metabolites demonstrated significant increases. Expression analysis of flavonoid biosynthetic genes mirrors the changes observed in the total flavonoid content. Furthermore, larval feeding activates the alpha-linoleic acid metabolism pathway consistently across all time points. Subsequent generations of H. cunea larvae in low-density feeding and high-density feeding groups demonstrated decreased growth, along with downregulation of growth regulatory genes and key genes involved in energy metabolism, digestion, and detoxification. Notably, the expression of digestive gene LIP10 and detoxification genes GST18 and CARE14 exhibits adaptive regulation in response to T. amurensis' inducible defense. Overall, larval feeding by H. cunea elicits a robust and enduring inducible defense response in T. amurensis, ultimately decreasing the fitness of the subsequent generations of H. cunea larvae on T. amabilis.

AB  - Knowledge on cortical development is based mainly on rodents besides primates and carnivores, all being altricial. Here, we analyzed a precocial animal, the pig, looking at dorsoparietal cortex from E45 to P90. At E45, most ionized calcium-binding adapter molecule 1-positive (Iba1+) cells had a macrophage-like morphology and resided in meninges and choroid plexus. Only a few cells were scattered in the ventricular and subventricular zone (VZ and SVZ). At E60/E70, all laminar compartments displayed microglia cells at a low-to-moderate density, being highest in VZ and SVZ followed by intermediate zone/white matter (IZ/WM). The cortical plate and marginal zone displayed only a few Iba1+ cells. Cells were intensely labeled, but still had poorly arborized somata and many resembled ameboid, macrophage-like microglia. Concurrent with a massive increase in cortical volume, microglia cell density increased until E85, and further until E100/E110 (birth at E114) to densities that resemble those seen postnatally. A fraction of microglia colabeled with Ki67 suggesting proliferation in all laminar compartments. Cell-to-cell distance decreased substantially during this time, and the fraction of microglia to all nuclei and to neurons increases in the laminar compartments. Eventually, of all cortical DAPI+ nuclei 7-12% were Iba1+ microglia. From E70 onwards, more and more cells with ramified processes were present in MZ down to IZ/WM, showing, for instance, a close association with NeuN+, NPY+, and GAD65/67+ somata and axon initial segments. These results suggested that the development of microglia cell density and morphology proceeds rapidly from mid-gestation onwards reaching near-adult status already before birth.

AB  - Tripartite interactions between plants, herbivores, and pollinators hold fitness consequences for most angiosperms. However, little is known on how plants evolve in response-and in particular what the net selective outcomes are for traits of shared relevance to pollinators and herbivores. In this study, we manipulated herbivory ("presence" and "absence" treatments) and pollination ("open" and "hand pollination" treatments) in a full factorial common-garden experiment with woodland strawberry (Fragaria vesca L.). This design allowed us to quantify the relative importance and interactive effects of herbivore- and pollinator-mediated selection on nine traits related to plant defence and attraction. Our results showed that pollinators imposed stronger selection than herbivores on traits related to both direct and indirect (i.e., tritrophic) defence. However, conflicting selection was imposed on inflorescence density: a trait that appears to be shared by herbivores and pollinators as a host plant signal. However, in all cases, selection imposed by one agent depended largely on the presence or ecological effect of the other, suggesting that dynamic patterns of selection could be a common outcome of these interactions in natural populations. As a whole, our findings highlight the significance of plant-herbivore-pollinator interactions as potential drivers of evolutionary change, and reveal that pollinators likely play an underappreciated role as selective agents on direct and in direct plant defence.

AB  - Vehicles kill many wild animals worldwide, including in protected areas, where the impacts of roads are increasing due to road development, the rise of human population at their boundaries, and the growing interest in wildlife tourism. Yet, knowledge on the factors influencing wildlife roadkills within protected areas is limited, particularly for large carnivores. Here we investigated spotted hyena (Crocuta crocuta) roadkills inside a protected area, the Serengeti National Park, Tanzania, between 1989 and 2023 (n = 104). We examined spatial determinants of hyena roadkills using a generalized linear model, temporal and spatiotemporal patterns in hyena roadkills, and the effect of age, sex, and social status on hyena mortality due to vehicles. Roadkills were more likely on main roads and the locations and number of roadkills varied according to seasonal changes in the locations of vast migratory ungulate herds, which are the main prey of hyenas. Adult females, who travel the most to forage on these herds, suffered the highest levels of road mortality. Road mortality was independent from social status among females. Our results indicate that roadkill patterns were shaped by both road characteristics, as incidence was substantially higher on main roads, and large-scale seasonal changes in the location of migratory prey. Further, the incidence of hyena roadkills was exacerbated by long-distance 'commuting' trips to areas containing large aggregation of migratory herbivores. Our findings provide new insight on ecological and individual factors modulating roadkill incidence in a large carnivore.

AB  - Optically thin layers of tiny ice particles near the summer mesopause, known as noctilucent clouds, are of significant interest within the aeronomy and climate science communities. Ground-based optical cameras mounted at various locations in the arctic regions collect the dataset during favorable summer times. In this paper, first, we compare the performances of various deep learning-based image classifiers against a baseline machine learning model trained with support vector machine (SVM) algorithm to identify an effective and lightweight model for the classification of noctilucent clouds. The SVM classifier is trained with histogram of oriented gradient (HOG) features, and deep learning models such as SqueezeNet, ShuffleNet, MobileNet, and Resnet are fine-tuned based on the dataset. The dataset includes images observed from different locations in northern Europe with varied weather conditions. Second, we investigate the most informative pixels for the classification decision on test images. The pixel-level attributions calculated using the guide back-propagation algorithm are visualized as saliency maps. Our results indicate that the SqueezeNet model achieves an F1 score of 0.95. In addition, SqueezeNet is the lightest model used in our experiments, and the saliency maps obtained for a set of test images correspond better with relevant regions associated with noctilucent clouds.

AB  - Simple Summary Natural flavor compounds can stimulate people's senses of smell and taste; as indicators of food sensory quality, such compounds influence the acceptance by consumers. In addition, natural antioxidants are becoming popular among consumers because they are safe and have no adverse side effects. Purple corn anthocyanins are polyphenolic compounds with natural antioxidant properties that exist widely in nature. Research has shown that anthocyanins can provide extra electrons to the free radicals, preventing lipid oxidation and improving muscle volatile components. However, no information is available concerning the effect of feeding anthocyanin on goat meat volatile compounds. This was the first study to investigate the effects of dietary anthocyanins from purple corn supplementation on lipid mechanism, body composition, volatile compound profiles, and related gene expression in the longissimus thoracis et lumborum muscle of goats. The current study indicates that the consumption of purple corn anthocyanin by growing goats improves mutton flavor by decreasing plasma lipid metabolism parameters and by modulating the abundance of several flavor-related genes in the longissimus thoracis et lumborum muscle. The results will help to understand the mechanism of action of anthocyanins on the flavor compounds, providing the rationale for anthocyanins regulating mutton flavor through related signaling pathways of ruminants in future studies. The current study aimed to investigate the effect of anthocyanins on muscle flavor compound profiles in goats. Goats in three groups were fed a basic diet or a diet supplemented with 0.5 g/d or 1 g/d anthocyanin-rich purple corn pigment (PCP). Compared to the control group, plasma total cholesterol was significantly decreased (p < 0.05) in the anthocyanin groups. The feeding of anthocyanin increased (p < 0.05) flavor compound types and total alcohol level, whereas it decreased (p < 0.05) total hydrocarbons, aromatics, esters, and miscellaneous compounds in the longissimus thoracis et lumborum muscle (LTL). Adding PCP to the diet enriched (p < 0.05) vegetal, herbaceous, grease, and fruity flavors compared to the control group. The 0.5 g/d PCP group had increased (p < 0.05) abundance of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma, but there was a decreased (p < 0.05) level of lipoprotein lipase in LTL. Collectively, this study indicated that anthocyanin can improve mutton flavor by decreasing plasma lipid parameters and by modulating the abundance of several flavor-related genes of goats.

AB  - The incidental capture by marine fisheries as bycatch poses a global threat to pelagic sharks and rays. In large, industrialized fisheries that often operate in areas beyond national jurisdiction, at least 22 threatened species of pelagic elasmobranchs are caught as bycatch, representing the majority of megafauna bycatch in tuna fisheries. Here, we investigate (1) the efficacy of the current policies of the five tuna-related Regional Fisheries Management Organizations (tRFMOs) in mitigating elasmobranch bycatch, (2) data needed to better assess the amount and impact of elasmobranch bycatch and (3) the research necessary for the adoption of new policies. We found that tRFMOs have adopted 34 active policies that address pelagic elasmobranch bycatch. However, most policies (similar to 76%, n = 26) are unlikely to avoid or minimize elasmobranch bycatch. Instead, most policies focus on mitigating post-capture mortality via remediation and requiring or encouraging research and data collection. Despite the emphasis on research mandates, we find that the existence of research was not related to policy adoption, suggesting that lack of research has not historically prohibited policymaking. Overall, we suggest that current research and data transparency, though perhaps not necessary for policy adoption, are not sufficient to adequately evaluate the population-level impacts of bycatch on many elasmobranch species in tRFMO-managed fisheries. Given these results, we recommend a precautionary approach that involves reforms in tRFMO voting processes to facilitate the adoption of binding requirements for elasmobranch catch limits, bycatch avoidance, pre- and post-capture handling and release modifications and protection of areas important to threatened pelagic elasmobranchs.

AB  - Injection of pig slurry (PS) into soils under no-tillage system (NTS) is more efficient for improving soil chemical and physical attributes, and reducing C and N emissions, than surface applications. This study evaluated the effect of using injection and surface application of PS, compared to NPK and control treatments, on the soil aggregate, C and N contents, and isotopes C-13 and N-15. The NTS consisted of rotations of summer (maize) and winter (black oat and wheat) grasses from 2011 to 2015. The treatments were PS injected into the soil (PSI), PS applied on the soil surface (PSS), chemical fertilization (NPK), and control (CTRL). The following soil properties were evaluated in the 0-5, 5-10, and 10-20 cm layers: aggregate stability (geometric mean diameter - GMD; aggregate mass distribution); total organic carbon (TOC) and total nitrogen (TN) in macroaggregates (8.0-0.25 mm), microaggregates (<0.25 mm), and bulk soil (<2.0 mm); and isotopes C-13 and N-15 in macro and microaggregates. The application of PSI improved the soil physical attributes, presenting higher GMD (0-5 cm) than the PSS, NPK, and CTRL treatments. In the 5-10 cm layer, the PSI treatments were more efficient in increasing the GMD and macroaggregate mass than the NPK. PSI also was more efficient in increasing TOC and TN when compared to PSS, and generated a higher GMD, which are protectors of these elements in the soil. The natural abundance of N-15 denoted the lower soil organic matter decomposition in the PSI treatment when compared to the PSS. The natural abundance of C-13 showed less-negative values in macroaggregates than in microaggregates, denoting that the soil management practices and crops used (grasses) affected positively the abundance of C-13. After seven applications of PS in maize-oat-wheat rotation in NTS, the application of PSI was more efficient in improving the soil physical and chemical attributes than the application of PSS.

AB  - Plants mediate above-and belowground interactions within insect assemblages via herbivore-induced plant volatiles and thereby influence host plant colonization by different herbivores. By changing shoot-emitted volatiles, herbivores may disrupt the host location behavior of heterospecific herbivores and natural enemies. However, effects of simultaneous conspecific above-and belowground herbivory on multiple trophic levels have received little attention. First, we infested Chinese tallow tree plants with aboveground feeding adults and/or belowground feeding larvae of a beetle (Bikasha collaris) alone or together with heterospecific above-or belowground herbivores. Then, we determined the preferences of heterospecific above-and belowground herbivores plus an entomopathogenic soil nematode for these plants in greenhouse experiments and olfactometer trials. Finally, we used gas chromatography-mass spectrometry to analyze above-and below ground volatiles variation among different feeding treatments. We found that Spodoptera litura moths avoided plants with herbivory by B. collaris larvae and adults via herbivore-induced plant volatiles. The herbivorous belowground feeding grub Holotrichia parallela avoided plants with above-or belowground herbivory. The parasitic nematode Heterorhabditis megidis preferred plants that had B. collaris larvae. Furthermore, the profiles of both leaf and root volatiles induced by B. collaris larvae and adults plus other herbivores varied. These results hint that interactions involving above-and belowground conspecific herbivores could shape plant rhizosphere and phyllosphere herbivore communities by modifying above-and belowground volatiles, as well as by modulating colonization by other herbivores and associated natural enemies.

AB  - The Min pig is a national-level protected pig that is recognized as a rare animal in China, lives in a constantly cold environment in the north of China, and has excellent characteristics compared with other commercial pigs. The Min pig has the specific character of secondary hair growth in winter and seasonal cycling. International research on hair follicles is mainly focused on human and mice hair, including hair follicle regeneration and hair loss treatment. Research on hair follicles in pigs is limited. The structure and morphology of hair follicles from Min pigs are different from those of lean-type pigs, such as Yorkshire and Berkshire pigs, which do not grow secondary hairs in the adult stage. In this study, there were significant gene expression differences with high-throughput sequencing to determine the primary and secondary hairs. Based on skin blocker experimental results, we can infer that the Wnt and BMP signaling could stimulate follicle stem cells in the Min pig.In China, the national-level protected pig, the Min pig, is characterized by the development of secondary hairs and hair follicles in winter. Factors that dominate the genotype in the growth of secondary hairs are not clear through the concrete cell signaling pathways. This study compared hair phenotypes based on morphological structure, transcriptomics, and potential targeting molecules in the breeds of Min, Berkshire, and Yorkshire pigs. The results indicated that Min pigs have specific characteristics for the growth of secondary hairs compared with the Berkshire and Yorkshire pigs. The transcriptome analyses and quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction results revealed that secondary hair growth was activated by follicle stem cells. The specific inhibitors of Wnt and BMP were studied using respective signals. The density of follicles, activity of follicle stem cells, and relative gene expression results have shown that Wnt and BMP stimulate the activity of follicle stem cells, and the Wnt signaling molecule has a significantly better effect than the BMP signaling molecule on stem cells. Wnt and BMP can promote the growth of local secondary hair and gene expression. Therefore, this study was conducted to verify the development mechanisms of secondary hairs, which have potential applications in laboratory animals and comparative medicine.

AB  - Simple Summary Sheep breeding is a long-standing tradition throughout Germany. Due to breeding in marginal and harsh sites, sheep developed into a large number of unique breeds adapted to many different ecosystems. In this work, we study demographic measures of genetic diversity and inbreeding trends in 35 sheep breeds using the national database of herdbook breeders in Germany. This database is a valuable resource to manage and monitor diversity in breeding populations. The loss of genetic diversity was found in all breeds studied, mainly due to genetic drift rather than unequal use of founders. The analysis of pedigree data from more than 1.4 million sheep revealed an overall measure of inbreeding of F = 0.031, an individual rate of inbreeding of Delta F-i = 0.0074, and a realized effective population size of N-e = 91.4 with 25-75% quartiles of 0.019-0.040, 0.0040-0.0086, and 57.9-125.3, respectively. Trends in individual inbreeding were significantly positive in meat and mountain sheep, but trends in the individual rate of inbreeding were only slightly positive. Country sheep showed significantly negative trends in the rate of individual inbreeding. Ancestral inbreeding had increasing trends in all sheep breeds. Our results demonstrate the efficiency of genetic diversity management and should help to conserve endangered breeds and maintain high genetic diversity in breeds used for wool, meat, and milk production. In Germany, many autochthonous sheep breeds have developed, adapted to mountain, heath, moorland, or other marginal sites, but breeds imported from other countries have also contributed to the domestic breeds, particularly improving wool and meat quality. Selective breeding and the intense use of rams may risk losing genetic diversity and increasing rates of inbreeding. On the other hand, breeds with a low number of founder animals and only regional popularity may not leave their endangered status, as the number of breeders interested in the breed is limited. The objective of the present study was to determine demographic measures of genetic diversity and recent as well as ancestral trends of inbreeding in all autochthonous German sheep breeds and sheep of all breeding directions, including wool, meat, and milk. We used pedigree data from 1,435,562 sheep of 35 different breeds and a reference population of 981,093 sheep, born from 2010 to 2020. The mean number of equivalent generations, founders, effective founders, effective ancestors, and effective founder genomes were 5.77, 1669, 123.2, 63.5, and 33.0, respectively. Genetic drift accounted for 69% of the loss of genetic diversity, while loss due to unequal founder contributions was 31%. The mean inbreeding coefficient, individual rate of inbreeding ( increment F-i), and realized effective population size across breeds were 0.031, 0.0074, and 91.4, respectively, with a significantly decreasing trend in increment F-i in 11/35 breeds. New inbreeding, according to Kalinowski, contributed to 71.8% of individual inbreeding, but ancestral inbreeding coefficients showed an increasing trend in all breeds. In conclusion, in our study, all but one of the mountain-stone sheep breeds and the country sheep breed Wald were the most vulnerable populations, with N-e < 50. The next most endangered breeds are exotic, country, and heath breeds, with average N-e of 66, 83, and 89, respectively. The wool, meat, and milk breeds showed the highest genetic diversity, with average N-e of 158, 120, and 111, respectively.
   The results of our study should help strengthen conservation program efforts for the most endangered sheep breeds and maintain a high genetic diversity in all sheep breeds.

AB  - This study assessed the outcomes of nonsurgical embryo recovery (NSER) after superovulation (SOV) in five locally adapted Brazilian breeds of sheep and goats. The objective was to evaluate the feasibility and efficiency of using SOV combined with a less-invasive embryo collection technique for supplying the Brazilian animal gene bank with germplasm from specific genotypes of interest. Morada Nova (n = 20), Santa Ines (n = 20), and Somalis (n = 20) ewes received an intravaginal progesterone (330 mg) device for 9 days, while Caninde (n = 15) and Moxoto (n = 15) goats received an intravaginal medroxyprogesterone acetate (60 mg) device for 6 days. All females received 133 mg of porcine follicle-stimulating hormone (pFSH) administrated in six decreasing doses 12 hours apart, starting 60 hours before device removal, plus 37.5 mu g of d-cloprostenol at the fifth and sixth pFSH dose. Donors in estrus were mated with fertile males. The corpora lutea (CL) number was assessed by ultrasonography 1 day before NSER. On day 6.5 or 7 after estrus, NSER was performed following hormonally induced cervical relaxation. A total of 97% of sheep and 90% of goats responded with estrus, and among those, 91% of sheep and 85% of goats presented a CL. In ewes, the numbers of CL were greater (p < 0.05) in the Santa Ines breed, while similar (p > 0.05) CL numbers were found among the goat breeds. All viable embryos were freezable (excellent and good quality) and the number per donor was 7.8 for sheep and 4.9 for goats. All parameters of NSER efficiency, embryo yield, and fertility post-NSER did not differ (p > 0.05) between breeds among each species. The SOV-NSER procedures applied for an embryo biobank supply of locally adapted Brazilian breeds of small ruminants were efficient regarding production of cryopreservable embryos, and preservation of donor fertility. Therefore, SOV followed by NSER is recommended for embryo biobank assembly in sheep and goats.

AB  - Organic sheep milk production under a protected designation of origin for Roquefort cheese in Aveyron, France, has developed over the past several years. This niche market provides farmers with a favorable economic context due to high and stable milk prices. However, a variety of risks threatens this favorable context. This raises questions about driving factors behind resilience of organic dairy sheep farms. Unlike previous studies, we assessed the subjective resilience of farms from the perspective of farmers. We assumed that the maintenance or improvement of farmers' satisfaction over time, despite a variety of disturbances, demonstrates the ability of farms to maintain their productive functions without undermining natural resources, while ensuring fair income and good working conditions. Based on analytical frameworks from research on livestock farming systems and social-ecological resilience, we aimed to understand the combined evolution of farm structure, farming practices, and farmers' satisfaction to identify the driving factors behind subjective resilience on organic dairy sheep farms. We observed a general trend for an increase in farm size. We also used sparse partial least squares analysis to relate changes in farmer satisfaction to changes in farm structure and farming practices. On the 36 organic dairy sheep farms studied, increasing ewe productivity was the main driving factor improving subjective farm resilience in a context of high milk prices. An increase in ewe productivity was often associated with high rates of feed concentrate distribution and a sharp decrease in grazing duration on a few farms. The change in farming practices resulting from this productivity paradigm highlighted a trend toward the conventionalization of organic sheep milk production. Underlying principles of this conventionalization were sometimes at odds with resilience factors of social-ecological systems reported in the literature. This calls for caution when using farmers' satisfaction as a proxy of farm resilience and suggests combining subjective assessment with more objective approaches.

AB  - Yak is an excellent germplasm resource on the Tibetan Plateau and is able to live in high-altitude areas with hypoxic, cold, and harsh environments. Studies on induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) in large ruminants commonly involve a combination strategy involving six transcription factors, Oct4, Sox2, Klf4, c-Myc, Nanog, and Lin28 (OSKMNL). This strategy tends to utilize genes from the same species to optimize pluripotency maintenance. In this study, we cloned the six pluripotency genes (OSKMNL) from yak and constructed a multi-cistronic lentiviral vector carrying these genes. This vector efficiently delivered the genes into yak fibroblasts, aiming to promote the reprogramming process. We verified that the treated cells had several pluripotency characteristics, marking the first successful construction of a lentiviral system carrying yak pluripotency genes. This achievement lays the foundation for subsequent establishment of yak iPSCs and holds significant implications for yak-breed improvement and germplasm-resource conservation.

AB  - 1. Matching the timing of life-history transitions with ecosystem phenology is critical for the survival of many species, especially those undertaking long-distance migrations. As a result, whether and how migratory populations adjust timing of life-history transitions in response to environmental variability are important questions in ecology and conservation. Yet the flexibility and drivers of life-history transitions remain largely untested for migratory marine populations, which contend with the unique spatiotemporal dynamics and sensory conditions found in marine ecosystems.
   2. Here, using an acoustic signature of blue whales' regional population-level transition from foraging to breeding migration, we document significant interannual flexibility in the timing of this life-history transition (spanning roughly 4 months) over a continuous 6-year study period.
   3. We further show that variability in the timing of this transition follows the oceanographic phenology of blue whales' foraging habitat, with a later transition from foraging to breeding migration occurring in years with an earlier onset, later peak and greater accumulation of biological productivity.
   4. These findings indicate that blue whales delay the transition from foraging to southward migration in years of the highest and most persistent biological productivity, consistent with the hypothesis that this population maximizes energy intake on foraging grounds rather than departing towards breeding grounds as soon as sufficient energy reserves are accumulated.
   5. The use of flexible cues (e.g. foraging conditions and long-distance acoustic signals) in timing a major life-history transition may be key to the persistence of this endangered population facing the pressures of rapid environmental change. Furthermore, these results extend theoretical understanding of the flexibility and drivers of population-level migration to a relatively solitary marine migrant.

AB  - Plants draw from various genetically controlled defenses to protect against herbivores and pathogens. The efficacy of alternative defenses can vary with the biology and phylogeny of the enemy. Dryocosmus kuriphilus, an invasive gall maker native to China, has become one of the main pests of chestnut trees around the world. We studied genetic variation in resistance and susceptibility to D. kuriphilus within a replicated blocked planting of 12 chestnut genotypes established in Galicia, Spain in 2004. We found very high genetic variation in susceptibility to D. kuriphilus. We evaluated if the variation was due to host selection by the wasp, differential efficacy of inducible defenses in the trees, or variability in susceptibility of the plant to manipulation by the gallmaker. We assessed host selection by counting number of eggs laid by females in tree buds and comparing preferences with phytochemistry. We also measured inducible changes in phytochemistry within and around galls, gall physical characteristics, parasitism, and insect fitness. The effective defense mechanisms in resistant genotypes involved (1) hypersensitive reactions to eggs or neonates within buds and (2) early precise abscission of nascent galls from expanding leaves. Surprisingly, the genetic resistance to D. kuriphilus of the chestnut genotypes we tested was not related to phenols, terpenes, and primary nutrition.

AB  - Archaeological evidence for penned animals is increasingly used to indicate managed livestock. Advances in techniques allowing the identification of dung and urine-derived components in sediments have enabled the expansion of this line of enquiry. Corralling animals into settlements protected them from predators at night and provided more control over their breeding. Deposits associated with livestock management at Neolithic settlements across Southwest Asia sometimes contain bones of perinatal animals. Reviewing the literature, it is evident that these faunal remains are not systematically reported or preserved in all burial environments. However, their distribution may reflect different patterns of livestock integration into human settlements. The presence of perinatal remains at sites where early livestock herding took place has important implications. Not only are they compelling evidence for herd management, particularly if there is also evidence for penning deposits, but also death of livestock during the perinatal phase of life informs us about the health of animals in early herds. This in turn, provides information about the skills needed by early pastoralists as they developed animal management strategies and the possible effect of transmissible diseases as animals were kept together in closer proximity.

AB  - Host plant resources are a major issue in gall-insect ecology. Soil fertilization may affect both plant quality and indirect defenses, as well as the prey quality of herbivores for predators. The soil fertility hypothesis (SFH) claims that gall-inducing insects infest more plants growing on poor than on fertile soils. Until now this was studied and supported only by observations in natural tropical biomes. We tested its validity in a field experiment in a Mediterranean region, using four aphid species (Hemiptera: Aphididae, Eriosomatinae) that induce galls in wild Pistacia atlantica Desf. (Anacardiaceae) trees, and their main enemies. The impact of fertilization was examined in control trees that were not fertilized ('poor soil') and others that were fertilized with NPK for either one or two consecutive growing seasons. Average internode length in apical shoots of fertilized trees was longer than in control trees, following SFH expectations. We did not detect a different number of aphid species in each tree, contrary to SFH predictions. Fertilization lowered the number of galls, the gall survival, and the mean number of aphids inside the galls, as expected by the SFH. All the galls suffered increased attacks by enemies in fertilized trees, as expected by the SFH. In conclusion, following this field experiment, the SFH should not be rejected as a possible framework in research on galling-insect ecology.

AB  - Pharmaceutical biowastes, rich in organic matter and high in moisture, are typical light industry byproducts with waste and renewable attributes. Thermochemical and biochemical conversion technologies transform these residues into value-added bioproducts, including biofuels, biofertilizers, and bio-carbon materials. Hydrothermal pretreatment effectively removes toxic substances and enhances feedstock for these processes. This review comprehensively examines its role in improving the formation of bioproducts from pharmaceutical biowastes, focusing on (i) upgrading and denitrogenating solid biofuels with better combustion performance; (ii) enhancing biodegradability and gaseous biofuel production via organic matter decomposition; (iii) enriching soluble carbon and nitrogen for liquid biofertilizer; (iv) eliminating antibiotic residues and reducing antibiotic resistance in solid biofertilizers; and (v) stabilizing carbon and nitrogen structures and optimizing pore characteristics for functionalized carbon materials. The review recommends a potential staged thermochemical approach to co-produce nitrogen-enriched liquid biofertilizers and porous carbon materials from pharmaceutical biowastes. Hydrothermal pretreatment emerges as a key technique for facilitating the migration and conversion of essential elements like carbon and nitrogen. This study reveals the potential of hydrothermal pretreatment to address the limitations of pharmaceutical biowastes and offers insights into their valorization.

AB  - A wide range of ant-plant mutualistic associations are known to occur in terrestrial ecosystems. Although many species of plants recruit ants to obtain protection from herbivores, myrmecophily is rare, since only few plant species are known to be adapted for pollination predominantly by ants. The annual herb, Euphorbia hirta, is characterized by the 'ant-pollination syndrome' including traits such as unisexual flowers, inconspicuous cyathia clustered in globose cymes, inflorescence-associated tiny nectaries and short, semi-erect stem. In present study, we aimed to examine the pollination ecology of Euphorbia hirta and the role of ants in its pollination. Field and laboratory experiments conducted to understand the association between E. hirta plants and ants revealed that seven ant species (belonging to five genera and three subfamilies) visited E. hirta plants. The visitation patterns of ants revealed that in a single foraging trip the ants visited a number of plants indicating their potential role in cross-pollination. Field-based exclusion experiments revealed production of significantly higher number of fruits in E. hirta plants under open pollination treatment as compared to other treatments. Scanning electron microscopy revealed that the adherence of the pollen grains to the bristles located on ant mouth-parts was facilitated by the three vertical, semi-circular grooves present on the grain surface. The number of fruits produced per plant was higher in ant-included plants as compared to only winged insect-pollinated and only self-pollinated plants suggesting that the plant-visiting ants are successful pollination vectors of E. hirta and while promoting self-pollination also contribute towards cross-pollination services.

AB  - This study investigated the effects of an illuminated night on sleep, mood, and cognitive performance in non-seasonal diurnal zebra finches that were exposed for 6 weeks to an ecologically relevant dimly lit night (12L:12dLAN; 150 lx: 5 lx) with controls on the dark night (12L:12D; 150 lx: < 0.01 lx). Food and water were provided ad libitum. Under dLAN (dim light at night), birds showed disrupted nocturnal (frequent awakenings) and overall decreased sleep duration. They also exhibited a compromised novel object exploration, a marker of the bird's mood state, and committed more errors, took significantly longer duration to learn with low retrieval performance of the learned task when tested for a color- discrimination (learning) task under the dLAN. Further, compared to controls, there was reduced mRNA expression level of genes involved in the neurogenesis, neural plasticity (bdnf, dcx and egr1) and motivation (th, drd2, taar1 and htr2c; dopamine synthesis and signaling genes) in the brain (hippocampus (HP), nidopallium caudolaterale (NCL), and midbrain) of birds under dLAN. These results show concurrent negative behavioral and molecular neural effects of the dimly illuminated nights, and provide insights into the possible impact on sleep and mental health in diurnal species inhabiting an increasingly urbanized ecosystem.

AB  - Plants emit biogenic volatile organic compounds (BVOCs) as signaling molecules, playing a crucial role in inducing resistance against herbivores. Neighboring plants that eavesdrop on BVOC signals can also increase defenses against herbivores or alter growth patterns to respond to potential risks of herbivore damage. Despite the significance of BVOC emissions, the evolutionary rationales behind their release and the factors contributing to the diversity in such emissions remain poorly understood. To unravel the conditions for the evolution of BVOC emission, we developed a spatially explicit model that formalizes the evolutionary dynamics of BVOC emission and non-emission strategies. Our model considered two effects of BVOC signaling that impact the fitness of plants: intra-individual communication, which mitigates herbivore damage through the plant's own BVOC signaling incurring emission costs, and inter-individual communication, which alters the influence of herbivory based on BVOC signals from other individuals without incurring emission costs. Employing two mathematical models-the lattice model and the random distribution model-we investigated how intra-individual communication, inter-individual communication, and spatial structure influenced the evolution of BVOC emission strategies. Our analysis revealed that the increase in intra-individual communication promotes the evolution of the BVOC emission strategy. In contrast, the increase in inter-individual communication effect favors cheaters who benefit from the BVOCs released from neighboring plants without bearing the costs associated with BVOC emission. Our analysis also demonstrated that the narrower the spatial scale of BVOC signaling, the higher the likelihood of BVOC evolution. This research sheds light on the intricate dynamics governing the evolution of BVOC emissions and their implications for plant-plant communication.
   We explored the evolutionary dynamics of biogenic volatile organic compound (BVOC) emissions in plants, which serve as signaling molecules crucial for inducing resistance against herbivores with spatially explicit models. We revealed the increase in intra-individual communication promotes the evolution of BVOCs, while heightened inter-individual communication favors individuals benefiting from BVOCs of neighboring plants without incurring emission costs. The study underscores the importance of spatial scale in BVOC signaling and contributes to understanding the formation of plant-plant communication.image

AB  - Excess nitrogen excretion, ammonia and odour are environmental pollutants associated with pig production. Reducing dietary crude protein (CP) will lower the amount of nitrogen excreted, reducing the potential for ammonia emissions, if diets are adequately formulated to supply amino acids and production performance is maintained. Crude protein content in diets for finishing pigs has been lowered recently, but the quantitative effect of this reduction on ammonia, odour, and slurry output is not well-established. The relationship between ammonia and odour is equivocal, and the effect on slurry production is unclear. The objective of this study was to investigate the effect of lowering dietary CP on ammonia emission, odour emission and slurry output of finishing pigs. Thirty entire boar pigs were individually housed in groups of six, from 10 weeks of age (30 +/- 3.0 kg) and offered standard diets. At 75 kg (+/- 1.5 kg) pigs were assigned to one of three treatment diets; (1) 180 g/kg CP, 11.0 g/kg total lysine (High CP), (2) 150 g/kg CP, 11.1 g/kg total lysine (Medium CP), and (3) 130 g/kg CP, 9.0 g/kg total lysine (Low CP). After three weeks on the experimental diets pigs were moved, six each week, to individual calorimetry chambers to measure ammonia and odour emissions. Pigs were offered treatment diets ad libitum. At the end of the recording period, the pigs were removed from the chamber, weighed and feed disappearance recorded to calculate intake. The slurry in each chamber was collected and analysed. The reduction in CP in the diet from 180 g/kg to 150 g/kg resulted in a 22% reduction in ammonia emissions, and from 180 g/kg to 130 g/kg resulted in a 47% reduction (p < 0.001). Slurry output from pigs offered the 130 g/kg CP diet was reduced by 39% (p < 0.001) and dry matter increased by 35% compared to slurry from pigs offered the 180 g/kg CP diet (p < 0.05). Water usage (p = 0.017), slurry output and nitrogen and phosphate in the slurry (p < 0.05, respectively) were found to decrease linearly with decreasing dietary CP content. There was no significant effect of reducing CP on performance or odour emission but hydrogen sulphide emissions decreased linearly (p < 0.010) with decreasing dietary CP. There was a weak positive relationship between odour emission and ammonia (linear: R-2 = 0.25, p = 0.005) with odour emission reduced as ammonia emission reduced. Reducing dietary CP in finishing pig diets could reduce ammonia emissions, water usage and slurry and nutrient output from pig production.

AB  - Long-term movements of adult marine animals predicate spatial management measures. Sea cucumbers are intensely exploited worldwide, yet few studies have assessed their long-term movement potential. Elephant trunkfish, Holothuria (Microthele) fuscopunctata, is a large coral reef holothuroid. At four sites at Lizard Island, northern Great Barrier Reef, we photographically marked and georeferenced 36 H. fuscopunctata, ranging 1.4-5.1 kg in weight. In broader searches one year later, we recaptured 92% of the animals. Their displacements were comparable among sites and averaged 8.7 m yr(-1). None of the movements could be characterised as nomadic; the maximum displacement was 21 m. Contrary to expectations, smaller animals tended to roam further than larger animals (p = 0.025). Our study shows that certain large-bodied sea cucumbers might not displace far over annual timescales. This empirical evidence of home ranging reshapes our understanding of echinoderm mobility and reveals a behaviour that would exacerbate Allee effects at low population densities.

AB  - The present study investigates the combined production of biohydrogen and polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHA) from sheep cheese whey through a 3-stage bioprocess, i.e. dark fermentation, selection of PHA storing microorgan-isms, and PHA accumulation. Batch dark fermentation tests (Stage I) were performed on raw cheese whey under different pH operating conditions, avoiding either the addition of inoculum or substrate pre-treatment to support the economic and technical feasibility of the proposed process. The performance of the fermentative stage was assessed in terms of biohydrogen and soluble metabolites production yields. The dark fermentation effluent was used as organic acid-rich feedstock either for selecting and harvesting PHA storing microorganisms from a mixed microbial culture without the addition of external nutrient sources (Stage II) or for the PHA accumulation by the selected biomass (Stage III). The results of the study support the possibility of achieving combined recovery yields of 5.3 L biohydrogen and 7.6 g PHA per litre of fed sheep cheese whey in the case of optimal dark fermentation pH setting (pH = 6). Such outcomes underline the untapped potential of sheep cheese whey for the recovery of high-added value bioproducts.

AB  - Livestock production is the major livelihood for a growing local population on the Tibetan plateau. However, government policy is to reduce the number of livestock due to the large quantities of greenhouse gasses (GHG), in particular methane, produced by ruminants and the degradation of the grasslands. For this policy to be effective, with little effect on livelihoods, there should be a decoupling of GHG emissions from economic growth of livestock products. This study examined the synergetic effects of policies, extreme climate events and GHG emissions from livestock at the headwater region of the Yellow River since 1980. Optimization models of GHG emissions efficiency and drivers were developed and parameterized. Trade-offs between GHG emissions from livestock and economic growth from livestock, determined by the decoupling model, showed that from 1980 to 2015: 1) the GHG emissions decreased by 39%; (2) CH4 emissions from livestock decreased by 33%, and yaks emitted the most (accounted for 99.6%) among livestock; (3) N2O emissions decreased by 34%; (4) trade-offs between livestock GHG emissions and grassland uptake indicated that the grazing livestock system functioned as a net carbon sink; (5) the efficiency factor, especially technical efficiency, was the main driver of GHG emissions; and (6) GHG emissions from livestock were in a decoupling state from economic growth from livestock. However, decoupling has not been stable as inter-annual fluctuations have been large mainly due to extreme climatic events, such as snowstorm disasters, which indicates that the grazing system was still relatively fragile. The GHG emissions can be reduced further by mitigating CH4 emissions, and enhancing CO2 sequestration on grazed pastureland. The ongoing transformation of livestock industry development on the Tibetan plateau is associated with uncertainty under the background of global GHG mitigation.

AB  - Nighttime studies are underrepresented in ecological research. Even well-known behaviors, such as the loud call of howler monkeys, are rarely studied at night. Our goal was to help fill this knowledge gap by studying the 24 h vocal behavior of the Guianan red howler monkey (Alouatta macconnelli) and to compare the acoustic structures of howling bouts made during the day to those made at night. We used passive acoustic monitoring coupled with automatic acoustic detection to study three groups of howlers over three months in the Virua National Park, Roraima, Brazil. The automatic classifier we built detected 171 howling bouts with a 42% recall rate and 100% precision. Though primarily diurnal, howlers vocalized mainly at night. Greater vocal activity before nautical twilight might be associated with territorial and resource defense behaviors, with howlers calling from roosting sites before starting their daily routines. We also found that during the day, howling bouts were longer and had lower harmonic-to-noise ratios, lower frequencies, and more symmetric energy distributions than bouts at night. Our study adds to growing evidence that passive acoustic monitoring and automatic acoustic detection can be used to study primates and improve our understanding of their vocal behavior.

AB  - Antagonist and mutualist organisms mediate the long-standing, classical Janzen-Connell effects and yet they are rarely investigated, especially when they share plant species hosts. Here, we propose that plant species create an "antagonists- and mutualist-scape" which, coupled with seed dispersal mechanisms, will govern the relative survival rates of juveniles within the landscape and influence their later life stages. We combined data on fully stem mapped plots of woody plant species in two Mediterranean forests (Mixed Forest of Segura [MFS] and Mixed Forest of Jaen [MFJ]) with data on the associated communities of leaf epiphytic fungi, leaf pathogens, sap-sucking insects and chewer insects hosted by each woody plant species. This allowed us to indirectly test the Janzen-Connell hypothesis by investigating the placement of plant species with contrasting seed dispersal mechanisms (fleshy fruited vs. dry-fruited plant) within the antagonists- and mutualist-scapes. More specifically, we determined the degree of host-specificity of plant-associated organisms and defined the antagonist- or mutualist-scapes for focal plants as the mean number of antagonist- or mutualist species the focal plant shares with its (sapling or adult) plant neighbours, respectively. We then applied multivariate spatial point pattern analysis to test whether saplings and adults of the focal species tended to be located in favourable sites of the antagonist-scapes (i.e. were neighboured by fewer antagonist species than expected) or were distributed independently of the antagonist-scapes. A substantial proportion of organisms was associated with more than one plant species, with organisms at MFJ being more "host-specific" than organisms at MFS. Our spatial analyses revealed spatial patterns that differed strongly between fleshy-fruited and dry-fruited species and were, in most cases, consistent with our expectations. For example, saplings of dry-fruited species were placed in favourable sites in the saplings antagonist-scapes, whereas saplings of fleshy-fruited species were independently placed with respect to the saplings antagonist-scapes. Our results show how the placement of plant species within the antagonist-scapes changes during the ontogeny, and how this is influenced by Janzen-Connell effects and the seed dispersal mechanisms. We provide a new approach and indications about the importance of generalist antagonists and mutualists as drivers of the spatial assembly of plant communities.Read the free Plain Language Summary for this article on the Journal blog.

AB  - The objectives of this study were to investigate the abundance and community composition of comammox Nitrospira under: (i) pasture-based dairy farms from different regions, and (ii) different land uses from the same region and soil type. The results clearly showed that comammox Nitrospira were most abundant (3.0 x 10(6) copies) under the west coast dairy farm conditions, where they were also significantly more abundant than canonical ammonia oxidisers. This was also true in the Canterbury dairy farm. The six land uses investigated were pine monoculture, a long term no input ecological trial, sheep + beef and Dairy, both irrigated and non-irrigated. It was concluded that comammox Nitrospira was most abundant under the irrigated dairy farm(2.7 x 10(6) copies). Contrary to the current industry opinion, the relatively high abundance of comammox Nitrospira under fertile irrigated dairy land suggests that comammox Nitrospira found in terrestrial ecosystems may be copiotrophic. it was also determined that comammox Nitrospira was more abundant under irrigated land use than their non-irrigated counterparts, suggesting that soil moisture is a key environmental parameter influencing comammox abundance. Comammox abundance was also positively correlated with annual rainfall, further supporting this theory. Phylogenetic analysis of the comammox Nitrospira detected determined that 17% of the comammox community belonged to a newly distinguished subclade, clade B.2. The remaining 83 % belonged to clade B.1. No sequences from clade A were found.

AB  - Since the emergence of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) in 2002, bats have been recognized as important reservoirs of diverse coronaviruses (CoVs). Despite extensive research on the broad geographic transmission of bat CoVs, there is a notable gap in understanding the transmission dynamics within sympatric bat communities. Using a phylogeographic Bayesian statistical framework, we examined CoV transmission patterns and their determinants in a region where four bat roosting caves coexist and CoVs circulate persistently. Our findings reveal that two subgenera of CoVs, alpha-CoVs and (3-CoVs dominate different bat caves at varying times. Notably, (3-CoVs show more frequent cross-species transmission events among the dominant reservoir hosts, bats of Rhinolophidae. Phylogenetic distance between host species emerges as the key influence factor of viral crossspecies transmission, whereas cohabitation duration and the number of hosts sharing caves do not significantly influence viral transmission. In addition, we emphasize that the compositional similarity of species in the roosting caves is critical for the inter-cave transmission of bat-CoVs, rather than the distance between cave. These results provide novel insights into the complex transmission dynamics of bat CoVs within sympatric bat communities.

AB  - Marine mammal watching is a non-consumptive wildlife-oriented tourism practice. Trichechus manatus manatus (hereinafter - Antillean manatee) belongs to the charismatic marine megafauna and is subject to this practice at many places. Here we investigated the Antillean manatee watching in Brazil, focusing on mapping this activity across the country, identifying hotspot areas, analysing the potential seasonality of this practice, and assessing the interactions between people and Antillean manatees. We used a social network as data source since this species often appears on social media. The species is charismatic and have characteristics, which attract public affection such as large body size, gentle behaviour, and distinct physical appearance. We detected Antillean manatee watching in 91 localities distributed across 19 municipalities and nine states in northern and north-eastern Brazil. We considered six localities as Antillean manatee watching hotspots because of their high number of associated images. Five of the hotspots were located within three Protected Areas for sustainable use. We found up to 23 people depicted in a single manatee-related picture posted on social network, but up to five people appeared in most posts (photos and videos). Furthermore, images were significantly posted mostly during the summer months, indicating seasonality in Antillean manatee watching. We classified the manatee-watching interactions collected as either prohibited or permitted by the Brazilian law. Permitted interactions were significantly more frequent, but the occurrence of prohibited interactions reveals the current lack of compliance with Brazilian regulations. We suggest that tourism management strategies prioritise Antillean manatee watching hotspot areas, focusing on reinforcing compliance with local regulations and preferably involving local residents to ensure the sustainability of this practice in Brazil.

AB  - Theory suggests that animals make hierarchical, multiscale resource selection decisions to address the hierarchy of factors limiting their fitness. Ecologists have developed tools to link population-level resource selection across scales; yet, theoretical expectations about the relationship between coarse- and fine-scale selection decisions at the individual level remain elusive despite their importance to fitness. With GPS-telemetry data collected across California, USA, we evaluated resource selection of mountain lions (Puma concolor; n = 244) relative to spatial variation in human-caused mortality risk. With hierarchical resource selection, coarse-scale selection determines availability at finer scales. This simple relationship allowed us to demonstrate that functional responses in resource selection explicitly link individual-level resource selection decisions across scales. We show that individuals proactively avoiding risk when selecting home ranges are freed to relax this avoidance when making decisions within home ranges. However, individuals also exhibit reactive avoidance of risk at the finest scales along movement paths.

AB  - Soil lead (Pb) contamination is often caused by anthropogenic activities. In this study, a pot experiment was conducted to assess the effect of biochars derived from pig-carcass (PCBC) and branches of oriental-plane tree (OPBC) on the bioavailability, redistribution, and phytoavailability of Pb and P, as well as the growth of Ipomoea aquatica Forsk in a Pb-contaminated soil. Application of PCBC increased the total and available P concentrations in the soil as compared to the control, and enhanced the concentrations of labile P and sparingly labile P via direct exogenous P input and improvement of soil pH. Both biochars facilitated P accumulation in plant shoots and roots. Sequential extraction of soil Pb confirmed that biochar application facilitated the transformation of mobile Pb into stable fractions, with greater effects from PCBC than OPBC. Hence, biochar application significantly decreased the soil DTPA-extractable Pb by 90.2% (PCBC) and 64.0% (OPBC) compared to the control, consequently reducing Pb uptake by plants. The Pb immobilization by biochar was driven by the biochar-induced increase of soil pH, Pb-phosphate/carbonate precipitation, ion exchange between Pb2+ and biochar-derived cations (e.g., Ca2+ and K+), and surface complexation with functional groups (e.g., carboxyl, hydroxyl, C=O). Application of PCBC simultaneously increased the biomass of plant roots and shoots, by 1.8- and 0.6- folds, respectively. Overall, PCBC showed a potential to function as an effective amendment in the immobilization of Pb and alternative P fertilizer to improve degraded soils.

AB  - Interactions between plants and herbivorous insects are often phylogenetically structured, with closely related insect species using similar sets of species or lineages of plants, while phylogenetically closer plants tend to share high proportions of their herbivore insect species. Notably, these phylogenetic constraints in plant-herbivore interactions tend to be more pronounced among internal plant-feeding herbivores (i.e., endophages) than among external feeders (i.e., exophages). In the context of growing human-induced habitat conversion and the global proliferation of exotic species, it is crucial to understand how ecological networks respond to land-use intensification and the increasing presence of exotic plants. In this study, we analyzed plant-herbivore network data from various locations of the World to ascertain the degree to which land-use intensity and the prevalence of exotic plants induce predictable changes in their network topology - measured by levels of nestedness and modularity - and phylogenetic structures. Additionally, we investigated whether the intimacy of plant-herbivore interactions, contrasting endophagous with exophagous networks, modulate changes in network structure. Our findings reveal that most plant-herbivore networks are characterized by significant phylogenetic and topological structures. However, neither these structures did not show consistent changes in response to increased levels of land-use intensify. On the other hand, for the networks composed of endophagous herbivores, the level of nestedness was higher in the presence of a high proportion of exotic plants. Additionally, for networks of exophagous herbivores, we observed an increase in the phylogenetic structure of interactions due to exotic host dominance. These results underscore the differential impacts of exotic species and land -use intensity on the phylogenetic and topological structures of plant -herbivore networks.

AB  - Simple Summary Elevated carbon dioxide concentrations (eCO(2)) have a significant direct effect on herbivorous insects during their host seeking and oviposition. On the other hand, eCO(2) could dramatically alter leaf chemistry of plants, especially in C3 plants (such as wheat), which in turn is likely to affect the population performance of insects that feed on the host plant. However, the effects of eCO(2) on host adaptability and insecticide resistance in the fall armyworm, Spodoptera frugiperda, are unclear. In this study, we demonstrate that elevated CO2 concentrations increased the population performance of S. frugiperda on wheat and reduced the susceptibility of S. frugiperda to chlorantraniliprole by inducing the expression of detoxification enzyme genes. This report warns that S. frugiperda may continue to be a major global pest through better host adaptation and increased insecticide resistance in the future as atmospheric CO2 continues to rise. Elevated atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations (eCO(2)) can affect both herbivorous insects and their host plants. The fall armyworm (FAW), Spodoptera frugiperda, is a highly polyphagous agricultural pest that may attack more than 350 host plant species and has developed resistance to both conventional and novel-action insecticides. However, the effects of eCO(2) on host adaptability and insecticide resistance of FAW are unclear. We hypothesized that eCO(2) might affect insecticide resistance of FAW by affecting its host plants. To test this hypothesis, we investigated the effect of eCO(2) on (1) FAW's susceptibility to chlorantraniliprole after feeding on wheat, (2) FAW's population performance traits (including the growth and reproduction), and (3) changes in gene expression in the FAW by transcriptome sequencing. The toxicity of chlorantraniliprole against the FAW under eCO(2) (800 mu L/L) stress showed that the LC50 values were 2.40, 2.06, and 1.46 times the values at the ambient CO2 concentration (400 mu L/L, aCO(2)) for the three generations, respectively. Under eCO(2), the life span of pupae and adults and the total number of generations were significantly shorter than the FAW under aCO(2). Compared to the aCO(2) treatment, the weights of the 3rd and 4th instar larvae and pupae of FAW under eCO(2) were significantly heavier. Transcriptome sequencing results showed that more than 79 detoxification enzyme genes in FAW were upregulated under eCO(2) treatment, including 40 P450, 5 CarE, 17 ABC, and 7 UGT genes. Our results showed that eCO(2) increased the population performance of FAW on wheat and reduced its susceptibility to chlorantraniliprole by inducing the expression of detoxification enzyme genes. This study has important implications for assessing the damage of FAW in the future under the environment of increasing atmospheric CO2 concentration.

AB  - Mercury is one of the most harmful metal contaminants, potentially affecting population functioning. We assessed the use of the red squirrel as a bioindicator of Hg contamination in the urban habitats of Warsaw. We thus compared total mercury (THg) concentrations in hair samples of live-trapped squirrels inhabiting areas of different mercury pollution: the urban forest in Warsaw's outer district and the urban parkin the city center, including in the analysis factors that may influence mercury concentration, i.e., age, body mass, reproductive status, and season. Mercury determination was done in a laboratory using atomic absorption spectrometry. In general, the concentration of THg in hair samples from sub-adult individuals was lower than in adults. The site of a sample collection and the body mass of squirrels in the urban park positively affected THg contamination. The higher mercury levels in the urban park were in line with the pollution levels in the soil. They can be explained by current and/or historical pollution and possibly also by park squirrels' altered behavior. On the contrary, the season when the samples were taken, sex, or reproductive status did not influence the THg level, suggesting that the red squirrel can be a useful bioindicator species of Hg contamination in urban areas. Although, in general, the mercury levels were moderate, elevated levels in the park suggest that mercury remains a problem and should be monitored in urban areas.

AB  - Simple Summary Maintaining gut health during the weaning period remains a major challenge for swine producers. Phytobiotics, which are plant-derived bioactive products for use as supplements in food animals, have shown great promise in helping to stabilize the gut environment of weaned pigs, but their mechanisms of action remain unclear. To determine if the positive impact of phytobiotics on gut health may be by influencing the symbiotic bacteria that inhabit the gut of young pigs, this report describes a comparison between fecal bacterial populations of weaned pigs supplemented with a commercial phytobiotic product for seven days to those of untreated pigs. Together, the results indicate that phytobiotic supplementation may provide a favorable environment for both lactate-producing and lactate-utilizing bacteria. The transition to a solid diet, as well as environmental and social stress, have a direct impact on swine gut physiology during weaning, affecting host gastrointestinal functions, as well as resident symbiotic microbial communities. While plant-derived bioactive products, such as phytobiotics, have shown great potential to mitigate these challenges, providing benefits such as antimicrobial, antioxidant, and anti-inflammatory activities, their mechanisms of action remain largely unexplored. To gain more insight, a 21 day trial is conducted to investigate the effects of LiveXtract, a commercial plant-based product, using fecal samples as a proxy for gut bacteria in weaned pigs. High-throughput sequencing of amplicons targeting the V1-V3 region of the 16S rRNA gene is used to determine bacterial composition at days 1 (pre-treatment), 4, 10, and 21 postweaning. Our results show that Lactobacillaceae and Peptostreptococcaceae are both higher in the supplemented group at D4 (p < 0.05), while Streptococcaceae are significantly lower in the treated group at D10 and D21. At D10, Erysipelotrichaceae are lower, and Veillonellaceae are higher in the treated samples than the control group (p < 0.05). Of the thirteen abundant Operational Taxonomic Units (OTUs) that have different representation between treated and control pigs (p < 0.05), six are predicted to be lactate producers (affiliation to Lactobacillus or Streptococcus), and one is predicted to be a lactate utilizer, based on its high identity to Megasphaera elsdenii. Together, these data suggest that phytobiotics may provide a favorable metabolic equilibrium between lactate production and utilization. Lactate is considered a critical microbial end product in gut environments, as it can inhibit pathogens or be metabolized to propionate for utilization by host cells.

AB  - Simple Summary The aim of this study was to provide an anatomical and histological description of the eyelids and orbital glands in the lowland tapir (Tapirus terrestris). The investigation was conducted on two female adult lowland tapirs from the Wroclaw Zoological Garden (Poland). Our results significantly expand the existing knowledge on the comparative anatomy of chosen accessory organs of the eye in one of the four living families of Tapiridae representatives. We present here the features typical only for tapirs and also some common features for closely related Tapiridae and Rhinocerotidae in terms of the morphology of the upper eyelid, lower eyelid, third eyelid and orbital glands. The lowland tapir is one of four species belonging to the Tapiridae family of the Ceratomorpha suborder, similar to Rhinocerotidae. This study describes anatomy with morphometry, histology (hematoxylin and eosin, Masson-Goldner trichrome, Movat pentachrome, mucicarmine, picro-Mallory trichrome) and histochemistry (PAS, AB pH 1.0, AB pH 2.5; AB pH2.5/PAS and HDI) of the upper and lower eyelids, and superficial gland of the third eyelid with the third eyelid, deep gland of the third eyelid, and lacrimal gland. The aim of the work is to show the features of the above-mentioned structures typical only for Tapiridae, as well as to show the presence of similarities and differences between the families forming the order Perissodactyla. The eyelashes on the upper eyelid were long, while those of the lower eyelid were short and much less prominent. In the upper and lower eyelid sebaceous glands, a characteristic simple alveolar gland producing a mucus-like secretion and poorly developed tarsal glands were observed. The marginal zone of the posterior surface of the eyelids was covered by stratified columnar epithelium with 18-21 layers of nucleated cells, while the bulbar zone of these surfaces was covered by cubic multilayer epithelium with 6-11 non-keratinized layers of cells and with sparse goblet cells. In only lower eyelids, numerous lymphoid nodules, diffuse lymphocytes and high endothelial venules were observed. The superficial gland was an acinar complex which secreted mucous and contained plasma cells within the interlobular and interlobular connective tissue. The upper and lower branches of the third eyelid were the shape of a bent "caudal fin" and were composed of hyaline cartilage, and they contained conjunctiva associated lymphoid tissue (CALT). The deep gland was also an acinar complex producing a serous character and having numerous diffuse lymphocytes. The lacrimal gland was an acinar complex producing seromucous secretions and had numerous plasma cells located in the glandular interstitium. The results of our research indicate that the features of the anatomy of the eyelids and orbital region in the lowland tapir are also typical of the family Tapiridae, but also have features common to the families Equidae and Rhinocerotidae. We confirm the presence of poorly developed tarsal glands in both eyelids as well as presence of a palpebral part of the lacrimal gland in the upper eyelid, which is typical only to Tapirus terrestris.

AB  - In this research, we study a generalization of the SIR epidemic model to observe diseaseinduced extinction in the presence of alternative stable states. We model per capita reproduction and mortality rates as functions of both population density and external indicators reflecting temporal resource variations that impact stable states. We then obtain conditions to guarantee a unique global solution for the SIR model when the rate functions are discontinuous. We further obtain conditions for the stability of two states when the external indicators are assumed to be constant. We use both deterministic and stochastic epidemic simulations to analyze models with alternative stable states for real mammalian populations. Through numerical examples, we show that changes in external indicators can, in fact, lead to the collapse of a population subject to an epidemic. However, we find a high probability of species survival in the presence of environmental stochasticity, even when the corresponding deterministic models predict extinction of the host population.

AB  - Current understanding is limited regarding technologies that use biochar and microorganisms to simultaneously treat soils contaminated with both veterinary antibiotics (VAs) and heavy metals (HMs) from different animal farms. The contributions of the keystone taxa and their similarities from different animal farms under VA and HM stresses before and after soil remediation should be further investigated as well. An innovative treatment of Herbaspirillum huttiense (HHS1) inoculated waste fungus chaff-based (WFCB) biochar was designed for immobilization of copper (Cu) and zinc (Zn), and the removal of oxytetracycline (OTC), enrofloxacin (ENR), and a subsequent reduction in their resistance genes in soils from pig, cow, and chicken farms. Roles of indigenous microorganisms which can treat soils contaminated with VAs and HMs were summarized. Results showed that available Cu and Zn were reduced by 19.5% and 28.1%, respectively, while 49.8% of OTC and 85.1% of ENR were removed by WFCB-HHS1. The decrease in ENR improved overall microbial community diversity, and the increases in genera HHS1, Pedobacter, Flavobacterium and Aequorivita, along with the decreases of genera Bacillus, Methylobacter, and Fermentimonas were indirectly favorable to treat HMs and VAs in soils from different animal farms. Bacterial communities in different animal farm soils were predominantly influenced by stochastic processes. The regulations of functional genes associated with metabolism and environmental information processing, which contribute to HM and VA defense, were altered when using WFCB-HHS1. Furthermore, the spread of their antibiotic resistance genes was restricted.

AB  - Single prolonged stress (SPS) is a preclinical rodent model for studying post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD)-like behaviors. Previously we found that increased expression of the microglial marker Iba-1 in the ventral hippocampus after SPS exposure was associated with impaired fear extinction, suggesting that microglial activity contributed to the SPS-induced behavioral changes. To test this, we examined whether reducing microglia with the colony-stimulating factor 1 receptor blocker, PLX3397, in the diet would prevent the SPS-induced extinction impairment. Male rats exposed to SPS showed enhanced fear acquisition and impaired fear extinction memory. Adding PLX3397 to the diet prevented these behavioral changes. In contrast, PLX3397 did not prevent SPS from impairing fear extinction memory in the female rats. Despite the sex-dependent behavioral effects, we found a reduced number and area fraction of Iba-1+ microglia in both male and female rats suggesting that PLX3397 had similar effects on microglia in both sexes. Altogether, these results suggest that microglia contribute to the behavioral changes induced by SPS in male but not female rats.

AB  - In the central Great Plains, winter wheat is used for over-winter grazing for cattle and sheep until the late spring months, when livestock are moved to grass pasture. As the popularity of summer cover crops increases, interest in their use in forage production systems increases as well. There is specific interest in the opportunity to increase productivity by the inclusion of a crop grown in the fallow season of winter wheat fields. The intensification of systems in a resource (water and/or nitrogen) limited region could decrease winter wheat forage production influencing a system's ability to sustain continuous forage production. Nitrogen (N) management could be effective in mitigating negative impacts on winter wheat. The objective of this study is to evaluate the influence of different summer forage crop species and different N management strategies in a multi-year continuous winter wheat forage production system in the central Grain Plains. Increased production of dry matter and crude protein was observed by implementing summer forage crops into a winter wheat forage system. A deleterious effect of summer crops compared to traditional fallow periods was observed but mitigated by the split application of N even compared to the same rate applied at pre-plant.

AB  - The leafhopper, Erythroneura sudra (Distant) is becoming a dominant insect pest, and usually can cause significant damage to fruit production in northern China. We studied the occurrence and density of E. sudra on three fruit tree species and its transcriptomic responses when it was fed on leaves of these tree species. A higher density and survival rate of E. sudra were recorded when it fed on leaves of peach (Amygdalus persica L.) (Rosales: Rosaceae) and cherry (Cerasus pseudocerasus Lindl) (Rosales: Rosaceae) than on apple (Malus domestica Mill) (Rosales: Rosaceae). Also, feeding on M. domestica induced the largest variation in transcriptomic profiles in E. sudra. In total, 166 genes were differentially expressed (89 upregulated and 77 downregulated) in E. sudra when it fed on M. domestica, compared to when it fed on the other two tree species. The upregulated genes were mainly related to 'response to oxidative stress', 'stress-resistance', and 'xenobiotic metabolic process'. The downregulated genes were mainly related to 'structural constituent of cuticle', 'biosynthetic process', and 'development regulation'. These results suggested that M. domestica significantly changed the expression of many genes and consequently caused lower occurrence and density of E. sudra. Such information could enhance our understanding of the leafhopper-host plant relationship. Additionally, it can contribute to the improvement of current control strategies for this pest.

AB  - Agricultural practices, specifically the use of antibiotics and other biocides, have repercussions on human, animal, and plant health. The aim of this study was to evaluate the levels of Enterobacteriaceae and Enterococcus, as antibiotic-resistant marker bacteria, in various matrices across the agro-ecosystem of an antibiotic-free swine farm in Quebec (Canada), namely pig feed, feces, manure, agricultural soil, water and sediment from a crossing stream, and soil from nearby forests. Samples were collected in fall 2022, spring and fall 2023, and spring 2024. All samples were subjected to counts of total, cefotaxime-, and ciprofloxacin-resistant Enterobacteriaceae as well as total and vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus spp. The frequency of total and cefotaxime-resistant Enterobacteriaceae along with the vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus decreased with age in pig feces, from weaning to the end of the fattening period. High proportions of the Enterobacteriaceae recovered from feces and environmental samples were resistant to cefotaxime. Application of manure on fields contributed a significant input of Enterococcus, but those resistant to vancomycin were under the detection limit. This study shows the prevalence of antibiotic-resistant bacteria in a farm agro-ecosystem even without the administration of antibiotics to the animals and highlights the complexity of components influencing antimicrobial resistance in the environment.

AB  - Harvesting can have a substantial impact on population dynamics and individual performance in wild populations. While the direct consequences of harvest on individual survival and population growth rate are often apparent, harvesting can also have indirect and more subtle demographic consequences. Disentangling these consequences, however, requires in-depth knowledge of individual life histories of both females and males in the population. Here, we summarise demographic research on a population where such data exist: the Vega moose population in northern Norway. In this population, vital rates vary considerably among both females and males, and harvesting increases this variation by generating positive covariation between reproductive performance and survival. The skewed age and sex structure, which is typical of many harvested populations, also has demographic consequences: it reduces the ratio of effective to total population size and influences variation in vital rates in males and females. The moose harvest at Vega is structured by age- and sex-specific quotas, but it is not intentionally selective regarding size or other phenotypic characteristics. Still, harvest selection for earlier birth rates and larger calves was apparent, likely due to habitat-performance relationships and habitat-specific harvest mortality. Together, the bulk of research on this population shows that harvesting impacts population demography through many different pathways, with some being more subtle than others. These complex pathways influence the demographic variance and affect stochastic processes such as population growth, genetic drift, and rates of evolutionary change, and they must therefore be acknowledged in management plans to achieve sustainable harvesting.

AB  - Short rotation coppices (SRCs) represent an important source of biomass. Since they are grown in various mixtures, SRCs represent an excellent opportunity for assessing the effects of local plant neighbourhoods on their performance. We used a common garden experiment consisting of plots that varied in genotype diversity of SRC willows to test for the effects of chemical traits of individual plants and chemical variation in the plots where they grew on insect herbivory. We also explored whether the composition of willows planted in a plot affected their chemistry. To do this, we performed untargeted metabolomics and quantified various chemical traits related to the total set of metabolites we detected, flavonoids, and salicinoids in four willow genotypes. We measured the leaf herbivory that the plants suffered. The genotypes differed in most chemical traits, yet we found only limited effects of individual traits on herbivory damage. Instead, herbivory damage was positively correlated with structural variation in salicinoids in a plot. When analysing the effects of plot chemical variation on herbivory damage separately for each genotype, we found both positive and negative correlations between the two, suggesting both associational resistance and susceptibility. Finally, we also observed a significant effect of the interaction between genotype and plot composition on structural variation in plant chemistry. Overall, our results suggest that high chemical variation in mixed willow SRCs does not necessarily lower the herbivory damage, possibly due to spillover effects of insect herbivores among genotypes. Our results also show that different genotypes respond differently to plot composition in terms of herbivory damage and chemical composition, which may affect their suitability for growing in mixed stands.

AB  - Selection of high-yielding traits in cereal plants led to a continuous increase in productivity. However, less effort was made to select on adaptive traits, favorable in adverse and harsh environments. Under current climate change conditions and the knowledge that cereals are staple foods for people worldwide, it is highly important to shift focus to the selection of traits related to drought tolerance, and to evaluate new tools for efficient selection. Here, we explore the possibility to use vulnerability to drought-induced xylem embolism of wheat cultivars Excalibur and Hartog (Triticum aestivum L.), rye cultivar Duiker Max (Secale cereale L.), and triticale cultivars Dublet and US2014 (x Triticosecale Wittmack) as a proxy for their drought tolerance. Multiple techniques were combined to underpin this hypothesis. During bench-top dehydration experiments, acoustic emissions (AEs) produced by formation of air emboli were detected, and hydraulic capacitances quantified. By only looking at the AE(50) values, one would classify wheat cultivar Excalibur as most tolerant and triticale cultivar Dublet as most vulnerable to drought-induced xylem embolism, though Dublet had significantly higher hydraulic capacitances, which are essential in terms of internal water storage to temporarily buffer or delay water shortage. In addition, xylem anatomical traits revealed that both cultivars have a contrasting trade-off between hydraulic safety and efficiency. This paper emphasizes the importance of including a cultivar's hydraulic capacitance when evaluating its drought response and vulnerability to drought-induced xylem embolism, instead of relying on the AE(50) as the one parameter.

AB  - Mycorrhizal symbiosis is an ancient association of plants and mycorrhizal fungi central to woody plant evolution and expansion. This symbiosis has established a complex exchange of services between plants and mycorrhizal fungi that ultimately helps plants thrive in extreme abiotic conditions and build resistance against lack of nutrients and water, pathogens, herbivores, or pollutants. Here, we briefly comment on the roles of mycorrhizal symbiosis as modulators of the responses of woody plants to multiple abiotic stress factors typical to ongoing global change. We comment on the most studied factors, i.e. drought, extreme temperatures, nutrient and light deficiency. There is a general lack of understanding of the interaction among stress factors and their combined effects on woody plants, their symbiotic interaction with mycorrhizal fungi and their impact on ecosystem processes. As a first step, identifying and ranking the severity of stress factors and situations/locations where multiple stress factors co-occur could guide initial expectations and hypotheses to comprehend the mycorrhizal benefits to woody species tolerance under multifactorial stress combinations. We finally highlight topical areas that require more information and research.

AB  - Anthropogenic activities such as poaching and habitat loss lead to a drop in population size, range overlap and hybridisation. The decline in population size results in reduced genetic diversity, an increase in homozygosity and inbreeding. Here, we genotyped 16 polymorphic microsatellite loci on 80 elephant dung samples to determine genetic diversity, genetic bottleneck, genetic relatedness and inbreeding in the savannah elephant in Nimule National Park, which experienced an 80% fall in population size. Results revealed that the elephant population in the park comprised 26 savannah elephants. The study also found genetic variation, average number of observed alleles A(o), observed heterozygosity H-o and expected heterozygosity H-e to be 5.31 +/- 2.62, 0.61 +/- 0.22 and 0.56 +/- 0.21, respectively, but with no difference between observed H-o and expected H-e heterozygosity. There was no evidence that the elephant population in the park went through a recent genetic bottleneck (p = 0.94167; and normal L-shaped distribution); however, evidence for a historical bottleneck was detected (M ratio = 0.44 +/- 0.22). Mean pairwise relatedness was generally low (ML-r = 0.09 +/- 0.22) with a high proportion of unrelated individuals (U = 85.8%), and there was no indication of inbreeding (F-IS = -0.08, p > 0.05). We conclude that the observed decline in the population size is not an artefact of using different methods, as shown by the historical bottleneck. Despite the observed reduction in census size, there is an exchange of individuals with the neighbouring savannah elephant population.

AB  - Simple Summary Soybean meal is the most common protein source for feeding pigs, but the livestock sector relies on imported soybean. Some studies have shown no adverse effects of replacing soybean meal with alternative protein sources on growth performance of growing-finishing pigs. Thereby, measures to promote locally grown protein crops for animal feed are sought. Surgical castration of males is performed to avoid boar taint in meat and to prevent aggressive behaviour, although it is associated with pain for piglets, whereas immunocastration only requires two doses of a vaccine that transiently suppresses testicular functions. Moreover, few studies comparing feeding strategies and consumption habits according to different castration methods have been published. In the current study, the local pea diet, in nutritionally balanced diets, impaired the average daily gain and feed conversion ratio above body-weights of 110 kg, but not earlier, while increased passive behaviour, with less presence of tail biting. In immunocastrates, performance results were better than those in barrows, although dressing percentage decreased, and, after second vaccination, they switched from a boar- to a barrow-like status. This study aimed to explore dietary replacement soybean meal (SBM) with local pea seeds (PS-L) and the effects of surgically castrated (CM) or immunocastration (IM) in heavy male pigs, on growth performance, feeding behaviour, and tail and ear lesions. Four treatments were arranged factorially (2 x 2), with two sexes and two dietary treatments (96 pigs in eight pens). The inclusion of PS-L was 25%, 30%, and 40% during three phases (40-80 kg, 80-110 kg, and 110-140 kg, respectively). No difference in average daily feed intake (ADFI) and body-weight (BW) between PS-L and SBM could be demonstrated (p > 0.05), but PS-L diet decreased the average daily gain (ADG) at 110-140 kg of BW (p < 0.001) and increased feed conversion rate (FCR) (p < 0.05). The ADG was higher (p < 0.01) in IM than CM in all fattening periods, and the FCR in IM was lower (p < 0.05) than in barrows. IM pigs had lower dressing percentage than CM (p < 0.01). Pigs fed a PS-L diet ate faster but increased their passive behaviour compared with those fed SBM. In conclusion, the PS-L diet did not reduce BW and improved passive behaviour, and IM grew more efficiently, regardless of diet.

AB  - The deposition of atmospheric nitrogen has globally increased and has interfered with plant growth and resistance to herbivores. Previous studies have shown that numerous dioecious plant species exhibit sex-specific responses in growth and tolerance to increased atmospheric nitrogen deposition. However, whether these changes lead to sexual differences in herbivore resistance and subsequent intersexual competition between male and female conspecifics remains unknown. Here, we used female and male siblings of Populus deltoides to investigate the effect of simulated nitrogen deposition on herbivore resistance and competitive ability of male and female plant conspecifics under controlled and field conditions. We showed that simulated nitrogen deposition significantly increased the growth of both plant sexes, with females outperforming males. The herbivore feeding bioassays demonstrated that simulated nitrogen deposition decreased the resistance of both plant sexes to generalist and specialist herbivores, with female plants exhibiting lower resistance than males. This could be attributed to decreased levels of leaf structural defense in females in response to simulated nitrogen deposition. A short-term competition test in the climate chamber revealed that simulated nitrogen deposition increased the competitive ability of females over males, whereas herbivore feeding reversed this advantage. A long-term competition experiment in the field further confirmed that male plants may benefit from increased atmospheric nitrogen deposition through enhanced herbivore resistance and intersexual competition compared to their female conspecifics. The findings provide potential implications for the selection of suitable sex of dioecious plants during forestation in natural habitats experiencing high levels of atmospheric nitrogen deposition.

AB  - Peucetia viridans (Hentz), commonly called the lynx spider, is an important predator with a diet that encompasses a wide variety of insects and arachnids, including cannibalism. Although several studies that address aspects related to its ecology and behaviour have been carried out, there is a notable lack of studies focused on the recording of its prey and hosts. This information gap is particularly evident regarding the interaction of the spider with beetles belonging to the family Scarabaeidae. To contribute to the knowledge of the feeding habits and host preferences of P. viridans, observations were made in two localities of the Valles Centrales region of Oaxaca, Mexico. Lynx spiders were observed on Croton ciliatoglandulifer Ortega, Lantana camara Linnaeus, Solanum mitlense Dunal, and Wigandia urens (Ruiz and Pav.) Kunth. Spiders utilise these plants as shelter and to ambush their prey, thereby reducing herbivore populations and protecting the plants. In return, the plants provide the spiders with prey and floral and extrafloral nectaries as food sources. Therefore, spiders and plants have a facultative mutualistic relationship, whereas the relationship between spiders and herbivores is antagonistic. For the first time Diplotaxis trapezifera Bates, Macrodactylus fulvescens Bates, Paranomala discoidalis (Bates), Strigoderma costulipennis Bates, Strigoderma sulcipennis Burmeister, and Euphoria pulchella (Gory and Percheron) as prey, and Wigandia urens, Lantana camara and Solanum mitlense as host plants are recorded. A checklist of host plants for P. viridans is given. Overall, these new observations highlight the importance that tritrophic interactions (plant-herbivore-natural enemy) have in wild systems, which are essential for maintaining ecological balance.

AB  - Aquatic salamanders are faced with a variety of threats to their population persistence, including increased sedimentation, loss of habitat, and anthropogenic development. These threats, among others, have led to the decline in relative abundance of the Eastern Hellbender (Cryptobranchus a. alleganiensis) in many streams across its geographic range; however, many gaps exist in our knowledge related to species life history, particularly larval ecology, habitat selection, and occupancy. Conservation management of these Appalachian (USA) salamander populations requires policies informed by data-driven studies that improve our understanding of overall recruitment. To investigate this lesser studied, early life stage, we characterized the site factors associated with occupancy of larvae within stream reaches in North Carolina, USA. Our use of biologically relevant, environmental covariates and numerous a priori models revealed several factors as important predictors of larval occupancy including percent substrate embeddedness, percentage riffle, percentage cobble substrate, and percentage forest land cover within 1 km. Occupancy was greater at sites with increased forest land cover, higher elevations, and water quality parameters of decreased specific conductivity and total dissolved solids. Detectability decreased across most sites during late summer visits, likely due to some combination of increased mortality of juveniles or individual dispersal out of stream survey transects. Using occupancy modeling, we provide the first empirical evidence identifying key environmental variables correlated with larval Eastern Hellbender presence in North Carolina, which expands our existing knowledge of larval life history with important implications for conservation management of this unique, charismatic megafauna salamander.

AB  - External factors can affect reproductive traits of breeding boars and especially the sensitive process of spermatogenesis. The aim of this study was to investigate probable influences of bedding materials (chipsy wood shavings (CWS), hemp straw (HS), linen straw (LS), spelt husks (SH), and regional wood shavings (RWS)) on semen traits of 40 randomly selected Pie<acute accent>train boars (8 boars per group, age: 2.35 +/- 1.23 years). After a six-week adaptation period, 40 fresh semen samples were collected weekly for four weeks and diluted in BTS (4 consecutive ejaculates per boar, 32 samples per group, 160 samples in total). Semen samples were analyzed using an extended range of spermatological methods (e.g., computer-assisted sperm analysis and flow cytometry). Generalized linear mixed models for each sperm parameter as well as the area under the curve for total sperm motility and thermo-resistance test were calculated. Materials LS and SH exceeded the standard maximum level for pesticide residues (VO (EG) No. 396/2005). Materials HS and LS presented the highest water-binding capacity of 413 % and 357 %, respectively, while SH showed the lowest value of 250 %. There were no significant (P > 0.05) differences between groups in any sperm characteristic, therefore indicating that bedding material had no influence on sperm quality. For most semen traits, however, we found significant (P <= 0.001) differences between sampling weeks. Based on pesticide results, we suggest CWS, RWS, or HS as possible bedding materials for pig production farms in the future. Furthermore, we strongly recommend a quality analysis of any new bedding material before use in swine husbandry.

AB  - Alaria alata is an emerging parasite that poses a potential risk for those consuming game, pork, snails and frogs. One paratenic host of A. alata that is known to play an important role in its spread through its feeding habitats is the wild boar. However, no statistical analysis of the influence of aquatic environments and carnivores on the occurrence of A. alata in wild boars has yet been performed. The present study combines a small-scale analysis based on hunting districts in the Mazowieckie province with a large-scale analysis based on data for all provinces in Poland. We applied various modeling approaches, including logistic regression and a generalized linear model in order to determine the presence, intensity and prevalence of A. alata. We used the Alaria mesocercariae migration technique (AMT) to estimate the risk of A. alata among wild boar in a given hunting district or province. The small-scale analysis found that mesopredators (red fox (Vulpes vulpes)) and racoon dog (Nyctereutes procyinoides) were likely to influence A. alata infestation of wild boar; however, the effect was weak, probably as a result of the large home range size of these animals. The large-scale analysis found that wetlands influence the prevalence of A. alata in wild boar, with the estimated risk increasing in the north of the country; this finding is consistent with other studies. Our findings indicate that the occurrence of A. alata in wild boar requires analysis on many levels, and environmental factors play a key role in risk assessment.

AB  - The reproduction of neotropical fish is linked to environmental stimuli that act as triggers in this process. Thus, it is possible to affirm that specific environmental changes can delimit most fish's period and reproductive success. El Nino Southern Oscillation phenomena (ENSO) influence rainfall and, consequently, hydrological dynamics, affecting several fish population aspects, especially reproductive aspects. However, in the Amazon, empirical evidence of the effect of anomalous climatic events on fish reproduction is incipient. In this sense, we investigated the taxonomic and functional structure of parental fish larvae stocks and how species modulate their reproductive activities before (2013 and 2014) and during La Nina (2018) and El Nino (2019) events. The data evidence that the larval assemblages suffered alterations in the taxonomic and functional composition between the three analyzed periods and a pattern of temporal distribution with a high influence of environmental variables. Flow, pH, and electrical conductivity were the most important variables to modulate fish reproductive intensity between periods. The species seem to respond to combinations of these variables that reflect environmental conditions conducive to biological recruitment according to their ecological characteristics, allowing the perpetuation or decline of their abundance in each period. All species of commercial interest associated with the neutral period showed a sharp decline in the subsequent moments. These results suggest that the incidence of anomalous climatic events added to regional fisheries exploitation can negatively affect the phenology and demographic patterns of larvae assemblages on a short temporal scale. During the neutral period, the community was dominated by larvae of periodic large, herbivores, piscivores, epibenthic maneuverable, and nektonic burst swimmers. The decrease in the abundance of certain functional groups at the neutral and La Nina period favored an accelerated ecological succession during the El Nino period, due to the increase of species from basal trophic levels (planktivores), generalists (omnivores), highly resilient (intermediate strategists), sedentary, short-distance migrants and little commercially exploited. Thus, the results contribute to the understanding of the interactions between anomalous climatic events and the reproduction of fish with different ecological characteristics in the Amazon River.

AB  - In tomato production, yield reduction is often caused by both abiotic and biotic stresses, particularly the threat of herbivorous insects. However, tomato trichomes and secondary metabolites play a crucial role in the resistance of tomatoes against external threats. This study aimed to assess the effect of agricultural practices on the development of trichomes and their importance in the defense of tomato plants against insect herbivores, specifically the pest Zonocerus variegatus. A survey was conducted in two major tomato production areas in Southern Benin, presenting different agricultural practices that could influence the development of trichomes. Samples from 200 tomato plants were collected from various tomato fields and trichomes on leaf and stem samples were counted using an optical microscope. Additionally, to understand the responses of specific tomato varieties to attacks by insect herbivores, experiments were conducted on the varieties Akikon, Tounvi, and Thorgal cultivated in pots and then subjected to biotic stress by Z. variegatus, with both control and experimental batches. Three weeks later, leaf and stem samples were taken and the trichomes were observed and also counted. Subsequently, phytochemical screenings and quantification of secondary metabolites were performed on the experimental and control plants. Structural Equation Models analysis revealed a significant positive effect of cropping systems and fertilization methods on trichome density, but a significant negative effect of soil type and biopesticide use. The experiment results showed an increase in trichome density in response to pest attacks. Phytochemical screenings revealed considerable production of polyphenols and flavonoids in all three varieties. The rate of insect damage was highest in the Tounvi tomato variety, followed by the Akikon variety and finally the Thorgal variety which released more flavonoids and polyphenols. These findings underscore the vital function of trichomes in protecting tomato plants against herbivore insects. This study provides a theoretical and practical basis for advancing and integrating the roles of trichomes in controlling insect herbivores and improve tomato production.

AB  - Wolves are assumed to be ungulate obligates, however, a recently described pack on Pleasant Island, Alaska USA, is persisting on sea otters and other marine resources without ungulate prey, violating this long-held assumption. We address questions about these wolves regarding their origin and fate, degree of isolation, risk of inbreeding depression, and diet specialization by individual and sex. We applied DNA metabarcoding and genotyping by amplicon sequencing using 957 scats collected from 2016 to 2022, and reduced representation sequencing of tissue samples to establish a detailed understanding of Pleasant Island wolf ecology and compare them with adjacent mainland wolves. Dietary overlap was higher among individual wolves on Pleasant Island (Pianka's index mean 0.95 +/- 0.03) compared to mainland wolves (0.70 +/- 0.21). The individual diets of island wolves were dominated by sea otter, ranging from 40.6% to 63.2% weighted percent of occurrence (wPOO) (mean 55.5 +/- 8.7). In contrast, individual mainland wolves primarily fed on ungulates (42.2 +/- 21.3) or voles during a population outbreak (31.2 +/- 23.2). We traced the origin of the Pleasant Island pack to a mainland pair that colonized around 2013 and produced several litters. After this breeding pair was killed, their female offspring and an immigrant male became the new breeders in 2019. We detected 20 individuals of which 8 (40%) were trapped and killed while two died of natural causes during the 6-year study. Except for the new breeding male, the pedigree analysis and genotype results showed no additional movement to or from the island, indicating limited dispersal but no evidence of inbreeding. Our findings suggest wolves exhibit more flexible foraging behavior than previously believed, and hunting strategies can substantially differ between individuals within or between packs. Nevertheless, anthropogenic and natural mortality combined with limited connectivity to the mainland may inhibit the continued persistence of Pleasant Island wolves.
   We applied DNA metabarcoding and SNP genotyping to quantify variation in marine foraging behavior within wolf packs, among sexes, and individuals using 957 scats collected from an island and the adjacent mainland from 2016 to 2022. Island wolves consistently consumed sea otters while mainland wolves fed mainly on ungulates and voles with more variation annually, among sexes and individuals, indicating both individual variation in the diet of a cooperatively hunting predator and varying hunting strategies among individuals within the same pack. We also found limited dispersal to and from the island with only one unrelated wolf coming from the mainland during the 6-year study period. Our findings suggest wolves are more flexible in their foraging strategies than is commonly appreciated and that the recolonization of sea otters can allow wolves to persist on predominantly non-ungulate, marine resources. Nevertheless, anthropogenic and natural mortality, and a lack of movement to and from the island may inhibit the continued persistence of the Pleasant Island wolves.image

AB  - Simple Summary This study examined whether the company of goats in a paddock helps to limit the effects of the social isolation of horses. Four short tests were performed, which examined horses in a herd without goats, horses isolated from the herd without goats, horses in a herd with goats, and horses isolated from the herd with goats. The duration of standing, walking, trotting, and cantering, and the horses' emotions were determined in each test. The results showed that the company of goats in the paddock only partially limited the effects of the social isolation of horses and reduced their restlessness. However, the horses' emotions change positively only when goats accompany horses in a herd. Therefore, goats can be used for the planned limiting of movements of isolated horses in paddocks and as an element of environment diversification for horses in a herd. The resulting relaxation helps to reduce the horses' negative behavior. This study aimed to perform a comparative analysis of the horses' heart rate parameters and locomotor activity in a herd or isolation, with or without the company of goats. Twenty horses were tested in a paddock, accompanied (or not) by three goats. The experiment comprised four tests (a control test of a herd of horses without goats, a horse isolation test without goats, a test of a herd of horses with goats and a test of an isolated horse with goats). The horse's locomotor behavior, and the HR, RR, rMSSD, LF, HF, and LF/HF were recorded. The data analysis included a 15-min rest, procedural and recovery HR/HRV periods, and a 5-min period at the beginning of the test. The duration of the horses standing in the company of goats increased significantly. The rMSSD parameter was the significantly lowest in the test of a herd of horses with goats. The company of goats in a paddock does not eliminate the emotional effects of the phenomenon. However, the locomotor behavior decreases. Goats in a paddock can provide a positive distraction for horses in a herd as a decrease in emotional excitability can be regarded as having a relaxing impact on a different animal species.

AB  - Heavy metals pollution has thorough worldwide apprehensions due to the instantaneous growth of industries. Farming regions are irrigated mainly with wastewater which contains both municipal and industrial emancipations. Keeping in view the above scenario, a study was designed in which three sites irrigated with ground, canal, and municipal wastewater in the District Jhang were selected to determine the zinc accumulation and its transfer in the soil, plant, and animal food chain. Zinc concentration was ranged as 18.85-35.59mg/kg in the soil, 26.42-42.67 mg/kg in the forage, and 0.982-2.85mg/kg in the animal samples. Investigated zinc concentration in soil and forages was found to be within the recommended WHO/FAO limits, but blood samples exceed the standards of NRC (2007). The maximum level of pollution load index (0.427-0.805mg/kg) and enrichment factor (0.373-0.894 mg/kg) for zinc was noticed upon wastewater irrigation. Daily intake (0.039 to 0.082 mg/kg/day) and health risk index (0.130 to 0.275 mg/kg/day) of zinc metal was higher in the buffaloes that feed on wastewater-irrigated forages. Bio-concentration factor (0.840 to 2.01mg/kg) for soil-forage was >1 which represents that these plants accumulated the zinc concentration into their tissues and raised health issues in grazing animals on consumption of wastewater-contaminated forages. As animal-derived products are part of human food, then zinc toxicity prevailed in livestock tissues ultimately affects the human food chain. Overall, findings of this study concluded that animal herds should be monitored periodically to devise preventive measures regarding the toxic level of heavy metals availability to livestock.

AB  - Cardiovascular disease is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Stress tests are frequently employed to expose early signs of cardiovascular dysfunction or disease and can be employed, for example, in the context of preterm birth. We aimed to establish a safe and effective thermal stress test to examine cardiovascular function. Guinea pigs were anaesthetized using a 0.8% isoflurane, 70% N2O mix. ECG, non-invasive blood pressure, laser Doppler flowmetry, respiratory rate, and an array of skin and rectal thermistors were applied. A physiologically relevant heating and a cooling thermal stress test was developed. Upper and lower thermal limits for core body temperature were set at 41.5 OC and 34 OC, for the safe recovery of animals. This protocol therefore presents a viable thermal stress test for use in guinea pig models of health and disease that facilitates exploration of whole-system cardiovascular function.

AB  - Understanding animals' habitat selection and movement behaviours relative to human activities is important for evaluating resource requirements and ensuring effective conservation management. The world's largest remaining population of Kordofan giraffe ( Giraffa camelopardalis antiquorum) reside in Zakouma National Park, Chad. However, it is unclear whether the park boundaries sufficiently encompass the full range of this population's preferred habitats. We used GPS telemetry data from 17 female giraffe over multiple years to better understand landscape and seasonal factors that influence their home range patterns and habitat preferences at multiple spatial scales. Kordofan giraffe seasonal ranges and core seasonal ranges were larger during the wet season and core utilization distributions had greater overlap with the national park in the dry season. The importance of shifts in seasonal habitat use, attributed to the flooding and drying that occurs within the park, necessitates Kordofan giraffe to move beyond the park's boundaries. Kordofan giraffe selected for open grasslands (mean coefficient = 0.48, 95% CI [0.22,0.74]), and increased their tortuosity of movement in these areas (mean coefficient = -0.18, 95% CI [-0.23,-0.14]). Conversely, with Vachellia savannas as the reference level for land-cover variables, the giraffe avoided anthropogenic areas, barren lands, Combretaceae savannas and forests. We advise increased community-based co-learning projects and awareness of giraffe outside the park. In addition, by identifying key habitat types that giraffe selected, we advise enhanced monitoring in preferred giraffe habitats during the wet season to protect these areas from being encroached by human settlement or agricultural expansion, with the support of the legal framework of the Bahr Salamat Wildlife Reserve and other agreements that protect wet season wildlife corridors.

AB  - Human-wildlife interactions are embedded within socio-ecological systems (SES), in which animal behavior and human decision-making reciprocally interact. While a growing body of research addresses specific social and ecological elements of human-wildlife interactions, including conflicts, integrating these approaches is essential for identifying practical and effective solutions. Carnivore predation on livestock can threaten human livelihoods, weaken relationships among stakeholders, and precipitate carnivore declines. As carnivores have received greater protection in recent decades, researchers and managers have sought non-lethal tools to reduce predation and promote coexistence between livestock producers and carnivores. For these tools to be successful, they must effectively deter carnivores, and they must also be adopted by producers. Relatively few studies examine the practical and context-specific effectiveness of non-lethal tools, and even fewer simultaneously consider their social acceptability among producers. To address this gap, we suggest that a tool's ecological effectiveness and social acceptability be analyzed concurrently to determine its social effectiveness. We thus paired an experimental study of a carnivore predation deterrent called Foxlights (R) with qualitative interviews of livestock producers in Northern California. We placed camera traps in sheep pastures to measure the response of coyotes (Canis latrans) to experimentally deployed Foxlights and interviewed livestock producers before and after the experiment. Our experiment revealed weak evidence for reducing coyote activity with Foxlights, but interviews revealed that the potential adoption of tools had as much to do with their social acceptability and implementation feasibility as with evidence-based measurements of tool effectiveness. Interviewees viewed Foxlights as potentially effective components of husbandry systems, despite the data suggesting otherwise, demonstrating that scientific reductionism may lag behind producer practices of systems-thinking and that isolated demonstrations of a tool's ecological effectiveness do not drive tool adoption. Future empirical tests of non-lethal tools should better consider producers' perspectives and acknowledge that data-based tests of ecological effectiveness alone have a limited place in producer decision-making. Iteratively working with producers can build trust in scientific outputs through the research process itself.

AB  - Context Macropods are very susceptible to stress during capture. Capture methods for macropods fall into two categories: trapping and darting. Trapping by nets or a triggered trap mechanism is commonly used for small macropods. Darting is most often used for large macropods that are more prone to stress and capture myopathy when caught in traps.Aim To describe a modified 'nylon drop-net' technique for safely capturing medium to large macropods; and post-capture treatments that reduce stress and the potential for myopathy.Methods We used a drop-net to capture 40 agile wallabies (Notamacropus agilis) (24 females and 16 males), ranging in weight from 6 to 24 kg. For immobilisation, a single dose of intramuscular Diazepam (1 mg/kg) and Richtasol, a multivitamin, was administered to reduce the risk of capture myopathy. The longer-term effects of capture on animal condition were monitored in 34 radio-collared individuals for 2 months.Key results No deaths occurred during or as a result of capture or in the 8 weeks following capture.Conclusions Our modified drop-net and handling/treatment regime provides a cost-effective method for capturing medium and small-sized macropod species with very low risk of mortality or morbidity.Implications Our methods improve the welfare and safety of captured medium-sized macropods.

AB  - Different wastewaters have been used as microalgae culture media and in biomass production. A percentage of this medium must be replaced periodically. The use of treated wastewater for irrigation has economic and environmental benefits. The aim of this research is to reuse wastewater from microalgae production and evaluate the effects on the growth and development of Pelargonium x hortorum. The study evaluated three wastewater sources that come from three different culture mediums (purified water, water plus fertilizers, and water plus 10% pig slurry). The tested treatments were: Control- nutrient solution for Pelargonium, Inlet-PW-purified water, inlet of reactor, Inlet-FW-water + fertilizers, inlet of reactor, Inlet-10 MW- water with 10% pig slurry, inlet of reactor, Outlet-PW- purified water, outlet of reactor, Outlet-FW- water + fertilizers, outlet of reactor and Outlet-10 MW- water and 10% pig slurry, outlet of reactor. This study suggests that the Outlet-PW waste solution from microalgae production can be used as an alternative water resource for cultivating Pelargonium, since production was equal to that of the control. The use of Outlet-FW also produced results similar to the control, except that root dry weight decreased and shoots and leaf number increased. A negative effect on biomass dry weight using Outlet-10 MW wastewater was observed. Outlet-PW irrigation water showed high concentrations of N, Na and Cl. Outlet-FW presented high concentrations of N and Na. Outlet-10 MW irrigation water showed high concentrations of N, Cl, Na and K. The high concentrations of Cl and Na in these wastewaters limit their use for plants which are less tolerant to salinity.

AB  - In temperate regions of the world, food resources are seasonally limited, which causes some wildlife species to seek out nutrient-rich resources to better meet their caloric needs. Animals that utilize high-quality resources may reap fitness benefits as they prepare for mating, migration, or hibernation. American black bears (Ursus americanus) are omnivores that consume both plant and animal food resources to meet macronutrient needs. Black bears capitalize on high-quality food resources, such as soft mast in summer and hard mast during autumn, but we know less about the importance of resource quality during spring. Therefore, we sought to understand the relationship between the spatiotemporal variation in the availability of food and resource selection of black bears during spring. We also aimed to infer potential changes in foraging tactics, from opportunistic foraging to more active selection. Although black bears are described as opportunistic omnivores, we hypothesized they select areas with high-quality forage when available. We instrumented 7 black bears with GPS collars in 2017 and 2018 and estimated fine-scale resource selection with integrated step-selection functions. We found evidence that black bear movements were influenced by forage quality of vegetative food resources. However, we failed to find evidence that black bears actively alter their movements to take advantage of seasonal neonate elk. Although black bears represent a substantial cause of mortality for neonate elk, we found that black bears likely feed on neonates encountered opportunistically while traveling between patches of high-quality forage. Few studies have shown evidence of an omnivorous species capitalizing on spatiotemporal variation in forage quality, yet our data suggest this may be an important strategy for species with diverse diets, particularly where resources are seasonally limited.

AB  - The discovery of a tusk and a rib of a straight-tusked elephant within layer 13 II-2c3 of the famous Lower Palaeolithic archaeological site Schoningen (district Helmstedt, Lower-Saxony, Germany) provided the reason for studying the climatic and ecological conditions of this part of the Middle Pleistocene Reinsdorf sequence in high resolution in relation to new chronometric data. Sediment, pollen, aquatic microfossil (diatoms, ostracods, gyrogonites of charophytes) and micro mammalian analyses provide evidence for a strong environmental change and landscape opening following the post-temperate boreal forest phase of the Reinsdorf Interglacial. Palynological and palaeontological evidence from this horizon suggest increasing dryness and seasonality. The high proportions of non-arboreal pollen including Poaceae as well as a major decrease of thermophile tree taxa indicate the development of zonal steppe environments. The assemblage of small mammal remains includes indicators of temperate as well as cold climatic conditions. A bone tool together with flint artefacts clearly show the presence of hominins in this context. Based on palaeoecological evidence and new luminescence dating, previous correlations of the Reinsdorf sequence to Marine Isotope Stage (MIS) 9 and thus of the interglacial sediments to MIS 9e are confirmed and the onset of the first post-interglacial steppe phase represented by layer 13 II-2c3 to MIS 9d is proposed.

AB  - Adaptation of translocated species to new habitats can be evaluated by comparing their behaviour and physiology with resident species. Twenty-eight white-red deer (Cervus elaphus) were translocated successfully from New Zealand to China in 2015, including 16 males and 12 females (7 pregnant and 5 non-pregnant). We assumed that the seasonal behaviour and reproductive physiology of the translocated white-red deer would gradually converge toward the seasonal patterns exhibited by resident red deer (Cervus elaphus songaricus). Thus, we monitored the behaviours of translocated white-red deer and compared these behaviours with that of resident red deer living in the same environment. The results showed that the white-red deer, translocated during the oestrus and breeding season, was different in various behaviours with the resident red deer. The resting and feeding behaviour of translocated white-red deer were significantly less than that of resident red deer (p < 0.05), while the standing and movement behaviour were significantly more than that of resident red deer (p < 0.05). Compared with non-pregnant translocated individuals, the pregnant translocated white-red deer need more time to adapt to seasonal and environmental changes. Regular monitoring of translocated white-red deer should be implemented to maintain the sustainable development of the white-red deer population.

AB  - Environmental chemicals (ECs) have been associated with a broad range of disorders and diseases. Daily exposure to various ECs in the environment, or real-life exposure, has raised significant public health concerns. Utilizing the biosolids-treated pasture (BTP) sheep model, this study demonstrates that in-utero exposure to a real-life EC mixture disrupts hypothalamo-pituitary-gonadal (HPG) axis gene expression and reproductive traits in prepubertal (8-week-old, 8w) and adult (11-month-old) male sheep. Ewes were maintained on either BTP or pastures fertilized with inorganic fertilizer [control (C)] from approximately one month prior to insemination until around parturition. Thereafter, all animals were kept under control conditions. Effects on reproductive parameters including testosterone concentrations and the expression of key genes in the HPG axis were evaluated in eight-week-old and adult male offspring from both C and biosolids-exposed (B) groups. Results showed that, at 8w, relative to C (n =11), B males (n = 11) had lower body weight, and altered testicular expression of HSD3B1, LHR and HSD17B3, BMP4, ABP, P27kip and CELF1. Principal component analysis (PCA) identified two 8w B subgroups, based on hypothalamic expression of GnRH, ESR1, and AR, and pituitary expression of KISSR. The two subgroups also exhibited different serum testosterone concentrations. The largest biosolids effects were observed in the hypothalamus of adult rams with NKB, ESR1, KISS1, AR, DLK1 and GNRH1 mRNA expression differing between B (n = 10) and C (n = 11) rams. Testicular steroidogenic enzymes CYP11A1 and HSD3B1 mRNA expression also differed between exposure groups. PCA identified two adult B subgroups, with BS1 (n = 6) displaying hypothalamic effects and BS2 (n = 4) both hypothalamic and testicular effects. The subgroups also differed in circulating testosterone concentrations. These findings demonstrate that exposure to a real-life EC mixture may predispose some males to infertility, by disrupting key functional HPG markers before puberty with consequent downstream effects on steroid hormones and spermatogenesis.

AB  - Anthrax outbreaks caused by the soil-borne bacterium Bacillus anthracis have been known to occur often in Africa, impacting both wildlife and livestock and occasionally infecting humans. Modelling the current distribution and predicting suitable habitats for this bacteria species is therefore critical for supporting effective planning and control measures for anthrax outbreaks. Despite its impact, the knowledge on the ecology of this pathogen is still limited. This can be due to intricate interactions between anthropogenic and environmental factors and the variety of species it affects. Therefore, detailed, site-specific analyses are essential for contributing to the understanding of the ecology of anthrax. This study used the maximum entropy modelling algorithm (MaxEnt) method to predict suitable habitat and environmental conditions that may support anthrax distribution and spore survival in Tarangire National Park, in Tanzania. Model inputs included 14 predictors from World Climatic, Landsat satellite, and World Soil Information datasets, as well as 636 presence-only occurrence data from park records from 2013 to 2023. The predicted suitable area favouring anthrax spores encompassed most of the savannah and open grassland in the northern part of the park, as well as narrow patches in the park's central region. The mean test AUC score was 0.91, and the predicted probability was 0.98 for anthrax presence. On average, the predicted probability of suitable conditions substantially improved with increasing levels of extractable phosphorus, exchangeable potassium, mean annual temperature, and soil pH. Furthermore, the probability of suitable habitat was highest at lower levels of fire frequency, exchangeable sodium, and extractable aluminium. The extensive track record of anthrax outbreaks in the area may be explained by the presence of these favourable soil characteristics and climate, which point to the long-term occurrence of anthrax spores in the park. However, the existence of suitable habitat in the northern part of the park presents opportunities for mobilising resources to mitigate the situation through activities such as targeted disease surveillance and the use of controlled fire.

AB  - The galloping rise in global population in recent years and the accompanying increase in food and energy demands has created land use crisis between food and energy production, and eventual loss of agricultural lands to the more lucrative photovoltaics (PV) energy production. This experiment was carried out to investigate the effect of organic photovoltaics (OPV) and red-foil (RF) transmittance on growth, yield, photosynthesis and SPAD value of spinach under greenhouse and field conditions. Three OPV levels (P0: control; P1: transmittance peak of 0.11 in blue light (BL) and 0.64 in red light (RL); P2: transmittance peak of 0.09 in BL and 0.11 in RL) and two spinach genotypes (bufflehead, eland) were combined in a 3 x 2 factorial arrangement in a completely randomized design with 4 replications in the greenhouse, while two RF levels (RF0: control; RF1: transmittance peak of 0.01 in BL and 0.89 in RL) and two spinach genotypes were combined in a 2 x 2 factorial in randomized complete block design with four replications in the field. Data were collected on growth, yield, photosynthesis and chlorophyll content. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) showed significant reduction in shoot weight and total biomass of spinach grown under very low light intensities as a function of the transmittance properties of the OPV cell used (P2). P1 competed comparably (p > 0.05) with control in most growth and yield traits measured. In addition, shoot to root distribution was higher in P1 than control. RF reduced shoot and total biomass production of spinach in the field due to its inability to transmit other spectra of light. OPV-RF transmittance did not affect plant height (PH), leaf number (LN), and SPAD value but leaf area (LA) was highest in P2. Photochemical energy conversion was higher in P1, P2 and RF1 in contrast to control due to lower levels of non-photochemical energy losses through the Y(NO) and Y(NPQ) pathways. Photo-irradiance curves showed that plants grown under reduced light (P2) did not efficiently manage excess light when exposed to high light intensities. Bufflehead genotype showed superior growth and yield traits than eland across OPV and RF levels. It is therefore recommended that OPV cells with transmittance properties greater than or equal to 11% in BL and 64% in RL be used in APV systems for improved photochemical and land use efficiency.

AB  - Instrumented buoys are used to monitor water quality, yet there remains a need to evaluate whether in vivo fluorometric measures of chlorophyll a (Chl a) produce accurate estimates of phytoplankton abundance. Here, 6 years (2014-2019) of in vitro measurements of Chl a by spectrophotometry were compared with coeval estimates from buoy-based fluorescence measurements in eutrophic Buffalo Pound Lake, Saskatchewan, Canada. Analysis revealed that fluorometric and in vitro estimates of Chl a differed both in terms of absolute concentration and patterns of relative change through time. Three models were developed to improve agreement between metrics of Chl a concentration, including two based on Chl a and phycocyanin (PC) fluorescence and one based on multiple linear regressions with measured environmental conditions. All models were examined in terms of two performance metrics; accuracy (lowest error) and reliability (% fit within confidence intervals). The model based on PC fluorescence was most accurate (error = 35%), whereas that using environmental factors was most reliable (89% within 3 sigma of mean). Models were also evaluated on their ability to produce spatial maps of Chl a using remotely sensed imagery. Here, newly developed models significantly improved system performance with a 30% decrease in Chl a errors and a twofold increase in the range of reconstructed Chl a values. Superiority of the PC model likely reflected high cyanobacterial abundance, as well as the excitation-emission wavelength configuration of fluorometers. Our findings suggest that a PC fluorometer, used alone or in combination with environmental measurements, performs better than a single-excitation-band Chl a fluorometer in estimating Chl a content in highly eutrophic waters.

AB  - The gut microbiome plays an important role in the metabolism, nutrient absorption and immunocompetency of animals. The dynamics of the microbiota can be influenced by modulatory factors that involve nutrition, environment, health, diseases, etc. Few reports have been documented regarding the effects of different feeds on the fungi microbiome of Suffolk crossed with Tibetan sheep. A total of 30 Suffolk crossed with Tibetan sheep (ST sheep) were selected for the study and randomly divided into five equal groups (n = 6): AZ, BZ, CZ, DZ and EZ. Group AZ was fed with alfalfa and oat grass, whereas group BZ was fed with mixture of concentrated feed, alfalfa and oat grass. Groups CZ, DZ and EZ were fed with concentrated feed #1, #2 and #3, respectively. All experimental animals were fed twice a day for four months, and rectum samples were collected for microbiota analysis. Results revealed that 2,781,461 raw reads and 2,333,239 clean reads were achieved in the ST sheep. When compared with the sheep of groups AZ and BZ (164), the shared amplicon sequence variants (ASVs) between AZ and CZ (109), AZ (113) and DZ (118) as well as AZ along with EZ were fewer. Conspicuous different phyla (8) and genera (56) were examined and compared with free-range sheep in AZ. Genera including Xeromyces, Kazachstania, Cordyceps, Rhodotorula, Pichia, Spor, etc. were found higher in animals in the CZ, DZ and EZ groups. The results of this study provide new insights regarding the effects of different feeds on the fungi microbiome of sheep farmed on the plateau. We concluded that the differences in feed in Suffolk crossed with Tibetan sheep altered their gut microbiota.

AB  - Landscape heterogeneity and the host plant use are factors suggested to play determinant roles in shaping the evolutionary history of herbivorous insects. However, the role of the reconfiguration of host plants distributions linked to Quaternary climate oscillations as drivers of contemporary population genetic structure is still poorly understood. Here, we formally examine the relative contribution of such factors on intraspecific diversification using the South American cactus moth, Cactoblastis cactorum, an herbivore insect specialized in the use of cacti as host plants. We assessed genomic variation using genome-wide SNPs and mitochondrial data in populations sampled across a broad geographical gradient where moths feed on different cactus species. We integrated demographic simulations and ecological niche modeling into a landscape genomics framework, to test alternative hypotheses of past and current population connectivity for both C. cactorum and its host plants. Regions exhibiting higher genomic diversity were evaluated for congruence with areas where suitable climatic conditions remained stable through time. Our results revealed that past spatial configuration of suitable habitat conditions and shifts of host plants distributions are the factors that better explain the intraspecific diversification. Genomic data also supported the hypothesis that areas of long-term habitat stability served as refugia for C. cactorum, enabling the maintenance of high levels of genetic diversity over time. Overall, our study highlights the importance of integrating inter-specific interactions and their spatio-temporal dynamics to better understand the relative importance of abiotic and biotic factors driving the diversification processes in herbivorous insects with broad geographical and restricted host ranges.

AB  - Background: The use of carbonaceous materials for environmental remediation is attractive due to low expense and high sorption capacity. However, their efficiency in contaminant removal is affected by substrate composition and sorption mechanism.
   Objective: This study investigated atrazine sorption and desorption in three carbon-rich substrates. Data were evaluated considering isotherm models and sorbent chemical composition.
   Methods: Sorption was performed by the batch equilibrium method with three substrates obtained from pig slurry composting with different proportions (w/w) of charcoal fines (CF): CF0, CF9 (9% CF), and CF18 (18% CF). The substrates were characterized by elemental analysis, C-13 NMR CP/MAS spectroscopy. The Freundlich and Dubinin-Radushkevich (DRK) models better fitted the sorption data (0.96>R-2>0.81), followed by Temkin (0.95>R-2>0.76). Charcoal addition to composting substrates increased carbon content and the aromaticity in the order CF0<CF9< CF18. However, the sorption affinity decreased in the opposite order as indicated by the Kf values: 675, 335 and 290 L kg(-1), respectively. Values of the E parameter (DRK) varied from 8.05 to 8.29 kJ mol(-1), suggesting a predominant physical sorption mechanism, whereas the Bt coefficient ( Temkin) indicated an endothermic process. Desorption was only observed at higher atrazine concentrations (>10 mg L-1), and the desorption Kf values were greater than the respective sorption values.
   Conclusions: Atrazine sorption in the tested C-rich substrates is not governed by the carbon content or aromaticity. The low sorption reversibility implies a low atrazine mobility from the tested substrates and suggests their potential for herbicide removal in the environment.

AB  - Across North America, many ungulate species that experienced historic population declines and range contractions are now broadly distributed across their native ranges after the implementation of successful restoration programs. The use of translocation continues to serve as an important restoration tool and is often informed through habitat models used to identify potential translocation areas based on biotic and abiotic landscape characteristics. Within the context of partially migratory wildlife populations, resident and migrant population segments can select for varying habitat characteristics, yet these population segments are often pooled when building habitat models. We used a large spatial dataset collected from eight bighorn sheep (Ovis canadensis) populations to build separate winter and summer resource selection models for migrant and resident animals with the purposes of (1) characterizing differences in seasonal selection patterns between resident and migrant population segments and (2) generating broad spatial predictions of bighorn sheep habitat to inform future translocations across western Montana, USA. Lastly, we used the model to inform two potential management scenarios, first to establish a new population in an unoccupied area and second to expand the distribution of existing populations through intra-mountain translocations. Selection patterns were generally similar among migrants and residents, especially in winter. Summer selection patterns varied between the two behaviors, with migrants selecting for higher elevations and residents selecting for lower elevations. Throughout the western Montana prediction area, bighorn sheep habitat was centered around mountain areas in all seasons. In the first management scenario, our model predicted that adequate resident and migratory bighorn sheep habitat existed in the restoration area, thus justifying the use of either resident or migrant source populations in translocation. In the second management scenario, our model predicted that there was broad potential for translocations into unoccupied areas adjacent to the current bighorn sheep distribution in western Montana. The behavior-specific approach to predicting bighorn sheep seasonal habitat captures the specific habitat characteristics of multiple migratory behaviors and may help to inform targeted and effective translocation programs.

AB  - Fat deposition is very important to the growth and reproduction of yaks. In this study, the effect of the feeding system on fat deposition in yaks was explored by transcriptomics and lipidomics. The thickness of the subcutaneous fat in yaks under stall (SF) and graze feeding (GF) was evaluated. The transcriptomes and lipidomes of the subcutaneous fat in yaks under different feeding systems were detected by RNA-sequencing (RNA-Seq) and non-targeted lipidomics based on ultrahigh-phase liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (UHPLC-MS), respectively. The differences in lipid metabolism were explored, and the function of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) was evaluated by gene ontology (GO) and Kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genome (KEGG) analysis. Compared with GF yaks, SF yaks possessed stronger fat deposition capacity. The abundance of 12 triglycerides (TGs), 3 phosphatidylethanolamines (PEs), 3 diglycerides (DGs), 2 sphingomyelins (SMs) and 1 phosphatidylcholine (PC) in the subcutaneous fat of SF and GF yaks was significantly different. Under the mediation of the cGMP-PKG signaling pathway, the blood volume of SF and GF yaks may be different, which resulted in the different concentrations of precursors for fat deposition, including non-esterified fatty acid (NEFA), glucose (GLU), TG and cholesterol (CH). The metabolism of C16:0, C16:1, C17:0, C18:0, C18:1, C18:2 and C18:3 in yak subcutaneous fat was mainly realized under the regulation of the INSIG1, ACACA, FASN, ELOVL6 and SCD genes, and TG synthesis was regulated by the AGPAT2 and DGAT2 genes. This study will provide a theoretical basis for yak genetic breeding and healthy feeding.

AB  - Wild small rodents are considered the natural reservoirs of Mycobacterium microti, a member of the Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex (MTBC) that can cause tuberculosis (TB) in humans and animals, as well as interfere with current tuberculosis eradication plans in livestock. A cross-sectional study was carried out in the Catalan Pyrenees (Iberian Peninsula) in an area where M. microti was previously isolated from wild boars, to evaluate the role of micromammals in the epidemiology of this outbreak. A total of 350 wild rodents were necropsied (306 Murinae and 44 Arvicolinae) in spring and autumn during two consecutive natural years. Tissues were analyzed by histopathology to look for TB-like lesions and by qPCR and culture to detect MTBC. Sera were analyzed by MTBC-specific ELISA. No evidence of TB infection in wild rodents was confirmed. Results suggest that small rodents did not play a role in the epidemiology of M. microti in the area. The source of this mycobacterium remains unknown, but previous detections of M. microti in various species in southern France suggest the movements of wild boars across the French Pyrenees as the most likely origin of the outbreak detected in the Iberian Peninsula.

AB  - Sawfishes (Pristidae) have been severely impacted by coastal development and unregulated fisheries and are considered Critically Endangered by the IUCN Red List. Environmental DNA (eDNA) analyses have shown potential for monitoring elasmobranch species, with various studies focusing on using species-specific approaches to detect Pristis species. However positive detection using existing probes has not been confirmed in some geographic regions where they would be expected. Here, we aimed to verify the phylogenetic relationships within the Pristidae family, with a particular focus on P. pristis (Linnaeus, 1758) to test whether mutations at key sites have been detrimental to species-specific detection of P. pristis using the existing probe set. To test this hypothesis mitogenomes were assembled that were found to follow the typical pattern of vertebrate mitogenomic organization. Phylogenetic trees showed similar topologies and confirmed geographic mitochondrial variation in P. pristis. Mismatches for the published 12S species-specific probe set for P. pristis were identified that prevent amplification of positive control samples from Brazil. However, ddPCR detection of the positive control was possible using a newly designed species-specific probe set. This study highlights how geographical variation can severely impact the success of generally applying species-specific detection systems developed based on data from only one geographical region. The new mitogenomes and species-specific probe set developed here may also contribute to improving the potential to map and monitor these Critically En-dangered species across the globe.

AB  - Mesoscale eddies shape the foraging ecology of predators such as marine mammals and seabirds. A growing number of animal tracking studies show that predators alter their swimming, diving, and foraging behavior within mesoscale eddies. However, little is known about how Southern Ocean eddies influence the distribution of mesopelagic micronekton (fish, squid, and crustaceans), which are major prey items of megafauna. Studies in other oceanic regions have found that eddies can influence the abundance and community composition of micronekton. Here, we analyze acoustic observations from a 14-day survey of a cyclonic mesoscale eddy, its surrounding waters, and the Polar Frontal Zone (PFZ) waters where the eddy formed. We report and interpret spatial patterns of acoustic backscatter at 18 and 75 kHz, proxies indicating combined changes in species, size, and abundance of micronekton. We find that the vertical distribution of acoustic backscatter matched the underwater light conditions characteristic of the eddy core, periphery, and surrounding waters, at scales smaller than 10 km. The median water-column integrated acoustic backscatter values in the eddy core were only half of those measured in the Sub-Antarctic Zone waters surrounding the eddy, but similar to those measured in the PFZ, where the eddy originated 27 days prior. These results suggest that, as for physical and chemical tracers, the eddy maintained its biological characteristics from its source waters creating a unique habitat compared to its surroundings.

AB  - Developing a robust understanding of Pacific halibut reproductive biology is essential to understanding the different components (e.g. maturity) that determine the reproductive output of the species and, therefore, for estimating the relative female spawning biomass. With these, effective and proactive management strategies can be designed and implemented to face the large-scale environmental changes to which high-latitude spawning fish are particularly vulnerable. To date, reproductive studies of Pacific halibut have mainly focused on population or regional scales, leaving the specific details of organism-level reproductive development unexamined. The work described here aimed to address information gaps in Pacific halibut reproductive biology by conducting a detailed histological examination of temporal changes in ovarian development over an annual reproductive cycle with special attention to the use of biological indicators (e.g. oocyte diameter, gonadosomatic index, hepatosomatic index, Fulton's condition factor, somatic fat) in characterizing female developmental stages and reproductive phases. Our results provide a foundation for future studies directed at improving current maturity estimations by histological assessment and explore models that test the utility of biological indicators to predict maturity in this important fish species.

AB  - The effects of three different CO2 concentrations (400, 600, and 1000 ppm) on the population parameters and growth of the green peach aphid, Myzus persicae, were examined. Raw life history data from M. persicae were analyzed using an age-stage, two-sex life table to take into account the viable development rate among individuals. The population projections of M. persicae indicate the stage structure and variability of the population growth under different CO2 concentrations based on an age-stage, two-sex life table analysis. Significantly longer oviposition duration and higher fecundity were observed under elevated CO2 (600 and 1000 ppm) than those under ambient CO2 (400 ppm). Furthermore, the M. persicae population reared under elevated CO2 concentrations showed higher intrinsic and finite rates of population increase than under ambient CO2 concentrations. These results indicate that the population parameters and growth of M. persicae were positively influenced in the fecundity by elevated CO2 concentrations relative to the ambient CO2. These findings indicate that it is basically remained to understand the direct effects of CO2 elevation on the host plants, and the interaction between the host plants and M. persicae in the same CO2 concentration for establishing more realistic population growth model systems for M. persicae in the aerial environment rising CO2 concentration level.

AB  - The widespread invasive success of Ulex europaeus, a thorny shrub native to NW Europe, remains to be understood from a functional perspective. According to the Enemy Release Hypothesis (ERH), lower pressure by vertebrate herbivores in the invaded areas should lead to lower investment in (costly) physical defenses, allowing plants to invest more in growth and/or reproduction. While U. europaeus seedlings have spines, adult plants have thorns, which are the main photosynthetic tissue (leaves are reduced to small phyllodes). Therefore, reduced biomass investment in thorns could compromise photosynthesis and growth in the invaded range. We hypothesized that U. europaeus plants in invaded ranges should show a reduction in the defensive components of thorns (e.g., softer and less fibrous tissues), but not reduced biomass allocation. We compared U. europaeus plants from the invaded (Chile) and native (Spain) distribution ranges regarding: (i) spinescence traits (thorn length, width, biomass, slenderness and bending strength) in adult plants, (ii) thorn fiber content and digestibility (proxies for palatability) in adult plants, and (iii) spine density in seedlings grown in a common garden. As expected, plants in the invaded range showed larger thorns, which contained less cellulose, were slenderer and easier to bend than those from plants in the native range. Likewise, seedlings from the invaded range showed lower spine density and more diameter growth, thus supporting the ERH. We found functional changes in spinescence traits between distribution ranges consistent with the dual role of thorns in U. europaeus, and these changes may partly explain its invasiveness.

AB  - Declining natural pollinator populations are a potential threat to global food supplies. Mass flowering summer annual oilseeds can provide much needed crop diversity and floral resources to support pollinator communities. We evaluated how managing planting date affects floral phenology, floral accumulation (flower coverage time x flower area), pollinator visitation, pollinator diversity and yield of nine oilseed crops. Borage (Borago officinalis L.), calendula (Calendula officinalis L.), crambe (Crambe abyssinica Hochst), cuphea (Cuphea viscosissima Jacq. x Cuphea lanceolata W. T. Aiton), echium (Echium plantagineum L.), flax (Linum usitatissimum L.), spring camelina (Camelina sativa (L.) Crantz), spring canola (Brassica napus L.) and sunflower [Helianthus annuus L.] were grown in Morris, Minnesota during the summers of 2013 and 2014. Each crop was planted on a "standard" planting date of mid-May and additional planting dates of early May, early June and early July. Shifting planting dates affected flowering phenology, floral accumulation, pollinator visitation and crop yield. Later planting dates led to later onset of flowering for all crops and affected total floral accumulation for crambe, cuphea and echium. Pollinator visitations changed with planting date and were generally greater with the later planting dates. At least two of the four planting dates supported high yield for each crop. The ability to maintain high crop yield across a window of planting dates affords growers management options for their fields and can be used to design complementary resource pairing and improve pollinator health through crop diversification and management.

AB  - Understanding the evolutionary forces that maintain phenotypic variation in ecologically relevant traits has long been one of the central goals of evolutionary ecology. While the maintenance of variation in plant defense is most often hypothesized to be due to trait trade-offs or spatiotemporal variation in herbivore abundance, the role that heterogeneous selective agents may play on the maintenance of variation in plant defense is less examined. Trichomes are hair-like appendages on plant surfaces that can defend against multiple damaging agents such as pathogens, herbivores, and UV radiation. It is currently unknown however if conflicting selection from such heterogeneous agents of damage may act to maintain the variation observed in trichome traits. Here, we assess whether trichomes serve as an herbicide resistance trait and how it coincides with the conventionally studied defensive strategy of herbivory resistance. In a series of experiments, we exposed the annual invasive velvetleaf (Abutilon theophrasti) to glyphosate (active ingredient in "Roundup") to investigate whether trichome traits (type and density) are linked to herbicide resistance and to test whether herbicide influences selection on plant trichomes. We found that an increased proportion of branched trichomes positively impacted herbicide resistance and chewing herbivory resistance. We also found evidence that glyphosate imposes positive selection on branched trichomes in velvetleaf. Overall, our results indicate that branched trichomes can contribute to both herbicide and herbivory resistance, serving a concordant rather than conflicting role to reduce plant injury. Our findings further suggest that novel anthropogenic agents of selection can alter the composition of plant defense traits, potentially impacting trait-mediated interactions among external stressors.

AB  - 1. Recent studies suggest that changes in leaf traits due to interactions between plants affect resource utilisation by herbivores, as well as herbivore distribution. However, this has not yet been confirmed experimentally. Here, we investigated the effects of phenotypic plasticity in leaf traits of Rumex obtusifofius (host plant) in response to intraspecific and interspecific interactions on the distribution of two leaf beetles, Gastrophysa atrocyanea (specialist herbivore) and Gaierucella grisescens (generalist herbivore).
   2. We investigated the local population density of R. obtusifolius plants and the presence of leaf beetles on the plants at five study sites. Leaf chemicals (condensed tannins and total phenolics) were compared between aggregated and solitary R. obtusifolius plants. To clarify the effects of the interaction environment of R. obtusifolius plants on their leaf traits and on resource utilisation by the leaf beetles, we compared leaf chemicals and preferences of adult leaf beetles among treatments where R. obtusifolius experienced intraspecific interaction, interspecific interaction or no interaction in cultivation experiments. Finally, we evaluated the independent and combined effects of patch size and intraspecific interaction on leaf beetle distribution in mesocosm experiments.
   3. In the field, the presence of the specialist leaf beetle G. atrocyanea was positively correlated with the local population density (rosette overlap ratio) of R. obtusifofius plants; however, there was no correlation in the case of the generalist leaf beetle G. grisescens. In the cultivation experiments, plants in the intraspecific interaction treatment increased their leaf concentrations of condensed tannins and total phenolics, and G. atrocyanea consumed more of these leaves than leaves in other treatments. Similar results were observed in the field. In the mesocosm experiments, larger numbers of G. atrocyanea were distributed on R. obtusifolius plants exposed to below-ground intraspecific interaction than on plants not exposed to intraspecific interaction.
   4. Our results provide experimental evidence that leaf-trait changes in response to intraspecific interaction between host plants influence specialist herbivore distribution. This highlights the need to integrate plant-plant interactions into our understanding of plant-animal interactions.

AB  - Aim. To assess the consequences of long-term consumption by pigs of feed experimentally contaminated with T-2 toxin in an amount dose to the most commonly found in feed.
   Material and Methods. The experiments were carried out on pigs, which were fed food contaminated with T-2 toxin in the amount of 200 mkg/kg for 45 days. During the experiment, the clinical condition of animals, feed and water consumption, the dynamics of live weight, analysis of blood parameters, the state of internal organs and tissues and statistical processing of the data obtained by conventional methods were undertaken.
   Results. Long-term consumption of feed contaminated with mycotoxin T-2 by pigs did not cause a pronounced clinical picture of toxicosis. However, the treated animals had diarrhea and lag in growth and development. According to the results of the blood test, it was concluded that the toxin suppressed the hematopoiesis process, inhibited protein synthesis, reduced resistance and microphagocytic function of the body, metabolic disorders and the functioning of most organs and systems. Pathological conditions and degenerative changes of cells and tissues of internal organs were recorded and mediated by the initiation of oxidative stress, inflammatory processes and cytotoxic effect.
   Conclusions. The consumption of feed contaminated with T-2 toxin in a dose of 200 mkg /kg by pigs was accompanied by disturbances of metabolic processes, functions of organs and systems, manifested by a decrease in growth intensity, changes in the blood picture, activity of enzyme systems, induction of oxidative stress, immunosuppressive and inflammatory reactions and pathomorphological disorders. Thus, the oral intake of T-2 toxin, even in small concentrations, was found to have a complex negative effect on the body.

AB  - Ecotones, characterized by adjacent yet distinct biotic communities, provide natural laboratories in which to investigate how environmental selection influences the ecology and evolution of organisms. For wild herbivores, differential plant availability across sharp ecotones may be an important source of dietary-based selection.
   We studied small herbivore diet composition across a sharp ecotone where two species of woodrat, Neotoma bryanti and N. lepida, come into secondary contact with one another and hybridize. We quantified woodrat dietary preference through trnL metabarcoding of field-collected fecal pellets and experimental choice trials. Despite gene flow, parental N. bryanti and N. lepida maintain distinct diets across this fine spatial scale, and across temporal scales that span both wet and dry conditions.
   Neotoma bryanti maintained a more diverse diet, with Frangula californica (California coffeeberry) making up a large portion of its diet. Neotoma lepida maintains a less diverse diet, with Prunus fasciculata (desert almond) comprising more than half of its diet. Both F. californica and P. fasciculata are known to produce potentially toxic plant secondary compounds (PSCs), which should deter herbivory, yet these plants have relatively high nutritional value as measured by crude protein content.
   Neotoma bryanti and N. lepida consumed F. californica and P. fasciculata, respectively, in greater abundance than these plants are available on the landscape-indicating dietary selection. Finally, experimental preference trials revealed that N. bryanti exhibited a preference for F. californica, while N. lepida exhibited a relatively stronger preference for P. fasciculata. We find that N. bryanti exhibit a generalist herbivore strategy relative to N. lepida, which exhibit a more specialized feeding strategy in this study system.
   Our results suggest that woodrats respond to fine-scale environmental differences in plant availability that may require different metabolic strategies in order to balance nutrient acquisition while minimizing exposure to potentially toxic PSCs.

AB  - The results of studying the space use and seasonal migrations of the Topozero territorial group of wild forest reindeer females in the Republic of Karelia are presented. Telemetry (GPS-collars) was used to assess the migration of the wild forest reindeer. Individual variations were noted in seasonal migrations: two individuals were relatively sedentary, whereas the third moved long distances during the year, with the distance between the extreme locations amounting to more than 70 km. The timing of the start of seasonal migrations varied between years. The use of the same summer habitats in different years was revealed, but the territories of the rut and winter pastures were different for the same animals. Movements of animals over fairly long distances have been noted, which is probably associated with the disturbance factor on the part of predators and/or humans.

AB  - Florivores modify the attributes of flowers while feeding, that affects the behavior and frequency of pollinators that visit flowers and setting of fruits and seed as a result of low pollen deposition. We determined the effect of experimental florivory on pollinators visitations, fruit-set, and seed-set of Opuntia cantabrigiensis. Four treatments were applied on intact flowers during reproductive season: 1) removal of 50% of the perianth, 2) emasculated flower, 3) flower without stigma, perianth and stamens (stigma-perianth) and 4) intact flower-control; selected treatments mimic the types of florivory observed in the population. The frequency of visitation, activity and taxonomic identity of the pollinator were recorded. We found that frequency of pollinators decreased with damage to the flower, with the stigma-perianth treatment receiving the fewest visits. The most frequent pollinators were the solitary bees Macrotera sinaloana, Diadasia rinconis, and Lithurgopsis apicalis (Hymenoptera) that collect rewards and perch on the stigma of flowers. Pollinators responded differently to florivory; Ashmeadiella opuntiae avoided flowers with perianth damage, possibly associating it with a lack of rewards, while D. rinconis prefered such flowers, the removal of this structure facilitated access to floral rewards. Flowers in the stigma-perianth treatment produced seedless fruit. Intact flowers had higher seed production than those with perianth damage or emasculation due to low pollinator visitation and pollen deposition. Opuntia cantabrigiensis is a xenogamous species with dependence on biotic vectors, therefore the damage caused by florivores reduces the visit of their pollinators and its reproductive success, which could negatively affect the population persistence.

AB  - Accurate estimates of manure-induced carbon retention coefficients (MCR) in soil are required when assessing carbon (C) storage and the C footprint in agricultural production systems. Eight field studies using various types and rates of manure applications on different crop rotations with durations varying from 10 to 74 years were used to quantify MCRs across diverse climatic conditions in Canada. The rate of solid cattle and swine manure had no impact on MCR which averaged 26%, whereas the MCR for liquid manure, including swine and cattle liquid manures, was much smaller, at only 5%. Under semi-arid conditions, irrigation had no impact on MCR. Compared to stockpiled manures, composted manure had a higher MCR (similar to 36%), due to the additional stabilization of C during the composting process. The MCRs can be effectively stratified based on the type of manure affecting soil organic C differently, and the approach has potential application in regional and national estimates of soil C storage in Canada and elsewhere.

AB  - Simple Summary In this study, consumer preferences for pork produced using animal-welfare-enhancing farming strategies were assessed. In China, the demand for animal-friendly products is increasing, but so far, studies on consumer preferences for animal welfare farming attributes are limited. The objective of this study was to analyze consumer preferences for pork based on four animal welfare farming attributes, namely feed nutrition, living environment, health care, and activity space. The study employed a choice experiment approach. The survey covered 1274 pork consumers in Guangdong province, China. Our empirical results suggest that Chinese consumers were willing to pay an additional 2.359-10.477 CNY/500 g (5.27-23.39%) for animal welfare pork. Furthermore, there was significant heterogeneity in consumer preferences. China is the world's largest producer and consumer of pork. Since the outbreaks of African swine fever in 2018, China's pork imports have been constantly on the rise. The results can contribute to the optimization of pork production structures and marketing plans for stakeholders and can assist with the timely development of international competition strategies for animal-derived trade products. Consumption demands for pork produced by farms that employ strategies to improve animal welfare ("animal welfare pork") will be an important indicator for predicting domestic pig feeding standards and pork industry development. This paper analyzes consumer preferences for animal welfare pork based on the choice experiment data of 1274 pork consumers in Guangdong province, China. The results show that consumers had a significant preference for animal welfare pork and that they were willing to pay a premium of 2.359-10.477 CNY/500 g (5.27-23.39%) on average. There is heterogeneity in consumer preferences regarding age, education level, and income. Producers of animal-derived products can not only adjust the mix of production conditions to improve pig welfare and innovate contractual arrangements for industry chain stakeholder groups, but they can also develop differentiated marketing strategies for animal welfare products to meet consumer demands for animal welfare.

AB  - Background: Between 2006 and 2014, 10 cases of urolithiasis in yaks with calcium carbonate uroliths were confirmed in Switzerland, and at the same time, a sixfold calcium overhang in roughage in an affected farm was evident. The purpose of this study was the question of whether urolithiasis in yaks in the alpine regions of Switzerland poses a husbandry risk. The hypothesis was that elevated calcium levels in roughage led to hypercalcemia and, thus, the formation of calcium carbonate stones. Methods: Blood samples from 99 animals from 10 farms were examined (n = 6 problem farms; n = 4 control farms). Several metabolites were analyzed in the blood and urine. In addition, roughage, soil, and water samples were analyzed. The farms were distributed within different regions of Switzerland. Results: This study revealed different Ca:P ratios, from 1.56 to 7.74:1, in the forages and mild hypercalcemia in the animals of the problem farms. In a univariate analysis of the problem versus control farms, about 20 other significant factors emerged. Multivariate analysis showed that altitude, CP (crude protein), P, Mg, NDF, and ADF in the diet are important factors. Based on analysis of the pedigree, there was no evidence of an obvious genetic background of urolithiasis. Limitations: A limitation of this study is the small number of yaks in Switzerland. Conclusions: The question of whether urolithiasis in yaks in alpine Switzerland poses a husbandry risk can be answered affirmatively. Calcium-rich forages play a crucial role in this multifactorial process.

AB  - Balanced chromosomal rearrangements, mainly reciprocal translocations, are considered to be the causative agent of several clinical conditions in farmed pigs, resulting in hypoprolificacy and economic losses. Literature suggests that reciprocal translocations are heritable and can occur de novo. The prevalence rate of these balanced structural rearrangements of chromosomes differs from country to country and varies between 0.5% and 3.3%. The Australian pig population is descendent of a small founder population and has since been a closed genetic group since the 1980s. Hence, any incident of reciprocal translocation along with the pedigree of boars that contribute sperm for artificial insemination has the potential to have an economic consequence. To date, there has been no published account for screening of reciprocal translocation associated with hypoprolificacy in the Australian pig population. In this study, we performed standard and molecular cytogenetic analyses to identify evidence of chromosome rearrangements and their association with hypoprolificacy in a representative 94 boar samples from a commercial nucleus herd. We identified three novel rearrangements between chromosomes 5 and 14, between chromosomes 9 and 10, and between chromosomes 10 and 12. In addition, we also detected a reciprocal translocation between chromosomes 3 and 16 that has previously been detected in pig herds in France. The prevalence rate was 6.38% within the samples used in this study. All four rearrangements were found to have an association with hypoprolificacy. Further study and routine monitoring will be necessary to identify any further rearrangements that will allow breeders to prevent the propagation of reciprocal translocations from generation to generation within the Australian pig population.

AB  - Vehicle collisions with wild pigs (Sus scrofa) are reported almost everywhere this species is found. However, this is one of the least studied and characterized forms of damage that these invasive animals cause in the United States (U.S.). We analyzed 518 wild pig-vehicle collisions (WPVCs) that took place statewide in Georgia between 2015 and 2021. From that dataset, we analyzed several parameters in order to better understand and characterize these accidents on a scale that had previously not been done in the U.S. Wild pig-vehicle collisions were reported from 105 out of the 159 counties in Georgia, increasing in number annually over the seven-year period. WPVCs were most likely to occur in the fall (37%). A duration weighted time of day analysis showed that WPVCs were most frequent at dusk. Most (97%) reported accidents were caused by live wild pigs, with the remainder being due to collisions with already dead or road-killed pigs. Most (86%) collisions involved a single wild pig while the remainder occurred with two or more pigs. Collisions occurred mostly with passenger cars on dry, straight, and level two-lane blacktop roads under dark, unlighted conditions. Nine percent of the vehicle accidents involving wild pigs resulted in injuries to the drivers and passengers. Some of the most severe injuries reported were caused by swerving to avoid striking wild pigs. No human fatalities were recorded due to these accidents. Wild pig-vehicle collisions are costly and dangerous and should be closely monitored and mitigated by the agencies responsible for motorist safety, transportation infrastructure, and wildlife management.

AB  - Thecarbon flows of China's iron and steel industrywas tracked between producers and users to reveal the spatial shiftsin CO2 equivalent emissions.
   Accurately tracking carbon flows is the first step towardreducingthe climate impacts of the iron and steel industry (ISI), which isstill lacking in China. In this study, we track carbon flows fromcoal/mineral mines to end steel users by coupling the cross-processmaterial and energy flow model, point-based emission inventory, andinterprovincial trade matrices. In 2020, ISI emitted 2288 Tg of CO2 equivalent (CO(2)eq, including CH4 andCO(2)), 96% of which came from energy use and 4% from rawmaterial decomposition. Often overlooked off-gas use and CH4 leakage in coal mines account for 25% of life-cycle emissions. Dueto limited scrap resources and a high proportion of pig iron feed,the life-cycle emission intensity of the electric arc furnace (EAF)(1.15 t CO(2)eq/t steel) is slightly lower than the basicoxygen furnace (BOF) (1.58 t CO(2)eq/t steel) in China. Inaddition, over 49% of producer-based emissions are driven by interprovincialcoal/coke/steel trade. In particular, nearly all user-based emissionsin Zhejiang and Beijing are transferred to steelmaking bases. Therefore,we highlight the need for life-cycle and spatial shifts in user-sidecarbon management.

AB  - Cumulus granulosa cells (CGCs) are a type of important ovarian somatic cells that carries out various functions related to oogenesis, follicular development and embryogenesis. The study on the development and function of CGCs facilitates the understanding of reproductive regulation in female animals. Sirtuin 7 (SIRT7) is a member of the sirtuin family of NAD(+)-dependent deacetylases mediating numerous biological processes. In this study, we detected the localization of SIRT7 in yak ovaries as well as explored the function of SiRT7 in yak CGCs. The results revealed that the SIRT7 protein was mainly localized in the cytoplasm of oocytes, granulosa cells and theca cells. The knockdown of SIRT7 in yak CGCs repressed cell proliferation and impacted the expressions of several apoptosis-related genes. Furthermore, oestrogen synthesis was also inhibited in SIRT7-deficient yak CGCs. The expressions of several sterogenesis-related genes decreased significantly following SIRT7 knockdown. In addition, the lack of SIRT7 in yak CGCs resulted in decreased levels of the TGFB/SMAD family members TGFB1, TGFBR1 SMAD2 and SMAD3. Moreover, the activation of the TGFB/SMAD pathway by adding TGFB/SMAD pathway activator SRI-011381 partially rescued the level of oestrogen secreted by SIRT7-deficient yak CGCs, as well as the expressions of steroidogenesis-related genes NR5A1 and CYP19A1. This research is the first to focus on the role of SIRT7 in yak ovary, and the outcomes offer new insights into the mechanism governing yak reproduction.

AB  - Intraguild interactions among carnivores have long held the fascination of ecologists. Ranging from competition to facilitation and coexistence, these interactions and their complex interplay influence everything from species persistence to ecosystem functioning. Yet, the patterns and pathways of such interactions are far from understood in tropical forest systems, particularly across countries in the Global South. Here, we examined the determinants and consequences of competitive interactions between dholes Cuon alpinus and the two large felids (leopards Panthera pardus and tigers Panthera tigris) with which they most commonly co-occur across Asia. Using a combination of traditional and novel data sources (N = 118), we integrate information from spatial, temporal, and dietary niche dimensions. These three species have faced catastrophic declines in their extent of co-occurrence over the past century; most of their source populations are now confined to Protected Areas. Analysis of dyadic interactions between species pairs showed a clear social hierarchy. Tigers were dominant over dholes, although pack strength in dholes helped ameliorate some of these effects; leopards were subordinate to dholes. Population-level spatio-temporal interactions assessed at 25 locations across Asia did not show a clear pattern of overlap or avoidance between species pairs. Diet-profile assessments indicated that wild ungulate biomass consumption by tigers was highest, while leopards consumed more primate and livestock prey as compared to their co-predators. In terms of prey offtake (ratio of wild prey biomass consumed to biomass available), the three species together harvested 0.4-30.2% of available prey, with the highest offtake recorded from the location where the carnivores reach very high densities. When re-examined in the context of prey availability and offtake, locations with low wild prey availability showed spatial avoidance and temporal overlap among the carnivore pairs, and locations with high wild prey availability showed spatial overlap and temporal segregation. Based on these observations, we make predictions for 40 Protected Areas in India where temporally synchronous estimates of predator and prey densities are available. We expect that low prey availability will lead to higher competition, and in extreme cases, to the complete exclusion of one or more species. In Protected Areas with high prey availability, we expect intraguild coexistence and conspecific competition among carnivores, with spill-over to forest-edge habitats and subsequent prey-switching to livestock. We stress that dhole-leopard-tiger co-occurrence across their range is facilitated through an intricate yet fragile balance between prey availability, and intraguild and conspecific competition. Data gaps and limitations notwithstanding, our study shows how insights from fundamental ecology can be of immense utility for applied aspects like large predator conservation and management of human-carnivore interactions. Our findings also highlight potential avenues for future research on tropical carnivores that can broaden current understanding of intraguild competition in forest systems of Asia and beyond.

AB  - Context Aerial distance sampling surveys are a widely used approach for estimating the abundance of wildlife populations, including kangaroos and other macropods. When analysing such data, design-based estimates of abundance extrapolate density from the sampled region to the broader area. In contrast, model-based approaches that use relationships between population density and habitat variables can deliver greater precision and ecological insight into population estimates.Aims This study aimed to evaluate recent spatio-temporal trends in the abundance of grey kangaroos (Macropus giganteus and M. fuliginosus) in Victoria, Australia using both design-based and model-based distance sampling.Methods Aerial surveys were conducted in seven management zones spread across the non-forested parts of Victoria on four occasions between 2017 and 2022. Distance sampling data were analysed to obtain design-based and model-based estimates of population size and relative precision across the entire study area, and for each management zone for each of the four surveys.Key results Model-based and design-based estimates of abundance proved to be broadly comparable, but with mostly higher precision for the model-based estimates at both statewide and management zone scales. The model-based approach revealed relationships between transect-level abundance and land-use type, normalised difference vegetation index (NDVI), annual rainfall and the amount of ecotonal habitat in the vicinity of the transects. Between 2017 and 2022 (a period coinciding with a prolonged La Ni & ntilde;a event), the total abundance of grey kangaroos increased by approximately 87% (based on the model-based inferences) despite an ongoing harvesting program.Conclusions In addition to improved precision, model based estimation revealed relationships between habitat variables and transect-level abundance, allowing prediction of abundance at small scales.Implications The improved precision of model-based estimates of abundance will provide greater confidence in kangaroo management decisions such as setting of statewide harvest quotas. Model-based estimates at smaller spatial scales will similarly support localised management decisions.

AB  - Atlantic cod Gadus morhua and American plaice Hippoglossoides platessoides are two of the most commercially valuable species in the Barents Sea (FAO Area 27). They are considered as an important but neglected source of zoonotic risk associated with nematodes from the genus Phocanema. The abundance of Phocanema spp. in a fish host individual in the Barents Sea may be quite high, which is convenient for studying the genetic structure of its populations. A total of 69 third-stage juveniles of Phocanema spp. were isolated from the liver, the mesentery, and the musculature of G. morhua and H. platessoides and genotyped by the mtDNA Cox2 gene. Almost all these juveniles (68) were molecularly identified as P. bulbosum. The mtDNA Cox2 gene was also used to reveal the haplotype diversity and the genetic structure of P. bulbosum. A comparison of the specimens examined in this study with each other and with the haplotypes previously identified by us in the White Sea showed that there were no significant differences between the groups from different hosts and from different catch areas.

AB  - This study aimed to evaluate the therapeutic effect of Terminalia chebula (TC) on Tibetan yak-origin Salmonella-induced diarrhea and dysentery in mice. The levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-1 beta, IL-6, IL-8, and TNF-alpha), anti-inflammatory cytokines (IL-4 and IL-10), and the oxidative stress markers malondialdehyde (MDA), superoxide dismutase (T-SOD), total antioxidant capacity (T-AOC), reduced glutathione (GSH-PX), and catalase (CAT) in the serum of mice were measured using ELISA kits. Using microbial diversity sequencing and non-targeted metabolomics detection techniques, the relevant mechanisms of TC treatment in a mouse Salmonella infection model were evaluated. The results showed the following: TC can effectively reduce the diarrhea rate; alleviate weight loss caused by Salmonella invasion; reduce the pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-1 beta, IL-6, IL-8, and TNF-alpha in serum; and increase the concentrations of the anti-inflammatory cytokines IL-4 and IL-10. TC can improve the body's antioxidant levels to heal the damage caused by oxidative stress and lipid peroxidation. The histological section results show that TC can significantly improve gastric and intestinal tissue lesions and has no toxic effects on the liver and kidneys. 16S rRNA and ITS sequencing analysis suggests that Lactobacillus, Enterorhabdus, Alistipes (bacterial community), Lodderomyces, Saccharomyces, and Penicillium (fungal community) may be key functional microbial communities in TC. Non-targeted metabolomics also suggests that the antibacterial treatment of dysentery with chebulic acid may be related to regulation of the Ras signaling pathway, long-term potentiation, the MAPK signaling pathway, metabolic pathways, and gut microbiome composition. Conclusion: TC has clear clinical efficacy in treating bacterial diarrhea, presenting anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects. Its roles in regulating the gut microbiome and metabolic pathways and products were determined as the main reason for its therapeutic effect in a mouse gastroenteritis model caused by Salmonella infection.

AB  - Certain plants exhibit rapid movement in response to mechanical stimulation; however, the ecological functions of this behaviour are largely unknown. Here, we show that the rapid flower closure of Drosera tokaiensis (Droseraceae) in response to mechanical stimulation functions as a physical defence against a specialist herbivore Buckleria paludum (Pterophoridae) caterpillar. Following feeding damage on fruits, flowers, flower stalks and buds by B. paludum, D. tokaiensis closed its flowers nine times faster than during natural circadian closure. The extent of damage to ovules was significantly reduced when the flowers were able to close compared with the condition in which closure was physically inhibited by the application of a resin. Nonetheless, flower closure had no effect on the feeding damage to stamens and styles and promoted further damage to petals. Given that feeding on petals, stamens and styles had no significant effect on the number of mature seeds, rapid flower closure leading to the protection of ovules had an overall positive effect on the reproductive success of D. tokaiensis. Our study showed rapid plant movement as a novel case of induced physical defence against herbivory.

AB  - Camellia oleifera is an important woody oil plant in southern China, and developing its industry can enhance forest resource uses and increase edible oil supply. This study investigated the floral characteristics of different C. oleifera varieties, analysed the species and diversity of flower-visiting insects in different habitats, identified the main pollinators and their flower-visiting behaviours, and explored the relationship between pollinating insects and their floral characteristics. The floral lifespan of individual C. oleifera flowers was 5-8 d across cultivars, which is essentially the same. However, floral traits and nectar sugar composition exhibited distinct differences. There were 22 species of insect pollinators from 14 genera and 8 families, including Hymenoptera and Diptera, in 3 habitats. High-potential pollinators varied by habitat, with Apis cerana and Phytomia zonata being the most frequent. A comparison showed that A. cerana was the best pollinator, whereas P. zonata had a larger population, was not affected by oil tea nectar poisoning, and could still pollinate. Therefore, the contribution of P. zonata cannot be overlooked. Redundancy analysis revealed the response relationship between the floral traits of C. oleifera and three insect population characteristics. Stamen length was the main floral trait affecting insect populations.

AB  - Trace metals in the environment are important pollutants affecting human health, particularly in urban areas worldwide. Phytoremediation as a nature-based solution (NBS) and environmentally friendly technology may decrease high concentrations of trace metals in urban soils, protecting public health (especially children) and contributing to urban sustainability. This study examined trace metal contamination of urban soils and trees in six cities in the Republic of Srpska (RS), Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) and investigated the potential of selected tree species for phytoremediation as a NBS for metal-polluted urban soils. Contamination of urban soils was assessed by quantifying the concentrations of 11 trace metals (B, Ba, Cd, Co, Cr, Cu, Mn, Mo, Ni, Pb, and Zn). To estimate phytoremediation potential of urban tree species, concentration and bioconcentration factor of the 11 metals were quantified in leaves of three common and abundant tree species: Aesculus hippocastanum L. (horse chestnut), Platanus acerifolia Willd. (plane), and Tilia sp. (lime). The results showed that trace metal concentrations in leaf samples did not exceed toxicity threshold guideline values. Further assessments are needed to establish the true potential of the three species as NBS for urban soils.

AB  - This case study sought to broaden the scope of inquiry into factors influencing human-wildlife coexistence beyond immediately tangible wildlife impacts and challenges with flagship wildlife species. Maasai pastoralists in Laikipia County, Kenya, were interviewed regarding challenges with wildlife, particularly perceptions of disease transmission from wildlife to domestic livestock. Responses revealed experiences with numerous diseases and multiple perceived associations between wildlife and livestock disease. Responses aligned with prior research that elephants severely compromise pastoralists' well-being, but concerns were overwhelmingly articulated as fear affecting daily activities rather than in more directly quantifiable terms. Findings did not indicate concerns with lions, despite their focus in scholarship and conservation initiatives. Responses indicated the need to view human-wildlife coexistence more broadly to include species beyond iconic wildlife, and to recognize that subjective concerns (e.g., fear, disease transmission to livestock) in addition to quantifiable events (e.g., human deaths, livestock predation) might affect attitudes toward wildlife conservation.

AB  - To address the underexplored use of black soldier fly larval (BSFL) meal in pig farming for sustainable development, this study examined the effects of substituting conventional protein with defatted BSFL meal in the pre-weaning diet of piglets farrowed from sows fed defatted BSFL diets (0%, 2.3%, and 4.6%). Fifty-four piglets (18 piglets in each treatment) were housed with sows until 28 days of age and fed a pre-weaning diet containing 0%, 12.5%, or 25% defatted BSFL meal based on their respective sows' dietary treatments (0%, 2.3%, and 4.6% defatted BSFL diets) from 21 to 35 days of age. The growth performances and fecal microbiota of piglets were investigated. The results showed that sow diets and defatted BSFL meal-incorporated pre-weaning diets did not have a significant effect on the growth performance of piglets (P > 0.05). However, piglet growth tended to decrease with increasing defatted BSFL meals in the pre-weaning diets. Additionally, piglets nursed by sows fed defatted BSFL diets showed higher fecal short-chain fatty acid and lower ammonia levels at 21 days of age than those nursed by sows fed a acids and modified the gut microbial metabolic pathways associated with stress response. These findings suggest that the appropriate inclusion of defatted BSFL meal in the diets of lactating sows and piglets did not adversely affect the growth performance of piglets and may potentially improve the health of piglets at weaning; however, attention should be paid to the chitin content in BSFL diets, which may affect nutrient digestibility. Incorporating 2.3% defatted BSFL to sow and 12.5% to pre-weaning piglet diets may serve as a feeding strategy in pig farming. The results obtained will aid the application of BSFL meal in the swine industry and the study of its dietary effect on weaning stress in piglets.

AB  - Simple Summary Pigs reared in tropical climate areas are frequently exposed to high ambient temperatures. The increase in ambient temperature above thermoneutrality evokes behavioral changes that alter the feeding pattern of pigs, triggering a reduction in performance. In addition, the light program may also modulate the feeding behavior of pigs. Thus, data collected using electronic feeders were used to generate information on pig feeding behavior to identify anomalies that occurred due to variations in ambient temperature (cyclic heat stress) and after turning the lights on and off (light events). Our results indicated that cyclic heat stress disrupts the feeding circadian rhythm in finishing pigs. Pigs prioritized the feed intake in the coolest hours of the day. However, nocturnal cooling did not allow the pigs to fully compensate for the feed intake depression caused by heat stress. Furthermore, the lighting program affected the feeding pattern, increasing or decreasing the meal size when the lights were switched on or off, respectively. Understanding pig feeding behavior during cyclic heat stress and light events could improve feeding strategies, productivity, and animal well-being. The impact of cyclic heat stress (CHS) and turning the lights on and off on pig feeding behavior (FB) was investigated. The FB of 90 gilts was recorded in real-time under two ambient temperatures (AT): thermoneutrality (TN, 22 degrees C) or CHS (22/35 degrees C). The day was divided into four periods: PI ((06-08 h)); PII ((08-18 h)); PIII ((18-20 h)); and PIV ((20-06 h)). Automatic and Intelligent Precision Feeders recorded each feed event for each pig. An estimated meal criterion (49 min) was used to calculate the FB variables. Feed behavior in both ATs followed a circadian pattern. The CHS reduced the feed intake by 6.9%. The pigs prioritized feed intake during the coolest hours of the day; however, nocturnal cooling did not allow the pigs to compensate for the reduced meal size due to CHS. The highest meal size and most of the meals were observed during the lighting-on period. The pigs reduced their interval between meals during PII and PIII. The lighting program increased the meal size when the lights were switched on and reduced the meal size when the lights were switched off. Thus, the dynamics of the FB were largely influenced by AT, whereas the meal size was affected by the lighting program.

AB  - Wildlife crossing structures are effective interventions for mitigating fragmentation of habitats by linear infrastructure. The 2017 construction of a new railway cutting through the Tsavo Conservation Area (TCA), home to the largest elephant population in Kenya, affected wildlife movement and habitat connectivity. Although numerous studies have investigated the use of wildlife crossing structures by a wide range of species, few have focused on their use by mega-herbivores. In this study, we examined use of 41 wildlife crossing structures by African savanna elephants (Loxodonta africana) along a 133 km section of new railway in Tsavo, Kenya. We used a generalized linear mixed modeling approach to assess the relationship between elephant crossing rate over 28 months between July 2017 to April 2021 and explanatory factors including crossing structure attributes, livestock presence and proximity to highways, water points and human settlement. We found that structural attributes of crossing structures were most strongly associated with the elephant crossing rate, particularly height and its interaction with type of crossing structure (bridges, wildlife underpasses and culverts). Higher crossing structures were associated with higher crossing rate, with the largest influence of height at culverts and wildlife underpasses. Although bridges comprised only 19.5 % of the 41 available crossing structures, they accounted for a disproportionately high number of elephants crossing events (56 %). The results demonstrated the importance of bridges over designated crossing structures for elephants, with predicted seasonal counts of elephant crossings being 0.31 for average sized culverts, 2.88 for wildlife underpasses and 5.86 for bridges. The environmental and anthropogenic variables were not strongly associated with elephant crossing rate. Our findings have direct application for future siting, and design of crossing structures across elephant ranges.

AB  - Acetylcholine (ACh), a potential plant growth regulator, can alleviate injury caused by NaCl and cadmium stress. However, the underlying mechanisms whereby it affects seed germination remain unclear. We pre-soaked maize (Zea mays L.) in different concentrations (1-3 & mu;m) of ACh. Seed germination and levels of & beta;-galactosidase, & alpha;-amylase, and starch were analyzed. ACh, abscisic acid (ABA), and gibberellic acid levels were estimated via enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The expression of ABA and gibberellic acid signaling-related genes was analyzed. Salt stress significantly reduced seed germination and hypocotyl elongation but increased ABA and H2O2 levels and enhanced antioxidant enzyme activity. Priming with 2 & mu;m ACh caused a significantly higher germination rate (by 13.4%) relative to that of the seeds subjected to salt stress alone. Under salt stress, ACh effectively upregulated & alpha;-amylase and & beta;-galactosidase activity (by 0.63- and 1.04-fold) and reduced starch content (by 34.02%). ACh treatment downregulated the expression of ZmNCED3 (involved in ABA signaling) and upregulated that of ZmKAO (involved in gibberellin signaling). The leaves of the seedlings pretreated with ACh presented higher antioxidant enzyme activity and, therefore, lower H2O2 accumulation than those of seedlings subjected to salt stress alone. Priming the maize seeds with exogenous ACh maintained seedling growth under salt stress. ACh pretreatment increased antioxidant activity, reduced ABA activity, and improved salt tolerance in maize seeds exposed to salt stress. These findings suggest that pretreatment with 2 & mu;m ACh improves seed germination, activates ROS scavenging, and regulates phytohormone levels under salt stress, thereby improving growth.

AB  - The illegal online trade in wildlife has increased significantly over the last 2 decades. Applying a systematic survey approach, we examined the online trade in elephant ivory before and after the implementation of a domestic trade ban in Singapore, to understand the forms of elephant ivory offered for sale, the e-commerce sites used and the effect of the domestic trade ban. Using elephant ivory and lookalikes in form, shape and colour as proxies for elephant ivory, we found that most of the online listings consisted of bird cages and related accessories such as bird feeding cups and ornaments used to adorn them. After the domestic trade ban in elephant ivory was implemented on 1 September 2021, a 76% drop in total listings was observed. Causal impact analysis indicated a strong causal effect of the domestic trade ban, resulting in an 83% drop in the mean number of new listings found weekly relative to the predicted counterfactual market response based on a Bayesian structural time-series model in the absence of the ban. E-commerce sites play an important role in combatting illegal wildlife trade online by removing flagged listings and sending notifications to raise awareness of the ban. We found textual descriptions of products to be more effective for preliminary differentiation of legal and potentially illegal listings compared to the detection of Schreger lines in images, although this remains a significant challenge for law enforcement. Our findings can inform future efforts to develop automated detection methods for elephant ivory in online markets.

For this reason, in the context of climatic and energy crises that have a decisive influence on the activity, it has been considered relevant to deepen the knowledge of the economic and energy profiles of the different goat production systems, filling an information gap that existed. For this purpose, twenty-one farms, representatives of the dairy goat system diversity in Andalusia, were monitored for one year, obtaining technical-economic information that allowed the calculation of different energy and economic indicators. The results of this work demonstrate that, from an energetic point of view, goat farms that base their feeding strategies on grazing and make optimal use of natural resources are more efficient than models based on permanent stabling. This greater environmental sustainability derived from extensification is penalized by the markets, which give priority to intensive models with greater milk production and less food autonomy. Nevertheless, this study demonstrates that extensification strategies are capable of remunerating family labor and can, therefore, be economically viable, provided that support from the Common Agricultural Policy is included in the analyses.Abstract The family-owned dairy goat sector in Andalusia presents great diversity. Taking into account the particularities of their economic strategies, which are focused on generating net value added and a stable long-term remuneration for family labor, this work aims to expand the scarce existing knowledge on the energetic and economic profiles of the different caprine management systems in a context of climate and energy crisis. For this purpose, twenty-one farms, representatives of the four typologies of the Andalusian dairy goat system, were monitored for one year: pastoral systems, grazing systems with high feed supply, indoor systems with associated crops, and indoor systems without associated crops. Technical-economic information was obtained that allowed the calculation of energy and economic indicators. In terms of socialized output, the differences found were due to the energy derived from milk sales, which was clearly lower in pastoral systems. The higher proportion of energy output obtained from manure with respect to edible products (milk and meat) highlights the importance of the former in energetic terms. High values for external inputs are found in the intensive group (111.22 GJ LSU-1), while the lowest results correspond to the pastoral group (36.96 GJ LSU-1). The main external input is the energy proceeding from purchased feed, which accounts for over 79% of the total external energy input in all four groups. The highest energy efficiency corresponds to the pastoral group, which is also the most efficient one in the use of non-renewable energy to produce milk and meat. Additionally, the level of eco-efficiency is higher in pastoral systems. Common Agricultural Policy funds contribute to increasing the remuneration of family work in pastoral systems, assimilating it to the rest of the systems. Therefore, intensification does not imply an absolute monetary advantage in all cases, while extensification can be remunerative for family-owned dairy farming.

AB  - While deep hypothermia is well known to lead to cardiac malfunction up to circulatory arrest, mild hypothermia can prevent hypoxic damage to the heart. Importantly, a large body of research on deep hypothermia was carried out on rats and mice whose myocardium is significantly different from the human. In the present work, we investigated the effect of deep hypothermia on rhythmoinotropic phenomena in the guinea pig (GP) whose myocardium is more alike the human. The force--frequency relationship (FFR), effect of post-rest potentiation, and frequency-dependent acceleration of relaxation (FDAR) were studied in GP right ventricular papillary muscles (PM) within a range of 0.1-3.0 Hz at temperatures of 30, 20 and 10 degrees C. It was shown that a positive FFR, mediated mainly by the inward Ca2+ current through the L-type Ca2+ channel, persists when cooling to 10 degrees C, suggesting that this mechanism retains its activity even under deep hypothermia. The effect of post-rest potentiation persists down to 20 degrees C, while further cooling replaces potentiation by depression. This may indicate that at 10 degrees C, the functioning of the sarcoplasmic reticulum is impaired, as manifested in the rest-induced inversion of the post-rest potentiation effect. The effect of frequency-dependent acceleration of the kinetics of muscular contraction also persists down to 20 degrees C, supporting the suggestion that this effect in the GP myocardium relies on the sarcoplasmic reticulum. Thus, we found that among the studied frequency-dependent effects, there are those affected by deep hypothermia (post-rest potentiation effect, FDAR) and those resistant to this exposure (FFR), which may reflect the differences in thermal sensitivity of the underlying mechanisms of Ca2 + transport.

AB  - Excess nitrogen (N) after animal slurry application is a persistent problem of intensive agriculture, with consequences such as environmental pollution by ammonia (NH3) and nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions and nitrate (NO3-) leaching. High-carbon organic soil amendments (HCAs) with a large C:N ratio have shown the potential of mitigating unintended N losses from soil. To reduce gaseous and leaching N losses after the application of slurry, a laboratory incubation study was conducted with silt loam soil. We tested the potential of three different types of HCA-wheat straw, sawdust, and leonardite (application rate 50 g C L-1 slurry for each of the three HCAs)-to mitigate N loss after amendment of soil with pig and cattle slurry using two common application modes (slurry and HCA mixed overnight with subsequent addition to soil vs. sequential addition) at an application rate equivalent to 80 kg N ha(-1). Compared to the control with only soil and slurry, the addition of leonardite reduced the NH3 emissions of both slurries by 32-64%. Leonardite also reduced the total N2O emissions by 33-58%. Wheat straw reduced N2O emissions by 40-46%, but had no effect on NH3 emission. (15) N labeling showed that the application of leonardite was associated with the highest N retention in soil (24% average slurry N recovery), followed by wheat straw (20% average slurry N recovery). The mitigation of N loss was also observed for sawdust, although the effect was less consistent compared with leonardite and wheat straw. Mixing the slurry and HCA overnight tended to reduce N losses, although the effect was not consistent across all treatments. In conclusion, leonardite improved soil N retention more effectively than wheat straw and sawdust.

AB  - Feeding ecology is an essential component of an organism's life, but foraging comes with risks and energetic costs. Species in which populations exhibit more than one feeding strategy, such as sea turtles, are good systems for investigating how feeding ecology impacts life-history traits, reproduction and carried over effects across generations. Here, we investigated how the feeding ecology of loggerhead sea turtles (Caretta caretta) nesting at the Cabo Verde archipelago correlates with reproductive outputs and offspring quality. We determined the feeding ecology of female turtles before and during the breeding season from stable isotope analysis of carbon and nitrogen and correlated isotopic ratio with female and offspring traits. We found that female turtles feeding at higher trophic positions produced larger clutches. We also found that females with higher delta 13C values, typical of productive foraging areas, had greater fat reserves, were less likely to be infected by leech parasites and produced heavier offspring. The offspring of infected mothers with higher delta 13C values performed best in crawling and self-righting trials than those of non-infected mothers with higher delta 13C values. This study shows adult female loggerheads that exploit productive areas build capital reserves that impact their reproductive success and multiple proxies for offspring quality. Overall, our findings provide valuable insights into the complex interplay between feeding ecology and reproductive success, and reveal the transgenerational carry-over effects of both feeding ecology and health on offspring quality in sea turtles.
   The feeding ecology of loggerhead sea turtles plays a crucial role in shaping their reproductive outcomes and offspring quality. Through stable isotope analysis, we observed that females feeding at higher trophic positions produced larger clutches. Those with less depleted delta 13C values, indicative of productive foraging areas, exhibited greater fat reserves, lower susceptibility to leech parasites and produced heavier offspring, suggesting that not all foraging habitats are equal and can significantly influence the fitness of sea turtle populations.image

AB  - Taenia hydatigena causes taeniasis in dogs and wild canids, with Cysticercus tenuicollis infecting small ruminants. Data on its incidence and risk factors in Pakistan are limited. This research work was carried out to determine the prevalence of C. tenuicollis in sheep and goats across Punjab and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KPK). A cross-sectional research study examined 9,273 randomly selected small ruminants from abattoirs in Faisalabad, Lahore, Multan, Bahawalpur, Sialkot, Rawalpindi, and Peshawar. Pre-slaughter and post-mortem investigations identified C. tenuicollis in 552 animals (5.95%). Punjab had a higher prevalence (6.84%) than KPK (3.35%). Faisalabad recorded the highest prevalence (8.14%) with a significant odds ratio of 2.43 (95% CI: 1.80-3.29). Males (6.20%) had a slightly higher infection rate than females (5.47%). Adults (8.08%) were more affected than young animals (4.08%). Irrigated plains (Lahore, Faisalabad, Multan) exhibited an 8.00% prevalence, significantly higher than wet mountainous areas like Peshawar, with an odds ratio of 2.39. These findings suggest C. tenuicollis is prevalent in both provinces with higher rate in Punjab, posing economic losses to the small ruminant industry. Factors such as region, sex, age, and climate influence infection rates. Molecular studies are needed to identify genetic variations and improve control strategies.

   The aim of the present study was to confirm that microbial additives producing antimicrobial substances and digestive enzymes increased the health of weaning pigs by improving blood metabolites and fecal microflora. Pediococcus acidilatic BBG-L1 and Lactobacillus plantarum SK3121 produced antimicrobial activity, while Bacillus subtilis SK877, B. subtilis BBG-B20, and Saccharomyces cerevisiae BBG-Y6 produced digestive-enzyme activity. The mixtures of these microbes were used as microbial additives and applied into weaning pigs for 21 d with different levels following 0, 0.5, 1.0, and 1.5% of the diet as fed. In the present study, dietary microbial additives had no effects on growth performance of weaning pigs, except for the feed efficiency. However, dietary microbial additives could improve the health status of weaning pigs. This could be seen in increasing immune response, glucose, and insulin in the blood, as well as reducing Salmonella and Escherichia coli in the fecal samples of the pigs. Furthermore, the supplementary microbial additive at 1.0% presented the highest improvement in blood metabolites. Therefore, the present study concluded that dietary microbial additives presented antifungal and digestive-enzyme activities that improved the health status of weaning pigs, and a supplementary level of 1.0% was recommended to improve feed efficiency, blood metabolites, and fecal microflora effectively.
   The present study investigated the effects of microbial additives producing antimicrobial and digestive-enzyme activities on the growth performance, blood metabolites, and fecal microflora of weaning pigs from 21 to 42 d of age. A total of 144 weaning pigs (1:1 ratio of gilt and boar; 21 d of age; 7.40 +/- 0.53 kg of average body weight) were randomly distributed into four supplementary levels of microbial additive (0 vs. 0.5 vs. 1.0 vs. 1.5% of fresh weight) with three pens of replication, consisting of 12 weaning pigs per pen. All weaning pigs were maintained with the same basal diet for 21 d. Blood and feces were subsampled at day 21. Feed efficiency tended to increase linearly (p = 0.069) with an increasing supplementation level. Insulin, insulin-like growth factor 1, and blood glucose presented a quadratic effect (p < 0.05) with an increasing supplementation level, and these blood metabolites were highest at the 1% supplementation level. Immunoglobulin G in blood increased linearly by (p < 0.05) increasing the supplementation level. Salmonella and Escherichia coli in feces were decreased linearly by (p < 0.05) increasing the supplementation level. In conclusion, supplementation of microbial additive at 1.0% improved the feed efficiency, blood metabolites, and fecal microflora of weaning pigs.

AB  - Marine shrimps of the genus Thor Kingsley, 1878 are distributed in the eastern and western Atlantic, eastern Pacific, and Indo-West Pacific. Thor manningi Chace, 1972 was originally described from Antigua and since then has been recorded from other Atlantic localities, including the Caribbean Sea, Bermuda, USA, Brazil, and Ascension Island. Specimens previously identified as T. manningi from Panama and Brazil were analyzed using a combination of morphological and molecular approaches. The analyses yielded a new species from the Atlantic coast of Panama, herein described as Thor paulae sp. nov. Moreover, we provide additional morphological observations on T. manningi, mainly regarding mouthparts and pereopods. The new species is morphologically similar to the Pacific Thor cocoensis Wicksten and Vargas, 2001 and Thor marguitae Bruce, 1978. However, it can be separated from them by the carpus of the second pereopod, rostral dorsal dentition, and chela of the first pereopod, respectively. The two species studied here can be easily distinguished by the supraorbital prominence in T. manningi (versus absent in the new species), and the pterygostomial margin rounded and unarmed in T. manningi (versus angular, with tooth in the new species). Thor manningi is morphologically closer to the western Atlantic Thor dobkini Chace, 1972 and Thor floridanus Kingsley, 1878, but can be separated from both by the merus of the first pereopod (T. dobkini) and dactylus of fourth and fifth pereopods (T. floridanus, but with the possibility of overlap). We provide a comparative table with morphological characters of all 17 valid species of Thor, as well as a worldwide identification key to the genus.

AB  - Single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) of the exon III at CSN1S1 gene encoding alpha S1-casein (alpha S1-CN) was investigated by means of the PCR-RFLP analysis in two sheep breeds - Bulgarian Daily Synthetic Population (BDSP, n = 89) and Pleven Blackhead sheep (PLBH, n = 38) with an aim to establish the possible effect of a particular genotype on the casein content and distribution of milk fractions. The homozygous CC genotype was observed in 63.2% of the studied ewes, while the homozygous AA genotype was established in 4.5 % of the individuals. The calculated mean values of observed (Ho = 0.323) and expected (He = 0.321) heterozygosity at CSN1S1 locus indicated a moderate degree of genetic variability in the examined sheep populations. The estimated negative values of the coefficient (Fis = -0.001 / -0.006) showed a low level of inbreeding. The results of the associative analysis indicated that CSN1S1 genotypes were significantly associated with the milk alpha S1-CN in the BDSP 2 population (P < 0.05). The highest casein percentage in this population (35.24 +/- 3.96) was associated with ewes carrying the heterozygous AC genotype. No significant differences (P > 0.05) were established for CSN1S1 genotypes in terms of casein content in the studied PLBH sheep population.

AB  - The Booroola fecundity (FecB) gene is a major fertility-related gene first identified in Booroola sheep. Numerous studies have investigated whether the FecB gene is a major fecundity gene in goats or whether there are other genes that play a critical role in goat fertility. Nevertheless, little attention has been paid to the role of the FecB gene in the body morphometric traits of goats, despite the positive relationship discerned between litter size and growth. We identified five copy number variations (CNVs) within the FecB gene in 641 goats, including 318 Shaanbei white cashmere (SBWC) goats, 203 Guizhou Heima (GZHM) goats, and 120 Nubian goats, which exhibited different distributions among these populations. Our results revealed that these five CNVs were significantly associated with goat morphometric traits (p < 0.05). The normal type of CNV3 was the dominant type and displayed superior phenotypes in both litter size and morphometric traits, making it an effective marker for goat breeding. Consequently, LD blocks in the region of 10 Mb upstream and downstream from FecB and potential transcription factors (TFs) that could bind with the CNVs were analyzed via bioinformatics. Although no significant LD block was detected, our results illustrated that these CNVs could bind to growth-related TFs and indirectly affect the growth development of the goats. We identified potential markers to promote litter size and growth, and we offer a theoretical foundation for further breeding work.

AB  - Many flowers are fed on by florivores, but we know little about if and how feeding on flowers affects their visual and chemical advertisement and nectar resource, which could disrupt pollination. Here, we investigated if damages caused by florivores compromise a Neotropical hummingbird pollination system, by modifying the floral advertisements and the nectar resource. We surveyed natural florivory levels and patterns, examined short-term local effects of floral damages caused by the most common florivore, a caterpillar, on floral outline, intra-floral colour pattern and floral scent, as well as on the amount of nectar. Following, we experimentally tested if the most severe florivory pattern affected hummingbird pollination. The feeding activity of the most common florivore did not alter the intra-floral colour pattern, floral scent, and nectar volume, but changed the corolla outline. However, this change did not affect hummingbird pollination. Despite visual floral cues being important for foraging in hummingbirds, our results emphasise that changes in the corolla outline had a neutral effect on pollination, allowing the maintenance of florivore-plant-pollinator systems without detriment to any partner.

AB  - The present paper represents the first description of abnormal hermaphroditism in Galeus melastomus (Rafinesque, 1810). The black mouth cat shark specimen, collected in summer from southern Tyrrhenian Sea at the entrance of Salerno gulf, showed a basic intersexuality characterized by the presence of male secondary and female primary sexual characters. The reproductive system has been described with an accurate morphological analysis, also including a histological assessment of oocytes. Results showed the presence of only right clasper, not exceeding the pelvic fin in length, with the absence of internal males' sexual organs. Concerning the female primary characters, the analysis of histological assessment showed the structure of mature oocyte, confirming the maturity stage of a mature female in active extruding stage, as highlighted by the macroscopic morphological analysis. Despite in many marine organisms' hermaphroditism is a physiological condition showed by specimens during their lifecycle, in Elasmobranchs this is considered an abnormal condition, with some exceptions. The lack of information on hermaphroditism in elasmobranchs form the Mediterranean Sea requires an increase of scientific community's attention, improving the knowledge on the reproductive biology of this sensitive taxon. This is essential to enhance the conservation of elasmobranchs populations in the entire Mediterranean basin.

AB  - Objectives: To improve the recognition accuracy of radar signals under a low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). Technology or Method: We propose a novel radar signal recognition method based on a dual-channel model with the histogram of oriented gradients (HOG) feature extraction. Specifically, multisynchrosqueezing transform (MSST) and Choi-Williams distribution (CWD) transform are adopted individually to obtain the time-frequency distribution images of radar signals, and HOG feature extraction is performed on the preprocessed time-frequency images of each channel, respectively. Then, the features of the two channels are fused and dimensionally reduced by the principal component analysis (PCA). Finally, the compact feature parameters are fed to the support vector machine (SVM) classifier to identify radar signals. Clinical or Biological Impact: The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed model achieves a high recognition performance with a small computational complexity, especially in low SNR. When the SNR is -12 dB, the recognition accuracy can reach more than 92%, which is over 6% higher than that of single-channel models and related convolutional neural network-based models.

AB  - The effect of insect biological control agents on invasive plant populations can vary spatially, and spatial vari-ation in climate may drive regional variation in herbivory, and thus biocontrol efficacy. Within host plant populations, local plant abundance can also be affected by the spatial distribution of herbivores, but whether local patterns persist at larger scales is less well understood. We examined how infestation and damage of the stem-mining weevil Mecinus janthiniformis, a specialist biocontrol agent of the invasive plant Linaria dalmatica, varied within and among populations across the northern edge of the range in North America. We quantified weevil and invasive plant densities, as well as plant fecundity, stem diameter and height across sites spanning an area of similar to 39,000 km(2) in British Columbia, Canada. We found that specialist weevils did not respond to host plant density within sites across the study region. Instead, weevil attack and load were most sensitive to among-site variability in climate, with stems at warmer sites having four times as many weevils compared to stems at cooler sites. Weevils also reduced plant fecundity more at warmer sites, when controlled for plant size (stem diameter) with larger effects of weevils in thicker stems, indicating that L. dalmatica suppression is highest in warmer locations where weevils are more abundant and environmental conditions more favorable. Our results suggest that, with climate change, the efficacy of biocontrol for L. dalmatica will improve across the northern edge of the range. We recommend that at cooler sites, where biocontrols are less prevalent and effects on plant fecundity are weaker, alternative management strategies are necessary at this time. Across invasive plant species more generally, future studies that establish the role of climate in variability in biocontrol efficacy long after introduction can improve management of invasive plants under climate change.

AB  - Natural variation in trichome pattern (amount and distribution) is prominent among populations of many angiosperms. However, the degree of parallelism in the genetic mechanisms underlying this diversity and its environmental drivers in different species remain unclear. To address these questions, we analyzed the genomic and environmental bases of leaf trichome pattern diversity in Cardamine hirsuta, a relative of Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana). We characterized 123 wild accessions for their genomic diversity, leaf trichome patterns at different temperatures, and environmental adjustments. Nucleotide diversities and biogeographical distribution models identified two major genetic lineages with distinct demographic and adaptive histories. Additionally, C. hirsuta showed substantial variation in trichome pattern and plasticity to temperature. Trichome amount in C. hirsuta correlated positively with spring precipitation but negatively with temperature, which is opposite to climatic patterns in A. thaliana. Contrastingly, genetic analysis of C. hirsuta glabrous accessions indicated that, like for A. thaliana, glabrousness is caused by null mutations in ChGLABRA1 (ChGL1). Phenotypic genome-wide association studies (GWAS) further identified a ChGL1 haplogroup associated with low trichome density and ChGL1 expression. Therefore, a ChGL1 series of null and partial loss-of-function alleles accounts for the parallel evolution of leaf trichome pattern in C. hirsuta and A. thaliana. Finally, GWAS also detected other candidate genes (e.g. ChETC3, ChCLE17) that might affect trichome pattern. Accordingly, the evolution of this trait in C. hirsuta and A. thaliana shows partially conserved genetic mechanisms but is likely involved in adaptation to different environments.
   Genomic and environmental approaches show that different environmental drivers led to similar genetic mechanisms accounting for the evolution of trichome pattern in Cardamine and Arabidopsis.

AB  - One of the most conspicuous marks of the Anthropocene worldwide is the ubiquitous pollution by long lifespan materials (e.g., plastic). In marine habitats, anthropogenic debris are observed from floating on the surface to deposited on the substrate or ingested by wildlife at different food web levels. However, the link between feeding strategy types and debris ingestion by reef fishes remains poorly explored. We analyzed the gut contents of three nominally herbivorous fishes along the Brazilian coast: the doctorfish Acanthurus chirurgus, the parrotfish, Sparisoma axillare, and the chub Kyphosus vaigiensis. Individual [i.e., total length (TL)] and species-level functional traits, as well sites with distinct environmental features (i.e., tourism activity intensity, fishing pressure, and distance from the coast), were tested as predictors of the concentration of debris found inside individual fish guts. Debris found were quantified, measured, and classified accordingly to color and shape. We found debris in 52.7% of individuals. Debris ranged from 0.10 to 11.75 mm, and the frequency of occurrence and ingestion rate (number of debris per individual) varied among species, being higher for the scraper species S. axillare (95.7% and 4.9 +/- 1.2, respectively) and A. chirurgus (74.6% and 1.64 +/- 0.34), than for the browser K. vaigiensis (55.8% and 0.83 +/- 0.24). TL, scraping feeding mode, and the most impacted location were positively related to debris ingestion rate. Our work revealed a higher vulnerability of an ecologically important trophic group to debris ingestion and of an already threatened species according to Brazilian red list. Besides the increasing number of species contaminated by anthropogenic debris, its effect on fish biology and physiology remains poorly understood.

AB  - The resorption of nutrients from senescent leaves allows plants to conserve and recycle nutrients. To explore the adaptation strategies of desert plants to nutrient-limited environments, we selected four typical desert plants (Populus euphratica Oliv., Tamarix ramosissima Ledeb., Glycyrrhiza inflata Batal., and Alhagi camelorum Fisch.) growing in the desert area of the northern margin of the Tarim Basin, China. The contents of nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), potassium (K), calcium (Ca), magnesium (Mg), and Ferrum (Fe) in the leaves of these four typical desert plants and their resorption characteristics were analyzed. The relationship of nutrient resorption efficiency with leaf functional traits and soil physical-chemical properties in two different habitats (saline-alkali land and sandy land) was discussed. The results showed that the four plants resorbed most of the elements. Ca was enriched in the leaves of P. euphratica, G. inflate, and A. camelorum; Mg was enriched in the leaves of G. inflata; and Fe was enriched in the leaves of the four plants. The results of the redundancy analysis showed that leaf thickness, soil electrical conductivity, and soil P content were the major factors affecting the nutrient resorption efficiency of the four plants. Leaf thickness was negatively correlated with N resorption efficiency (NRE), P resorption efficiency, and Fe resorption efficiency; soil electrical conductivity was positively correlated with the resorption efficiency of most elements; and soil P content was negatively correlated with the resorption efficiency of most elements in the plant leaves. The results showed that soil physical-chemical properties and soil nutrient contents had an important impact on the nutrient resorption of plant leaves. The same species growing in different habitats also differed in their resorption of different elements. The soil environment of plants and the biological characteristics of plant leaves affected the resorption of nutrient elements in different plants. The purpose of this study is to provide small-scale data support for the protection of ecosystems in nutrient-deficient areas by studying leaf functional strategies and nutrient conservation mechanisms of several typical desert plants.

AB  - Co-composting is an efficient strategy for collaborative disposal of multiple organic wastes in rural areas. In this study, we explored the co-composting of rural sewage sludge and other organic solid wastes (corn stalks and kitchen waste), with a focus on the variation of total petroleum hydrocarbons (TPH) during this process. 12% corn-derived biochar was applied in the composting (BC), with no additives applied as the control treatment (CK). The TPH contents of piles after composting ranged from 0.70 to 0.74 mg/g, with overall removal effi-ciencies of 35.6% and 61.1% for CK and BC, respectively. The results indicate that the addition of 12% biochar increased the rate of TPH degradation and accelerated the degradation process. 16s rDNA high-throughput sequencing was applied to investigate the biodiversity and bacterial community succession during the com-posting process. Diverse bacterial communities with TPH degradation functions were observed in the composting process, including Acinetobacter, Flavobacterium, Paenibacillus, Pseudomonas, and Bacillus spp. These functional bacteria synergistically degraded TPH, with cooperative behavior dominating during composting. Biochar amendment enhanced the microbial activity and effectively promoted the biodegradation of TPH. The physi-cochemical properties of the compost piles, including environmental factors (pH and temperature), nutrients (nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium), and humic substances produced in composting (humic acids and fulvic acids), directly and indirectly affected the variation in TPH contents. In conclusion, this work illustrates the variation in TPH content and associated influencing factors during co-composting of rural organic solid wastes, providing valuable guidance toward the further optimization of rural organic waste management.

AB  - Analyzing functional connectivity in fragmented landscapes is essential for maintaining biodiversity; however, such studies in Costa Rica are limited. To address this need, the present research was developed to assess functional connectivity across different land uses within the Reserva Conchal, part of the Baulas-Conchal Coastal Marine Biological Corridor (CBC-BC). The land cover and land use layer from SINAC 2023 was validated, achieving an accuracy of 98.53% and a Kappa index of 0.97. The selected target species were the mantled howler monkey (Alouatta palliata) and the white-tailed deer ( Odocoileus virginianus), chosen based on their biological traits to encompass a range of dispersal capacities. Functional connectivity was modeled using spatial graph techniques with the "Graphab" software and habitat suitability index (HSI) analysis with "MaxEnt" in "R". The global scale metrics indicated a higher probability of connection for O. virginianus (PC = 0.066) compared to A. palliata (PC = 0.0058), suggesting that the white-tailed deer is better adapted to diverse land uses, while the howler monkey exhibited more fragmented habitat patches and a high dependency on specific corridors. Local scale metrics identified key patches and links to improve connectivity for both species. It was concluded that functional connectivity could be improved through restoration and conservation efforts in priority areas, highlighting the need to integrate such methodologies into decision-making strategies for landscape management in the country

AB  - Chronic wasting disease (CWD) is a contagious prion disease that affects cervids in North America, Northern Europe, and South Korea. CWD is spread through direct and indirect horizontal transmission, with both clinical and preclinical animals shedding CWD prions in saliva, urine, and feces. CWD particles can persist in the environment for years, and soils may pose a risk for transmission to susceptible animals. Our study presents a sensitive method for detecting prions in the environmental samples of prairie soils. Soils were collected from CWD-endemic regions with high (Saskatchewan, Canada) and low (North Dakota, USA) CWD prevalence. Heat extraction with SDS-buffer, a serial protein misfolding cyclic amplification assay coupled with a real-time quaking-induced conversion assay was used to detect the presence of CWD prions in soils. In the prairie area of South Saskatchewan where the CWD prevalence rate in male mule deer is greater than 70%, 75% of the soil samples tested were positive, while in the low-prevalence prairie region of North Dakota (11% prevalence in male mule deer), none of the soils contained prion seeding activity. Soil-bound CWD prion detection has the potential to improve our understanding of the environmental spread of CWD, benefiting both surveillance and mitigation approaches.

AB  - Livestock farming has been traditionally assessed by its economic figures, whereas the impact caused by their production models on the environment and on society have been largely disregarded. This paper analyses various organic cattle farming systems from the point of view of their technical-economic management, but also on the environmental impact caused by their greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Within this context, 34 organic meat cattle dehesa farms located in the southwest of Spain were studied. On the one hand, a principal component analysis devised four factors that explained the technical-economic management model of these farms in terms of their level of dependence on subsidies, production intensification, feeding practices and productivity. The farms were then divided into three clusters whose main differences came from the size of the farms, the intensification level and the joint rearing of cattle with other livestock species. On the other hand, GHG emissions and carbon sequestration levels for each of these clusters were calculated using the life cycle assessment methodology. The average GHG net emissions from the farms were 461.98 kg of CO(2)eq per ha (or 8.86 kg of CO2 eq per kg of live weight of sold animal), with the largest and more extensive farms reporting 262.05 kg of CO2 eq per ha (or 6.02 kg of CO2 eq per kg of live weight of sold animal) and the smallest and more intensive farms resulting in as much as 697.49 kg of CO2 eq per ha (or 11.18 kg of CO2 eq per kg of live weight of sold animal). One of the most significant aspects of the study was the carbon sequestration capacity of dehesa extensive farms, which allowed these livestock systems to be in line with the preservation of the natural resources, animal welfare and the provision of ecosystem services.

AB  - Finding food is a key motivator of animal behavior and underpins an increasing number of conservation and wildlife management challenges. Introduced predators threaten many vulnerable native species, and some native predators are problematic for declining prey species. Likewise, browsing by native and introduced herbivores threatens endangered plant species, undermines habitat restoration efforts, and alters plant communities. Mammalian predators and herbivores use olfactory information to forage efficiently, pursuing cues that are useful and ignoring those that are not. Here, we present the theoretical basis for why olfactory misinformation should alter foraging decisions and provide compelling evidence that supports the theory. Drawing on this theory and evidence of the success of olfactory misinformation where it has been applied to date, we propose that there is enormous scope for its application more broadly in conservation and wildlife management. Such an approach offers a robust behavioral alternative for protecting valued plants and prey species that are otherwise vulnerable to foraging mammals.

AB  - The application of organic fertilizers (OF) can supply carbon (C) to the soil in crop fields. OF-derived C (OF-C) is often estimated using the differential method that can be biased due to indirect effects of OF on soil C. This study tested three methods to quantify OF-C: (i) the widespread differential method, (ii) the synchronic isotope method comparing plots with and without OF and (iii) the asynchronic isotope method mimicking a trial without a control plot. These methods were implemented on an Arenosol and an Andosol supplied during 13 years with slurry or compost. The results highlighted the relevance of using the synchronic isotope method, which focuses on the direct effect of OFs on the soil organic matter (without bias of vegetation change) and considers control soil's evolution. The higher the isotopic difference between soil and OF, the shorter the method implementation time needed: for an initial difference of 7.5 parts per thousand and 3.5 parts per thousand, quantification is suitable after 4 and 9 years of fertilization respectively. Attention should be paid to OF-delta C-13 variability to guarantee the method validity. The method proved to be suitable to study the factors controlling the OF-C fate in tropical soils.

AB  - Prairie restorations typically differ from remnant prairies in forb composition; long-lived, late-successional plants are often missing. To study establishment of such species, we set up a field experiment where seeds of the threatened, long-lived Asclepias meadii were sown individually into the field with initial fire and soil disturbance treatments. We returned each year for 11 years to record the presence/absence, size, and reproduction of each plant. Individual plants were sometimes observed 1 year, not observed a subsequent year, and then observed again. We therefore analyzed survival data with mark-recapture models and found that the probability of a seed germinating and the resulting plant surviving for 11 years was 0.057 (5.7%). Probability of detection was approximately 0.80, suggesting that we did not observe all living plants. Vegetative dormancy, herbivory on above-ground parts, and observer error could all be responsible. We found no relationship between plant survival and the initial burn/disturbance treatment or previous year precipitation. Plants that were observed in the last study year were individuals that had, on average, greater size in earlier years. Three plants produced flowers and two produced fruit; we believe such reproductive success has not been previously documented for seed of A. meadii sowed into a restoration site. Our restoration study dovetails with the more typical plant community restoration research. In such studies, seeds of many species are sown, but often the late successional species do not establish. We show the value of detailed multiyear monitoring to determine the fate of such plant introductions.

AB  - Wetlands worldwide are under threat from anthropogenic impacts. In large protected North American areas such as Yellowstone and Wood Buffalo National Parks, aquatic habitats are disappearing and wetland-dependent fauna are in decline(1-3). Here we investigate population dynamics of an indicator species in Canada's Peace-Athabasca Delta ("the delta"), a World Heritage Site. Based on population surveys, habitat mapping and genetic data from 288 muskrats, we use agent-based modeling and genetic analyses to explain population expansion and decline of the semi-aquatic muskrat (Ondatra zibethicus). Simulations quantify a large population (similar to 500,000 individuals) following flood-induced habitat gains, with decreased size (similar to 10,000 individuals) during drying. Genetic analyses show extremely low long-term effective population size (N-e: 60-127), supporting a legacy of population bottlenecks. Our simulations indicate that the muskrat population in the delta is a metapopulation with individuals migrating preferentially along riparian pathways. Related individuals found over 40km apart imply dispersal distances far greater than their typical home range (130m). Rapid metapopulation recovery is achieved via riparian corridor migration and passive flood-transport of individuals. Source-sink dynamics show wetland loss impacts on the muskrat metapopulation's spatial extent. Dramatic landscape change is underway, devastating local fauna, including this generalist species even in a protected ecosystem. Ward et al. investigate population dynamics of a wetland indicator species, the semi-aquatic muskrat, within the large and protected area of the Peace-Athabasca Delta in Canada. The authors found indications of rapid population increases associated with flood events, genetic signatures of population bottlenecks, long range dispersal dynamics, and declines in the spatial extent of the muskrat population indicative of the impacts of wetland loss even within a protected ecosystem.

AB  - Free ferulic acid (FA) is a natural compound with antioxidant properties which mitigates the negative effects of cold stress in sheep; however, its impact on thermoregulatory responses in heat-stressed sheep has not been defined. The objective was to evaluate the effects of FA supplementation on physiological responses, serum analyte concentrations, and the hematological profile of heat-stressed hair ewe lambs. Twenty-two DorperxKatahdin ewe lambs (initial body weight = 23.5 +/- 2.8 kg and age =4 months) were housed in individual pens for 40 days and assigned under a randomized complete block design to the following treatments (n= 11): basal diet with 0 (control) or 250 mg of FA/kg of feed. The FA x sampling day interaction only affected serum concentration of some metabolic hormones; particularly on day 20 of the trial, FA increased (P < 0.01) insulins and the insulin to glucose ratio while decreased (P = 0.05) thyroxine. Overall, supplemental FA did not affect rectal temperature, respiratory rate, most body surface temperatures, feedlot performance, and serum concentrations of metabolites, electrolytes, triiodothyronine, and cortisol. In addition, FA only tended to decrease (P= 0.09) erythrocyte count and plaquetocrit and to increase (P = 0.08) mean corpuscular volume. In conclusion, FA supplementation did not improve the growth nor thermoregulatory capacity of heat-stressed hair ewe lambs. Still, it partially modulated the metabolism to reinforce some energetic adaptive mechanisms when the ambient temperature was >= 35 degrees C.

AB  - Chronic wasting disease (CWD) is a fatal transmissible spongiform encephalopathy that affects both free-ranging and farmed cervid species, including mule deer, white-tailed deer, and elk (Odocoileus hemionus, Odocoileus virginianus, and Cervus canadensis). Due to the long incubation period and variability of clinical signs, CWD can expand and spread to new areas before they reach diagnostically detectable levels. Antemortem testing methods currently available can be difficult to obtain and to be applied to the large numbers required for adequate surveillance. However, key volatile biomarkers could be harnessed for non-invasive antemortem surveillance. Detection dogs are the most effective tool currently available for volatile detection; dogs can effectively complete wildlife surveys at rates surpassing that of humans. This study is the first to demonstrate that trained detection dogs can be used as an antemortem test for CWD. First, we trained three dogs to differentiate between CWD-positive and CWD-negative white-tailed deer faeces in a laboratory setting. Dogs spent significantly more time at the positive sample than the negative samples, suggesting that they differentiated between the positive and negative volatile signatures. We then trained the same dogs to search for CWD-positive faecal samples in a more naturalistic field setting. In the field, dogs found 8/11 CWD-positive samples and had an average false detection rate of 13%. These results suggest that dogs can be trained to differentiate CWD-positive faeces from CWD-negative faeces in both laboratory and field settings. Future studies will compare canine accuracy to other antemortem methods, as well as improved canine training methods.

AB  - The processes involved in the life cycling of the brown alga Saccharina japonica were investigated through laboratory culturing experiments. We observed that meiospores were released relatively early from the ripe sorus on the sporophyte. Following the release of free meiospores, there was a partial detachment of the sorus, leading to the release of other reproductive cells. When a small piece of exfoliated sorus tissue was cultured separately, the appearance of gametophytes and then sporophytes occurred later for the free meiospores. These observations suggest that at least two processes are involved in the production of new sporophytes. This phenomenon appears to be an active and regulated reproductive strategy, as these processes were stimulated by the abscisic acid hormone. Additionally, we examined the effects of grazing by sea urchins on the dissemination of reproductive cells. Undigested sorus tissue segments containing sporangia and paraphyses were observed in the digestive tracts, as well as in the faeces released by sea urchins. From these undigested sorus tissue segments, were observed the development of gametophytes and then sporophytes when the faeces were cultured independently. These findings show that herbivores play a role in the dissemination of brown algae reproductive cells and provide evidence for the sustained protective function of sorus tissues, even after detachment from the mother plants and exposure to sea urchin feeding. We discuss the potential importance of these reproductive processes in the persistence and diversity of kelp populations.

AB  - The human dimensions of wildlife (HDW) program at Cornell University has contributed to the development of the HDW field for approximately 50 years. In this essay, faculty and staff of the Cornell Center for Conservation Social Sciences (formerly known as Human Dimensions Research Unit) reflect on how their HDW work has evolved, primarily describing their experience in terms of two trends: broadening perspectives about who are stakeholders requiring attention in wildlife management and greater stakeholder involvement in decision-making. The authors conclude that HDW science and practice is securely embedded in wildlife management, but to sustain that position it should address certain challenges (resistance to change, dynamics of human-wildlife coexistence, environmental justice, methodological malaise, communication technology) and seize important opportunities (social-ecological systems perspective, public trust thinking and good governance).

AB  - We derive recent surface mass balance (SMB) estimates from airborne radar observations along the iSTAR traverse (2013, 2014) at Pine Island Glacier (PIG), West Antarctica. Ground-based neutron probe measurements provide information of snow and firn density with depth at 22 locations and were used to date internal annual reflection layers. The 2005 layer was traced for a total distance of 2367 km to determine annual mean SMB for the period 2005-2014. Using complementary SMB estimates from two regional climate models, RACMO2.3p2 and MAR, and a geostatistical kriging scheme, we determine a regional-scale SMB distribution with similar main characteristics to that determined for the period 1985-2009 in previous studies. Local departures exist for the northern PIG slopes, where the orographic precipitation shadow effect appears to be more pronounced in our observations, and the southward interior, where the SMB gradient is more pronounced in previous studies. We derive total mass inputs of 79.9 +/- 19.2 and 82.1 +/- 19.2 Gtyr(-1) to the PIG basin based on complementary ASIRAS-RACMO and ASIRAS-MAR SMB estimates, respectively. These are not significantly different to the value of 78.3 +/- 6.8 Gtyr(-1) for the period 1985-2009. Thus, there is no evidence of a secular trend at decadal scales in total mass input to the PIG basin. We note, however, that our estimated uncertainty is more than twice the uncertainty for the 1985-2009 estimate on total mass input. Our error analysis indicates that uncertainty estimates on total mass input are highly sensitive to the selected krige methodology and assumptions made on the interpolation error, which we identify as the main cause for the increased uncertainty range compared to the 1985-2009 estimates.

AB  - Reconstructing Pleistocene glaciation timing and extent is vital for understanding paleoclimate. Whereas late Pleistocene glaciation has been studied extensively in western North American mountain ranges, the glacial history of the western Elk Range in Colorado remains understudied, particularly in the East River watershed, a site of intense scientific focus. Here we use cosmogenic nuclide exposure and depth-profile dating methods to determine the timing of glaciation in the East River watershed. We use glacier modeling to reconstruct paleoglacier extents and quantify past climate conditions. Our findings indicate that the East River glacier retreated from its maximum position approximately 17-18 ka, moving to recessional positions between 13 and 15 ka, before experiencing more substantial retreat to high-elevation cirques around 13 ka. Glacier modeling suggests that the maximum ice extents at 17-18 ka could have been sustained by temperature depressions of approximately -6.5 degrees C compared to modern conditions, assuming consistent precipitation. Additionally, the ice position at 13-15 ka could have been supported by temperature depressions of around -4.0 degrees C. These results offer insights into the deglaciation timeline in the East River watershed and broader western Elk Range as well as paleoclimate conditions during the late Pleistocene, which may aid future research on critical zone evolution in the East River watershed.

AB  - Capybaras (Hydrochoerus hydrochaeris), the largest rodents in the world, are prolific and live in structured social groups. These characteristics, combined with their role as hosts for the bacterium Rickettsia rickettsii, make them key targets in reproductive management strategies, particularly in endemic areas of Brazilian Spotted Fever (BSF). This study evaluated 140 female capybaras subjected to surgical sterilization during management campaigns. Findings include the identification of inclusion cysts in the uterine serosa, observed in 100 % of pluriparous individuals and absent in nulliparous ones. The cysts displayed histological characteristics consistent with reports in other species, consisting of a layer of cuboidal cells and an amorphous eosinophilic material. Hypotheses for their formation include lymphatic alterations, impaired venous return, and postpartum uterine contractions. The presence of cysts in the placenta and umbilical cord is unprecedented, suggesting a potential association with hormonal factors. Although benign, these cysts warrant attention to avoid misdiagnoses. It is concluded that multiparity is a determining factor in the formation of cysts in capybaras, while healthy nulliparous individuals did not present such alterations. The absence of studies on cysts in capybaras underscores the imperative need to continue investigations to refine population management and better 29 understand the clinical impacts of these findings.

AB  - The aim of this study was to combine Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) with a Key Performance Indicator (KPI) assessment focusing on biodiversity in order to examine the environmental impacts of different pig farm types (13 breeding, 23 finishing and 27 breeding-to-finishing farms) in seven European countries. In addition, the relationship between environmental impacts and selected farm management characteristics was explored. Fossil energy depletion (FED), global warming (GWP), acidification (AP) as well as marine (MEP) and fresh water (FEP) eutrophication potential were assessed by an attributional LCA and expressed per kilogram body mass net sold (BMNS). In addition, the potential biodiversity performance of all crop-livestock farms within the sample (n = 56) was evaluated with a KPI assessment of biodiversity-related field management characteristics. We found no relationship between LCA results and biodiversity scores (KPI). LCA and biodiversity performance varied more within than across farm types (breeding, finishing, breeding-to-finishing). For example, the GWP expressed per kg BMNS of the breeding unit of breeding-to-finishing farms was on average (median) 2.77 (range: 1.40-4.78) and of breeding farms 2.57 (range: 1.91-3.23) kg CO2-eq. The average (median) biodiversity theme score for breeding farms was 51% (range: 36-70%), for breeding-to-finishing farms 38% (range: 30-68%) and for finishing farms 43% (range: 28-67%). Several farm management characteristics (e.g., FCR, productivity, proportion of solid manure) correlated with all/some LCA results. Biodiversity performance depended especially on KPIs related to ecological focus areas, fertiliser management and GMO crops. The large range regarding environmental performance in both LCA and KPI assessment across farm types indicates that farm-specific improvement measures should be implemented to enhance overall environmental sustainability on farm. In conclusion, combining LCA with KPI assessment provides a more comprehensive environmental impact assessment of pig farms.</p>

AB  - A feeding factorial experiment was conducted, in which Artemia was enriched with two organic selenium (Se) concentrations (0, 12 mg/L) and three highly unsaturated fatty acids (HUFA) levels (0, 0.3 and 0.6 g/L) to produce six dietary treatments, labelled as H0, H03, H06, H0S; H03S and H06S. The diets were fed to barramundi larvae (11 day after hatching) for 15 days to investigate the combined effects of selenium and HUFA on growth performance, fatty acid composition, skeletal deformities and stress resistance of the larvae. The results showed that enriching Artemia with Se significantly improved the final weight and specific growth rate of the larvae fed non or highest HUFA enrichment levels (P < 0.05). No differences were observed in survival of the larvae fed enriched HUFA diets, but they were significantly higher than those fed unenriched HUFA groups. Dietary Se supplementation significantly increased larval n-3 HUFA and DHA contents. High mortalities were recorded in the larvae fed unenriched HUFA diets, whereas Se supplementation significantly increased the survival of the larvae fed high HUFA level. Fish fed unenriched HUFA Artemia showed significantly higher skeletal deformities than those fed other diets. The results thus indicated the beneficial effects of dietary Se in preventing the reduced growth and stress resistance in the barramundi fed HUFA inclusion diets. (c) 2022 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Microalgal-bacterial biofilms are a competitive wastewater treatment technology. This study investigated the impact of photoperiod on the characteristics and performance of these biofilms in treating pig farm wastewater. Under continuous lighting (L-24h), we observed optimal NH4+-N removal efficiency, minimal chlorophyll levels, and peak concentrations of polysaccharides and c-di-GMP. The concentration of c-di-GMP, strongly correlated with the dominant genera Brevundimonas, Devosia, and Comamonas, modulated the maturation of microalgalbacterial biofilms. The formation of these biofilms promoted NH4+-N removal. SEM imaging under L-24h conditions revealed microalgae and bacteria intimately bound by extracellular polymeric substances. Overall, this study unveiled the mechanisms of molecular communication and bacterial community succession within microalgal-bacterial biofilms under varying photoperiods.

AB  - Anthelmintic residues in livestock dung can adversely affect beneficial organisms. Targeted selective treatment (TST) of a reduced proportion of livestock with anthelmintics can slow resistance development in gastrointestinal nematodes by providing residue-free dung which could also benefit non-target organisms. We tested effects of TST on survival and reproduction of the dung beetle Onthophagus taurus (Scarabaeidae) in a factorial glasshouse experiment (Experimental treatments: five TST levels, 0.00, 0.25, 0.50, 0.75, 1.00 x four ivermectin concentrations, 125, 250, 375, 500 ppb). Each mesocosm comprised a 60 L bin containing sand, four dung pats and six pairs of adult beetles (F0 generation). No effects of TST level and ivermectin concentration on mortality of F0 adults after one week were observed. F0 adult brood ball production was affected by TST level, particularly at high ivermectin concentrations. Brood ball production increased as more untreated pats became available, with greater increases at higher ivermectin concentrations. We tested for evidence of a reported attraction of dung beetles to ivermectin-treated dung using a novel glitter-marker to trace the origin of dung used in brood balls. Where mesocosms contained both dung types, the proportion of brood balls created from untreated dung showed no statistical difference from the null expectation based on untreated dung availability in the mesocosm. Emergence of F1 adults was affected by the increase in TST, with this effect dependent on concentration. Treatments with concentrations of 250-500 ppb had the lowest emergence rates (ca. 5-20 % in mesocosms where all dung pats were treated) but emergence rates increased with TST level, reaching 68-88 % emergence where no dung pats were treated with ivermectin. Ivermectin-induced mortality occurred predominantly at egg and first instar stages. TST can provide refuges for dung beetles offering a strategy for livestock producers to maintain livestock welfare whilst benefiting from ecosystem services provided by important insects.

AB  - The temperature inside the sheep barn has a significant effect on sheep growth; therefore, providing a suitable thermal environment for the barn is essential. Considering the uneven heating problem of existing heating equipment in livestock barns, we designed an air-duct heating equipment using electricity to ensure a comfortable temperature for sheep with a suitable airflow rate. A computational fluid dynamics (CFD) method was used to simulate the temperature and velocity fields inside the sheep barn, check the heating effectiveness, and ensure uniformity. To determine the optimal opening direction and size of the heating equipment, simulation tests with various opening directions and sizes were conducted using the flow velocity and uniformity of the flow field as the key factors. The CFD simulation results showed that for the investigated sheep barn, a downward opening with diameter of 60 mm was the most effective for heating. Finally, in winter, a heating test was conducted during the decreasing, stable, and increasing periods of outdoor temperatures to verify the heating effectiveness in the experimental sheep barn. During the decreasing and stable periods of outdoor temperature, the indoor temperatures increased by 2 and 5 degrees C, respectively, in 70 min. Conversely in the increasing period of outdoor temperature, the temperature inside the barn increased by 11 degrees C and continued to rise. Our results showed that the expected heating effect of sheep barns was achieved, which can provide a reference for the environmental regulation of livestock barns.

AB  - Background: Two coexisting species with similar ecological requirements avoid or reduce competition by changing the extent of their use of a given resource. Numerous coexistence mechanisms have been proposed, but species interactions can also be aggressive; thus, generally a subordinate species modifies its realized niche to limit the probability of direct encounters with the dominant species. We studied niche partitioning between two sympatric wild canids in north-eastern Italy: the golden jackal and the red fox, which, based on competition theories, have a high potential for competition. We considered four main niche dimensions: space, habitat, time, and diet.
   Results: We investigated three study areas monitoring target species populations from March 2017 to November 2018 using non-invasive monitoring techniques. Red fox presence was ascertained in every study area, while golden jackal presence was not ascertained in one study area, where we collected data regarding wolf presence. Considering the two target species, we observed partial diet partitioning based on prey size, with the golden jackal mainly feeding on wild ungulates and the red fox mainly feeding on small mammals. The two canids had an extensive temporal overlap along the diel cycle, having both predominant crepuscular and nocturnal activity patterns, but marked spatial partitioning and differential use of habitats. The golden jackal proved to be specialist concerning the habitat dimension, while the red fox resulted completely generalist: the former selected less human-modified habitats and avoided intensively cultivated lands, while the latter was present in all habitats, including intensively cultivated lands.
   Conclusions: The observed partitioning might be due partially to some ecological adaptations (e.g. specialist vs. generalist use of resources) and specific behaviours (e.g. cooperative vs. solitary hunting) and partially to the avoidance response of the red fox aimed at reducing the probability of direct encounters with the golden jackal.

AB  - Muskrats are one of North America's most widely distributed semi-aquatic mammals; however, populations are declining in many areas of North America yet expanding as an invasive species elsewhere. Its importance in native habitats and impacts in non-native environments warrants investigation into their habitat requirements. We compared the influence of several environmental factors to determine drivers of habitat selection. We hypothesized that distance to vegetation, vegetation type, distance to beaver lodges, beaver presence, and pond morphometry would influence muskrat habitat use. Through field surveys and GIS analyses, we used logistic regression and non-parametric approaches to assess various habitat metrics. Relative to randomly created points, muskrat huts were closer to adjacent vegetation, with more huts adjacent to cattail stands than other types of vegetation, although rushes (Juncus sp.) were most heavily browsed by muskrats. Although there were more huts and push-ups on occupied beaver ponds than on abandoned ponds, overall presence of muskrats did not differ. Push-ups exhibited random placement in ponds and weak associations with other variables, despite being adjacent to smaller vegetation stands with higher browse intensity than huts. Understanding habitat use allows unique insights into a species declining in native habitats yet creating ongoing challenges as an invasive species.

AB  - Plants and insects are essential components of terrestrial ecosystems and insect herbivory is the most important type of biotic interaction in these ecosystems alongside the role of insects as pollinators. Insect damaged fossil leaves arc the only direct sources documenting the historical effect of folivorous arthropods on once living foliar tissue. The present study focuses on the patterns of plant-insect association for the Pliocene locality of the Chotanagpur Plateau, Jharkhand, eastern India. Out of 1500 fossil angiosperm leaves that were studied, 1080 leaves (72%) were damaged. About 37 damage types (DTs) representing six functional feeding groups (FFGs) were identified, i.e., galling (50.74%), margin feeding (23.24%), hole feeding (17.04%), skeletonization (1.94%), mining (2.22%), surface feeding (3.33%) and others (1.49%). Galling is the prevalent form of damage here. The host plant taxa bearing the damage types belonged to Fabaceae, Malvaceae, Anacardiaceae, Moraceae, Rhamnaceae, Rubiaceae, Myrtaceae, etc.. On the basis of comparison with extant taxa, possible culprits could have belonged to the insect orders Orthoptera, Coleoptera, Lepidoptera, Diptera, Hemiptera, and Hymenoptera. The evidence of numerous body fossils of Lepidoptera (caterpillar), Diptera (gall midge), and Hemiptera from our studied sedimentary section provides direct clues to the plant-insect interactions. It seems the tropical, predominantly humid, Pliocene climate favored large-scale herbivory in the palaeoforest of Jharkhand, eastern India. (C) 2022 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - This paper estimates the Cs-137 ecological half-life of white-tailed deer inhabiting the Department of Energy's Savannah River Site (SRS) based on sex and age using data collected over a 51-year time-period. With a physical half-life of 30.2 yr, the biological half-life for the deer herd is considerably shorter because of the isotope's biochemical mimicry of K+ inside the body. Leveraging this long-term dataset and robust sample size, we compared the long-term half-century estimates to shorter decadal increments. The simple exponential decay model for the entire 51-year sampling period predicted an ecological half-life of 23.15 years. When breaking the sample data into decadal increments Cs-137 body burden had complex temporal dynamics with predicted half-lives ranging from 9.25 to 32.33 years. Exponential decay for the entire 51-year sampling period for models evaluated by sex, age, sex*age to determine how these variables influence the predictability in the mean depuration rate, the ecological half-lives were between 21 and 23 years for all permutations, except for fawns that had a half-life no different than the physical half-life of the isotope itself. Differential habitat use and competition most likely explains why both yearling and adult females consistently had higher body burdens than males over the 51-year time period, showing how dynamic this radioisotope is in biological systems. This study is one of the most robust long-term datasets in the world (n = 42,412) that is specifically focused on monitoring the uptake and depuration of Cs-137 in a wild species.

AB  - We present an overview of wildlife-vehicle collision (WVC) liability covering 36 European countries. We reviewed approaches to WVC liability which are currently in effect across Europe and their potential consequences for WVC reporting. To obtain relevant information, we conducted a survey, including a web-based questionnaire. We retrieved answers to questions related to human fatalities from WVC, the existence of WVC databases, roadkill data systems and recommendation for drivers in the event of WVC. In 19 countries, no one is liable when a motorized vehicle collides with a wild animal. In the remaining countries, road managers or road owners may be liable as well as drivers or hunters, either consistently or under certain conditions. Liability can, in some countries, be changed after a legal assessment. Human fatalities due to WVCs have been reported in 27 countries, with approximately 90 deaths annually across European roads. The number of injured people and estimates of socio-economic losses were not possible to obtain at a European level as many countries lack reliable databases. We discuss how existing WVC liability across countries provoke some actors to transfer liability to another actor or avoid reporting these incidents altogether. WVC underreporting in certain national databases is one of the consequences of the existing WVC liability rules in the given countries. This fact reduces the potential to identify hotspots and define appropriate mitigation measures. In conclusion, we propose several procedures for modifying WVC liability that could enhance wildlife protection and road safety.

AB  - BackgroundModels of utilization distribution in the form of partial differential equations have long contributed to our understanding of organismal space use patterns. In studies of infectious diseases, they are also being increasingly adopted in support of epidemic forecasting and scenario planning. However, as movement research shifts its focus towards large data collection and statistical modeling of movement trajectories, the development of such models has notably slowed.MethodsHere, we demonstrate the continued importance of modeling utilization distribution to predict variation in space-use patterns over time. We highlight the considerable, yet largely untapped, potential of such models, which have historically been limited by the steady-state assumption due to longstanding technical constraints. Now, by adapting existing computational tools primarily developed for material science and engineering, we can probe beyond the steady states and unlock from them a broad spectrum of complex, transient space-use dynamics. Our approach requires little experience in numerical analysis and is readily accessible to model practitioners in ecology and epidemiology across diverse systems where movement is a critical feature.ResultsWe illustrated our approach using a mix of canonical and novel case studies, covering topics from wildlife translocation to vaccine deployment. First, we revisited a classical model of canid territorial formation driven by scent-mediated conspecific avoidance. Transient space-use analysis uncovered previously hidden spatial dynamics that are ecologically informative. Next, we applied our approach to long-distance movement on realistic landscapes. Habitat and land-use heterogeneities markedly affected the transient space-use dynamics and short-term forecasts, even when the steady state remained unchanged, with direct implications for conservation management. Finally, we modeled transient space-use dynamics as both a response to and a driver of transient population dynamics. The importance of this interdependence was shown in the context of epidemiology, in a scenario where the movement of healthcare personnel is influenced by local outbreak conditions that are stochastically evolving.ConclusionsBy facilitating transient space-use analysis, our approach could lead to reevaluations of foundational ecological concepts such as home range and territory, replacing static with dynamic definitions that more accurately reflect biological realities. Furthermore, we contend that a growing interest in transient space-use dynamics, spurred by this work, could have transformative effects, stimulating new research avenues in ecology and epidemiology.

AB  - The present study evaluated the general welfare state of two strains of transgenic goats bred in a region with a hot and humid tropical climate. Nine females were used, being three transgenic for human lysozyme (hLZ group), three transgenic for human glucocerebrosidase (hGCase group), and three non-transgenic (control group). The temperature and humidity index (THI) were recorded during the morning, afternoon, and evening. The physiological parameters measured were respiratory rate, heart rate, and rectal and vaginal temperatures. Venous blood samples were collected using Vacutainer (R) tubes containing 10% ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA). Also, analysis of erythrogram, leukogram, and some biochemical parameters of serum was performed. It was observed that the afternoon shift presented the largest THI, being potentially more impactful on the physiology of animals. In general, respiratory and heart rates were higher in transgenic animals, especially in the hLZ group compared to the control group (P < 0.05). Regarding the hematological parameters, the quantification of red blood cells, hemoglobin, and hematocrit was significantly lower (P < 0.05) in the hGCase group compared to that in the hLZ and control. The leukocyte count was considerably lower (P < 0.05) in the hLZ group compared to that in the hGCase and control. Correlation analysis showed that the increase in THI was associated with a change in physiological parameters normally used as indicators of thermal stress. Despite the differences found among the experimental groups, all the physiological parameters remained within the normal limits recommended for the goat species. Further studies involving a larger number of animals from different categories should be carried out to elucidate the impacts that transgenesis can have on animal welfare under different THI conditions.

AB  - Simple Summary The use of cacti, such as forage cactus, in goat feeding is widely practised in Northeast Brazil due to adaptation to climatic conditions, mainly in arid and semi-arid regions. During dry periods, when water is the main limiting factor for the development of most plant species, the growth of forage cactus is not compromised due to crassulacean acid metabolism. However, little is known about the effects of forage cactus on goats' diet in relation to meat quality. In this study, we evaluated the inclusion of 0, 25 and 55% of forage cactus replacing Tifton 85 hay in the diet of goats and its effects on meat quality. Meat from kids fed 55% of forage cactus showed greater acceptance by consumers. Therefore, it is recommended that Tifton 85 hay be replaced with 55% forage cactus, as it provides lower lipid content and higher monounsaturated fatty acid content in goat meat. Low rainfall in Northeast Brazil is a limiting factor for animal production. Forages that present crassulacean acid metabolism, such as forage cactus, are adapted to the edaphoclimatic conditions of this region, as they lose little water through the stomata. Thus, the objective was to evaluate the physical and chemical quality, fatty acid profile and sensory acceptance of the meat from goats fed forage cactus as a substitute for Tifton 85 hay. Twenty-one uncastrated mixed-breed goats with a mean body weight of 18 +/- 0.86 kg and 7 +/- 1 months of age were used. A completely randomized design with three treatments and seven replications per treatment was performed. The inclusion of 0 (control), 25 and 55% of forage cactus in substitution of Tifton 85 hay in the diet of the goats was evaluated. The lipid content in the meat of animals fed 25 and 55% of forage cactus was 1.33% and 1.26%, respectively, and was lower (p < 0.05) in relation to the meat of animals that received the control diet (1.56%). The inclusion of 55% of forage cactus provided an increase (p < 0.05) in the content of monounsaturated fatty acids in the meat (52.71%) in relation to the control meat (37.75%). Sensory analysis differed (p < 0.05) between treatments. We recommend replacing Tifton 85 hay with 55% forage cactus, as it presents greater sensory acceptance, and provides lower lipid content and higher content of monounsaturated fatty acids in goat meat.

AB  - When a maternal rat nurtures her pups, she relies on adequate resources to provide optimal care for her offspring. Accordingly, limited environmental resources may result in atypical maternal care, disrupting various developmental outcomes. In the current study, maternal Long-Evans rats were randomly assigned to either a standard resource (SR) group, provided with four cups of bedding and two paper towels for nesting material or a limited resource (LR) group, provided with a quarter of the bedding and nesting material provided for the SR group. Offspring were monitored at various developmental phases throughout the study. After weaning, pups were housed in same-sex dyads in environments with SRs for continued observations. Subsequent behavioral tests revealed a sex x resource interaction in play behavior on PND 28; specifically, LR reduced play attacks in males while LR increased play attacks in females. A sex x resource interaction was also observed in anxiety-related responses in the open field task with an increase in thigmotaxis in LR females and, in the social interaction task, females exhibited more external rears oriented away from the social target. Focusing on morphological variables, tail length measurements of LR males and females were shorter on PND 9, 16, and 21; however, differences in tail length were no longer present at PND 35. Following the behavioral assessments, animals were perfused at 56 days of age and subsequent immunohistochemical assays indicated increased glucocorticoid receptors in the lateral habenula of LR offspring and higher c-Fos immunoreactivity in the basolateral amygdala of SR offspring. Further, when tail vertebrae and tail tendons were assessed via micro-CT and hydroxyproline assays, results indicated increased trabecular separation, decreased bone volume fraction, and decreased connectivity density in bones, along with reduced collagen concentration in tendons in the LR animals. In sum, although the restricted resources only persisted for a brief duration, the effects appear to be far-reaching and pervasive in this early life stress animal model.

AB  - The contamination of freshwater environments by pharmaceuticals is a growing problem. Modern healthcare uses nearly 3000 substances, many of which are designed to work at low dosages and act on physiological systems that have been evolutionarily conserved across taxa. Because drugs affect the organisms from different trophic levels, pharmaceutical pollution is likely to disturb species interactions. However, such effects are still only poorly understood. We investigated the impacts of environmentally relevant concentrations of the common drug fluoxetine (Prozac), an increasingly common contaminant of European waters, on predation behavior of crucian carp (Carassius carassius), a common planktivorous European fish, and the somatic growth of its prey, the water flea (Daphnia magna), a widespread planktonic crustacean. We exposed these two organisms to environmentally relevant levels of fluoxetine (360 ng L-1): the fish for 4 weeks and the water fleas for two generations. We tested the growth of the daphnids and the hunting behavior (reaction distance at which fish attacked Daphnia and feeding rate) of the fish under drug contamination. We found that Daphnia exposed to fluoxetine grew larger than a nonexposed cohort. The hunting behavior of C. carassius was altered when they were exposed to the drug; the reaction distance was shorter, and the feeding rate was slower. These effects occurred regardless of Daphnia size and the treatment regime they were subjected to. Our results suggest that contamination of freshwater environments with fluoxetine can disrupt the top-down ecological control of herbivores by reducing the hunting efficiency of fish and, as a consequence, may lead to increases in cladoceran population numbers.

AB  - Context. Prairie dogs (Cynomys spp.) are rodents enjoyed by some humans; yet, they cause crop and property damage, and carry zoonotic disease. Non-lethal control of prairie dogs is of interest in urban/suburban settings. The injectable immunocontraceptive vaccine GonaCon (active ingredient is gonadotropin-releasing hormone [GnRH]) has been shown to be effective at reducing fertility in equine and deer, and is a US EPA-registered vaccine for use in these ungulate species. Aims. To conduct a replicated field study to test efficacy of GonaCon in black-tailed prairie dogs (C. ludovicianus), and if found to be efficacious, to help facilitate the EPA registration of this product for prairie dog management in urban/suburban areas. Methods. Prairie dogs were live-trapped in October- December 2018 in three treatment and three control sites. Every captured female >= 660 g was injected with 0.4 mL of either GonaCon (0.032% w/w GnRH) at treatment sites or a sham vaccine (absent of GnRH) at control sites. Juveniles and adults were counted at all six sites to establish juvenile:adult (ratio) and juvenile density in May-June 2019 (determining initial GonaCon effectiveness) and 2020 (determining persistence of contraception). Key results. In 2019, the juvenile:adult ratio was significantly reduced (P = 0.0022) in GonaCon (mean +/- s.e.: 0.23 +/- 0.01) relative to the sham (1.10 +/- 0.58) sites. Juvenile density was three times greater in sham than GonaCon sites. In 2020, GonaCon sites produced equal offspring to nearby sham sites. Conclusions. GonaCon is highly effective during the first year (2019) but not in the second year (2020) if only a small area (0.6-2.8 ha) or small proportion of females in a colony is treated, such as was undertaken in this study. Implications. In 2022, GonaCon-Prairie Dogs was EPA-registered. Treating whole colonies of prairie dogs at once is favoured; yet, if small or partial colony treatment is desired, then annual GonaCon treatment may be needed.

AB  - Crop diversification through inter- and mixed cropping practices has been shown to enhance conservation biological control of herbivorous pest insects. However, distinct cropping practices are usually tested independently, which makes assessing the relative impact of specific measures difficult. We assessed parasitism rates of released large cabbage white (Pieris brassicae) caterpillars by parasitoids on white cabbage (Brassica oleracea) plants in six different cropping systems: four different strip-cropping designs, a pixel cropping design and a monoculture. These cropping designs differed in the number of crops included, the use of parasitoid-attractive cultivars in concurrence with a cash cultivar, the use of nectar-providing crops for adult parasitoids and the spatial arrangement of the crops. Parasitism rate by the main P. brassicae parasitoid Cotesia glomerata was enhanced by strip cropping of white cabbage with wheat, and even further enhanced by the inclusion of four more main crops. Contrastingly, C. glomerata parasitism rate was lower in the most intensive crop mixture, that is pixel cropping, than in any of the strip-cropping designs. The use of attractive cultivars or rewarding floral resources within a strip-cropping set-up did not significantly further enhance C. glomerata parasitism rate. Synthesis and applications: Our results show that increasing the number of crops in the agroecosystem enhances parasitism rates, whereas the additional inclusion of more subtle measures to attract or reward parasitoids shows mostly marginal effects. We argue that strip cropping can readily be employed as (part of a) pest control strategy, but trait-based measures still need further development. How to implement attract and/or reward strategies in large-scale agricultural systems should be further evaluated in the context of crop diversification schemes.Read the free Plain Language Summary for this article on the Journal blog.

AB  - Simple Summary Palm kernel cake (PKC) is a by-product used in the diet of ruminants (sheep, dairy cows, beef cattle) with the aim of reducing production costs. The inclusion of PKC showed promising results mainly in feedlot animals. However, among domestic ruminant species, goats are the most selective feed animals, which may result in different feeding behavior and performance when PKC is included in the diet. We tested the dietary inclusion of PKC, a by-product of the biofuel industry, at the levels of 0, 80, 160 and 240 g kg(-1), to evaluate its impact on the performance, feeding behavior and the metabolic profile of lactating goats. The inclusion of up to 80 g kg(-1) PKC is recommended for the diet of goats without affecting the performance. This study was carried out to determine the optimal inclusion rate of palm kernel cake (PKC) in diets for lactating goats based on intake, digestibility, feeding behavior, milk production and nitrogen metabolism. Twelve goats were used, eight Saanen and four Anglo Nubian, with a body weight of 46.0 +/- 9.4 kg and 105 +/- 5 days of lactation, distributed in a 4 x 4 Latin square design in triplicate. The diets were composed of increasing levels of PKC; 0, 80, 160 and 240 g kg(-1) of dry matter (DM). The DM, crude protein, neutral detergent fiber and non-fibrous carbohydrates intakes decreased (p < 0.01) with the PKC inclusion. Milk production and milk protein decreased (p = 0.001), and milk production efficiency was not affected (p > 0.05) by the PKC inclusion. The ether extract intake varied quadratically (p < 0.01). Feeding and rumination efficiencies of dry matter and NDF were reduced (p < 0.001). The fat and total solids contents of the milk were influenced quadratically (p < 0.05). Nitrogen excretion (feces and milk), and retained nitrogen decreased (p < 0.001). Moderate use of up to 80 g kg(-1) DM of PKC in the diet of lactating goats is recommended since at these levels milk production or body weight are significantly affected.

AB  - Simple Summary Chaka sheep are adapted to a harsh, highly saline environment and are also known for having typical sensory characteristics attributed to free-range conditions and grazing on wild plants. Black Tibetan sheep are located in Guinan county, Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture of Hainan, Qinghai Province, and are well-adapted to the harsh plateau environment in China. In this study, we compared the fatty acids and metabolites in the longissimus dorsi muscle between Black Tibetan and Chaka sheep grazing in a highly saline environment. We found that upregulated organic acid and fatty acid biosynthesis increased the meat quality of Chaka sheep. The objective of this study was to investigate and compare fatty acids and metabolites in the longissimus dorsi muscle between Black Tibetan and Chaka sheep grazing in a highly saline environment. A total of eight castrated sheep (14 months old) with similar body weights (25 +/- 2.2 kg) were selected. The experimental treatments included Black Tibetan (BT) and Chaka sheep (CK) groups, and each group had four replications. The experiment lasted for 20 months. All sheep grazed in a highly saline environment for the whole experimental period and had free access to water. The results showed that the diameter (42.23 vs. 51.46 mu m), perimeter (131.78 vs. 166.14 mu m), and area of muscle fibers (1328.74 vs. 1998.64 mu m(2)) were smaller in Chaka sheep than in Black Tibetan sheep. The ash content in the longissimus dorsi was lower in Chaka sheep than in Black Tibetan sheep (p = 0.010), and the contents of dry matter (DM), ether extract (EE), and crude protein (CP) in the longissimus dorsi showed no differences (p > 0.05). For fatty acids, the proportions of C10:0, C15:0, and tC18:1 in the longissimus dorsi were higher in Chaka sheep than in Black Tibetan sheep (p < 0.05). However, all other individual fatty acids were similar among treatments, including saturated fatty acids (SFAs), unsaturated fatty acids (UFAs), monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFAs), polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), and the ratios of n-6 PUFAs to n-3 PUFAs and PUFAs to SFAs (p > 0.05). A total of 65 biomarkers were identified between the two breeds of sheep. Among these metabolites, 40 metabolic biomarkers were upregulated in the CK group compared to the BT group, and 25 metabolites were downregulated. The main metabolites include 30 organic acids, 9 amino acids, 5 peptides, 4 amides, 3 adenosines, 2 amines, and other compounds. Based on KEGG analysis, eight pathways, namely, fatty acid biosynthesis, purine metabolism, the biosynthesis of unsaturated fatty acids, renin secretion, the regulation of lipolysis in adipocytes, neuroactive ligand-receptor interaction, the cGMP-PKG signaling pathway, and the cAMP signaling pathway, were identified as significantly different pathways. According to the results on fatty acids and metabolites, upregulated organic acid and fatty acid biosynthesis increased the meat quality of Chaka sheep.

AB  - The transmission of resistance traits to herbivores across subsequent generations is an important strategy employed by plants to enhance their fitness in environments with high herbivore pressure. However, our understanding of the impact of maternal herbivory on direct and indirect induced chemical defenses of progeny, as well as the associated costs, is currently limited to herbivory by leaf-chewing insects. In this study, we investigated the transgenerational effects of a sap-feeding insect, the green peach aphid Myzus persicae, on direct and indirect chemical defenses of bell pepper plants (Capsicum annuum), and whether the effects entail costs to plant growth. Aphid herbivory on parental plants led to a reduced number of seeds per fruit, which exhibited lower germination rates and produced smaller seedlings compared to those from non-infested parental plants. In contrast, the progeny of aphid-infested plants were less preferred as hosts by aphids and less suitable than the progeny of non-infested plants. This enhanced resistance in the progeny of aphid-infested plants coincided with elevated levels of both constitutive and herbivore-induced total phenolic compounds, compared to the progeny of non-infested plants. Furthermore, the progeny of aphid-infested plants emitted herbivore-induced plant volatiles (HIPVs) that were more attractive to the aphid parasitoid Aphidius platensis than those emitted by the progeny of non-infested plants. Our results indicate that herbivory by sap-feeding insect induces transgenerational resistance on progeny bell pepper plants, albeit at the expense of vegetative growth.

AB  - Poultry waste can be produced into high-quality organic fertilizers by composting. In this project, a microbial agent was constructed. The objective of this study was to analyze the effectiveness of additives (microbial agent ( TB) and manure compost (TM)) on composting process of chicken litter with mushroom residue. Results indicated that TB exhibited the highest composting temperature (72.1 degrees C) and TM exhibited the longest high-temperature period (10 days). TB nutrients were better retained compared to the control and achieving a final total nitrogen (TN), total phosphorus (TP) and total potassium (TK) at 1.92%, 5.38% and 4.61%, respectively. After composting, the TP increased 1.22% in the treatments with manure compost inoculation compared with initial phase, while it increased 0.95% in CK2. At the end of composting, TM had lower E4/E6 values and organic matter (OM) content compared to CK2 illustrating that the addition of mature compost enhanced the humification of compost. Operational taxonomic units ( OTUs) analysis revealed that TM increased microbial community diversity, however, TB decreased microbial community diversity compared to the control. Compared with the direct addition of a few specific microorganisms as microbial agents, the addition of mature compost can obviously increase the microbial species in the composting process, extend high-temperature period and promote fermentation process. Obviously, the above research results provide theoretical lessons on how to rationally add exogenous microbes to promote the composting process scientifically.

AB  - Mangalore melon (Cucumis melo ssp. agrestis var. acidulus) is a non-dessert melon, extensively grown in the coastal districts of South India, but hardly known to the rest of the World. Immature or mature fruits of Mangalore melon are used in preparation of delicious dishes such as vegetable stew, chutneys and curries. They are appreciated for nutritional values, long shelf life and biotic stress resistance. Seventy-nine accessions of Mangalore melon were collected from five states of South India and their genetic diversity was assessed using inter simple sequence repeat (ISSR) markers. Putative candidate genes of extended shelf life in Mangalore melon were studied by quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction in comparison with cantaloupe (Cucumis melo L.). Shelf life varied from 65 to 300 days at room temperature. Six ISSR primers amplified 142 fragments ranging from 80 to 2380 bp with an average of 23.66 bands per marker on a high-resolution capillary electrophoresis system. Neighbor joining phylogenetic tree construction from the ISSR allele similarity based genetic distance revealed two major clusters with 46 and 33 accessions in each cluster. Expression of fruit ripening related genes of ethylene biosynthesis (1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate synthase, 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate oxidase) and cell wall metabolism (polygalacturonase, xyloglucan endotransglucosylase/hydrolase and expansin) in Mangalore melons was significantly lower than the cantaloupe melon at 180 days after harvest. Mangalore melon is a promising genetic resource for enhancing the shelf life of melons. The putative candidate genes identified here are useful in enhancing shelf life of cantaloupe.

TI  - Gut microbial diversity and digestive function of an omnivorous shark
T2  - MARINE BIOLOGY
LA  - English
AB  - The intestinal microbiome of vertebrates has been shown to play a crucial role in their digestive capabilities. This is particularly true for omnivores and herbivores that rely on enteric microbes to digest components of plant material that are indigestible by host-derived enzymes. While studies of microbe-host interactions are becoming more frequent in terrestrial systems, studies of this type are still limited in marine systems, particularly for higher trophic level organisms. Although sharks are largely carnivorous, the bonnethead shark (Sphyrna tiburo) has been identified as an omnivore, given that it assimilates seagrass material in addition to proteinaceous prey items such as crustaceans. The mechanisms by which bonnetheads digest seagrass, including microbial digestion, are still unknown. We use digestive enzyme assays, histological imaging, measurements of microbial fermentation, and 16S rDNA sequencing to explore potential processes by which the bonnethead shark may digest and assimilate plant material. We found evidence of microbial fermentation (as evident by moderate short-chain-fatty-acid concentrations) as well as evidence of greater epithelial surface area in their spiral intestine compared to other gut regions. We identified specific orders of microbes that make up the majority of the bonnethead shark gut microbiome (Vibrionales, Clostridiales, Pseudomonadales, Mycoplasmatales, Rhizobiales, and others), some of which are known, in other organisms, to be involved in the production of enzymes responsible for the breakdown of chitin (found in crustacean shells) and components of cellulose (found in seagrass). Our results highlight that an organism from a stereotypical "carnivorous" group is capable of breaking down seagrass, including potential for some fiber degradation, as well as advances our knowledge of gut microbe community structure in sharks.

AB  - By dispersing seeds long distances, large, fruit-eating animals influence plant population spread and community dynamics. After fruit consumption, animal gut passage time and movement determine seed dispersal patterns and distances. These, in turn, are influenced by extrinsic, environmental variables and intrinsic, individual-level variables. We simulated seed dispersal by forest elephants (Loxodonta cyclotis) by integrating gut passage data from wild elephants with movement data from 96 individuals. On average, elephants dispersed seeds 5.3 km, with 89% of seeds dispersed farther than 1 km. The longest simulated seed dispersal distance was 101 km, with an average maximum dispersal distance of 40.1 km. Seed dispersal distances varied among national parks, perhaps due to unmeasured environmental differences such as habitat heterogeneity and configuration, but not with human disturbance or habitat openness. On average, male elephants dispersed seeds farther than females. Elephant behavioral traits strongly influenced dispersal distances, with bold, exploratory elephants dispersing seeds 1.1 km farther than shy, idler elephants. Protection of forest elephants, particularly males and highly mobile, exploratory individuals, is critical to maintaining long distance seed dispersal services that shape plant communities and tropical forest habitat.

AB  - Simple Summary: Physiological responses to heat stress are affected by breed. Therefore, crossbreeding genetically improved lines with tropically adapted breeds of pigs may be a strategy to attenuate the impact of high ambient temperatures on pig production. Although some studies have evaluated thermotolerance in tropically adapted breeds, it is not yet clear to which extent improved tolerance to heat stress is a consequence of a greater ability to equilibrate thermogenesis and thermolysis, or if it is a consequence of decreased growth performance. Although there was no interaction for performance, thermoregulatory responses, and blood parameters, our results evidenced that ambient temperature effects on carcass parameters were modulated by the pigs' genotype. Because protein deposition significantly decreased in response to high ambient temperature in commercial pigs, and was not affected by ambient temperature in Piau crossbred pigs, our study suggests increased thermotolerance of Piau crossbred pigs.
   The study aimed at evaluating the effects of high ambient temperature (HT: 30 degrees C) on the thermoregulatory responses and performance of commercial and Piau crossbred (Brazilian Piau breed sires x commercial genotype dams) growing pigs. Commercial and Piau crossbred pigs were reared under thermoneutral (TN: 22 degrees C) or HT conditions during a 14-day experimental period. Feeding (daily) and animals (beginning and end) were weighted to obtain performance parameters. Skin and rectal temperatures, respiratory rate, and blood parameters were also measured. At the end of the trial (day 15), the animal's backfat thickness (BF) and loin eye area (LEA) were measured. No interaction (p > 0.05) between the genetic group and ambient temperature was observed for any performance trait. Irrespective of ambient temperature, Piau crossbred pigs had a similar feed intake (ADFI, 2615 g/day, on average; p > 0.05), lower daily weight gain (ADG, -234 g/day; p < 0.01), and a higher feed conversion ratio (FCR, +0.675 g/g; p < 0.01). There was interaction (p = 0.01) between genotype and ambient temperature for the LEA that decreased significantly in response to HT in commercial pigs (-6.88 cm(2)) and did not differ in response to ambient temperature in Piau crossbred pigs (29.14 cm(2), on average; p > 0.05). Piau crossbred pigs had greater BF (+7.2 mm; p < 0.01) than commercial pigs. Regardless of the genetic group, exposure of pigs to HT resulted in decreased ADFI (-372 g/day; p < 0.01), ADG (-185 g/day; p < 0.01), and a higher FCR (+0.48 g/g; p = 0.01). Ambient temperature did not affect lipid deposition. Pigs at HT had an increased respiratory rate (+38 bpm; p < 0.01) and a long-lasting increase in skin and rectal temperatures compared to TN pigs. Total concentrations of triiodothyronine (T-3) and thyroxine (T-4) were not affected by ambient temperature in commercial pigs, whereas Piau crossbred pigs kept at 30 degrees C had a transient decrease in both hormones at day 2 (p < 0.01). Serum cortisol concentrations were not affected (p > 0.05) by genotype nor ambient temperature. In summary, Piau crossbred pigs had lower efficiency using nutrients for growth in association with increased lipid deposition when compared to commercial pigs. In response to HT, commercial pigs had a decreased LEA, whereas no effect was observed for Piau crossbred pigs.
   Apart from that, commercial and Piau crossbred pigs had a similar magnitude of thermoregulatory responses activation in response to HT, evidencing their innate survival-oriented function.

AB  - Simple Summary The loss of sperm quality during liquid preservation of boar semen may depend on the initial characteristics of the raw semen. Retained cytoplasmic droplets (CD) at the sperm tail caused by incomplete sperm maturation in the epididymis are the most common morphological abnormality in boar semen. The aim of the present study was to examine whether the presence of CD affects the quality of boar sperm during long-term liquid storage. For this, sperm integrity and function were evaluated in semen samples containing different amounts of sperm with CD. It was found that the ability of sperm to perform an essential preparative step for fertilization, named capacitation, was impaired in semen samples rich in CD. Moreover, the enhanced presence of CD caused a higher incidence of sperm destabilization in semen doses preserved for long term (96 h). In contrast, sperm motility and viability were not affected by the presence of CD. The proportion of sperm with CD did not decrease during semen storage in the semen extender. It is concluded that a disturbed maturation of sperm in the epididymis impairs essential steps of fertilization and causes a faster sperm destabilization during in vitro storage. Retained cytoplasmic droplets (CD) are the most frequent sperm abnormality in boar semen. A high incidence of CD is associated with subfertility, but the underlaying reasons are not well understood. The storage of extended semen might augment the adverse effects of CD on essential steps towards fertilization, such as capacitation. The aim of this study was to examine whether the enhanced presence of CD in boar semen influences sperm's response to the capacitation stimulus bicarbonate during long-term semen storage. Extended semen samples (n = 78) from 13 artificial insemination centers were analyzed using a flow cytometric calcium influx assay. Samples with >15% of CD showed a reduced specific response to bicarbonate and a higher non-specific destabilization after storage for 96 h and subsequent incubation at 38 degrees C in three variants of Tyrode's medium (p < 0.05). The size of the bicarbonate-responsive sperm population was inversely correlated with the presence of CD-bearing sperm (r = -0.61, p < 0.01). Samples with <= 15% and samples with >15% of CD did not differ in motility or viability and acrosome integrity during semen storage. In conclusion, incomplete epididymal sperm maturation impairs the in vitro capacitation ability and promotes sperm destabilization in stored boar semen.

AB  - With the growing concerns about antibiotic resistance, it is more and more important to prevent the environmental pollution caused by antibiotic fermentation residues. In this study, composted erythromycin fermentation residue (EFR) with the mixture of cattle manure and maize straw at ratios of 0:10 (CK), 1:10 (T1), and 3:10 (T2) explores the effects on physicochemical characteristics, mobile genetic elements (MGEs), and antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs). Results reflected that the addition of EFR reduced the carbon/nitrogen ratio of each compost and improved the piles' temperature, which promoted the composting process. However, the contents of Na+, SO42-, and erythromycin were also significantly increased. After 30 days of composting, the degradation rates of erythromycin in CK, T1, and T2 were 72.7%, 20.3%, and 37.1%, respectively. Meanwhile, the total positive rates for 26 detected ARGs in T1 and T2 were 65.4%, whereas that of CK was only 23.1%. Further analysis revealed that ARGs responsible for ribosomal protection, such as ermF, ermT, and erm(35), dominated the composts of T1 and T2, and most were correlated with IS613, electrical conductivity (EC), nitrogen, and Zn2+. Above all, adding EFR helps to improve the nutritional value of composts, but the risks in soil salinization and ARG enrichment caused by high EC and erythromycin content should be further investigated and eliminated.

AB  - Aerobic composting is considered as an economically as well as environmentally friendly technology that pre-vents the diffusion of ARGs and ARBs from manure to farmland soil, on which many studies have been con-ducted. However, the transmission route and potential ecological risks of ARGs in soil-vegetable systems after application of manure at different maturity stages remain unclear. Therefore, through a pot experiment, this study analyzed the effects of manure composted from livestock excrement on ARGs and microbial community in different soil-vegetable systems, taking leafy plants (Shanghai green) and tuber plants (carrot) as examples. It was noted that the highly matured manure could reduce the ARGs contamination in soil and crops, and the ARGs in soil tended to accumulate in the direction of plant roots. The edible part of crops often had a more serious ecological risk of ARGs, and the potential pathogenic bacteria and ARGs could harm human health through exposure and dietary routes. In summary, this study provides new evidence for the transmission of ARGs in soil -vegetable systems with different mature stages of manure and highlights the potential safety risks of the transfer of antibiotic resistance from manure to soil and ultimately to the human food chain.

AB  - Baculoviruses are a group of entomopathogenic viruses that are important natural enemies of insects, particularly lepidopteran larvae. An important component of baculovirus transmission efficiency is the frequency with which hosts encounter patchily distributed virions on plants. Little is known about the ecology and bacterial composition of virus-killed cadavers. We used a baculovirus and host Trichoplusia ni caterpillars to study the effects of virus-killed cadavers on tomato plant defenses and T. ni behavior. We also compared bacterial communities associated with virus-killed and uninfected (freeze-killed) cadavers and found that there was no significant difference in community composition and membership between tomato-fed virus-killed or freeze-killed cadavers. Comparison of virus-killed cadavers from two separate experiments revealed significant differences in bacterial community composition, suggesting that host plant could play a more important role in shaping bacterial communities than virus infection status. Culture-dependent plating indicated that virus-killed cadavers had significantly higher bacterial titers compared with uninfected cadavers. We found that virus-killed cadavers suppressed polyphenol oxidase activity, an important plant defense protein, in mechanically damaged plants, but not in plants damaged by herbivory. Although cadavers did not influence plant defenses induced by feeding damage inflicted by healthy or infected T. ni, this study provides the first evidence that baculoviruses could influence plant defenses through host cadavers. When applied to intact plants, neither virus-killed or freeze-killed cadavers influenced T. ni oviposition, larval choice, or larval consumption, indicating these insects did not discriminate cadaver cues. Virus-killed cadavers could play important roles in mediating interactions between plants, herbivores, and other trophic levels, with potential implications for viral transmission dynamics.

AB  - Fasciolosis, a parasitic disease of ruminants, poses significant economic and animal-health challenges in Algeria. This study aimed to assess spatial, temporal, and species-specific patterns of fasciolosis prevalence across diverse agro-climatic zones and to estimate associated economic losses. Between 2013 and 2023, eight wilayas El-Tarf, Skikda, Jijel (Region I), Blida, Mila (Region II), and M'Sila, Medea, Laghouat (Region III) were surveyed. Systematic postmortem inspections of 1,569,392 animals (349,176 cattle; 982,669 sheep; 235,639 goats; 1,882 camels; 26 horses) were performed by qualified veterinarians, with liver and bile-duct examination for Fasciola. Data on region, species, year, and season were analyzed in R 4.4.0 using ANOVA, Kruskal-Wallis, Tukey's post hoc tests, and principal component analysis (PCA). Economic losses were calculated from condemned liver weights in Blida, Laghouat, and Jijel, converted to USD. PCA distinguished three regional prevalence profiles, with PC1 (77.7% variance) separating overall prevalence levels. Region I exhibited the highest mean prevalence (2.47%), peaking at 3.54% in 2018 - significantly greater than Region II (1.39%) and Region III (1.96%) (p < 0.01). Cattle showed the greatest infection rate (mean 4.14%), significantly higher than sheep (1.32%; p < 0.001) and goats (0.25%; p < 0.001), while horses and camels remained uninfected. Seasonal analysis revealed highest prevalence in autumn and winter (approximate to 2.1%) versus spring (approximate to 1.5%). Economic losses totaled USD 10.6 million in Blida, USD 1.0 million in Laghouat, and USD 142.2 million in Jijel over the study period. Targeted control strategies, adapted to regional and seasonal risk patterns, are essential. Future work should investigate environmental and management factors driving regional differences and evaluate cost-effective interventions to mitigate fasciolosis impact in Algerian livestock.

AB  - In arid ecosystems, foliar water uptake (FWU) plays an important role in improving plant physiological performance. However, the structural and physiological response mechanism of FWU between male and female woody desert plants has not been reported. Using the dioecious desert woody plant Populus euphratica, the current study explored the structural and physiological response mechanism of male and female P. euphratica leaves to water absorption via an FWU capacity experiment based on leaf epidermal cell wall components and cell structure, osmotic adjustment, and oxidative metabolism indicators. The results showed that both male and female P. euphratica plants could absorb water through leaves. The per unit area of leaf water absorption (AFWU) and the leaf absorption speed (k) of female P. euphratica were higher than those of male P. euphratica, and the TFWU was approximately twice that of male P. euphratica. The leaf thickness (LT), palisade tissue thickness (TP) and the contents of cellulose and pectin of female were significantly larger than those of male P. euphratica. The contents of sucrose, glucose, soluble sugar, proline and peroxidase in female leaves were significantly higher than those in male leaves. Multivariate factor analysis showed that the AFWU of the leaves was strongly correlated with glucose, cellulose, TP, and catalase, and the k was strongly correlated with starch, pectin, LT, and malondialdehyde. The FWU capacity of female P. euphratica was stronger than that of male P. euphratica, which was caused by the difference in cell structure and osmotic regulatory substances. These results provide a new perspective for understanding the water utilization mechanism reproduction strategy of dioecious plants.

AB  - A variety of animals have been observed cleaning ectoparasites off of another species. In terrestrial systems, the most common interactions involve birds cleaning mammals. Despite the high density and wide distribution of kangaroos across Australia, there are almost no known records of bird-kangaroo cleaner relationships. Here I report multiple observations of bird-kangaroo interactions recorded with camera traps. This study replicates a previous report of Willie Wagtail (Rhipidura leucophyrs) cleaning, as well as details observations of two new bird species observed perching on Eastern grey kangaroos (Macropus giganteus). These results indicate bird-macropod cleaning interactions may be more common than previously reported.

AB  - Parrotfishes and surgeonfishes are major Caribbean herbivores that primarily graze reef algae and thereby play an important functional role in indirectly promoting coral recruitment and growth. Yet, an emerging body of research suggests that these nominal herbivores graze on a diverse array of other food sources and researchers have questioned whether they may target more nutrient-dense foods growing within or upon algae, such as cyanobacteria. In this study, we investigated the species-specific foraging rates of parrotfishes and surgeonfishes on Brown Chromis (Chromis multilineata) fecal pellets compared to other major dietary items. We found that almost 85% of observed fecal pellets were ingested by fishes and that over 90% of ingested fecal pellets were consumed by parrotfishes and surgeonfishes alone. While there were species-specific differences in the levels of feces consumption (coprophagy), we found that all three surgeonfishes (Acanthurus chirurgus, A. coeruleus, and A. tractus) and six of the nine of parrotfish species surveyed (Scarus coeruleus, S. iseri, S. taeniopterus, S. vetula, Sparisoma aurofrenatum, and S. viride) consumed C. multilineata feces. To better understand the nutritional value of this behavior, we analyzed the composition of proteins, lipids, carbohydrates, total calories, and micronutrients in C. multilineata fecal pellets and compared these to published values for other food sources targeted by these fishes. Our findings suggest that these fecal pellets may have higher values of proteins, carbohydrates, total calories, and important micronutrients, such as phosphorus, compared to various macroalgae and the epilithic algae matrix, though comparable or lower values compared to cyanobacteria. To our knowledge, this is the first study to document coprophagy by tropical herbivorous fishes in the Caribbean region. This research advances our understanding of the foraging ecology of nominally herbivorous fishes and highlights the importance of fish feces as a nutritional resource on coral reefs.

AB  - Background Glucocorticoids (e.g. cortisol) are associated with variation in social behavior, and previous studies have linked baseline as well as challenge-induced glucocorticoid concentrations to dominance status. It is known that cortisol response to an acute challenge is repeatable and correlates to social behavior in males of many mammal species. However, it is unclear whether these patterns are also consistent for females. The aim of this study was to investigate whether baseline and response cortisol concentrations are repeatable in female guinea pigs (Cavia aperea f. porcellus) and whether dominance rank is stable and correlated to baseline cortisol concentration and/or cortisol responsiveness. Results Our results show that cortisol responsiveness (after 1 h: R = 0.635, 95% CI = 0.229, 0.927; after 2 h: R = 0.764, 95% CI = 0.433, 0.951) and dominance rank (R = 0.709, 95% CI = 0.316, 0.935) of females were significantly repeatable after six weeks but not correlated. Baseline cortisol was not repeatable (R = 0, 95% CI = 0, 0.690) and also did not correlate to dominance rank. Furthermore, the difference in repeatability estimates of baseline and response values was due to high within-individual variance of baseline cortisol concentration; the amount of between-individual variance was similar for baseline cortisol and the two measures of cortisol responsiveness. Conclusions Females occupying different dominance ranks did not have long-term differences in cortisol concentrations, and cortisol responsiveness does not seem to be significantly involved in the maintenance of dominance rank. Overall, this study reveals the remarkable stability of cortisol responsiveness and dominance rank in a female rodent, and it remains an open question whether the magnitude of cortisol responsiveness is adaptive in social contexts for females.

AB  - Mammalian embryos produced in vitro have poor embryo quality and low developmental ability compared with in vivo embryos. The main manifestations are the low number of blastocysts, the low ratio of the number of inner cell mass cells to the number of trophoblastic cells, and the high apoptosis rate of blastocysts, resulting in low embryo implantation rate. Therefore, optimizing in vitro culture conditions has become a key technology to improve the quality of preimplantation embryos. Oviduct Epithelial cells exosomes (OEVs) can be absorbed and internalized by embryos to improve the blastocyst rate and blastocyst quality of embryos in vitro. As a special nuclear structure, Paraspeckles are involved in the fate determination of mammalian early embryonic mammalian cells. However, the regulation of embryonic cell differentiation by OEVs remains unknown. We aimed to investigate the effects of OEVs on paraspeckle formation and cell fate determination in yak in vitro fertilization (IVF) of em-bryos. To simulate the in vivo oviduct environment after ovulation, we used follicular fluid exosomes (FEVs) to stimulate yak oviduct epithelial cells and collect OEVs. OEVs were added to the yak IVF embryo culture system. Paraspeckle formation, cell differentiation, and blastocyst quality in yak embryos were determined. Our results show that, development of yak embryos is unique compared to other bovine species, and OEVs can be used as a supplement to the in vitro culture system of yak embryos to improve embryonic development and blas-tocyst quality. And also Paraspeckles/CARM1 mediated the regulation of OEVs on cell differentiation during in vitro yak embryo production. These results provide new insights into the study of yak embryonic development and the role of OEVs in embryonic development.

AB  - Circadian rhythm (CR) disturbances are among the most commonly observed symptoms during major depressive disorder, mostly in the form of disrupted sleeping patterns. However, several other measurable parameters, such as plasma hormone rhythms and differential expression of circadian clock genes (ccgs), are also present, often referred to as circadian phase markers. In the recent years, CR disturbances have been recognized as an essential aspect of depression; however, most of the known animal models of depression have yet to be evaluated for their eligibility to model CR disturbances. In this study, we investigate the potential of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH)-treated animals as a disease model for research in CR disturbances in treatment-resistant depression. For this purpose, we evaluate the changes in several circadian phase markers, including plasma concentrations of corticosterone, ACTH, and melatonin, as well as gene expression patterns of 13 selected ccgs at 3 different time points, in both peripheral and central tissues. We observed no impact on plasma corticosterone and melatonin concentrations in the ACTH rats compared to vehicle. However, the expression pattern of several ccgs was affected in the ACTH rats compared to vehicle. In the hippocampus, 10 ccgs were affected by ACTH treatment, whereas in the adrenal glands, 5 ccgs were affected and in the prefrontal cortex, hypothalamus and liver 4 ccgs were regulated. In the blood, only 1 gene was affected. Individual tissues showed changes in different ccgs, but the expression of Bmal1, Per1, and Per2 were most generally affected. Collectively, the results presented here indicate that the ACTH animal model displays dysregulation of a number of phase markers suggesting the model may be appropriate for future studies into CR disturbances.image
   Major depressive disorder is commonly accompanied by circadian rhythm (CR) disturbances in the form of sleep pattern and hormonal rhythm disruption. These CR disturbances have been linked to alterations in the circadian expression patterns of circadian clock genes (ccgs) in various tissues, including the brain. Here, we investigate the dysregulation of 13 different ccgs across blood, brain, and peripheral tissue in an adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) animal model of depression to evaluate its efficacy for investigating CR disturbances. We found that ACTH treatment significantly affected ccg expression central and peripheral, but the nature and specific genes affected varied by tissue.image

AB  - The brown shrimp Penaeus aztecus Ives, 1891, a well-established alien species in the Mediterranean Sea, is here recorded from Croatia (central-northern Adriatic Sea) on the basis of 18 specimens found since November 2016. Such numbers triple the number of confirmed specimens known from the basin so far and testify its northern spreading in the Adriatic Sea. There are no certainties regarding possible pathway(s) of arrival of this species in the area. However, unaided dispersal from neighbouring countries constitutes the most probable one, although introduction through ballast water or deliberate introduction or escape from aquaculture facilities cannot be ruled out. All the specimens were captured while trawling on muddy substrates at depths ranging from 50 to 200 m, and were communicated to the authors of the present note by local fishermen. This confirms the importance of fishermen knowledge to detect the occurrence of non- indigenous megafauna in the Adriatic Sea as a complementary tool to proper scientific surveys.

AB  - Black-backed jackal Lupulella mesomelas consume fruits and their seeds, yet their seed dispersing ability is poorly understood. We extracted, identified and counted seeds from 150 jackal scat samples, and quantified the viability and germination capacity of ingested seeds, using tetrazolium viability tests and germination trials. We recovered 336 seeds of Grewia occidentalis, 1025 seeds of Pappea capensis, 362 seeds of Diospyros lycioides, 296 seeds of Vachellia karroo and 2 seeds of an unknown species from the scats. Seed viability and germination of three species tested (G. occidentalis, P. capensis and D. lycioides) were significantly lower than uningested seeds, but many seeds did survive ingestion by jackal and germinated successfully. Our study confirms that jackal do play a role in endozoochory and provides the first evidence of reduced germination of these dispersed seeds, broadening our understanding of the ecological role of this heavily persecuted mesopredator.

AB  - Airborne pathogens are the most important factor causing environmental issues on pig farms. Research on airborne swine-derived microbes has mainly concentrated on several specific microbes or pathogens. The present work was conducted to detect and identify the entire microbial community in piggery air and their dispersion by 16SrRNA sequencing. Fifteen faeces and eighty-four air samples were collected in swine barns and from different distances away from the barns, respectively. The results showed that the faeces and air share the most dominant bacteria. The top 10 genera belonged to Fimicutes, Proteobacteria and Bacteroidetes, and accounted for 54% and 76-84% of the total sequences. Moreover, great higher (P < 0.01) microbial diversity was detected in the faeces. This study indicated that a hygienic interval of 50 m should be set on swine farms to prevent the spreading infectious disease caused by airborne pathogens.

AB  - Dryland wheat farming commonly uses a rotation of wheat to fallow between years but growers have begun to diversify crop rotations for a variety of environmental and economic reasons. Ethiopian mustard (Brassica carinata A.) and camelina (Camelina sativa L.), two oil seed crops, can be successfully grown in the Northern Great Plains (NGP) and could be a suitable fallow replacement. Native bees have declined in abundance and richness primarily due to conversion of natural habitat to row crops and honey bees have become increasingly difficult to manage in recent years. Thus, it is important to determine how flower visiting insects utilize novel crops. We collected flower visiting insects via weekly sweep netting events during two growing seasons to determine abundance and richness of bees and other insect pollinators on B. carinata, C. sativa, and a ten species cover crop. Overall, numerous native bees and other flower visiting insects were collected off all three potential fallow replacements. These crops may provide important floral resources for bees and other pollinators and could be used to improve pollinator resources within cropping systems of the NGP.

AB  - This work aims to study the major salivary gland morphology of peccaries during their growth. The glands were analyzed using macroscopic description, light microscopy, electron microscopy, histochemistry, and immunohistochemistry. Topographically, the salivary glands resemble other animals, including domestic animals and pigs. During growth, the parotid enlarges and mandibular gland loses weight. Histologically, the parotid has serous production, and sublingual has mucous production, resembles most species, however, mandibular gland produces mucous, unlike other animals, including pigs, which produce seromucous secretion. Histochemically, parotid produces more acidic mucins than pigs and it undergoes maturation during development; mandibular, and especially the sublingual gland, produce more acidic and basic mucopolysaccharides than pigs. The results found with transmission and scanning electron microscopy techniques corroborate the histological and histochemistry findings. The major salivary glands were positive to different lecithins (Com-A, BSA-I-B4, WGA and PNA), which were also more positive than in pigs and sheep. We conclude that collared peccaries have a salivary secretion that facilitates the digestion of carbohydrates, and biometric characteristics and positivity to lecithins that facilitate adaptation to foods with antinutritional factors.

AB  - Mwanganda's Village (MGD) and Bruce (BRU) are two open-air site complexes in northern Malawi with deposits dating to between 15 and 58 thousand years ago (ka) and containing Middle Stone Age (MSA) lithic assemblages. The sites have been known since 1966 and 1965, respectively, but lacked chronometric and site formation data necessary for their interpretation. The area hosts a rich stone artifact record, eroding from and found within alluvial fan deposits exhibiting poor preservation of organic materials. Although this generally limits opportunities for site-based environmental reconstructions, MGD and BRU are located at the distal margins of the alluvial fan, where lacustrine lagoonal deposits were overprinted by a calcrete paleosol. This has created locally improved organic preservation and allowed us to obtain ecological data from pollen, phytoliths, and pedogenic carbonates, producing a regional-to site-scale environmental context for periods of site use and abandonment. Here, we integrate the ecological data into a detailed site formation history, based on field observations and micromorphology, supplemented by cathodoluminescence microscopy and mu-XRF. By comparing local, on-site environmental proxies with more regional indicators, we can better evaluate how MSA hunter-gatherers made decisions about the use of resources across the landscape. Our data indicate that while tree cover similar to modern miombo woodland and evergreen gallery forest prevailed at most times, MSA hunter-gatherers chose more locally open environments for activities that resulted in a lithic artifact record at multiple locations between 51 and 15 ka.(C) 2022 The Authors.

AB  - Advances in on-animal sensor technologies to monitor location and activity have enhanced the ability to study foraging decisions of free-ranging herbivores. Sensors monitoring jaw movements that quantify ingestive behaviours, such as the RumiWatch (RW) noseband sensor system, have primarily been used in indoor animal housing systems or structurally homogeneous, small pasture (paddock) environments. Continuously monitoring these ingestive behaviours in extensive and heterogeneous rangelands has not been previously conducted. We evaluated the accuracy of the RW noseband sensor system for two grazing seasons in 130-ha pastures (paddocks) composed of native, mixed-species plant communities in a semiarid environment. The noseband sensor was used to compare ingestive behavior at different sites and seasons characterized by varying sward complexity, stocking rate, and levels of forage limitation. We evaluated the noseband sensor against direct visual observations of yearling steers grazing with two different validation studies. First, the time duration of grazing recorded by the sensor was compared to direct visual observation data (Validation Study 1). A high correlation (r(s) = 0.95) for hourly grazing time resulted between the RW system and visual observations. Second, we examined the ability of the RW system to measure prehension bite rates in distinct plant communities varying in height and leaf angle (Validation Study 2). The accordance between direct observation and measurement by the RW system for bite rate improved from 2019 (Concordance Correlation Coefficient (CCC) = 0.71) to 2020 (CCC = 0.80) after modifications to improve the fit of the halter supporting the noseband sensor. Correlations between the sensor and visual observations increased by similar to 17 % with this modification for grazing bouts in mixed-species and midgrass-dominated swards; correlations remained similar to 10 % lower in shortgrass-dominated swards. Our results show that the RW system is an effective tool for monitoring free-ranging cattle grazing activity and quantifying bite rates in a heterogeneous rangeland ecosystem. Bite rate measurements are more accurate in swards with vertically oriented stems and leaves compared to lawn-like prostrate swards. Grazing bout length and rumination chew rate may represent behavioral indicators employed in managing animal performance in semiarid rangelands. Our validation study and experimental investigation indicate that the RW noseband sensor is a useful animal-borne sensor technology for research demanding sustained ingestion measurements across mixed-species forage communities.

AB  - To suppress friction fluctuations during the operation of a pipeline inspection gauge (PIG) and to avoid speed deviations, which may lead to poor detection accuracy and jamming, an adaptive backstepping controller with improved unscented Kalman filter (UKF) was proposed in this paper. Firstly, the friction model was derived, and based on this, the nonlinear dynamic model of PIG was established. Then, an adaptive backstepping controller was designed to estimate the dynamic parameters of the system and stabilize the operating velocity of the PIG by controlling the friction, and adaptive noise based UKF was applied to obtain more accurate feedback estimated signals to deal with the time-varying disturbances in the environment. An active control PIG prototype and a pipeline experimental platform was built, and experiments were conducted under various conditions. Under all conditions, compared to the uncontrolled system, the proposed control strategy can reduce the fluctuation range of friction values by more than 59%, reduce the velocity fluctuation range by more than 88%, and maintain the velocity control error within 4%. Compared to the other controllers, the proposed controller demonstrated better performance in terms of control precision and robustness, verifying the effectiveness and reliability of the proposed controller.

AB  - Purpose Fate factors, for freshwater eutrophication, represent the route of a limiting-nutrient, phosphorus or nitrogen, and their degradation in the environment. Their value may vary according to the location and emission season; that is, they are site and temporal dependent. In this study, phosphorus fate factors for the freshwater eutrophication impact category were estimated in a native scale of state hydrographic units (SHU), considering its variability and applied in a case study for one hydrographic basin in the state of Bahia, Brazil. Methods The fate model considered the phosphorus removal processes of advection, retention, and agricultural and domestic water use, based on national databases (Geonetwork, HidroWeb, SAR, and SNIS). Heat maps and correlation networks allowed the assessment of fate factors' spatiotemporal variability. The new generated fate factors were qualitatively and quantitatively assessed, then further applied in a case study of buffalo milk production at Leste SHU to determine the regionalization effects on the freshwater eutrophication potential impact. Results and discussion This study reconfirmed the spatial and temporal variability of the fate factors. The fate factor values found, in this study, for Pardo SHU are similar to those estimated with the non-regionalized data used by the adopted model, being within the range of 0 to 20 days. However, the fate factors for De Contas and, mainly, for Leste were underestimated, reaching a value up to five times higher, indicating that the model's proposed changes impacted the final result. The temporal differentiation was mainly determined by periods of higher and lower water availability. Advection processes inversely determined the fate factors, and the phosphorus removal by retention processes became more prominent when the water availability was lower. On the other hand, the role of phosphorus removal through water use was minimum. Water availability was the largest contributor to the sensitivity analysis, followed by the total freshwater volume. Conclusion The fate modeling adopted in this study, with the use of data from national databases and native resolution, gave a more precise and detailed analysis perspective of the phosphorus fate in Brazilian SHUs, setting up site- and temporal-specific fate factors. Besides, this study provides a further understanding of the fate factors establishment by analyzing their relationship with the respective input parameters and highlighting one of the used model's weaknesses: the estimation of phosphorus removals instead of phosphorus load underestimates the true freshwater eutrophication potential.

AB  - Over 5500 years ago, a sustainable and intensive millet-pig system emerged in northern China. This system, which included common millet (Panicum miliaceum), foxtail millet (Setaria italica), and domestic pig (Sus scrofa domesticus), played a crucial role in supporting the development of complex societies. Around 5000 years ago, the spread of these two millets to the Tibetan Plateau facilitated agriculturalization in the high-elevation river valley areas of the plateau (>2500 m above sea level). Previous studies tended to suggest that there were no domesticated pigs at the early settlements in high-elevation river valleys of the Tibetan Plateau, where subsistence strategies primarily relied on hunting wild animals and millet cultivation. Here, we report the earliest known domestic pigs identified through ancient DNA (aDNA) analysis of pig bones excavated from these high-elevation sites, dating back to approximately 4800-4100 years ago. Additionally, we conducted stable isotope analysis on pig and wild herbivore bone remains, as well as crop remains from the La Phob site. The delta C-13 and delta N-15 values provide clear evidence of intensive millet-pig agriculture, with pigs primarily consuming both common and foxtail millets, and their manure used for field fertilization. Our study demonstrates that by 4800 years ago, not only domestic pig and the two millets but also an intensive millet-pig system had spread to the high-elevation Tibetan Plateau, contributing to the early sedentary lifestyle of humans in these regions.

AB  - We surveyed occurrence and activity of large and medium-sized mammals on three experimental short-rotation coppice (SRC) and three afforestations by camera trapping. Both habitat types were surveyed simultaneously in spring. Additional wintertime surveys were performed on the SRC to consider seasonal aspects of habitat utilisation. In spring, SRC and afforestations were predominantly used by the same species. European hare (Lepus europaeus) and roe deer (Capreolus capreolus) were the most active species across all sites. Additionally, the European rabbit (Oryctolagus cuniculus) showed intense activity on one SRC site. Activity of carnivorous and omnivorous species was comparatively low in both habitat types, but even lower on the SRC. The only forest-associated species (European badger Meles meles), detected on all afforestations, was absent from the SRC. In winter, the surveyed SRC were used by the same species as in spring. Most species showed similar activity on the SRC in both seasons. We conclude that small-scale and structurally diverse SRC provide suitable habitat, in different seasons, especially for herbivorous mammals associated with farmland and forest-ecotones rather than forest species. The extent to which our results can be generalised to large-scale commercial SRC is unclear. However, the results indicate that SRC can be managed in a manner compatible with wildlife and may then have a habitat function for mammals comparable to that of young afforestations. Creation of within-plantation heterogeneity can be a suitable measure to improve habitat quality and should, therefore, be considered in the design and management of SRC.

AB  - The western Palaearctic species of the hawkmoth genus Hyles (Lepidoptera: Sphingidae) have long been the subject of molecular phylogenetic research. However, much less attention has been paid to the taxa inhabiting the central and eastern Palaearctic, particularly Central Asia, where almost 50% of the species diversity of the genus occurs. Yet, many taxonomic conundrums hinder a proper assessment of the true diversity in these moths. One still unresolved group of species includes Hyles hippophaes and Hyles chamyla. Despite a largely overlapping morphology and ecology, a plethora of infraspecific taxa display some unique divergent characters over a wide geographical area. In this study, we undertook a taxonomic assessment of each population and resolved this species complex using an integrative approach. A combination of new computational techniques (DAISY-II) in comparative morphology and recent advances in DNA extraction methods and sequencing of museum specimens (WISC) alongside more traditional genetic approaches allowed testing of the three main phenotypes-bienerti, chamyla and apocyni-in terms of their morphological, mitochondrial and biogeographical integrity, and to elucidate their evolutionary relationships. Our results support the existence of two closely related species, Hyles chamyla and H. hippophaes, but the former species H. apocyni (here discussed as the ecological form apocyni of H. chamyla) is best regarded as a hybrid between H. chamyla and H. h. bienerti. The results indicate that the evolutionary relationship between H. chamyla and H. hippophaes is one of admixture in the context of ongoing ecological differentiation, which has led to shared morphological characters and a blurring of the species boundaries. These results clarify the evolutionary relationships of this species complex and open future research lines, including the analysis of nuclear markers and denser sampling, particularly of H. hippophaes and H. vespertilio in western Europe.

AB  - Harpacticoida participate in important benthic processes but their specific interactions with other primary producers are still unknown. This study investigated Copepoda Harpacticoida's selectivity of diatoms and cyanobacteria and whether their microscale distribution is influenced by diatoms and cyanobacteria distribution. We conducted a laboratory controlled experiment, where diatoms and cyanobacteria and four Harpacticoid species (Cletocamptus cf. deitersi, Mesochra sp. Robertsonia mourei and Metis holothuriae) were isolated and cultivated from water and sediment samples collected in the midlittoral zone of the Santa Cruz Canal in Pernambuco, Northeast Brazil. The grazing experiment lasted 24 h. Concurrently, sediment samples were collected with 25 contiguous syringes (1.3cm2) at one centimeter depth to verify the microspatial relation in situ. We characterized the site through the levels of chlorophyll-a, phaeopigments, silt and clay percentage, organic matter percentage and salinity. We found that the species of Copepoda Harpacticoida from a mangrove area fed selectively on different diatoms and cyanobacteria species. Furthermore, our results also indicated that there was a very low overlap in the use of diatoms and cyanobacteria by these Harpacticoida species and that the size of diatoms and cyanobacteria seemed to partially influence their selectivity. For the set of nine diatoms for which there was strong or very strong evidence that the presence of harpacticoid animals decreased their densities due to herbivore-prey interactions, seven were grazed upon by a single harpacticoid species. Our field observational study demonstrates that the aggregated spatial pattern of diatom and cyanobacteria species explains, to a large extent, the spatial distribution of Copepoda Harpacticoida species in the estuarine mud flat. For all tested species, at least one of the diatoms and cyanobacteria selected as food in the laboratory was a significant predictor of harpacticoid species spatial distribution, showing the importance of species-specific relationships.

AB  - Digital technologies are becoming increasingly important in human engagements with the natural world. It has been suggested that digital games could contribute to the work of biodiversity conservation organisations, mediating human understanding of, and responses to, living nature. In this paper, we explore the implications of enrolling non-human nature into conservation gaming projects, focusing on the example of gamifying animal movement data. We discuss a simple experiment where people 'race' against animals in an exercise app, examining how wild animals are represented in digital games through digital technologies. We also explore how tracking technologies make animals digital, and how these digital animals can be central to gaming experiences. We consider what is involved in these transitions and enrolments of wild animals into gaming environments, and explore a series of issues that seem to us to deserve further thought and discussion: what humans can learn from games featuring non-human animals; whether games evoke empathy for the non-humans; whether games allow a human player to learn about the political ecology of landscapes within which wild animals exist; questions of ethics and power associated with the involuntary enrolment of animals into the gamification dynamic; the commodification involved in 'animal games'; and the carbon and other impacts of 'games for nature'. Digital games are a global phenomenon and a global industry. Their role in the lived experience of being human continues to expand. We suggest that there is value in conservationists and those who analyse and critique the political ecologies of conservation thinking further about digital games, digital animals and digital natures.

AB  - Successful restoration of Geochelone platynota to Dry Zone ecosystems in Myanmar depends on the survival of translocated tortoises and, therefore, a knowledge of predators and predation is important. We here report the loss of 28 and approximately 200 translocated G. platynota to Eurasian golden jackals (Canis aureus) and wild pigs (Sus scrofa), respectively, at Shwe Settaw Wildlife Sanctuary in central Myanmar. Measures to reduce the risk of future predation include structural reinforcement of acclimation pens to deter wild pigs and the experimental use of large cat (e.g., tiger [Panthera tigris] and leopard [Panthera pardus]) odors to repel jackals and wild pigs from the translocation area.

AB  - Clonal herbs form belowground organs where they store reserves and bear regenerative buds. Based on these characteristics, clonal herbs may deal with disturbances better than non-clonal herbs, and clonality is seen as an adaptive strategy in disturbed habitats. The advantage of being clonal is likely to be enhanced in stressful conditions where larger belowground storage is beneficial. We conducted a greenhouse experiment to examine the ability of young plants to deal with biomass removal when exposed to light or nutrient stress or its combination. Using congeneric pairs of species, we evaluated the ability of clonal versus non-clonal groups to cope with biomass removal in terms of mortality, biomass productivity, specific leaf area and root-to-shoot ratio. We found that clonal and non-clonal herbs produce the same amount of biomass when injured and that nutrient and light stress does not alter biomass production. Both groups responded similarly to the biomass removal by increasing the specific leaf area and root-to-shoot ratio. Very young clonal herbs had higher mortality than non-clonal herbs of the same age. This fact suggests a higher survival probability in the non-clonal group, presumably originating from a greater population dependence on generative reproduction. We conclude that belowground organs in young plants, and thus bud banks and belowground storage, are not yet formed enough to give clonal herbs an advantage over non-clonal ones, and the advantage of clonality might manifest later in life when belowground organs are fully developed.

AB  - Analyzing the influence of external shocks on the pricing dynamics of the live pig industry chain is essential for effective macroeconomic control. Utilizing monthly data spanning from January 2010 to August 2023, this study employs the TVP-SV-VAR (Time-Varying Parameter-Stochastic Volatility-Vector Autoregression) model to analyze the effects of EPU (Economic Policy Uncertainty) and INU (Live Pig Industry News Uncertainty) on industry pricing. The findings are as follows: Firstly, the impacts of EPU and INU on industry prices exhibit time variability and distinct characteristics. Specifically, the impact magnitude of EPU ranges between [-0.025, 0.025], and that of INU between [-0.01, 0.01]. These differences in impact magnitude elicit varied responses from manufacturers and consumers to the indices. Secondly, uncertainty shocks at particular time points show high consistency, suggesting a patterned influence of external shocks on industry pricing that aligns with historical trends. Thirdly, robustness tests with alternative explanatory variables confirm the reliability of the findings. An uncertainty index, crafted from more comprehensive information sources, more accurately captures the effects of external shocks on industry pricing. Additionally, the volume of live pig slaughters illustrates the potential interaction between external shocks and pricing dynamics. In an era marked by increasingly frequent external shocks, this research offers valuable insights for policymakers to implement macro-control and foster high-quality industrial development.

AB  - Environmental estrogens are currently a significant research topic, and poultry manure serves as a crucial source. This study investigated the degradation characteristics and effect mechanisms of six estrogens (E1, 17 alpha-E2, 17 beta-E2, E3, 17 alpha-EE2, and DES) during the aerobic composting of chicken manure. An orthogonal test comprising four factors (aeration rate, calcium-magnesium-phosphorus fertilizer (Ca-Mg-P fertilizer), coconut shell biochar, initial moisture content) and three levels of aerobic composting was conducted over a 45-day period to monitor the changes in estrogens and basic parameters. The results indicated that the factors influencing the estrogen degradation rate ranked as: initial moisture content (MC) > Ca-Mg-P fertilizer > aeration rate > coconut shell biochar. These factors significantly influenced the abundance of estrogen-degrading genera. Optimal composting conditions for estrogen degradation were identified as the addition of 10% coconut shell biochar, maintaining an initial moisture content of 60%, and using an aeration rate of 0.08 L min(-1)center dot kg(-1)DM (dry matter), with an average degradation rate of 86.88% for the six estrogens under these conditions. During the composting process under various treatments, five known estrogen-degrading genera were observed with high relative abundance (max 31.08%), and the predominant genera were Staphylococcus and Brachybacterium for 17 alpha-E2, 17 beta-E2, E3, 17 alpha-EE2, and DES, and Pusillimonas for E1. The composition of microbial community structure changed significantly, and the dominated environment factors effecting the composition and succession of these genera were carbon to nitrogen ratio (C/N) and MC. The research results can provide both a theoretical basis and practical reference for the effective degradation of estrogens during the composting of chicken manure.

AB  - Arthrospira (previously Spirulina) is a filamentous cyanobacterium used as a dietary supplement for humans and animals because of its high protein content and the production of various bioactive compounds. However, this "superfood" is unsuitable as a sole resource for Daphnia magna, possibly because it lacks essential biochemicals. We explored possible lipid limitation of D. magna feeding on A. platensis by supplementing with cholesterol and/or the long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA), eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA). Daphnids were reared on long-filament (untreated), or short-filament (fragmented) A. platensis supplemented with cholesterol- and/or EPA-containing liposomes. For comparison, daphnids were fed Chlamydomonas reinhardtii (standard algal food). D. magna reared on cholesterol-supplemented A. platensis survived throughout the study period, grew well, and produced eggs better than those grown on Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, whereas D. magna raised on A. platensis supplemented with EPA did not survive as long, demonstrating that sterol limitation is the primary factor explaining the inadequate quality of A. platensis as food for D. magna. The lipid analysis also showed that no sterol was detected in A. platensis, whereas ergosterol and fungisterol were found in C. reinhardtii. Supplementing A. platensis with both cholesterol and EPA enhanced growth and reproduction, implying that A. platensis also has dietary PUFA limitations, which is important once sterol requirements are met. Because sterol limitation has serious consequences on zooplankton life history performance, incorporating dietary lipid limitation as a potential barrier for energy and carbon flow is crucial to enhance our understanding of food web dynamics and ecosystem functioning.

AB  - In the context of climate change, increased temperature and decreased water availability are expected to have profound effects on plant-herbivore interactions. To gain further insight into this issue, this work focuses on the dissection of the response of the Arabidopsis thaliana plant to the mite pest Tetranychus urticae under environmental conditions that resemble climate change. Phenotypical and molecular changes were analyzed in plants grown under mild drought and/or warm temperatures. When the transcriptome results were compared in standard and altered climate conditions, a large number of genes were found to be differentially expressed. Mite infestations in these plants showed that basal alterations conditioned the subsequent response of the plant to a specific biotic stressor. Warm temperatures favored mite performance and decreased jasmonic acid accumulation. Reduced plant damage in mild drought conditions was correlated with a higher jasmonic acid accumulation and the up-regulation of many genes involved in the production of defensive compounds. In conclusion, the use of ambient conditions that resemble climate change highlighted the drastic alterations in gene expression that may occur in nature. Understanding how these changes affect specific plant-herbivore interactions is crucial to determining how global warming will affect crop production in the future.

AB  - Sub-clinical mastitis exhibits a higher prevalence in dairy goats than clinical mastitis, necessitating the adoption of non-invasive diagnostic techniques such as infrared thermography (IRT) to detect this economically significant production disease in the dairy sector. Accordingly, this study aims to employ IR imaging of the udder and teat quarters of lactating crossbred goats (Alpine x Beetal and Sanen x Beetal) across various seasons, utilising IRT, to discern cases of sub-clinical (SCM) and clinical mastitis (CM). Over a year, 100-110 lactating crossbred dairy goats underwent consistent IRT screenings, followed by a comprehensive evaluation of udder health status using the California mastitis test and somatic cell count (SCC). The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis was conducted to establish the cut-off values for different thermographic parameters in this study. The results revealed that the SCC increased significantly (p < 0.01) in healthy, SCM, and CM milk samples across the seasons. The analysis of ROC revealed a comparatively higher sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy for udder thermograms during SCM than CM and vice versa for teat thermograms. IRT analysis reflected a difference (p < 0.01) in the udder and teat thermograms among quarters of healthy, SCM, and CM in summer, winter, autumn, and rainy seasons. A significant increase (p < 0.01) in udder thermograms was observed for quarters affected with SCM and CM relative to healthy, with an increase of 1.89 and 2.94 degree celsius in winter, 0.85 and 1.63 degree celsius in summer, 0.73 and 1.41 degree celsius in rainy, and 1.33 and 2.38 degrees C in autumn, respectively. Similarly, for teat thermograms it was 1.79 and 2.81 degree celsius in winter, 0.76 and 1.41 degrees C in summer, 0.70 and 1.37degree celsius in rainy, and 1.09 and 1.93 degree celsius in autumn, respectively. Therefore, regardless of the seasons examined in this study, IRT proves to be an effective and supportive tool for early mastitis detection in lactating crossbred dairy goats.

AB  - The Grotte du Bison, in Arcy-sur-Cure (Yonne, France), yielded a large assemblage of 49 Neandertal remains from late Mousterian layers, offering critical insights for the study of Middle to Upper Paleolithic populations of Western Europe. Previous studies described the external morphology of 13 isolated teeth and a partial maxilla. Building on this previous work, the current study provides further descriptions and analyses of the remains, including one postcranial fragment, six cranial fragments, two maxillary fragments, and 40 isolated teeth. The dental remains are examined for a more detailed assessment of the metric and nonmetric variability of their external and internal morphologies. We focus our description on preservation, health status, and age at death, and we assess the minimum number of individuals. The dental variability is also compared to that of Middle and Upper Pleistocene hominins. Our results indicate that the collection represents at least nine to 17 individuals, comprising mostly children and adolescents. Five to seven pairings are identified based on shared dental traits, developmental criteria, such as perikymata and pitted hypoplasia, wear patterns, and taphonomic alterations. This collection exhibits characteristic Neandertal features, including occasionally markedly expressed traits (e.g., I1 and P3 ridging and tubercular expressions), as well as a homogenous expression of accessory structures (particularly for the molars). The highest morphological variability is observed on maxillary premolar roots, which display different stages of root fusion, mesially placed hypercementosis, and pulp cavity extension. This collection also reflects the morphological and behavioral diversity observed in the other Arcy-sur-Cure caves. (c) 2024 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Although many ecological studies recognize the importance of the three-dimensional complexity of the landscape, only a small number of investigations incorporate it into their methods. Through an empirical study we assess the extent to which habitat metric patterns vary measured by 3D versus 2D methods, and whether it is possible that variations are associated with scale, topographic complexity or specific animal behavior. We analyze areas and potential animals where the use of 3D approaches is most influential for reliable results in ecological studies. This study was carried out in southern Spain, focusing on game estates covering an area of about 2.241 km(2). The topographical features of the areas were obtained from a digital terrain model (DTM) and a scalable terrain model (STM) generated from Lidar data. The estates were categorized according to a preliminary 3D vs. 2D surface increment index (SI index). Then an experimental repeated measures design was carried out to compare three nested scales from 1 to 4 km square plots. The influence of plot topography on the SI index was analyzed statistically. Plots were also compared pair-wise through a post hoc comparison analysis. In order to establish how 3D affects the metrics of the trajectories travelled by different animal species, we simulated movements of Oryctolagus cunniculus, Cervus elaphus, Canis lupus and Lynx pardinus, which move and behave differently in the study area. We simulated 15 replicate paths per specie, assuming 24 fixes per path. Variations in animal trajectories were analyzed by fitting general linear models (GLMs), which also provide a basic method for estimating the potential errors produced by a simple 2D analysis. We obtained significant differences between the projected and geometric surface areas, with an increase of up to 11.15% and an increase in animal paths length up to 5% using 3D approaches. Landscape complexity, rather than species type, is related to animal path metrics differences. However, in species such as deer and lynx the 3D spatial component is basic for an accurate estimate of path length, especially in heterogeneous landscapes. Altitude and slope range are determining factors for considering the 3D approaches as advisable. Our results confirm that ecological studies ignoring threedimensional (3D) components run the risk of misinterpretation due to the fact that the bi-dimensional (2D) approach underestimates distances and landscape area. The use of 3D methods provides more accurate results than with 2D approaches, with far-reaching implications for a wiser wildlife management and conservation in Mediterranean ecosystems.& nbsp;

AB  - Catch-and-release (C&R) angling has grown in popularity due to increasing numbers of conservation-minded anglers and regulations of recreational fisheries. C&R is often assumed to cause low mortality but can cause physiological and physical impairment. Fish metabolism and temperature interact to play a critical role in the biological functioning of fish. Understanding the relationship between temperature, fish metabolism, and physiological impairment is important for effective fisheries management and conservation, particularly for C&R angling in a changing thermal environment. We used respirometry to quantify post-release metabolic stress and recovery of two popular Namibian angling species (Argyrosomus inodorus and A. coronus) subjected to simulated C&R angling across a range of temperatures. Metabolic stress and recovery time did not differ significantly between warm (A. coronus) and cold-water (A. inodorus) species at any test temperature. However, several specimens of both species failed to recover physiologically and physically after 10 hours, thereby indicating C&R-related impairment and potential for mortality. Given the predator-rich environment of coastal waters in Namibia, best C&R practices are needed to minimise post-release mortality.

AB  - <bold>Introduction:</bold> It is unclear whether plants and microorganisms achieve niche complementarity by taking up different inorganic nitrogen (N) forms to alleviate N competition, particularly in N-limited regions. <bold>Methods:</bold> This paper conducted a 15-day N-15 tracer study ((NH4NO3)-N-15 or (NH4NO3)-N-15) in situ to quantitatively calculate the uptake rates of plants and microorganisms in four stands (pure Hippophae rhamnoides L, pure Pinus tabuliformis Carri & egrave;re, mixed H. rhamnoides-P. tabuliformis, and Artemisia gmelinii Weber ex Stechm grassland) in the forest-grassland transition zone on the Loess Plateau during the growing season. Among them, H. rhamnoides and P. tabuliformis can associated with arbuscular mycorrhizal and ectomycorrhizal, respectively. <bold>Results:</bold> The results indicated that H. rhamnoides in the pure stand and A. gmelinii preferred to take up (NO3-)-N-15, whereas P. tabuliformis in the pure stand preferred (NH4+)-N-15. Compared to pure stands, mixed afforestation decreased the NH4+ and NO3- uptake rate of H. rhamnoides by 87% and 70%, respectively, but did not alter the N preference of plants. Plants and microorganisms differed in their N preferences in the pure stand, whereas this was not the case in the mixed stand. The proportional similarity index between H. rhamnoides and P. tabuliformis (0.90 +/- 0.01) was higher than that between plants and microorganisms in forest stands, except for P. tabuliformis and microorganisms in the mixed stand (0.90 +/- 0.02). <bold>Discussion:</bold> Those results indicated that niche complementarity by preferring different N forms can alleviate N competition. This study helped to gain a deeper understanding of the plasticity of N uptake patterns by plants and microorganisms in the forest-grassland transition zone, and provides theoretical support for vegetation restoration during the implementation of the Grain for Green program on the Loess Plateau.

AB  - Paddy straw can be an affordable alternative fiber source to feed sheep. Ensiling can preserve and improve the quality of paddy straw silage (PSS). A completely randomized experimental design was used to compare the effect of 3 different doses of indigenous probiotics inclusion at 0% (iProbiotic-0), 4% (iProbiotics-4) and 8% (iProbiotics-8) in PSS based diet on dry matter intake (DMI, g/head/day), average daily gain (ADG, g/head/day), total cholesterols (mg/dL), triglycerides (mg/dL), low-density lipoprotein (LDL, mg/dL), and high-density lipoprotein (HDL, mg/dL) in the blood of Priangan ewe lambs during 70 days feeding trial using 6 replicates (n = 6). The results showed that Probiotics-8 treatment increased (P < 0.05) total DMI, but it did not have any impact (P > 0.05) on ADG, blood cholesterols, triglycerides, LDL, and HDL values of the lambs. Increased DMI of lambs consuming iProbiotic-treated PSS is a sign that indigenous probiotics inclusion during PSS preparation increases the palatability of PSS. The PSS can be an alternative and more affordable fiber source for sheep feeding in high rice producing countries.

AB  - When emersed, intertidal seaweeds experience rapid changes in environmental conditions. On warm sunny days, seaweeds can desiccate soon after emersion. On rainy days or in areas with freshwater inputs, they may experience rapid drops in salinity. To determine whether one low tide's exposure to environmental stress alters seaweed growth, palatability to herbivores, and dimethylsulfoniopropionate (DMSP) concentrations, we exposed Ulva fenestrata to desiccation and hyposaline conditions for 3 h in summer and winter. Two days later, summer desiccation decreased growth, consumption by Lacuna vincta, and DMSP by 71%, 83%, and 67%, relative to controls. Winter desiccation reduced DMSP by 19% and did not affect growth or L. vincta feeding. Summer hyposaline conditions increased growth by 75% but did not affect L. vincta grazing or DMSP, whereas winter hyposaline conditions reduced growth by 37%. After 2 days of exposure to L. vincta, seaweeds were allowed to recover for 7 days, then DMSP was measured. U. fenestrata desiccated in the summer did not survive. Average DMSP concentrations were 127% higher in grazed than ungrazed seaweed in the summer salinity experiment, providing evidence that grazing induces DMSP. No DMSP induction occurred in winter, possibly because grazing rates were much lower. In a follow-up summer desiccation experiment, maximum quantum yields (MQYs) and DMSP decreased to 12% and 14% of controls within an hour. After 7 days, MQY and DMSP concentrations recovered, but growth was 81-97% lower in seaweeds desiccated for 30-60 min, relative to controls. These results provide the first evidence for grazer-induced DMSP increases.

AB  - This investigation explores the corrosion behaviour of Ni alloy (UNS718), which is a potential material for storing biodiesel and making engine components. The study also examines the connection between Ni alloy corrosion and biodiesel degradation. Immersion tests were conducted using in-house biodiesels to evaluate the corrosion rates of Used Cooking Oil (UCOB), Karanja oil (KOB), and Jatropha oil (JOB) biodiesels on Ni alloy (UNS718). The results highlighted the role of corrosion product morphology and the formation of corrosion- driven pitting, cracks, etc., on Ni alloy when exposed to different biodiesels such as KOB, JOB, and UCOB. The study utilized gravimetric techniques to measure the corrosion rate and advanced analytical tools such as FESEM, EDS, XPS, NMR and XRF. It revealed decreased corrosion rates of Ni alloys with prolonged biodiesel immersion. For example, after 2160 h, Jatropha biodiesel exhibited a corrosion rate of 0.000699 mm/year, while the corrosion rates of Ni alloy exposed to UCOB and KOB were 0.001398 mm/year and 0.001048 mm/year, respectively. The study also suggests a detailed mechanism of Ni alloy corrosion when exposed to different biodiesels such as Karanja, Jatropha, and Used Cooking Oil.

AB  - The study was investigated the influence of pyrolysis conditions on the yield and nutrient properties of yak dung-based biochar and its potential of agro-environmental applications. A series of biochars were made by hydrothermal carbonization (HTC) under the different atmospheres, such as Nitrogen (N-2) and carbon dioxide (CO2), processing temperatures (200-300 degrees C) and residence times (1-2 h). The results showed the yield of yak dung-based biochar ranges from 35.33 wt% to 58.29 wt%. The concentration of nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P) and potassium (K) in biochar varied from 28.18 mg center dot g(-1) to 15.54 mg center dot g(-1), 16.23 mg center dot g(-1) to 25.31 mg center dot g(-1) and 0.59 mg center dot g(-1) to 1.02 mg center dot g(-1), respectively. And the contents of micronutrients Zn and Fe varied from 4.6 mg center dot g(-1) to 17.42 mg center dot g(-1), and 15.28 mg center dot g(-1) to 29.22 mg center dot g(-1), respectively. The yield, total carbon (C), N, hydrogen (H) and oxygen (O) content of biochar decreased with increasing processing temperature, while the total P and K content, pH and Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) surface area increased; moreover, the P and K content of biochar produced in N-2 increased more compared with CO2. The heavy metal contents of copper (Cu), cadmium (Cd), chromium (Cr), platinum (Pb) and arsenic (As) all were lower in yak dung-based biochar compare with other manures or sewage sludge-based biochar. Biochar produced in N-2 had higher nutrient content indicating the potential of application for fertilizer compared with it in CO2; while the biochar produced in CO2 with larger surface area characteristic and more abundant functional groups showing higher potential of application for the soil amendments and nutrient control materials. Our study provides some new insights for biochar production according to its application.

AB  - An anti-predator strategy increases the fitness of the prey itself, in which vigilance behavior plays an important role. Numerous studies have explored the correlation between prey age and the level of vigilance towards an approaching predator. However, limited studies have delved into the development of vigilant behaviors, much less the vigilant decision-chains. Chinese water deer (Hydropotes inermis), an extremely timid and sensitive animal capable of independent movement at birth, exhibits changes in vigilance strategy from newborn to the end of suckling period. Through individual recognition and standardized flight initiation trial, we measured the distances between the approaching predator and the occurrence of various vigilance behaviors (stare, flight, roaring, stretching neck, vigilant stomping). Our results reveal that Chinese water deer exhibited the vigilant strategy of roaring in the early stage (<3 weeks), and stretching neck and vigilant stomping in the late stage (>= 10 weeks), displaying an overall trend of increasing complexity. The vigilant decision-chains of the fawns become more diverse with age. Fawns prioritize their own intrinsic status when making flight decisions under the same threat, with age, birth weight, and pre-flight behaviors emerging as the dominant determinants. Overall, our findings indicate that suckling fawns of Chinese water deer adopt different vigilance behavioral strategies with their development and depending on their age, birth weight and pre-flight behaviors when faced with a threat.

AB  - The vertebrate assemblage recovered from the Toropi/Yupoi Formation (Late Pleistocene) in the Arroyo Toropi area, Bella Vista (Corrientes Province, Argentina), has been subjected to taphonomic evaluation. The fossil-bearing levels have been dated to similar to 53 ka (MIS 3) based on Optically Stimulated Luminescence dating. This assemblage primarily comprises mammal remains, with a notable prevalence of herbivorous megamammals. Also, reptiles and birds have been documented. Sedimentological analysis suggests that the skeletal remains were preserved within a floodplain environment influenced by the dynamics of the adjacent fluvial system, and taphonomic features observed in the assemblage support this interpretation. The assemblage resulted from the deposition of disarticulated mammal remains and local dispersion over a relatively short period. Rapid burial is evident, but several processes such as weathering and breakage have contributed to the observed patterns. The loss of several skeletal elements within the assemblage may be attributed to sporadic water flows occurring on the floodplain. During the post-burial stage, the specimens were affected by diagenetic processes, including filling, impregnation, deformation and breakage. In summary, the taphonomic evaluation of the Toropi/Yupoi Formation offers valuable comparison with other fossil fluvial assemblages. This research contributes to our understanding of the processes and environmental conditions that shaped this Late Pleistocene ecosystem.

AB  - Human-wildlife conflict (HWC) is an escalating humanitarian issue and a conservation concern. In terms of protection and management, areas at high risk of HWC are not necessarily afforded the same resources as areas prioritized for protection. To improve allocation of limited protection resources and HWC mitigation efficiency, we determined management priorities based on HWC risk and people's attitudes toward wildlife around the Giant Panda National Park. We constructed an ensemble species distribution model with 1959 species' distribution loci and 337 conflict event records. This model was used to simulate the spatial distribution patterns of HWC risk and to evaluate the influence of diverse environmental factors. A survey of people's attitudes toward wildlife was conducted in 155 villages around the Giant Panda National Park. Priority areas for HWC management were concentrated near protected areas, where wildlife habitats and populations were recovering and expanding. We obtained 947 questionnaires, which showed that some residents were highly aware of conservation and had a high tolerance for wildlife, even when they were living in areas at high risk of HWC. However, people who had encountered conflicts with wild boar were more likely to have negative attitudes toward other wildlife, even giant pandas (Ailuropoda melanoleuca). Thus, HWC may lead to the generalization of negative attitudes toward wildlife conservation. In our study area, environmental (e.g., building fences and changing crop types) and social measures (e.g., insurance and ecocompensation) have been implemented to mitigate HWC. Our results can provide an important basis for the allocation of compensation resources and improvement of HWC management in areas of high conservation priority. Future studies should further explore how to develop more personalized HWC management plans based on the characteristics of different regions.

AB  - Virtually all plants employ direct and indirect defenses against herbivores. While it is known that plant defenses can be affected by belowground symbiotic microbes under controlled conditions, studies showing these multitrophic interactions in nature are surprisingly scarce. Here we tested for effects of rhizobia on insect attraction and direct defense (cyanogenesis) in wild lima bean (Phaseolus lunatus) plants in Costa Rica. We performed bioassays with rhizobia-inoculated (R+) and rhizobia-free (R-) potted plants distributed among native lima bean communities at two spatially separated field sites (450 km apart) and in two field seasons. Without affecting overall plant size, rhizobia altered leaf chemistry (cyanogenesis and soluble leaf nitrogen) and ultimately insect communities visiting the plants. Natural herbivorous chrysomelid beetles were strongly attracted to R + plants, while natural enemies, ants and parasitoid wasps, preferred R- plants resulting in a particularly high herbivore:carnivore ratio on R + plants. This suggests that symbiotic microbes mediate trophic interactions by influencing both direct and indirect plant defenses against herbivores. Our results show that rhizobia affect the plant defensive phenotype and have cascading effects on plant-insect interactions in nature.

AB  - Anthelmintic resistance (AR) in gastrointestinal nematodes is a growing global concern that threatens effective parasite control in livestock farming. This study aimed to assess gastrointestinal nematode (GIN) control practices and identify risk factors associated with AR development on Lithuanian sheep farms. A cross-sectional survey was conducted between 2022 and 2023 among 71 members of the Lithuanian Sheep Breeders Association, covering farm management, grazing, and deworming practices. Anthelmintics were used by 90.2% of farmers, with most treating their flocks twice a year. Only 18.3% of farmers performed parasitological testing to guide treatments, with significantly more organic farms applying this approach than traditional farms. Treatment frequencies were significantly higher in traditional farms. Most farmers (45.1%) relied on the visual appraisal of sheep weight for dosing, while 35.2% dosed according to the weight of a medium-sized animal. Macrocyclic lactones were the most commonly used anthelmintics (50.7%). Quarantine procedures for new animals were implemented by less than half of the farmers (44.4%), while others treated without isolation (56.6%). These findings indicate reliance on non-strategic parasite control methods and limited use of diagnostics, highlighting the need for improved farmer education to promote sustainable parasite control and reduce AR risk in Lithuanian sheep farms.

AB  - Premise Plant responses to herbivores and their elicitors include changes in traits associated with phenology, defense, and reproduction. Induced responses by chewing herbivores are known to be hormonally mediated by the jasmonate pathway and can cascade and affect late-season seed predators and pollinators. Moreover, herbivore-induced plant responses can be transmitted to the next generation. Whether herbivore-induced transgenerational effects also apply to phenological traits is less well understood. Methods Here, we explored responses of wild lima bean plants (Phaseolus lunatus) to herbivory and jasmonate treatment and possible transgenerational effects of herbivore-induced early flowering. In a controlled field experiment, we exposed lima bean plants to herbivory by leaf beetles or methyl jasmonate sprays (MJ). We then compared plant development, phenology, reproductive fitness and seed traits among these treatments and undamaged, untreated control plants. Results We found that MJ and leaf herbivory induced similar responses, with treated plants growing less, flowering earlier, and producing fewer seeds than undamaged plants. However, seed size, phenolics and cyanogenic glycosides concentrations did not differ among treatments. Seed germination rates and flowering time of the offspring were similar among maternal treatments. Conclusions Overall, the results confirm that responses of lima bean to herbivory by leaf beetles are mediated by jasmonate; however, effects on phenological traits are not transmitted to the next generation. We discuss why transgenerational effects of herbivory might be restricted to traits that directly target herbivores.

AB  - This study selected sheep as an animal model for domestic and wildlife ruminants to collect and identify arthropods of forensic importance. Two adult Merino sheep were humanely killed (each in cold and warmseason) atUkulinga Research andTraining Farmof the University of KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa. Five decomposition stages were observed as fresh, bloated, active, advanced and dry stages. Calliphoridae, Muscidae and Sarcophagidae flies comprising of Chrysomya marginalis (Wiedemann), Ch. putoria (Wiedemann), Ch. albiceps (Wiedemann), Ch. chloropyga (Wiedemann.), Lucilia cuprina (Wiedemann), Musca domestica (Walker) and Sarcophaga calcifera (Boettcher) were recorded. Colonisation by coleopterans during the warm season started as early as the fresh stage with Dermestes maculatus (De Geer), Thanatophilus micans (Fabricius) and Onthophagus crassicollis (Boucomont), whilst the same species were collected from the bloated stage in the cold season. Chrysomya marginalis, M. domestica, D. maculatus, T. micans andO. crassicollis persisted on the carcass throughout the five stages of decomposition during the warm season. Results from this study generated important information on the endemic arthropod species that are attracted to sheep carcass during the warm and cold season in a locality of the KwaZulu-Natal province and their succession pattern can be further investigated as potential indicator species in estimating the post-mortem interval in this locality.

AB  - Sheep wool (SW) serves as a slow-release organic fertilizer, and its effectiveness can be enhanced through alkaline hydrolysis to break down keratin. The resulting keratin hydrolysate can support plant growth and improve mineral nutrition. Keratin hydrolysate obtained from sheep wool via the alkaline hydrolysis method was applied to lettuce, spinach, and radish plants at levels of 0, 0.5, 1.0, 1.5, 2.0, and 3.0 mL kg- 1. Before starting the experiment, the molecular and chemical structure of sheep wool hydrolysate (SWH) was determined using Scanning Electron Microscopy, Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy and Raman Spectroscopy. At the end of the study, the effects of SWH on plant growth and mineral nutrition were determined. Based on the experimental results, several amino acids, including alanine, glycine, tryptophan, valine, and methionine, were identified in the composition of the hydrolysate. Treatments with SWH significantly enhanced the growth of lettuce, spinach, and radish plants. Furthermore, these treatments led to a notable increase in the total nitrogen (N) concentration in the plants. Specifically, the calcium (Ca), magnesium (Mg), and iron (Fe) concentrations significantly increased in both lettuce and spinach. Additionally, SWH treatments elevated the zinc (Zn) concentration in radish tubers and the manganese concentration in lettuce plants. The copper (Cu) concentration in the plants also rose significantly following SWH treatments. The use of keratin hydrolysate derived from SW through the alkaline hydrolysis method demonstrates its potential to promote plant growth, emphasizing its significance in waste recovery and its transformation into a valuable resource.

AB  - This study explores the chemical diversity of plant metabolites in different organs of black poplar (Populus nigra), a tree species of considerable ecological and economic importance, to broaden our knowledge of organs other than leaves, especially with regard to herbivore-induced changes. Targeted and non-targeted metabolite analyses were used to investigate the defence responses of black poplar organs, including leaves, wood, bark, and roots, to aboveground feeding damage by caterpillars of the generalist herbivore Lymantria dispar. The research revealed that metabolic responses to herbivory are organ-specific, with a large increase in unique features upon insect damage. Herbivory led to more significant changes in central (primary) metabolites than the targeted specialized (secondary) metabolites measured. The study concludes that understanding the complexity of organ-specific metabolism in black poplar can be very useful for investigating plant-herbivore interactions in this tree species.

AB  - Climate changes affect all agricultural production systems, directly or indirectly, including that of ruminant meat, through the limitation of forage resources sensitive to reduced water regimes and drought. The present paper assessed the economic sustainability of ruminant meat production in the context of climate change, with a particular focus on integrating bioeconomy principles through the use of drought-resistant crops such as sorghum and millet in livestock feed. This study included scenarios for two farm-level models, a sheep fattening farm and a cattle fattening farm, to determine the economic benefit and impact of integrating resilient crops in the total feed ration. The findings showed that the dry scenario system could offer economic and environmental advantages over traditional water-intensive crops like maize. The results demonstrated that replacing maize with sorghum or millet could result in a reduction in feed costs and enhanced economic benefit over the traditional feed system.

AB  - Every week, 1-2 breeds of farm animals, including local cattle, disappear in the world. As the keepers of rare allelic variants, native breeds potentially expand the range of genetic solutions to possible problems of the future, which means that the study of the genetic structure of these breeds is an urgent task. Providing nomadic herders with valuable resources necessary for life, domestic yaks have also become an important object of study. In order to determine the population genetic characteristics, and clarify the phylogenetic relationships of modern representatives of 155 cattle populations from different regions of the world, we collected a large set of STR data (10,250 individuals), including unique native cattle, 12 yak populations from Russia, Mongolia and Kyrgyzstan, as well as zebu breeds. Estimation of main population genetic parameters, phylogenetic analysis, principal component analysis and Bayesian cluster analysis allowed us to refine genetic structure and provided insights in relationships of native populations, transboundary breeds and populations of domestic yak. Our results can find practical application in conservation programs of endangered breeds, as well as become the basis for future fundamental research.

AB  - Cattle-yak, a hybrid of yak and cattle, exhibits significant heterosis but male infertility, hindering heterosis fixation. Although extensive research has been conducted on transcriptional mechanisms in the testes of cattle-yak, the understanding of their translational landscape remains limited. In this study, we characterized the translational landscape of yak and cattle-yak based on Ribo-seq technology integrated with RNA-seq data. The results revealed that gene expression was not fully concordant between transcriptional and translational levels, whereas cattle-yak testes exhibited a stronger correlation across these two regulatory layers. Notably, genes that were differentially expressed at the translational level only (MEIOB, MEI1, and SMC1B) were mainly involved in meiosis. A total of 4,236 genes with different translation efficiencies (TEs) were identified, and the TEs of most of the genes gradually decreased as the mRNA expression level increased. Further research revealed that genes with higher TE had a shorter coding sequence (CDS) length, lower GC content, and higher normalized minimum free energy in the testes of yaks, but this characteristic was not found in cattle-yaks. We also identified upstream open reading frames (uORFs) in yak and cattle-yak testes, and the sequence characteristics of translated uORFs and untranslated uORFs were markedly different. In addition, we identified several short polypeptides that may play potential roles in spermatogenesis. In summary, our study uncovers distinct translational dysregulations in cattle-yak testes, particularly affecting meiosis, which provides novel insights into the mechanisms of spermatogenesis and male infertility in hybrids.

AB  - The open nucleus breeding system (ONBS) has been widely employed in livestock breeding and has demonstrated a desirable genetic gain compared to the traditional closed nucleus breeding system (CNBS). However, no related study and application for ONBS exist on aquatic animal breeding. The present investigation simulates the family-based ONBS with different proportions of introduced multiplier individuals used as parents of the nucleus population (NP) and CNBS schemes for the harvest body weight of the Pacific white shrimp (Litopenaeus vannamei). The multiplier population (MP) comprised progenies from eight families with high estimated breeding value (EBV) or genomic EBV (GEBV) of NP of the previous generation. ONBS was assigned three proportions (10%, 30%, and 50%) of the introduced MP individuals. The short-term selection (G0 to G10) and long-term selection (G0 to G20) were performed for CNBS and ONBS schemes using pedigree-based best linear unbiased prediction (PBLUP) with the A relationship matrix from the pedigree or single-step genomic BLUP (ssGBLUP) with the H relationship matrix integrating SNP markers and pedigree. The genetic gain of body weight and inbreeding coefficient of NP for eight breeding schemes with CNBS_PBLUP (CP), CNBS_ssGLUP (CS), ONBS_PBLUP (OP10, OP30, OP50), and ONBS_ssGBLUP (OS10, OS30, OS50) with three proportions of the introduced MP individuals were calculated. Compared to CP, genetic gains for the three OP schemes increased by 7.68 to 11.27% after short-term selection, and by 2.51 to 5.79% after long-term selection. In comparison to CS, genetic gains for the three OS schemes increased by 8.21 to 8.96% after short-term selection, and from 4.46 to 5.87% after long-term selection. The ONBS schemes achieved higher genetic gains than the corresponding CNBS schemes whether using genomic or pedigree information. The advantage of ONBS over CNBS is reduced after long-term selection. Genetic gains for the three OS schemes increased by 9.77 to 14.06% after long-term selection compared with the corresponding OP schemes. Furthermore, no significant difference (P > 0.05) in genetic gain was revealed among the ONBS schemes after either pedigree-based or genomic selection. Inbreeding coefficients for the three OP schemes increased from 59.45 to 70.98% compared with CP, whereas inbreeding coefficients for the three OS schemes increased from 24.72 to 32.22% compared with CS. Besides, after long-term selection, inbreeding coefficients for the three OS schemes decreased from 13.13 to 14.79% compared with the corresponding OP schemes. In a nutshell, ONBS using introduced MP individuals has great promise in the selective breeding program of L. vannamei. Genomic information has more potential to improve selection response and control inbreeding level than pedigree information when applying ONBS.

AB  - Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) are considered biofertilizers for sustainable agriculture due to their ability to facilitate plant uptake of important mineral elements, such as nitrogen (N). However, plant mycorrhiza-dependent N uptake and interplant transfer may be highly context-dependent, and whether it is affected by aboveground herbivory remains largely unknown. Here, we used N-15 labeling and tracking to examine the effect of aboveground insect herbivory by Spodoptera frugiperda on mycorrhiza-dependent N uptake in maize (Zea mays L.). To minimize consumption differences and N-15 loss due to insect chewing, insect herbivory was simulated by mechanical wounding and oral secretion of S. frugiperda larvae. Inoculation with Rhizophagus irregularis (Rir) significantly improved maize growth, and N/P uptake. The N-15 labeling experiment showed that maize plants absorbed N from soils via the extraradical mycelium of mycorrhizal fungi and from neighboring plants transferred by common mycorrhizal networks (CMNs). Simulated aboveground leaf herbivory did not affect mycorrhiza-mediated N acquisition from soil. However, CMN-mediated N transfer from neighboring plants was blocked by leaf simulated herbivory. Our findings suggest that aboveground herbivory inhibits CMN-mediated N transfer between plants but does not affect N acquisition from soil solutions via extraradical mycorrhizal mycelium.

AB  - We have analyzed DNA microsatellites and the mitochondrial control region in reindeer from 31 different husbandry areas in Norway, Sweden, and Finland in order to better understand the processes that underlie the genetic variability of the Nordic domestic herds. The distinct differentiation found in the nuclear markers but less so in the mitochondrial marker gives evidence of an origin from a common ancestral population which later evolved into the two main gene pools characterizing the nuclear genomes of domestic reindeer in Finland and most of Sweden and Norway. Analyses of temporal trends in effective population size give evidence of a rapid increase in number of reindeer before the population growth associated with the pastoral transition. This implies that the ancestry of contemporary domestic reindeer lay among a rapidly growing wild population possibly located in the boreal areas of eastern Fennoscandia or European Russia. The evolution of reindeer husbandry in Finland, perhaps with input from European Russia, which later spread to northern Norway could explain the shared genomic pattern observed in these areas today. The structured selection of productive female-centered herds may explain the genetic structure in other parts of Norway and in Sweden. The further substructuring of the Swedish/ Norwegian gene pool appears to follow the traditional language borders with the South Sami language dominating the southern and the Central Sami language in the more northern genetic subclusters. This suggests that traditional knowledge, cultural identities, and herd migrations have contributed to shape the genetic structure seen today. Ecological gradients are more pronounced within as compared to between the genetic clusters, giving further evidence that historical and social-cultural processes are important drivers for the genetic differentiations found in domestic reindeer across the Nordic countries.

   Animal landraces are historic local breeds often characterized by low production levels, so that their economic sustainability is often threatened and the risk of extinction is high. In Basilicata, southern Italy, a sheep landrace jeopardized of extinction is Gentile di Puglia. Thus, the study aimed at investigating the feasibility of a possible conservation strategy for such landrace based on the innovative use of its wool for the production of quality garments, so as to give new value to wool and allow further income to farmers. The results highlighted a possible good demand for such products, so as to reduce the difference in gross margin between Gentile di Puglia and the standardized intensively-farmed Comisana, from 57% to 3%. Such economic performance could be further improved by widening the set of fashion wool garments produced, so as to make the Gentile di Puglia even more preferable than other high-production breeds.
   In Basilicata, southern Italy, a sheep landrace jeopardized of extinction is Gentile di Puglia due to low production levels, low market values of milk and meat, and replacement of wool with synthetic fibers. Due to these dynamics farmers progressively resort to intensive breeding systems, hence causing the gradual disappearance of the ovine sector, the withering of traditional breeding culture and the abandonment of internal and marginal territories. However, in changing climate, traditional agriculture is getting increased attention worldwide by the consumers who are embracing emerging sustainable food production. Thus, in the light of a possible conservation strategy, the study investigates the prospective market for a garment (pullover) produced with wool from Gentile di Puglia, and woven through traditional techniques. An integrated methodological approach based on choice experiments and Bass diffusion model was carried out in order to analyze the consumers' preferences, the penetration market of this innovative product and the new wool value for farmers. The results pointed out a potential demand focused on women aged 50 years and more and a recognized wool value to farmers of 55 euro animal(-1) (22 euro kg(-1)). This new revenue could allow the reduction of the difference in gross margin between the Gentile di Puglia and the non-autochthonous intensively-farmed Comisana from 57% to 3%. The production of further wool garments for a wider demand could increase the economic sustainability of Gentile di Puglia, making it even more preferable than other highly productive breeds.

AB  - Anthropogenic foods such as agricultural crops have potential to give large impacts on wildlife populations. However, few studies have addressed the impact of anthropogenic food consumption on the individual performance and then population of long-lived mammals such as large herbivores. In this study, we investigated the effect of agricultural crop consumption on the physical characteristics and reproductive performances of sika deer (Cervus nippon) in central Japan. To investigate the relative dietary contribution of agricultural crops for each individual, we performed nitrogen stable isotope analysis of bone collagen. Our results suggest that nitrogen stable isotope ratios (delta N-15) could be used as an index of the relative dietary contribution of agricultural crops. The delta N-15 value of agricultural crops was much higher than that of wild plants and that of bone collagen varied widely among individuals. Deer <= 4 yr old that were more likely to consume agricultural crops tended to be larger and have a higher reproductive rate. In contrast, body size and reproductive rate did not vary according to the relative dietary contribution of agricultural crops in individuals >= 5 yr old. These results indicate that consumption of anthropogenic foods can induce precocious maturity in younger individuals by improving their physical characteristics and reproductive performance. Agricultural crop consumption is therefore likely to be an important factor in the population dynamics of large herbivores living in agricultural landscapes.

AB  - The discovery of the Aleurocanthus cf. Aleurocanthus spiniferus (Tea spiny whitefly spiniferus morphotype; previously found in Tokyo) for the first time in Shizuoka Prefecture raised the possibility that this species had invaded Honshu Island, Japan. Unlike the allied species, Aleurocanthus spiniferus and A. camelliae, which have been intercepted from China to Japan, the origin of the current species remains unclear. Despite the status of this species as a minor pest on the ornamental plant, Eurya japonica, the cryptic diversity among the black spiny whitefly is fascinating to be elucidated, specifically how the primary endosymbiont of whiteflies, Portiera aleyrodidarum, coevolved and contributed to the classification of whiteflies. The current study examines the taxonomic status of five species of whiteflies, i.e., A. spiniferus (Quaintance), Aleurocanthus aff. A. camelliae, Aleurocanthus cf. A. spiniferus, A. camelliae Kanmiya and Kasai, Aleurotrachelus camelliae Kuwana, and A. ishigakiensis Takahashi. Using consortium molecular typing targeting mitochondrial DNA (COI and 16S of mitoribosome), the nuclear gene (ITS1), and the ribosomal gene of Portiera, the phylogenetic clustering analysis has been conducted and revealed that the genus Aleurotrachelus sensu lato was clustered together with Aleurocanthini Takahashi, 1954 stat. rev. and reinstated Crenidorsum ishigakiensis comb. nov. due to crescent-shaped scallops being clearly defined. The current study also unveiled several putative species in the A. spiniferus species complex, molecularly. In addition, the recombination event was not detected in Portiera but has been detected in the mtCOI genes of the A. spiniferus cryptic species and the A. woglumi sequences deposited in the NCBI database. The mitochondrial recombination gives an insight into the speciation process among this species complex.

AB  - Intact tropical forests are generally considered to be resistant to invasions by exotic species, although the shrub Clidemia hirta (Melastomataceae) is highly invasive in tropical forests outside its native range. Release from natural enemies (e.g., herbivores and pathogens) contributes to C. hirta invasion success where native melastomes are absent, and here we examine the role of enemies when C. hirta co-occurs with native Melastomataceae species and associated herbivores and pathogens. We study 21 forest sites within agricultural landscapes in Sabah, Malaysian Borneo, recording herbivory rates in C. hirta and related native Melastoma spp. plants along two 100-m transects per site that varied in canopy cover. Overall, we found evidence of enemy release; C. hirta had significantly lower herbivory (median occurrence of herbivory per plant = 79% of leaves per plant; median intensity of herbivory per leaf = 6% of leaf area) than native melastomes (93% and 20%, respectively). Herbivory on C. hirta increased when closer to native Melastoma plants with high herbivory damage, and in more shaded locations, and was associated with fewer reproductive organs on C. hirta. This suggests host-sharing by specialist Melastomataceae herbivores is occurring and may explain why invasion success of C. hirta is lower on Borneo than at locations without related native species present. Thus, natural enemy populations may provide a "biological control service" to suppress invasions of exotic species (i.e., biotic resistance). However, lower herbivory pressures in more open canopy locations may make highly degraded forests within these landscapes more susceptible to invasion.Abstract in Malay is available with online material.

AB  - Coexistence with large carnivores represents one of the world's highest profile conservation challenges. Ecologists have identified ecological benefits derived from large carnivores (and large herbivores), yet livestock depredation, perceived competition for shared game, risks to pets and humans, and social conflicts often lead to demands for reduction of predator numbers from a range of stakeholder groups. Nearly 100 years ago, Vito Volterra predicted that increased mortality on both prey and predators results in increased abundance of prey and decreased abundance of predators. This principle appears to be robust and often consistent with the objectives of wildlife management. Although seldom recognized, and rarely tested in the field, the Volterra principle is a fundamental outcome of ecological theory with important implications for conservation.

AB  - The establishment of gut microbiota in young ruminants has a profound impact on their productive performance in adulthood. The microbial communities of ruminants differ significantly across the different regions of the digestive tract, as well as between the mucosa and lumen. In this study, we analyzed the characteristics of the microbiota of the small intestine (jejunum and ileum) and large intestine (cecum and colon) of sika deer on day 1 (birth), day 42 (transition period) and day 70 (rumination period) using 16S rRNA gene sequencing. The results showed that the microbial diversity of the mucosa in the jejunum, ileum, cecum and colon of sika deer was higher on day 70 than on day 1, and the diversity of the cecal mucosa was significantly higher than that in the small intestine. Principal coordinates analysis (PCoA) showed that the microbial community structures of the small and large intestinal mucosa were significantly different, and the microbial community structure of sika deer on day 1 was significantly different from that on days 42 and 70. The relative abundances of Methylobacterium-Methylorubrum, Pelagibacterium, Acinetobacter and Staphylococcus were higher in the small intestinal mucosa, while Alistipes, Prevotellaceae UCG-004, Eubacterium coprostanoligenes group and Lachnospiraceae unclassified were higher in the large intestinal mucosa. We also observed increased levels of specific microbiota in the small intestinal (Turicibacter and Cellulosilyticum) and large intestinal mucosa (Treponema, Romboutsia, Oscillospirales UCG-005 and Peptostreptococcaceae unclassified) with animal growth. A comparison of the predicted function showed that the microbiota of the small intestinal mucosa was enriched for replication and repair, while carbohydrate metabolism was enriched in the microbiota of the large intestinal mucosa. In addition, the relative abundances of amino acid and energy metabolism were significantly higher on days 42 and 70 than on day 1. Our results revealed that the microbial community composition and the dynamics of the intestinal mucosa from birth to rumination in juvenile sika deer, which may provide insights into similar processes in other juvenile ruminants.

AB  - Animals can reduce predation risk by increasing antipredator behaviours in areas of high long-term risk (risky places hypothesis), escalating antipredator behaviours when exposed to immediate risks (risky times hypothesis), varying responses to short-term risk based on long-term risk (risky times and risky places hypothesis, or predation risk allocation hypothesis) or altering antipredator behaviours based on habitat characteristics (habitat complexity risk mediation hypothesis). Most research on responses to predation risk has come from studies on herbivore prey, whereas little research has focused on mesopredator behavioural responses to risk. We studied antipredator behaviours of mesopredator cheetahs, Acinonyx jubatus, exposed to top predator risk from lions, Panthera leo, and leopards, Panthera pardus, by using a playback experiment to manipulate short-term predation risk in areas of differing long-term risk. We did not find support for the risky places hypothesis; cheetah vigilance was not influenced by longterm risk. On the contrary, we found support for the risky times hypothesis; cheetahs were more vigilant and more likely to flee following lion and leopard playbacks. Additionally, we did not find support for the risky times and risky places hypothesis or the predation risk allocation hypothesis; cheetah antipredator behaviours following a predator playback were not associated with long-term predation risk. Finally, cheetahs had higher baseline vigilance in areas of open vegetation but were more likely to flee from lion sounds in areas of dense vegetation and from leopards in areas of open vegetation. We highlight the importance of understanding spatial and temporal factors that influence mesopredator risk perception and show that antipredator behaviours can differ among trophic levels.

AB  - Next-generation sequencing technology has enabled accurate insights into the diet of wildlife species. The protocols for faecal sample collection and DNA extraction for diet analysis have differed from those focusing on target species, even in most studies combining questions on both aspects. We designed an experiment to evaluate two protocols using 11 parameters and select a single one that will generate both target species (Asiatic wild ass, Equus hemionus, in Israel) and diet DNA, as an effective strategy to minimise time, effort, and cost without hampering efficiency. In Protocol A, we swabbed the outer surface of faecal boluses and extracted DNA using a Stool Kit, while for Protocol B, we homogenised faecal matter from inside the bolus followed by extraction using a Powersoil Kit. Protocol A performed significantly better for four parameters, which included, for the target species, microsatellite amplification success and the quantity of the GAPDH gene; and for its diet, the number of exact sequence variants (ESVs) obtained at genus level and plant genus richness. However, there was no significant difference in the amplification success of sex-linked and plant markers, total reads at genus level, number of genera obtained and plant genus composition. Although we chose Protocol A, both protocols yielded results for the target species and its diet, demonstrating that one single protocol can be used for both purposes, although a pilot study is recommended to optimise the protocol for specific systems. This strategy may also be useful for studies combining target species and their gut microbiome and parasitic load.

AB  - Mountain areas in Norway provide important resources for livestock grazing. These resources are crucial for agricultural production in a country with limited agricultural land and a climate and topography that restrict production of feed and food. A key contributor in the harvest of these resources has been mountain summer farming and outfield grazing in general. However, the use of mountainous grazing resources has been declining strongly for several decades with the regrowth of formerly open areas as a consequence. In contrast, recreational use, number of holiday cabins and associated infrastructure is rapidly increasing. Conflicts between recreational and agriculture use have received increasing attention in different media. We investigated the spatial patterns of cabin development and key grazing areas in Norwegian mountain areas, analysing data on livestock, cabins, and associated infrastructure. We found a large number of cabins and associated infrastructure within high-quality grazing areas indicating that the quality of grazing has not been adequately considered in the location of new cabins. Taking into consideration that cabin development seems not to decrease, the reduced availability of grazing resources may result in an increasing level of conflict and also impact food security in the long run.

AB  - Understanding animal growth plays an important role in improving animal genetics and breeding. In order to explore the early growth and development law of Ashidan yak, the body weight (BW), wither height (WH), body oblique length (BL) and chest girth (CG) of 260 female Ashidan yaks were measured. These individuals grew under grazing conditions, and growth traits were measured at 6, 12, 18 and 30 months of age. Then the absolute growth and relative growth of Ashidan yak were calculated, and five nonlinear models (Logistic model, Gompertz model, Brody model, von Bertalanffy model and Richards model) were used to fit the growth curve of Ashidan yak. The fitting effect of the model was evaluated according to MSE, AIC and BIC. The results showed that the growth rate of Ashidan yak was the fastest from 12 to 18 months old, and the growth was slow or even stagnant from 6 to 12 months old. The AIC and BIC values of the Richards model were the lowest among the five models, with an AIC value of 4543.98 and a BIC value of 4563.19. The Richards model estimated body weight at 155.642 kg. In summary, the growth rate of female Ashidan yak changes with the seasons, growing faster in warm seasons and slower in cold seasons. Richards model is the best model to describe the growth curve of female Ashidan yak in five nonlinear models.

AB  - The frequency and intensity of heat waves are on the rise due to climate change. Heat waves are temporally discrete, and thus occur at different stages of plant development. Yet, compared with mean temperature, little is known about how the timing of extreme heat events interacts with the timing of plant development. In this study, we varied the timing of experimental heat waves applied to common milkweed (Asclepias syriaca) to determine how heat waves timing impacts plant developmental timing and subsequent plant-arthropod interactions. We found that heat waves delay and synchronize plant development, and that these effects are particularly strong for early season heat waves. Heat wave-exposed plants also supported fewer species of arthropods and experienced less chewing herbivory than ambient-temperature controls. Our study reveals that the relationship between extreme event timing and plant developmental timing will shape how increasing prevalence of extreme heat events impacts plant-arthropod communities.

AB  - Crown-of-thorns sea stars are one of the most ecologically important tropical marine invertebrates, with boom-bust population dynamics that influence the community structure of coral reefs. Although predation is likely to influence the development of population outbreaks, little is known about the defensive behavior of crown-of-thorns sea stars. Righting behavior after being overturned, a key defensive response in echinoderms, was investigated for the newly settled herbivorous juvenile, the corallivorous juvenile, and adult stages of crown-of-thorns sea stars. The average righting time of the newly settled juveniles (0.3-1.0-mm diameter) was 2.74 minutes. For the coral-eating juveniles (15-55-mm diameter), the righting time (mean = 6.24 min) was faster in larger juveniles, and the mean righting time of the adults was 6.28 minutes. During righting and in response to being lifted off of the substrate, the juveniles and adults exhibited an arm curling response, during which their arms closed over their oral side, often forming a spine ball, a feature not known for other asteroids. The righting and curling responses of the corallivorous juveniles were influenced by the presence of a natural enemy, a coral guard crab, which caused the juveniles to spend more time with their arms curled. These behaviors indicate that crown-of-thorns sea stars use their spines to protect the soft tissue of their oral side. The highly defended morphology and behavioral adaptations of crown-of-thorns sea stars are likely to have evolved as antipredator mechanisms. This points to the potential importance of predators in regulating their populations, which may have decreased in recent times due to fishing, a factor that may contribute to outbreaks.

AB  - Herbivores play an essential role in the health and recovery of a coral reef ecosystem. The lack of recovery of the keystone herbivore Diadema antillarum has had long-lasting effects, evidenced with many reefs persisting in algal dominance. This study restocked 756 lab-reared D. antillarum to four coral reefs on the east and south coast of Puerto Rico. Sea urchins were placed in experimental plots ("corrals") for 2 months, and the change in benthic composition was measured. Significant changes in the benthic structure were observed during the first week after the restocking. Significant reductions of fleshy macroalgae (Dictyota spp.) and thick turf algal/sediment mats (TAS), both unsuitable substrates (e.g. coral settlement), contributed to this change. Also, restocked D. antillarum significantly reduced the cover of encrusting red algae, Ramicrusta spp. By the end of the study, the abundance of fleshy macroalgae decreased by a mean of 77% (max of 100%) and Ramicrusta and TAS by 53% (max 71%) and 56% (max 100%), respectively. Clean substrate ("pavement"), crustose coralline algae (CCA), and filamentous turf algae increased between one to two orders of magnitude. The restoration of native sea urchins is a non-invasive and useful approach to aid in the mitigation of algae, especially potentially dangerous alga like Ramicrusta. The results of this study highlight the importance of herbivores in improving the conditions on coral reefs.

AB  - Aliphatic and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (AHs and PAHs, respectively) were analyzed in the dissolved fraction (<0.7 mu m) of surface water and in various particulate/planktonic size fractions (0.7-60, 60-200, 200-500 and 500-1000 mu m) collected at the deep chlorophyll maximum, along a North-South transect in the Mediterranean Sea in spring 2019 (MERITE-HIPPOCAMPE campaign). Suspended particulate matter, biomass, total chlorophyll a, particulate organic carbon, C and N isotopic ratios, and lipid biomarkers were also determined to help characterizing the size-fractionated plankton and highlight the potential link with the content in AHs and PAHs in these size fractions. Sigma(28)AH concentrations ranged 18-489 ng L-1 for water, 3.9-72 mu g g(-1) dry weight (dw) for the size fraction 0.7-60 mu m, and 3.4-55 mu g g(-1) dw for the fractions 60-200, 200-500 and 500-1000 mu m. AH molecular profiles revealed that they were mainly of biogenic origin. Sigma(14)PAH concentrations were 0.9-16 ng L-1 for water, and Sigma(27)PAH concentrations were 53-220 ng g(-1) dw for the fraction 0.7-60 mu m and 35-255 ng g(-1) dw for the three higher fractions, phenanthrene being the most abundant compound in planktonic compartment. Two processes were evidenced concerning the PAH patterns, the bioreduction, i.e., the decrease in concentrations from the small size fractions (0.7-60 and 60-200 mu m) to the higher ones (200-500 mu m and 500-1000 mu m), and the biodilution, i.e., the decrease in concentrations in plankton at higher suspended matter or biomass, especially for the 0.7-60 and 60-200-mu m size fractions. We estimated the biological pump fluxes of Sigma(27)PAHs below 100-m depth in the Western Mediterranean Sea at 15 +/- 10 ng m(-2) day(-1), which is comparable to those previously reported in the South Pacific and Indian Ocean.

AB  - Ridge irrigation (RI) is a water-saving irrigation mode for paddy fields, and the effects of part of urea substituted by organic manure and controlled-release urea on greenhouse gas emission under RI mode are not clear and need to be investigated. A field experiment with four nitrogen treatments (F0: only urea; F1: Chinese milk vetch replacing 30% urea; F2: pig manure replacing 30% urea; and F3: controlled-release urea replacing 30% urea) and two irrigation modes (conventional irrigation CI and RI) in south China was conducted to determine rice yield, methane (CH4), and nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions, global warming potential (GWP), and greenhouse gas emission intensity (GHGI). Compared to F0, three urea substitution treatments increased the yield by 14.6-23.2% and reduced N2O emission by 26.4-57.9%; F1 decreased CH4 emission by 22.3-30.8%; and F2 increased CH4 emission by 59.9-120.9%. Compared to F0, F1 decreased GWP and GHGI by 23.1-31.3 and 39.0-41.2% while F2 increased them by 53.9-111.6 and 55.7-57.2%, respectively. Compared with CI mode, RI mode decreased GWP and GHGI by 7.8-34.0 and 16.7-28.4%, respectively. Chinese milk vetch replacing 30% urea was a suitable urea substitution method under ridge irrigation, which can increase rice yield and decrease GWP and GHGI.

AB  - Northern elephant seals migrate long distances from feeding grounds to raise pups during a brief period on breeding beaches. Because gestation sets a parturition date months in advance, timing of the arrival must be precise; an early arrival would waste foraging time, but a late arrival would cause parturition failure. We used satellite-tracked animals to examine this timing, establishing arrival and birth dates in 106 migrating females and estimating how far they traveled in the days just before birth. Females arrived a mean of 5.5 days prior to birth (range 1-11, SD = 1.5), and females arriving later in the breeding season had 1.8-day shorter prebirth intervals relative to early arrivers. There was no correlation between female body condition, nor female age, and the prebirth interval. The last 15 days prior to birth, animals traveled as far as 1,465 km. Those farthest from the colony traveled >100 km per day, three times faster than animals near the colony at the same time. Despite migrations covering several thousand kilometers while pregnant, female elephant seals were able to time their arrival within days. This allows them to maintain a precise annual birth cycle for many years consecutively.

AB  - Physiological systems often have emergent properties but the effects of genetic variation on physiology are often unknown, which presents a major challenge to understanding the mechanisms of phenotypic evolution. We investigated whether genetic variants in haemoglobin (Hb) that contribute to high-altitude adaptation in deer mice (Peromyscus maniculatus) are associated with evolved changes in the control of breathing. We created F-2 inter-population hybrids of highland and lowland deer mice to test for phenotypic associations of alpha- and beta-globin variants on a mixed genetic background. Hb genotype had expected effects on Hb-O-2 affinity that were associated with differences in arterial O-2 saturation in hypoxia. However, high-altitude genotypes were also associated with breathing phenotypes that should contribute to enhancing O-2 uptake in hypoxia. Mice with highland alpha-globin exhibited a more effective breathing pattern, with highland homozygotes breathing deeper but less frequently across a range of inspired O-2, and this difference was comparable to the evolved changes in breathing pattern in deer mouse populations native to high altitude. The ventilatory response to hypoxia was augmented in mice that were homozygous for highland beta-globin. The association of globin variants with variation in breathing phenotypes could not be recapitulated by acute manipulation of Hb-O-2 affinity, because treatment with efaproxiral (a synthetic drug that acutely reduces Hb-O-2 affinity) had no effect on breathing in normoxia or hypoxia. Therefore, adaptive variation in Hb may have unexpected effects on physiology in addition to the canonical function of this protein in circulatory O-2 transport.

AB  - Zokors, an Asiatic group of subterranean rodents, originated in lowlands and colonized high-elevational zones following the uplift of the Qinghai-Tibet plateau about 3.6 million years ago. Zokors live at high elevation in subterranean burrows and experience hypobaric hypoxia, including both hypoxia (low oxygen concentration) and hypercapnia (elevated partial pressure of CO2). Here we report a genomic analysis of six zokor species (genus Eospalax) with different elevational ranges to identify structural variants (deletions and inversions) that may have contributed to high-elevation adaptation. Based on an assembly of a chromosome-level genome of the high-elevation species, Eospalax baileyi, we identified 18 large inversions that distinguished this species from congeners native to lower elevations. Small-scale structural variants in the introns of EGLN1, HIF1A, HSF1 and SFTPD of E. baileyi were associated with the upregulated expression of those genes. A rearrangement on chromosome 1 was associated with altered chromatin accessibility, leading to modified gene expression profiles of key genes involved in the physiological response to hypoxia. Multigene families that underwent copy-number expansions in E. baileyi were enriched for autophagy, HIF1 signalling and immune response. E. baileyi show a significantly larger lung mass than those of other Eospalax species. These findings highlight the key role of structural variants underlying hypoxia adaptation of high-elevation species in Eospalax.
   Comparative analysis of whole-genome sequencing of six zokor species that live at different altitudes show the contribution of deletions and inversions to adaptation to high altitude in these subterranean rodents.

AB  - Habitat loss profoundly influences animal behaviour, impacting the long-term viability of species. In this study, we explored the link between the flight capabilities of the woodlandspecialist butterfly, Limenitis camilla, and the spatial-temporal connectivity of its main habitatbroadleaved forests. We examined the shifts in forest functional connectivity inWallonia (Belgium) in recent decades, alongside the exploratory flight patterns of female L. camilla. Our findings revealed that butterflies from fragmented forests spent more time on movement-related behaviours than those from well-connected habitats. This indicates a potential evolutionary adaptation favouring behaviours that help locate suitable egg-laying sites in populations that have experienced habitat shrinkage and increased isolation over the past 20-40 generations.
   There is broad evidence that the main driver of the ongoing biodiversity crisis is landuse change, which reduces and fragments habitats. The consequence of habitat fragmentation on behavioural responses of fitness-related traits in insects have been so far understudied. In herbivorous insects, oviposition-related behaviours determine access to larval food, and the fate of the next generation. We present a pilot study to assess differences in behaviours related to movement and oviposition in Limenitis camilla butterflies from Wallonia (Belgium), one of the most fragmented regions in Europe. We first quantified variation in functional habitat connectivity across Wallonia and found that fragmented habitats had more abundant, but less evenly distributed host plants of L. camilla. Secondly, we quantified the behaviours of field-caught L. camilla females originating from habitats with contrasted landscape connectivity in an outdoor experimental setting. We found differences in behaviours related to flight investment: butterflies from fragmented woodlands spent more time in departing flight, which we associated with dispersal, than butterflies from homogenous woodlands. Although results from this study should be interpreted with caution given the limited sample size, they provide valuable insights for the advancement of behavioural research that aims to assess the effects of global changes on insects.

AB  - We sampled mussels (Mytilus edulis) along the coast of the Korean peninsula, and determined their trophic position (TP) using the nitrogen isotope ratio of amino acids (TPglu/phe). The TPglu/phe of mussels (2.0 to 2.5) is higher than TP of herbivores, suggesting that TP normalization is required to remove the trophic enrichment effect on basal nitrogen isotope ratio. We found similar trends in spatial variation between nitrogen isotopic baseline based on nitrogen isotope ratio of bulk tissue (delta N-15(base-bulk)) and that of phenylalanine (delta N-15(base-phe)) in mussels, reflecting different nitrogen sources among sampling sites. The present study suggests that delta N-15(base-bulk) and delta N-15(base-phe) are powerful tools to trace nitrogen isotopic baselines from primary consumers as well as higher TP organisms.

AB  - We show that one population of red kangaroos outside the dingo barrier fence has fewer females and joeys, and also grows up faster than a neighboring population that is protected by the fence. We argue that the impacts of contrasting predation pressures across the fence, for kangaroos and other prey, need further investigation.
   Decommissioning the dingo barrier fence has been suggested to reduce destructive dingo control and encourage a free transfer of biota between environments in Australia. Yet the potential impacts that over a century of predator exclusion might have had on the population dynamics and developmental biology of prey populations has not been assessed. We here combine demographic data and both linear and geometric morphometrics to assess differences in populations among 166 red kangaroos (Osphranter rufus)-a primary prey species of the dingo-from two isolated populations on either side of the fence. We also quantified the differences in aboveground vegetation biomass for the last 10 years on either side of the fence. We found that the age structure and growth patterns, but not cranial shape, differed between the two kangaroo populations. In the population living with a higher density of dingoes, there were relatively fewer females and juveniles. These individuals were larger for a given age, despite what seems to be lower vegetation biomass. However, how much of this biomass represented kangaroo forage is uncertain and requires further on-site assessments. We also identified unexpected differences in the ontogenetic trajectories in relative pes length between the sexes for the whole sample, possibly associated with male competition or differential weight-bearing mechanics. We discuss potential mechanisms behind our findings and suggest that the impacts of contrasting predation pressures across the fence, for red kangaroos and other species, merit further investigation.

AB  - Simple Summary Boer goat is a world-famous meat-type goat breed that underwent long-term artificial selection from African indigenous animals. The current study displayed the genome-wide selection signature analyses of South African indigenous goat (AF), African Boer (BH), and Australian Boer (AS), to investigate the hereditary basis of artificial selection in different stages. Moreover, the theta pi, F-ST, and XP-CLR methods were used to search for the candidate signatures of positive selection in Boer goats. Ten genes (e.g., BMPR1B, DNER, ITGAL, and KIT) under selection in both groups were identified and are potentially responsible for reproduction, metabolism, growth, and development. This study provided a comprehensive overview of genomic variations in Boer goat, which may provide a basis for further resource protection and improvement of this breed. Boer goats, as kemp in meat-type goats, are selected and bred from African indigenous goats under a long period of artificial selection. Their advantages in multiple economic traits, particularly their plump growth, have attracted worldwide attention. The current study displayed the genome-wide selection signature analyses of South African indigenous goat (AF), African Boer (BH), and Australian Boer (AS) to investigate the hereditary basis of artificial selection in different stages. Four methods (principal component analysis, nucleotide diversity, linkage disequilibrium decay, and neighbor-joining tree) implied the genomic diversity changes with different artificial selection intensities in Boer goats. In addition, the theta pi, F-ST, and XP-CLR methods were used to search for the candidate signatures of positive selection in Boer goats. Consequently, 339 (BH vs. AF) and 295 (AS vs. BH) candidate genes were obtained from SNP data. Especially, 10 genes (e.g., BMPR1B, DNER, ITGAL, and KIT) under selection in both groups were identified. Functional annotation analysis revealed that these genes are potentially responsible for reproduction, metabolism, growth, and development. This study used genome-wide sequencing data to identify inheritance by artificial selection. The results of the current study are valuable for future molecular-assisted breeding and genetic improvement of goats.

AB  - The oilseed crop Camelina sativa exhibits salinity tolerance, but the effects on early growth stages across a range of different salts and in combination with salicylic acid (SA) have not been thoroughly evaluated. In this study, seeds were germinated in varying concentrations of six salts (NaCl, CaCl2, ZnCl2, KCl, MgSO4, and Na2SO4) with or without 0.5 mM SA. Using the halotime model, we estimated salt thresholds for germination and parameters of seedling growth. Germination and seedling growth parameters of camelina significantly decreased with increasing salt concentration across all salt types. Salts containing Zn and SO4 were most detrimental to germination and seedling growth. Except for KCl, 0.5 mM SA generally reduced the salinity tolerance threshold (Saltb(50)) of camelina. Specifically, Saltb(50) was 21.5% higher for KCl and 16.1%, 25.0%, 54.9%, 21.0%, and 5.6% lower for CaCl2, NaCl, MgSO4, Na2SO4, and ZnCl2, respectively, when 0.5 mM SA was compared to 0 mM SA. Furthermore, camelina seedling growth was consistently more sensitive than germination across all salt types. SA did not significantly enhance germination or seedling growth and was harmful when combined with certain salts or at the germination stage. It can be concluded that both the type of salt and the concentration of SA are as critical as the salt concentration in saline irrigation water.

AB  - The management of biological invasions is a worldwide conservation priority. Unfortunately, decision-making on optimal invasion management can be impeded by lack of information about the biological processes that determine invader success (i.e. biological uncertainty) or by uncertainty about the effectiveness of candidate interventions (i.e. operational uncertainty). Concurrent assessment of both sources of uncertainty within the same framework can help to optimize control decisions. Here, we present a Value of Information (VoI) framework to simultaneously analyse the effects of biological and operational uncertainties on management outcomes. We demonstrate this approach with a case study: minimizing the long-term population growth of musk thistle Carduus nutans, a widespread invasive plant, using several insects as biological control agents, including Trichosirocalus horridus, Rhinocyllus conicus and Urophora solstitialis. The ranking of biocontrol agents was sensitive to differences in the target weed's demography and also to differences in the effectiveness of the different biocontrol agents. This finding suggests that accounting for both biological and operational uncertainties is valuable when making management recommendations for invasion control. Furthermore, our VoI analyses show that reduction of all uncertainties across all combinations of demographic model and biocontrol effectiveness explored in the current study would lead, on average, to a 15.6% reduction in musk thistle population growth rate. The specific growth reduction that would be observed in any instance would depend on how the uncertainties actually resolve. Resolving biological uncertainty (across demographic model combinations) or operational uncertainty (across biocontrol effectiveness combinations) alone would reduce expected population growth rate by 8.5% and 10.5% respectively. Synthesis and applications. Our study demonstrates that intervention rank is determined both by biological processes in the targeted invasive populations and by intervention effectiveness. Ignoring either biological uncertainty or operational uncertainty may result in a suboptimal recommendation. Therefore, it is important to simultaneously acknowledge both sources of uncertainty during the decision-making process in invasion management. The framework presented here can accommodate diverse data sources and modelling approaches, and has wide applicability to guide invasive species management and conservation efforts.

AB  - Reducing enteric methane emissions from livestock is a key environmental challenge, as methane is a major pollutant. The complexity of animal biology and diverse diet compositions make it difficult to develop strategy to control methane production. This study examined the use of plant phenolic extracts of Madhuca longifolia (ML-7) as a feed additive combined with various ruminant diets and dosages to find an effective supplement to reduce methane emissions. Seven feeds were assessed: two dry forages (wheat and oat straw), two green fodders (berseem and napier), and three mixed diets formulated with straw bases: wheat (Diet-1), oat (Diet-2) and sorghum (Diet-3), each combined with berseem and concentrate in a 2:1:1 ratio. The nutritive value of each feed was assessed, followed by measuring total gas, methane and in vitro fermentation after supplementing all feeds with ML-7 at different levels (0, 0.2, 0.6 and 1.0%). Diet-3 had the highest (18.98 Mj kg(-1)) gross energy while oat straw had the lowest (18.25 Mj kg(-1)). Berseem had the best nutritional profile. Supplementing feeds with ML-7 extract significantly reduced total gas and methane production across the tested feeds. However, DMD declined significantly in diet-3 and napier grass. ML-7 had no effect on short-chain fatty acid production in the tested diets, although SCFA production decreased significantly with 1.0% ML-7 supplementation in dry and green fodder. The methane reduction pattern was diet-1 > napier > berseem, diet-2, diet-3, wheat straw, and oat straw. Total volatile fatty acids decreased most in diet-3, followed by diet-2, diet-1, napier, berseem, and other dry roughages. ML-7 supplementation had minimal impact on total protozoa populations but significantly reduced holotrichs. Supplementing ML-7 extract to feeds at 0.6-1.0% levels shows potential for reducing methane emissions in ruminants without disrupting rumen fermentation, promoting sustainable livestock production and a climate-friendly environment by reducing methane emissions.

AB  - Objective In the eastern Canadian Arctic, the Greenland Halibut Reinhardtius hippoglossoides fishery has been active since the 1990s, but to date, no comprehensive examination of seabird bycatch patterns has been carried out. Incidental catch of seabirds by fisheries can be detrimental to seabird populations and can also result in the loss of time, bait, and targeted fish species for the fishery. Thus, bycatch of seabirds can have negative impacts on both conservation efforts and fisheries. We aimed to understand seabird bycatch by the Greenland Halibut fishery across seasons, across years, and associated with different types of gear, which is critical to informing potential mitigation solutions that may reduce seabird bycatch in fishing gear.Methods We compiled all available information on seabird bycatch in the eastern Canadian Arctic region (Northwest Atlantic Fisheries Organization Subarea 0, Divisions 0A and 0B) to assess spatial and temporal patterns of bycatch of all seabirds reported by at-sea fisheries observers from 2010 to 2019.Results We found that northern fulmars Fulmarus glacialis were the most frequently reported seabird bycatch species in the fishery, with high levels of monthly and annual variation in the number of birds reported as bycatch. Gulls and shearwaters were also reported at lower levels in the bycatch database.Conclusions Seabird bycatch by the Greenland Halibut fishery in Divisions 0A and 0B is highly variable from year to year but does not appear to be related to the level of total allowable catch. August, September, and October had the highest levels of northern fulmars reported in the bycatch records, suggesting that fulmars may be more vulnerable to being caught in the fishery during these months, although future examinations of effort data are needed to confirm this.
   This assessment of seabird bycatch in the Greenland Halibut fishery within Northwest Atlantic Fisheries Organization Subarea 0, Divisions 0A and 0B, is a critical step in providing the quantitative data needed to address questions relating to population-level impacts on fisheries bycatch species in the region.

AB  - Many temperate grasses are both hyper-accumulators of silicon (Si) and hosts of Epichloe fungal endophytes, functional traits which may alleviate environmental stresses such as herbivore attack. Si accumulation and endophyte infection may operate synergistically, but this has not been tested in a field setting, nor in the context of changing environmental conditions. Predicted increases in atmospheric CO2 concentrations can affect both Si accumulation and endophyte function, but these have not been studied in combination.We investigated how elevated atmospheric CO2 (eCO(2)), Si supplementation, endophyte-presence and insect herbivory impacted plant growth, stoichiometry (C, N, P and Si), leaf gas exchange (rates of photosynthesis, stomatal conductance, transpiration rates) and endophyte production of anti-herbivore defences (alkaloids) of an important pasture grass (tall fescue; Lolium arundinaceum) in the field.eCO(2) and Si supplementation increased shoot biomass (+52% and +31%, respectively), whereas herbivory reduced shoot biomass by at least 35% and induced Si accumulation by 24%. Shoot Si concentrations, in contrast, decreased by 17%-21% under eCO(2). Si supplementation and herbivory reduced shoot C concentrations. eCO(2) reduced shoot N concentrations which led to increased shoot C:N ratios. Overall, shoot P concentrations were 26% lower in endophytic plants compared to non-endophytic plants, potentially due to decreased mass flow (i.e. observed reductions in stomatal conductance and transpiration). Alkaloid production was not discernibly affected by any experimental treatment. The negative impacts of endophytes on P uptake were particularly strong under eCO(2).We show that eCO(2) and insect herbivory reduce and promote Si accumulation, respectively, incorporating some field conditions for the first time. This indicates that these drivers operate in a more realistic ecological context than previously demonstrated. Reduced uptake of P in endophytic plants may adversely affect plant productivity in the future, particularly if increased demand for P due to improved plant growth under eCO(2) cannot be met.

AB  - Informing conservation and management decisions for habitats frequented by species of high management interest often face the challenge of limited resources for conducting wildlife surveys. When surveys are focused on local areas or sparsely distributed species, it may also be difficult to obtain counts sufficient for implementing abundance models that account for imperfect detection. With replicated aerial surveys collected within a 70.25-km(2) portion of the Eastern Alaska Range, Alaska, USA, during the summers of 2013-2015, we estimated daily abundance of Dall's sheep using two different estimation methods: Bayesian N-mixture models and Poisson regression models. We then compared estimates of relative abundance from both model types while paying special attention to the assumption of closure within individual survey units. With abundance estimates obtained from individual survey days, we then estimated the average number of Dall's sheep within the survey area for the period 1 July-1 October. Daily ewe abundance followed a quadratic pattern, with 10-20 ewes being within our survey area in early July and late September, and approximately 90 ewes within the survey area in mid-August. Lamb-to-ewe ratios averaged 0.2 from July-September, while ram-to-ewe ratios averaged 0.4 from July until mid-August before increasing to about 1.0 by the end of September. These results indicate that our survey area is an important habitat to local Dall's sheep populations when lambs are vulnerable to predators. Accordingly, human recreation and military training within the survey area should be minimized 1.5-3.0 months after parturition to minimize disturbance. We also found that N-mixture models displayed a pattern of abundance estimates that increased in magnitude as model complexity increased. We thus recommend an a priori approach to N-mixture model construction that balances the risk of overfitting models to modest data against the risk of fitting models that do not explain heterogeneity in abundance and detection probability. Lastly, we suggest simple improvements to replicated, aerial surveys for species like Dall's sheep focused on reducing violations of the closure assumption within individual survey units, which can reduce bias of density estimates obtained with N-mixture models.

AB  - The genetic and morphological diversity of the bezoars from two habitats in the Karaman Province (south-western Anatolia, Turkiye), i.e. camlica and Nunu Valleys, was explored. No previous ecomorphological and molecular genetic studies had been performed on these populations. Horn length differentiation and the sequence analysis of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) D-loop region are presented. In addition, 87 previously obtained sequences of bezoar were included in the analyses aiming to determine both phylogenetic rela-tionships and population genetic structure of the Anatolian wild goats. A statistically significant difference between the horn lengths of 18 bezoar samples taken from two habitats were found. From the five D-loop sequences obtained in this study, two haplotypes were identified, one of them being a new haplotype found only in the Nunu Valley population. The other haplotypes were found in both bezoar populations studied as well as in some other south-western Anatolian bezoar populations (from the Mersin Province, close to Karaman). Phylogenetic analyses (Maximum likelihood and Bayesian phylogenetic trees, Median-joining network) revealed eight Anatolian wild goat haplogroups. These haplogroups consisted of a common an-cestral lineage with 481-bp long (all over Anatolia) and a more recent lineage with 556 bp (only in Akseki, Mersin and Nunu Valley-Karaman). According to the results, it could be said that there are introgressive hy-brid populations in Nunu Valley, Karaman, as well as in the Akseki and Mersin Provinces. The findings also revealed that the morphological difference between the Nunu and camlica populations was due to different gene pools, which indicated the presence of introgression rather than phenotypic plasticity.

AB  - Simple Summary
   The present study, in view of the importance of finding an alternative hormone to eCG, aims to determine the response of sheep to hCG-based treatments. The findings indicate that the low fertility rates reported for protocols based on the administration of hCG for inducing ovulation during estrus synchronization in sheep may be related to a high occurrence of abnormal follicular growth patterns, disturbances, and retardments of ovulation and concomitant formation of follicular cysts in the treated females. These results preclude their practical application to induce ovulation concomitantly to estrous synchronization treatments.
   Currently, there is an intense effort to find an alternative hormone to eCG to induce ovulation after estrus synchronization treatments in sheep. One of the proposed alternatives is based on the use of hCG, but the results are controversial since fertility rates are commonly affected. The present study aims to evaluate, therefore, the adequacy of hCG in protocols for the synchronization of estrus and ovulation. Ovarian follicle dynamics, occurrence of estrus behavior and subsequent ovulation, quality of corpora lutea, and pregnancy rate after controlled natural mating were assessed in two consecutive trials. The findings indicate that the low fertility rates reported for the protocols based on the administration of hCG for inducing ovulation during estrus synchronization in sheep may be related to a high occurrence of abnormal follicular growth patterns, disturbances, and retardments of ovulation and concomitant formation of follicular cysts in the treated females. These results preclude their practical application to induce ovulation concomitantly to estrous synchronization treatments.

AB  - A new oil from transgenic Camelina sativa was evaluated for its potential to serve as a primary source for eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and astaxanthin in feed for rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss). Experimental diets were formulated containing either the transgene-derived oil (CAM) or a blend of fish and vegetable oils (CTL). The two diets were given to quadruplicate tanks of 30 fish (body weight 294 +/- 32 g) for 10 weeks. Some of the fish were exercised in a swim tunnel prior to sampling. At sampling, muscle tissue was collected for fillet quality assessment and plasma to measure oxidative stress markers. Dietary treatment had no significant impact on final body weight. The fatty acid profile of rainbow trout fillets reflected that of the experimental diets with higher levels of linoleic acid, arachidonic acid, EPA and DHA in fish fed CAM. Levels of corresponding lipid inflammatory mediators, except for those derived from DHA, were pre-exercise elevated in plasma of fish fed CAM. Similarly, dietary ketocarotenoid levels were reflected in the fillet of fish with lower astaxanthin in fish fed CAM compared to CTL, which agreed with differences in fillet color. Dietary treatment had no significant impact on swimming performance. Plasma cortisol and 8-isoprostane were elevated post-exercise, irrespective of dietary treatment. Feeding the transgene-derived oil supported normal growth and increased fillet EPA and DHA levels above standard. A comparable swimming capacity and stress response suggests that the inclusion of the transgenic camelina oil did not impair fish welfare.

AB  - Global food production, both aquatic and terrestrial, is rife with sustainability issues. Aquaculture is a rapidly growing industry that is on track to surpass wild-caught fishery production by 2030. The integration of aquaculture and agriculture systems could help to reduce some of their respective and shared environmental issues. Integrated Aquaculture-Agriculture (IAA) has been shown to provide a variety of benefits to both aquaculture and agriculture including increased system water use efficiency (WUE), a reduction in fertilizer use, and increases in total farm yield and resilience. This study was performed to examine the potential for rainbow trout aquaculture effluent to improve the yield, nutrient composition, and WUE of lettuce, as well as act as a partial fertilizer replacement. We used four irrigation treatments throughout the experiment: city water, aquaculture effluent, city water with added organic fertilizer, and aquaculture effluent with added organic fertilizer. Throughout the trial, there were some issues of herbivory in the growing plot, but overall, the lettuce receiving city water with organic fertilizer (30. +/- 3.4 g/plant) showed significantly higher fresh biomass than effluent treatments (18 +/- 1.4 g/plant and 17 +/- 2.9 g/plant) at the end of the trial. We did not detect any significant differences among treatments in the macro- and micronutrients of the lettuce shoots and roots. However, the WUE of effluent treatments (4.4 +/- 0.030 kg/m3 and 1.0 +/- 0.070 kg/m3) was greater than that of organic fertilizer (0.28 +/- 0.050 kg/m3) and control treatments (0.23 +/- 0.040 kg/m3). The results indicate that adopting IAA in California could improve statewide WUE and conserve water for sustainable agricultural production.

AB  - As high-quality sheep germplasm resources in China, Hu sheep are characterized by fast growth and development, high fecundity, and tolerance to drought and cold. Tibetan sheep, adapted to high-altitude environments, have developed strong environmental adaptability. To explore the differences in the interaction among rumen microbial flora, hepatic gluconeogenesis, and mitochondrial function between Tibetan sheep and Hu sheep in the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, this study systematically compared and analyzed the rumen flora density, key enzyme activities related to hepatic gluconeogenesis and mitochondrial function, and the expression levels of related genes in Tibetan sheep and Hu sheep under identical feeding management conditions, followed by correlation analysis. The results showed that Hu sheep had significantly higher densities of Ruminobacteramylophilus (Ram) and Fibrobacter succinogenes (Fs) associated with starch and protein degradation (p < 0.01). The expression levels of Forkhead box O1 (FOXO1), pyruvate carboxylase (PC) activity, and adenosine triphosphate (ATP) content were also significantly higher than those in Tibetan sheep (p < 0.01). In contrast, Tibetan sheep had higher densities of Butyrivibrio fibrisolvens (Bf), Ruminococcus albus (Ra), Ruminococcus flavefaciens (Rf), etc., related to cellulose degradation (p < 0.01). The gluconeogenesis-related genes, Glucose-6-phosphatase catalytic subunit 1 (G6PC1) and phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase1 (PCK1), and the activities of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK) and fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase (FBPase) were significantly higher in Tibetan sheep than in Hu sheep (p < 0.01). Mitochondrial function-related genes Mitofusin-1 (Mfn1), Mitofusin-2 (Mfn2), subunit 6 of ATP synthase (ATP6), cytochrome b (Cytb), etc., also showed significantly higher expression in Tibetan sheep (p < 0.01). While no significant differences were observed in the contents of citric acid (CA), pyruvic acid (PA), glucose (Glu), etc. (p > 0.05). Correlation analysis indicated that rumen flora was associated with the key enzyme activities and gene expressions of hepatic gluconeogenesis and mitochondrial function to varying degrees. In summary, Tibetan sheep exhibit strong fiber degradation capacity, the efficient utilization of gluconeogenic intermediates, and mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) ability, forming adaptive strategies for high-altitude environments. By contrast, Hu sheep show efficient protein and starch degradation capacity, thereby enhancing the supply of gluconeogenic precursors. It is indicated that when introducing Hu sheep to high-altitude areas, dietary intervention can be used to regulate rumen microorganisms, such as increasing fiber-decomposing bacteria or enhancing mitochondrial oxidative capacity, to counteract metabolic limitations induced by hypoxia.

AB  - Online image repositories can offer a freely accessible, information-rich and cost-effective alternative to museum collections for studying long-term changes in human interactions with nature and ecological and evolutionary change. The Rhino Resource Center (RRC) is one example, curated by experts and holding a collection of >4000 rhino images, including both artistic portrayals (1481-2021) and photographs (taken between 1862-2021), and representing a potentially valuable case study to investigate the utility of online image repositories for research into large vertebrates and, potentially, other well-recorded smaller taxa. The five extant species of rhino are all threatened by habitat loss and human hunting and therefore are an important focus for conservation research. We used the RRC for two separate research approaches: (i) assessing the changing representations and human interactions with rhinos using 3158 images (1531 pieces of artwork and 1627 photographs); and (ii) determining to what extent morphological data can be extracted from photographs to assess changes in horn length over time, using a sample size of 80 photographs of rhinos taken in profile view. We found that African rhino species have become more commonly depicted in images, compared to Asian rhino species over time. During the age of European imperialism (between the 16th and 20th centuries), rhinos were commonly portrayed as hunting trophies, but since the mid-20th century, they have been increasingly portrayed in a conservation context, reflecting a change in emphasis from a more to less consumptive relationship between humans and rhinos. Finally, we found evidence for declining horn length over time across species, perhaps related to selective pressure of hunting, and indicating a utility for image-based approaches in understanding societal perceptions of large vertebrates and trait evolution.

AB  - The aim of this study is to provide new insights on the age and growth of H. dactylopterus in the north-western Ionian Sea (central Mediterranean) by using different data sets and comparing three different methods, one direct by otolith reading corroborated by two indirect methods, by means of back calculation and Length Frequency Distribution analysis (LFDa), in order to obtain robust data for use in analytical management models. A total of 1403 specimens of blackbelly rosefish were sampled from habitats explored on muddy bottoms in the depth range 106-721 m and 309 individuals caught in the cold-water coral habitat between 418 and 635 m in depth. The length-frequency distributions of blackbelly rosefish showed a polymodal pattern in both habitats explored, with medium-small individuals caught on muddy bottoms and larger ones in coral habitats and canyons. The maximum age observed in females was 13 years (315 mm TL), while in males it was 15 years (336 mm TL), and no significant difference was observed comparing age-length keys from otolith readings of females with the males. The analysis of the daily increments allowed us to validate the average length of the first year of age (approximately 90-100 mm LT) obtained from the three different methods used. No significant difference was highlighted comparing the average lengths of age class 1, calculated with the direct method and by counting the daily increments. The von Bertalanffy growth parameters were estimated for the sexes and for the whole population from otolith readings and for the entire population by LFD analysis and the back calculation method. The growth curves were comparable between the different methods and no significant difference was observed. The von Bertalanffy growth parameters estimated for the different methods were comparable (otolith readings L infinity 494 mm, k=0.06 years-1, t0=-3.00 years; back calculation method L infinity 487 mm, k=0.06 years-1, t0=-2.30 years; LFDa L infinity 415 mm, k=0.07 years-1, t0=-2.23 years), indicating a slow growth in accordance with what has already been observed in other areas of the Mediterranean.

AB  - Angiosperms have co-evolved with animals over thousands of years leading to an array of mutualistic relationships. Passage of plant seeds through animal intestines leads to an important mutualism providing the animal with food and the plant with seed dispersal and enhanced germination. This phenomenon is well studied in terrestrial angiosperms, but there is less research in aquatic environments. We studied the effect of gut passage in marine mega-herbivores (green sea turtles and dugongs) on seed germination for a common Australian seagrass, Zostera muelleri. We collected fecal samples likely to contain seeds, as well as seagrass seeds from plants at two coastal seagrass meadows in the central Great Barrier Reef World Heritage Area, Australia. Seeds collected from feces and plants were subjected to germination trials across different temperature treatments: low (19 degrees C), medium (26 degrees C), and high (32 degrees C). We found excreted seeds had a significantly greater germination probability (two to four times greater) and germinated significantly faster (18-61% faster) than seeds from the plant. Excreted seeds which had not germinated at the end of the experiment were significantly less likely to be viable compared with seeds taken from the plant. Seeds released from the plant have a slow germination and low germination probability compared with excreted seeds, but retain a high percentage of seed viability. Our study is the first record of marine mega-herbivores enhancing germination of Z. muelleri seeds. By transporting seeds to new locations and enhancing germination, these animals are important in seagrass resilience and connectivity among metapopulations.

AB  - Translational ecology defines a collaborative effort among scientists and stakeholders to rapidly translate environmental problems into action. This approach can be applied in a fisheries management context when information needed to inform regulations is unavailable, yet conservation concerns exist. Our research uses a translational ecology framework to assess the stock status and develop research priorities for the crevalle jack (Caranx hippos) in the Florida Keys, USA, a currently unregulated species. Interview data that compiled expert fishing guide knowledge were used to develop hypotheses tested using existing fisheries-dependent datasets to check for agreement among sources and assess the consistency of observed patterns. Six hypotheses were developed concerning the status and trends of the crevalle jack population in the Florida Keys, and four of these hypotheses received clear support, with agreement between guide observations and one or more of the fisheries-dependent datasets. The results of our study outline an effective translational ecology approach for recreational fisheries management designed to rapidly recognize potential management needs as identified by fishing guides, which allows for actionable science and proactive management.

AB  - Migratory waterbirds are experiencing severe declines worldwide due to habitat loss. Their life cycles often span different countries and continents, highlighting the need for safeguarding wetland networks along migratory flyways. However, there are gaps in understanding how changes in specific sites can impact species at the biogeographical scale. Here we used a wetland of international importance (the Guadalquivir marshes, SW Spain) as a case study to investigate the causes and consequences at the flyway scale of annual changes in wintering waterbird assemblages. To do so, we combined 38 years of local and international waterfowl winter counts, environmental and remote sensing data encompassing 432 Ramsar sites, and a functional approach through structural equation modelling (SEM). We show that the environmental conditions experienced by wintering waterfowl in the study area were correlated with changes in their biogeographical populations in the East Atlantic Flyway. We found that during the last 40 years, the waterfowl assemblage wintering at the Guadalquivir marshes has shifted from a community composed mainly by herbivores and pre-Saharan dabbling granivores, to the current one dominated by Trans-Saharan dabbling granivores. Declines in 9/15 of the species studied were associated with the deterioration of the Do & ntilde;ana National Park natural marshes, whereas changes in the remnant six species responded mainly to global factors, such as the increase in winter temperatures in other areas of their distribution range. These results underscore the importance of considering global factors and flyway population data when interpreting regional trends of migratory animals. But also, that changes in specific wetlands can have measurable global impacts. Being that the long-term persistence of migratory animals in a changing world entails the protection and integrity of migratory flyways beyond national borders.
   Las aves acu & aacute;ticas migratorias est & aacute;n experimentando importantes declives a nivel mundial debido a la p & eacute;rdida de h & aacute;bitat. Esto es debido a que sus ciclos vitales suelen abarcar distintos pa & iacute;ses y continentes, lo cual las hace dependientes del buen estado de conservaci & oacute;n de las redes de humedales que usan en sus rutas migratorias. Sin embargo, hay una falta de estudios que analicen si los cambios en algunos de estos humedales clave pueden afectar a las especies a escala biogeogr & aacute;fica. Para abordar esta cuesti & oacute;n, hemos utilizado un humedal de importancia internacional (las Marismas del Guadalquivir, en el suroeste de Espa & ntilde;a) como caso de estudio para investigar las causas y consecuencias de los cambios interanuales en las poblaciones de aves acu & aacute;ticas invernantes. Para ello, hemos combinado 38 a & ntilde;os de censos de an & aacute;tidas invernantes en las Marismas del Guadalquivir y el Pale & aacute;rtico Occidental, junto con datos ambientales y de teledetecci & oacute;n de 432 sitios Ramsar usando un enfoque funcional mediante Modelos de Ecuaciones Estructurales. Nuestros resultados muestran que las poblaciones de an & aacute;tidas del Pale & aacute;rtico Occidental se ven afectadas por las condiciones que encuentran durante la invernada en las Marismas del Guadalquivir, resaltando el papel internacional clave de este humedal para la conservaci & oacute;n de las aves acu & aacute;ticas. De este modo, la comunidad de an & aacute;tidas invernantes en las Marismas del Guadalquivir ha pasado en los & uacute;ltimos 40 a & ntilde;os de estar compuesta principalmente por herb & iacute;voros y gran & iacute;voros presaharianos, a la actual dominada por gran & iacute;voros transaharianos. Se detectaron declives en 9/15 de las especies estudiadas asociados al deterioro de las marismas naturales del Parque Nacional de Do & ntilde;ana, mientras que los cambios en las 6 especies restantes respondieron principalmente a factores globales, como el aumento de las temperaturas invernales en otras zonas de su & aacute;rea de distribuci & oacute;n. Estos resultados ponen de manifiesto la importancia de considerar factores globales y datos poblacionales a gran escala a la hora de interpretar las tendencias locales de aves migratorias. Pero tambi & eacute;n, que los cambios en un sitio clave, como las Marismas del Guadalquivir, pueden tener un impacto cuantificable en las poblaciones de aves a escala global. De este modo, la persistencia a largo plazo de las especies migratorias en un mundo cambiante implica asegurar la integridad de las rutas migratorias m & aacute;s all & aacute; de fronteras nacionales.

AB  - The appropriate response for controlling an invasive non-native species depends on the extent to which its invasion has progressed, which can be revealed by information on its distribution and abundance. Reeves' muntjac is a native deer to China and Taiwan, but has been introduced and become well-established in Great Britain. Moreover, in recent years, reports and verified records in the wild from other European countries have become more frequent. We reviewed the status of Reeves' muntjac in Britain and evaluated its national range expansion from 2002 to 2016. While the British population appears to have tripled in size since 1995, the rate at which it has expanded its range seems to have peaked at approximately 12% per year between 2002 and 2005 and has since declined. We also consolidated observations on its international distribution, including a conservative evaluation of its presence in zoological collections. We predict that this species could expand its range to include every European country, although the availability of suitable landcover and climate is likely to vary substantially between countries. To prevent the significant impacts to conservation interests that have been observed in Great Britain from extending across Europe, national administrations should consider eradicating Reeves' muntjac while that is still feasible.

AB  - Losing aggressive contests may impact survival, reproductive success and animal welfare. Previous experience plays an important role in shaping contest behaviour, but less is known about how individual variation in learning abilities influences contest dynamics and resource-holding potential. Here, we investigated whether learning performance (acquisition learning and reversal learning) in domestic pigs, Sus scrofa, predicts the outcome of a contest against an unfamiliar opponent. While acquisition learning speed did not predict contest outcome, pigs that successfully learned the reversal were more likely to win the contest than pigs that failed to learn the reversal. As expected, weight difference between opponents was also an important factor in predicting contest outcome. Our results suggest that cognitive flexibility may confer an advantage in contests, unless pigs already have a substantial weight advantage over their opponent. These findings advance our understanding of the role of cognitive processes in animal contests and suggest that promoting cognitive flexibility may reduce the potential welfare impacts arising from stressful social defeat. Further research is required to determine whether cognitive flexibility influences assessment strategy and allows pigs to resolve contests with fewer costs. (c) 2024 The Author(s).

AB  - The morphology of insect-induced galls contributes to defences of the gall-inducing insect species against its natural enemies. In terms of gall chemistry, the only defensive compounds thus far identified in galls are tannins that accumulate in many galls, preventing damage by herbivores. Intrigued by the fruit-like appearance of the translucent oak gall (TOG; Amphibolips nubilipennis, Cynipidae, Hymenoptera) induced on red oak (Quercus rubra), we hypothesized that its chemical composition may deviate from other galls. We found that the pH of the gall is between 2 and 3, making it among the lowest pH levels found in plant tissues. We examined the organic acid content of TOG and compared it to fruits and other galls using high-performance liquid chromatography and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Malic acid, an acid with particularly high abundance in apples, represents 66% of the organic acid detected in TOGs. The concentration of malic acid was two times higher than in other galls and in apples. Gall histology showed that the acid-containing cells were enlarged and vacuolized just like fruits mesocarp cells. Accumulation of organic acid in gall tissues is convergent with fruit morphology and may constitute a new defensive strategy against predators and parasitoids.

AB  - Plants can detect neighbouring plants through a reduction in the ratio between red and far-red light (R:FR). This provides a signal of plant-plant competition and induces rapid plant growth while inhibiting defence against biotic stress, two interlinked responses designated as the shade avoidance syndrome (SAS). Consequently, the SAS can influence plant-herbivore interactions that could cascade to higher trophic levels. However, little is known about how the expression of the SAS can influence tritrophic interactions. We investigated whether changes in R:FR affect the emission of herbivore-induced plant volatiles (HIPVs), and whether these changes influence the attraction of the zoophytophagous predator Macrolophus pygmaeus. We also studied how the expression of the SAS and subsequent inhibition of plant defences affects the reproduction of M. pygmaeus in both the presence and absence of the greenhouse whitefly (WF) (Trialeurodes vaporariorum) as arthropod prey. The results show that changes in R:FR have little effect on HIPV emissions and predator attraction. However, a reduction in R:FR leads to increased reproduction of both the predator and the WFs. We discuss that shade avoidance responses can increase the population development of M. pygmaeus through a combination of reduced plant defences and increased herbivore densities.

AB  - Lowland and highland Peromyscus maniculatus populations display divergent, locally adapted physiological phenotypes shaped by altitudinal differences in oxygen availability. Many physiological responses to hypoxia seem to have evolved in lowland ancestors to offset episodic and localised bouts of low internal oxygen availability. However, upon chronic hypoxia exposure at high elevation, these responses can lead to physiological complications. Therefore, highland ancestry is often associated with evolved hypoxia responses, particularly traits promoting tolerance of constant hypoxia. Environmentally induced DNA methylation can dynamically alter gene expression patterns, providing a proximate basis for phenotypic plasticity. Given each population's differential reliance on plasticity for hypoxia tolerance, we hypothesised that lowland mice have a more robust epigenetic response to hypoxia exposure, driving trait plasticity, than highland mice. Using DNA methylation data of tissues from the heart's left ventricle, we show that upon hypoxia exposure, lowland mice chemically modulate the epigenetic landscape to a greater extent than highland mice, especially at key hypoxia-relevant genes such as Egln3. This gene is a regulator of the gene Epas1 that is frequently targeted for positive selection at high elevation. We find higher methylation among wild highland mice at gene Egln3 compared to wild lowland mice, suggesting a shared epigenetic ancestral response to episodic and chronic hypoxia. These findings highlight each population's distinct reliance on molecular plasticity driven by their unique evolutionary histories.

AB  - Challenging students to independently design and implement experiments is a powerful way to teach the scientific method while engaging with STEM-related course material. For ecology and organismal biology, such experiences often take the form of field work. The COVID-19 pandemic presented formidable challenges for instructors of such courses: How can students conduct any experiments, much less ones of their own design, when they might not even have access to campus? Here we describe a student-led field project exploring invertebrate herbivory in terrestrial plant systems. Designed to flexibly accommodate student groups working either in-person, remotely, or both, the project would be suitable for invertebrate biology, plant biology, or general ecology courses at the college or high school level. We describe our implementation in two sections of a sophomore-level course, provide specific advice based on our experiences, make suggestions for future improvements or adaptations, and provide all the written materials that instructors would need to implement this in their own teaching.

AB  - Buffalo breeding in Italy is becoming increasingly economically attractive, with milk production in the Lazio region growing by 15% since 2004. However, the optimal physical characteristics of total mixed rations (TMR) have not been thoroughly investigated. This lack of research suggests the need for greater attention to the physical characteristics of diet, which, combined with its chemical properties, may negatively impact milk yield (MY) and milk quality (MQ), as seen in dairy cows. Therefore, the objective of this study was to assess the effect of diet composition, with a particular focus on the physical component, on MY and MQ, and apparent digestibility (AD) of dairy buffaloes. The study was conducted on 10 dairy buffalo farms in Amaseno valley (Italy). Monthly samples of TMR, faeces, and bulk milk were collected over a 12-month period, alongside interviews with farmers to gather information on MY and diet composition. The results revealed a high variability in the physical-chemical composition of diets across farms, attributable to differences in feeding management practices. Both chemical and physical component were found to be associated with MY, MQ and AD changes. A ration poor in roughage and rich in concentrate negatively affected MQ showing lower milk fat, and higher somatic cells count and milk urea, while a greater presence of coarse particles and high fibre were associated with lower MY. Nevertheless, coarse particles and aNDF were positively associated with milk clotting parameters and aNDF digestibility. Our study emphasised the high importance of fibre for improving MQ of dairy buffaloes.
   Particle size distribution of dairy buffalo diet is affected by raw material and feeding management.Dairy buffalo unbalanced diets (rich in fibre and low in starch) can negatively affect milk yield.Physical characteristics of diets can positively affect milk clotting parameters of buffalo milk.

AB  - Yaks have evolved several breeds or genetic resources owing to their geographical and ecological environment, and investigating the genetic construction of body size among breeds is key for breeding. Here, a genome-wide association study (GWAS) was performed for five body size traits in 31 yak breeds and genetic resources. The information from clustering individuals according to their habitats was used for kinship grouping in the compressed mixed linear model (CMLM). We named this approach the pCMLM method. A total of 3,584,464 high-quality single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were obtained, and six markers were found to be significantly associated with height by pCMLM. Four candidate genes, including FXYD6, SOHLH2, ADGRB2, and OSBPL6, were identified. Our results show that when CMLM cannot identify optimal clustering groups, pCMLM can provide sufficient associated results based on population information. Moreover, this study provides basic information on the gene localization of quantitative traits of body size among yak breeds.

AB  - This study elucidates the role of free volume in the aging dynamics of the Kob-Andersen (KA) model through temperature cycling experiments. By examining the relationship between free volume and key phenomena such as aging, rejuvenation, and memory effects, we clarify how free volume influences the aging process in this system. Our results reveal a strong correlation between local free volume and the fraction of fast-moving particles, both of which significantly affect the dynamic susceptibility. This indicates that aging dynamics are largely governed by rapidly relaxing particles residing in regions of larger local free volume. Notably, we find no evidence of rejuvenation effects, in contrast to previous reports on the Weeks-Chandler-Andersen (WCA) system; however, memory effects are observed and attributed to minimal local structural rearrangements during aging. Taken together, these findings contribute to a more detailed molecular-level understanding of aging dynamics and provide valuable perspectives on the complex behavior of glassy systems.

AB  - Hypertension, if untreated, can disrupt the blood-brain-barrier (BBB) and reduce cerebral flow in the central nervous system (CNS) inducing hippocampal atrophy, potentially leading to cognitive deficits and vascular dementia. Spontaneous hypertensive rats (SHR) demonstrated neuroplastic alterations in the hippocampus, hyperlocomotion and memory deficits in males. Cerebrolysin (CBL), a neuropeptide preparation, induces synaptic and neuronal plasticity in various populations of neurons and repairs the integrity of the BBB. This research aims to investigate the behavioral outcomes in locomotion and recognition memory in the Novel Object Recognition Test (NORT) and assess the neuroreparative effect of CBL on the cytoarchitecture of neurons and the spine density in pyramidal neurons of the prefrontal cortex (PFC), the entorhinal cortex (EC) and the CA1 region of the dorsal hippocampus, as well as spheroidal neurons of the dentate gyrus (DG). Our findings indicate that SHR exhibited elevated diastolic and systolic pressures, and increased locomotion. Importantly, CBL treatment improved recognition memory in SHR strain. Hypertension led to reduced arborization in the EC, CA1, and DG regions. Moreover, CBL treatment increased arborization in both normotensive and hypertensive rats in the CA1, and DG regions of hippocampus and EC and selectively increased spine density in the hippocampus of hypertensive rats. These findings suggest that CBL neurotrophic treatment enhances recognition memory and promotes dendritic growth or spine density, depending on the neurochemical environment within the brain.

AB  - This work aimed to establish whether the temperature humidity index (THI) under different intertropical zones affects the retention of cytoplasmic droplets (CDs), sperm function and DNA integrity in boars. With this purpose, two separate studies were devised. In the first one, 49 boars from six farms were collected every 45 days (230 ejaculates). THI were measured daily, and sperm parameters were evaluated. Boars were classified into three groups based on the incidence of ejaculates having more than 25% spermatozoa with CDs: persistent (at least three consecutive ejaculates), moderate (less than three ejaculates) and absent (no ejaculate having >= 25% spermatozoa with CDs). Farms were classified based on THI through cluster analysis into two groups. In the second study, 32 liquid-stored semen samples were classified based on three cluster analysis: low and high incidence of proximal (PCDs), distal (DCDs) CDs and a combination of PCD and DCDs. high THI farms presented significantly (p < .05) higher proportions of boars with moderate and persistent incidence of CD than those with low THI. In study 2, the presence of PCDs was negatively correlated with sperm DNA integrity (r = -0.691; p < .01). However, differences between groups were more apparent when ejaculates were classified based on both PCDs and DCDs than when PCDs or DCDs were considered separately. In conclusion, classification of boars according to the severity and persistence of CDs in boars allows understanding more clearly the dynamics of CD retention and the effects of ambient temperature and relative humidity. Additionally, the joint analysis of both PCDs and DCDs is necessary in routine sperm quality analyses.

AB  - Hu sheep are renowned for their adaptation to high-temperature, humid environments and their high fecundity. Despite serving as the founder species for sheep breeding in China, the genetic mechanisms underlying these desirable traits and the breed's origin have remained unresolved. To address the longstanding challenges in understanding their adaptations and origins, comprehensive analyses utilizing genetic data is conducted from over 300 Hu sheep and approximate to 200 other Chinese native sheep. The study unveils the migration history of sheep and the formation of the Hu sheep in eastern China. By employing multiple screening methods, this study identifies that the BMPR1B, UNC5C, and GRID2 synergistically contribute to the high fecundity trait in Hu sheep. The coexistence of beneficial genotypes in these genes increase the likelihood of multiple births. Notably, the results suggest a potential coevolution between environmental adaptation and reproductive traits in this breed. Overall, the study provides novel insights into the genetic origin and adaptation of Hu sheep, offering new perspectives for molecular breeding in sheep and other livestock species.

AB  - The ongoing interplay among plants, insects, and bacteria underscores the intricate balance of defense mechanisms in ecosystems. Regurgitant bacteria directly/indirectly impact plant immune responses, but the underlying mechanism is unclear. Here, we focus on the interaction between regurgitant bacteria, diamondback moth (DBM), and plant. Six culturable bacteria were isolated from DBM gut regurgitant, including three Enterobacter strains (RB1-3), Micrococcus sp. (RB4), Staphylococcus haemolyticus (RB5), and Bacillus cereus (RB6). These RB strains suppressed genes related to jasmonic acid and glucosinolate signaling pathways but had little effect on salicylic acid signaling pathway genes in Arabidopsis thaliana wounds. RB1 and RB5 inhibited DBM development on A. thaliana but not on an artificial diet. RB1 and RB5 significantly suppressed GOX genes and proteins in DBMs. However, the Pxgox2 insect mutant strain inoculated with RB1 or RB5 did not significantly affect DBM feeding on A. thaliana compared to the wild type. Six RB have been functionally identified, with RB1 and RB5 negatively regulating GOX-mediated host adaptability. The deliberate addition of RB1 and RB5 can negatively affect DBM herbivory and fitness. Our study provides a molecular basis for the further application of RB for insect pest management by modulating insect-plant interactions.

AB  - Simple Summary The cell membrane of spermatozoa is the main structural element of these gametes. In boars, due to its structure, it is most susceptible to various types of damage induced by various factors. Artificial insemination in pigs mainly involves the use of liquid semen preserved at 17 degrees C. Thus, it is important to monitor this semen during its storage. In practice, the changes that can take place in sperm during the preservation and storage of boar semen are not analysed. Furthermore, considerable variation is observed in the characteristics of boar semen, which may depend on the breed or crossbreeding variant of the boar. Crossbred boars are often used in artificial insemination, because they not only easily produce ejaculates with good parameters, but also have good libido characteristics. However, despite the benefits of artificial insemination with semen of crossbred boars, there is insufficient knowledge of the sensitivity of cell structures to conditions associated with semen storage in comparison with boars of the parent breeds. For this reason, a study was conducted to analyse changes in the integrity of sperm cell membranes taking place during the storage of semen collected from Duroc x Pietrain crossbred boars and purebred boars of the parent breeds. The sperm of Duroc x Pietrain crossbred boars were found to be less sensitive to the conditions of semen storage and to better retain cell membrane integrity than the sperm of purebred males, which was confirmed by calculating the heterosis effects for semen assessed at different hours of storage at 17 degrees C. The aim of the study was to assess changes in the integrity of sperm cell membranes during the storage of semen collected from Duroc x Pietrain crossbred boars and purebred boars of the component breeds. To compare the cell membrane integrity of sperm heads in crossbred and purebred boars, heterosis effects were estimated. The study was conducted on 48 ejaculates collected from Duroc x Pietrain crossbred boars and from purebred Duroc and Pietrain boars used for artificial insemination. Microscope slides were prepared from each ejaculate for the evaluation of the cell membrane integrity of the sperm, at 1, 24, 48, 72, and 96 h after collection of the ejaculate. Diluted ejaculates were stored at 17 degrees C. Sperm membrane integrity was analysed by two methods: SYBR-14/PI and eosin-nigrosin. Our results showed that the cell membrane integrity of sperm heads changed with storage time, but the extent of the changes varied depending on the genetic group of boars. The semen of Duroc x Pietrain crossbreds was clearly seen to be less sensitive to storage conditions than that of boars of the parent breeds, which was confirmed by the calculated heterosis effects. The percentage of sperm with an intact cell membrane was higher in crossbred boars than in purebred boars (p <= 0.05). In addition, significantly fewer moribund sperm spermatozoa and spermatozoa with a damaged cell membrane were observed in crossbred boars (p <= 0.05). In the semen of purebred Duroc and Pietrain boars, the cell membrane integrity of the sperm should be assessed more often during storage than in the semen of Duroc x Pietrain crossbred boars. This study provides valuable information for the development and implementation of semen quality monitoring in crossbred boars and boars of the parent breeds during storage at 17 degrees C with respect to the cell membrane structure of sperm heads.
   The evaluation methods used effectively identify damage to the cell membranes of the sperm during semen storage.

Dental morphology, jaw-muscle activity patterns, mandibular movements, and tongue manipulation work to facilitate oral fragmentation of dietary items. While processing mechanically challenging foods, mammals modulate mandibular movements and bite forces via recruitment of greater jaw-adductor muscle forces and protracted biting or chewing. Because jaw-loading patterns are influenced by magnitude; frequency; and duration of muscular, bite, and reaction forces during routine feeding behaviors, relatively larger jaws are thought to be more characteristic of mammals that experience higher masticatory loads due to the processing of mechanically challenging foods. The ease of food fracture during post-canine biting and chewing is mainly determined by food stiffness and toughness. Such foods have been associated with increased loading magnitude and/or greater amounts of cyclical loading (i.e., chewing duration). Dietary properties are thought to modulate cyclical loading through changes in chewing frequency and chewing investment. On the other hand, chewing frequency has been found to be independent of dietary properties in rabbits and primates; however, little evidence exists regarding the influence of dietary properties on these parameters in a broader range of mammals. Here, we assessed chewing behavior in seven adult llamas (Llama glama) processing foods with a wide range of mechanical properties (grain, hay, carrots, and dried corn). Each subject was filmed at 60 frames/s, with video slowed for frame-by-frame computer analysis to obtain length of feeding bout and number of chewing cycles for each food type. These parameters were used to calculate chewing frequency (chews/s), chewing investment (chews/g), and chewing duration (s/g). Chewing frequency was not significantly related to mechanical properties of food, but chewing investment and chewing duration were significantly related to dietary stiffness and toughness. Therefore, cyclical loading is positively influenced by stiff and tough foods. This suggests that variation in jaw morphology in extinct and extant mammals is positively related to dietary stiffness and toughness, which requires greater chewing investment and increased chewing duration.

AB  - Non-volatile metabolites constitute the bulk of plant biomass. From the perspective of plant-insect interactions, these structurally diverse compounds include nutritious core metabolites and defensive specialized metabolites. In this review, we synthesize the current literature on multiple scales of plant-insect interactions mediated by non-volatile metabolites. At the molecular level, functional genetics studies have revealed a large collection of receptors targeting plant non-volatile metabolites in model insect species and agricultural pests. By contrast, examples of plant receptors of insect-derived molecules remain sparse. For insect herbivores, plant non-volatile metabolites function beyond the dichotomy of core metabolites, classed as nutrients, and specialized metabolites, classed as defensive compounds. Insect feeding tends to elicit evolutionarily conserved changes in plant specialized metabolism, whereas its effect on plant core metabolism varies widely based the interacting species. Finally, several recent studies have demonstrated that non-volatile metabolites can mediate tripartite communication on the community scale, facilitated by physical connections established through direct root-to-root communication, parasitic plants, arbuscular mycorrhizae and the rhizosphere microbiome. Recent advances in both plant and insect molecular biology will facilitate further research on the role of non-volatile metabolites in mediating plant-insect interactions.

AB  - In Calabria (Southern Italy) naturally occurring asbestos (NOA) mainly occurs in the ophiolitic sequences cropping in the Mount Reventino area. The most common type of asbestos detected was the amphibole tremolite; fibrous antigorite and minor chrysotile were also found. The development of asbestos-related diseases depends on, among other things, the morphological characteristics of fibers, length and width, affecting the durability of asbestos fibers in the lung. In this work fifteen lung samples of sheep, goats and wild boars, grazing around the Mount Reventino area were collected and asbestos fibers analysed. Observed fibers (357), of which 97 % were tremolite and 3 % antigorite fibers, were grouped according to species, grazing area and age of the animals. The aim of this work was to highlight any differences among the groupings and to compare our size results with data in literature related to exposed populations. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) highlighted a positive correlation between tremolite fiber length and width and revealed groupings in terms of animal age. The Kruskal-Wallis test showed statistically significant differences between fiber mean widths in young and old animals. 63 % observed asbestiform fibers were longer than 5 mu m and 7 % of the fibers were longer than 20 mu m (critical fiber length connected to the frustrated phagocytosis by the macrophage). Fibers conforming to the Stanton Hypothesis size (predictor of the carcinogenic potency of fibers) were 1 %. Our size parameters of fibers detected in the animal lungs were in fairly good agreement with literature data for human asbestos exposure to tremolite.These results confirmed that an animal-sentinel system could be used to monitor the natural background of the airborne breathable fibers exposure. In addition, the size correlation of animal-human breathed fibers could be useful to study their potential toxicity. Additional data are necessary for improving the agreement with human exposure data.

AB  - The larvae of five dipteran species were reared on artificial diets under controlled laboratory conditions. Usually, these species complete their life cycles in perishable, filthy, unhygienic, and foul-smelling natural diets, which hinder rearing work and affect the laboratory environment. More importantly, these unaltered foods do not allow for true conformity in rearing protocols. The addition of a standard artificial diet to rearing protocols would make it possible to conduct ecological, biological, and forensic investigations with greater accuracy and precision. To address this problem, we formulated a new artificial diet for larvae and tested its performance on five different fly species (Calliphora vicina, Lucilia sericata, Sarcophaga argyrostoma, Musca domestica, and Hermetia illucens). We compared the development of larvae reared on an artificial diet with that of larvae reared on beef liver and pig muscle. The results showed no differences in development time between the two groups. However, our results showed that the artificial diet facilitated the rearing of flies for forensic and medical purposes by standardizing the nutritional value of the diet, improving laboratory conditions, and providing a more hygienic and cost-effective food substrate.

AB  - After mammalian ovulation, oocytes enter the oviduct, causing oocyte and oviduct changes. Some studies have shown that follicular fluid exosomes (FEVs) play an important role in this regulatory process, but the specific mechanism is remains unclear. Here, we investigate the effect of FEVs on autophagy and on the synthesis and secretion of oviductal glycoprotein 1 (OVGP1) in yak oviduct epithelial cells (OECs). We added FEVs to yak OECs and collected samples at intervals. The effect of autophagy on OVGP1 synthesis and secretion was detected by manipulating the level of autophagy in OECs. The results showed that autophagy gradually increased as early as 6 h after exosome intake level increased, and the increase was most obvious 24 h after. At that time, the synthesis and secretion of OVGP1 also reached its highest levels. When the autophagy level of OECs is changed through the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway, OVGP1 synthesis and secretion levels also change, along with the OVGP1 levels in oviduct exosomes also change. More importantly, the addition of FEVs treatment while using 3-MA to inhibit the autophagy level in yak OECs did not change the synthesis and secretion level of OVGP1. Our results indicate that FEVs can affect the synthesis and secretion of OVGP1 by regulating the level of autophagy in OECs, and that the completion of this process may depend on the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway, indicating that exosomes and autophagy play important roles in the reproductive physiology of yak OECs. Our results provide new ideas in to characterizing the role of exosomes in yak reproduction.

AB  - Wildlife populations can be unmarked, meaning individuals lack distinguishing features for individual identification. Populations may also exhibit non-independent movements, meaning individuals move together. For populations of either unmarked or non-independent individuals, models based on spatial capture-recapture (SCR) approaches can be used to estimate abundance, density, and other parameters critical for monitoring, management, and conservation. However, when individuals are both unmarked and non-independent, few model options are available. One approach has been to apply unmarked models and not address the non-independence despite unquantified impacts on bias, precision, and the ability to make robust ecological inferences. We conducted a simulation study to quantify the impact of non-independence on the performance of spatial count (SC) and spatial partial identity models (SPIM) - two SCR-based unmarked modeling approaches - and used the performance of fully marked and independent SCR as a reference. We varied the levels of non-independence (aggregation and cohesion), detection probability, and the number of partial identity covariates used to resolve identities in SPIM estimation. We expected abundance estimates to be increasingly biased and precise as aggregation and cohesion increased. Results showed that models indeed became less robust to increasing non-independence, but importantly suggested that only SPIM could be reliably applied under low levels of cohesion when sufficient partial identity covariates are available. SC yielded consistently biased estimates with poor precision. SCR was consistently robust across combinations of aggregation and cohesion, as expected. We therefore advise against the use of SC models for estimating population parameters when individuals are known to be non-independent, caution that SPIM may be used under narrow ecological conditions, and encourage continued investigations into sampling design and methods development for estimating populations of unmarked and non-independent individuals.

AB  - Coat colour patterns are important characteristics of many cattle breeds and in some are determined by a chromosomal translocation, which can have the pleiotropic effect of testicular hypoplasia. We test the hypothesis that this variant, known as the Cs-29 allele, is prevalent in the ancient Chillingham White Cattle (Bos taurus) of north-east England. Its distribution may provide insights into breed history, and as it is associated with reproductive anomalies, we investigated the issues of subfertility in this cattle herd which are of clear relevance to its conservation. We report that the cattle are homozygous for the translocation. As it is also known in other breeds of the England-Scotland border and northern Irish area, namely the White Galloway and Irish Moiled, and in the Northern Finncattle and Swedish Mountain, we further hypothesize a Scandinavian connection for White Galloway, Irish Moiled and Chillingham cattle. We present unpublished data showing testicular hypoplasia to be present at Chillingham. Sperm quality is also known to be very low, and the question arises as to how the highly inbred (F-is = 0.92) Chillingham cattle have continued to survive in spite of these reproductive anomalies. Surprisingly, herd fertility has not declined over the last 160 years, and in the light of behavioural data, we propose this is probably because of multiple mating, there being no castration and only welfare culling in this herd. These findings have wide relevance, particularly for breeds of conservation importance and probably for other bovine species, because male subfertility, frequent in cattle generally, could restrict the choice of bulls for representation in gene banks with consequent risk of loss of lineages. Research on heterospermic insemination or multiple mating of cattle could, therefore, be a useful complement to the development of assisted reproduction technologies for cryoconservation.

AB  - This study aimed to investigate whether the intensity of lighting may affect Duroc boars' semen parameters in different seasons and in different periods from the beginning of the use of boars for semen collection. A total of 6879 ejaculates were collected from 21 boars and kept under natural low light intensity and daylight length conditions, and 3141 ejaculates from 10 boars were kept under high light intensity (190-210 lx) and natural daylight length conditions. Experimental groups were divided according to the intensity of lighting (low, high), season (winter, spring, summer, fall), and the period from the beginning of the use of boars for semen collection (0-1 year, 1.1-2 years, 2.1-3 years). Selected parameters were analyzed: semen volume, sperm concentration, total number of sperms, sperm motility, percentage of sperms with an abnormal morphology and number of insemination doses from one ejaculate. Semen volume, sperm concentration, and rate of sperms with an abnormal morphology were associated with the two-way interaction between light intensity and season (P < 0.0001), and between light intensity and period from the first semen collection (P < 0.0001). The total number of sperms and number of insemination doses from one ejaculate were associated with the two-way interaction between light intensity and season (P < 0.0001). Sperm motility was associated with the twoway interaction between light intensity and season (P < 0.0001), and between light intensity and period from the first semen collection (P < 0.01). In conclusion, the intensity of lighting can affect Duroc boars' semen parameters in different seasons and different periods from the beginning of the use of boars for semen collection.

AB  - The potential of sulphur (S), MgSO4 (Mg), and KH2PO4 (P) in nitrogen retention, ammonia emission decrease, and microbial community succession during composting needs to be investigated. To achieve this, different levels of S (0, 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, and 0.8% in dry weight) plus Mg and P (S + Mg + P) were progressively added in 70 days pig manure aerobic composting. The results revealed that the amendment increased salinity and lowered pH and dephytotoxication of the product with the increase of S amount. However, no significant inhibition effects were observed on the evolution of the thermophilic phase and product maturity. In addition, the amendment significantly reduced the total NH3 and N2O emissions by 29.66%-58.81% and 20.6%-56.7%, increased NH4+ level by 17.22%-73.21% in thermophilic phase and NO3  content by 26.17%-57.48% in a mature phase, and elevated the total Kjeldahl nitrogen content by 34.28%-46.6% during the composting. In addition, compared to the control, the supplement markedly encouraged the formation of guanite in the compost product. The S addition stimulated the growth of Anseongella, Actinomadura, Chelativorans, Castellaniella, Luteimonas, and Ster-oidobacter microbial communities which functioned well in the degradation of nitrogen-containing compounds and organic matter. Evidence from Redundancy Analysis, Firmicutes, Myxococcus, Chloroflexi, Gemmatimonadota, and Deinococcota showed positive correlations with pH. These results imply that adding S-Mg-P amendment encourages the population and activity of specific functional microorganisms, and facilitated the ammonia emission reduction by lowering pH and thus reserved nitrogen through the formation of guanite during com-posting. The investigation of bacterial community abundance and environmental variables at the phylum and genus levels over time revealed that adding of 0.6% S in conjunction with P and Mg minerals was suitable for nitrogen loss mitigation in composting. The findings suggest using S + Mg + P supplement to conserve nitrogen in pig dung aerobic composting.

AB  - Background The restoration of lake ecosystems requires a good knowledge of the lake's history and the driving mechanism of environmental changes. In this study, we used Lake Datong, the largest inland lake in Hunan Province China, as an example to study the effects of aquaculture, based on historical data of aquatic creature, diatom inferred-total phosphorous (DI-TP) data, and an Ecopath model. Lake Datong has undergone several stages of aquaculture from 1980, with a rapid increase in fish production and fish feed supplementation at each stage. Its water quality has deteriorated since the introduction of aquaculture and the lake has become moderate eutrophic status. Results According to the DI-TP data, before 1930, Lake Datong was in a mesotrophic status (50-60 mu g/L DI-TP). Between 1930 and 1980, the number of nutrient-tolerant species increased slightly, which indicates a nutrient increase in the lake (66-83 mu g/L DI-TP). From the 1980s to 2010 and especially since 2000, eutrophication increased rapidly, with eutrophic species dominating the diatom assemblage, such as Stephanodiscus hantzschii, S. minutulus, and a sudden decrease in Aulacoseira granulata (< 10%). The annual average DI-TP concentration was 202 mu g/L. After 2010, DI-TP decreased to 127-152 mu g/L. In 2019, consumer biomass in Lake Datong was very low because the large-scale aquaculture was restricted by local government. The biomass of submerged macrophytes was relatively high, indicating that excessive primary producers had not been used by consumers and therefore, had not entered the food web. This led to a reduction in the energy transfer efficiency (TE) of the ecosystem. Conclusions The succession of the water ecosystem of Lake Datong is reappeared by DI-TP analysis and historical reference data. Lake Datong has experienced four stages of eutrophication succession following the introduction of aquaculture activities, with dramatic changes in the composition and biomass of its aquatic creatures. After comprehensive management in 2017, the consumer biomass of Lake Datong was at a relatively lower level, and the biomass of submerged macrophytes was higher, meaning a large quantity of primary producers had not been used by consumers, thus had not entered the food web, which consequently reduces the energy TE of the ecosystem. Future management needs to pay attention to making a suitable macrophyte harvest plan, stocking herbivorous and omnivorous fish, and establishing rational fishing, which can not only enhance the energy flows and nutrient cycling of the ecosystem, but also improve the food web structure. Our results provide important reference values and theoretical support for decision-makers and stakeholders in the subsequent management of similar shallow lake-water ecosystems.

AB  - Physical and chemical defenses of seeds are essential for plant survival and reproduction. By protecting their seeds from herbivores and other threats, plants can ensure that their offspring have a better chance of surviving and growing into adult plants. Plant seed-size variation can affect their ability to allocate defense resources and nutrients. Smaller seeds tend to contain fewer resources and are likely to be more constrained in resource allocation to defense or to nutrient supply for the germinating seedling than larger seeds. In this study, we hypothesized that (1) the trade-off between physical and chemical defenses and reserve materials (in this study TNC content) in seeds is related to the allocation of those resources to seeds, 2) the direction of allocation of these resources is mediated by seed size. Based on seeds of 77 woody plant species collected in the K & oacute;rnik Arboretum located in western Poland, we measured several physical and chemical seed traits: seed mass, total phenols, tannin content, crude fiber, lignin content, and total non-structural carbohydrates. We revealed that chemical defense (phenol content) and total non-structural carbohydrates increased with seed mass, whereas physical defense (fiber content) had the opposite effect. We found that the trade-off between physical and chemical defense in plants was often mediated by seed size.

AB  - Melatonin receptor MT1, encoded by the MTNR1A gene, is the main one involved in the seasonal regulation of reproductive activity. A correlation between this gene polymorphism and reproductive performance has been demonstrated in sheep. To date, no data about MTNR1A gene polymorphism are available regarding Italian goat breeds other than the Sarda goat. This study aimed to detect any PCR-RFLP polymorphic sites of MTNR1A using MnlI and RsaI enzymes in Northern Italian goat breeds, which are characterized by a pronounced reproductive seasonality. One-hundred-eight adult female goats belonging to four different breeds were included in the study (i.e., Frisa Valtellinese, n = 29; Orobica, n = 23; Lariana, n = 29; Camosciata delle Alpi, n = 27). Blood was sampled from each goat. Genomic DNA was extracted from each sample and the main part of exon II of MTNR1A gene was amplified by PCR and digested with MnlI and RsaI enzymes. Unexpectedly, none of the fragments were found to be polymorphic. The absence of polymorphism may be linked to the macro group of goat breeds that evolved during human migrations. Breeds of the Alpine-European strain would appear to show no polymorphism, as confirmed by our study, whereas breeds belonging to the Mediterranean-African or Asian-Middle Eastern strains do.

AB  - Sexually dimorphic ungulates often show differences in habitat use between sexes; however, information on seasonal changes in habitat use according to sex and the presence of offspring is scarce. This study aimed to clarify the seasonal differences in habitat use of sika deer (Cervus nippon) according to sex, age, and the presence of offspring in the highly seasonal habitats of the subalpine zone of Mount Fuji, Japan. Habitat use varied across seasons and substantial differences according to sex and the presence offspring were observed in summer. In summer, males frequently used habitats with abundant forage (forest edges). Conversely, while females without offspring frequently used habitats with abundant forage (forest edges) and safety (flat terrain), females with offspring preferred safer habitats (forest interior, areas far from mountain trails, and flat terrain) instead. These results revealed that males, females without fawns, and females with fawns prioritized food intake over safety, both food intake and safety, and safety, respectively. These patterns reflect differences in vulnerability to predation and in strategies to maximize reproductive success. The habitat use of females with fawns changed drastically from summer to autumn: in autumn, they prioritized not only safety but also food conditions, suggesting that their habitat use changed seasonally as vulnerability declined with fawn growth.

AB  - Understanding the dietary patterns of large carnivores is a key feature of their niche and addresses their ecological role in ecosystems. The striped hyena (Hyaena hyaena) is a large carnivore distributed in many arid and semi-arid regions of the world and its diet is largely understudied in its range. We studied the dietary patterns of striped hyenas in the anthropogenic landscape, located in the semi-arid region of Rajasthan, India. We collected and analyzed a total number of 127 scat samples from November 2019 to February 2022. The relative biomass and frequency of occurrence of the large-sized prey species (>30 kg) were higher in the striped hyena's diet. However, the species requires a wide range of smaller prey to enrich its diet and a total of twenty-one prey species have been recorded in the hyena diet. The diet diversity of the striped hyena computed by the Shannon-Weiner Index (H) was 3.28. The proportion of prey in the scats indicated that very large to large and mediumsized prey accounted for 95.7% of total dietary biomass and was mostly preferred by striped hyenas, which was probably consumed through scavenging. Livestock (cows, buffaloes, sheep, camels, and dogs) accounted for 56.54% of total dietary biomass. The higher amount of presence of livestock mammals in the scats suggests that striped hyenas may frequently visit human settlement areas, which could be influenced by high carcass availability. The presence of small prey such as mongoose, hares, foxes, and rats indicate that the striped hyenas might partially hunt the smaller animals or opportunistic feed. This study added to our understanding of the striped hyena's feeding ecology in areas where anthropogenic food is quite abundant compared to wild prey. Hence hyenas benefit from anthropogenic food scavenging, whereas humans benefit from the non-lethal nature of hyenas and waste removal.

AB  - Light quality and chemicals in a plant's environment can provide crucial information about the presence and nature of antagonists, such as competitors and herbivores. Here, we evaluate the roles of three sources of information-shifts in the red:far red (R:FR) ratio of light reflected off of potentially competing neighbors, induced metabolic changes to damage by insect herbivores, and induced changes to volatile organic compounds emitted from herbivore-damaged neighboring plants-to affect metabolic responses in the tall goldenrod, Solidago altissima. We address the hypothesis that plants integrate the information available about competitors and herbivory to optimize metabolic responses to interacting stressors by exposing plants to the different types of environmental information in isolation and combination. We found strong interactions between the exposure to decreased R:FR light ratios and damage on the induction of secondary metabolites (volatile and non-volatile) in plants. Similarly, the perception of VOCs emitted from neighboring plants was altered by the simultaneous exposure to spectral cues from neighbors. These results suggest that plants integrate spectral and chemical environmental cues to change the production and perception of volatile and non-volatile compounds and highlight the role of plant context-dependent metabolic responses in mediating population and community dynamics.

AB  - Public perception of large carnivores is heterogeneous and contrasting attitudes of various stakeholder groups may create barriers to effective management. The most prominent disparities occur between hunters and conservationists. While dissatisfaction among hunters may lead to increased instances of illegal killing as a form of protest, conservationists' disapproval can impact public opinion, potentially eroding trust in management policy. We conducted a survey across Slovakia (n = 1071) to understand how different stakeholders perceive current management of the Eurasian lynx (Lynx lynx) and to identify key commonalities and potential conflicts of interests. We found broad consensus among stakeholders regarding high intrinsic value of lynx in Slovak nature and low potential for conflict regarding livestock damages caused by lynx. Majority of respondents, including hunters (63%), foresters (63%), and farmers (62%), supported the legal protection of lynx in Slovakia. Our study also demonstrates widespread support of the Slovak public (75%-88%) for reintroduction programs using Slovak lynx population as a resource. However, the majority of respondents (65%-75%) supported using primarily orphans and rehabilitated lynx for these programs. The greatest polarization between hunters and conservationists was observed in issues related to lynx population status and lynx heaving an impact on roe deer population. Approximately half of hunters believed lynx population over the past 20 years increased and that lynx poses a threat to the roe deer population, with over a third advocating for legal lynx hunting. These attitudes likely lead to the relatively widespread illegal killing on over similar to 50% of the lynx distribution range in Slovakia. Our data suggest that increasing public awareness of lynx, implementing adaptive science-based management, and involving hunters in citizen science and management decisions might be the most effective way to develop policies balancing conservation goals with the socio-cultural context of human-large carnivore coexistence.

AB  - Simple Summary The study of animal movement in wild, free ranging species is fundamental for advancing knowledge on ecosystem relationships and for conservation. The deployment of bio-logging devices to this purpose (often GPS-collars in large mammals) requires relatively invasive procedures, such as capture, handling and release. Capture and manipulation cause behavioural modifications that are largely understudied in wild species and may affect both the welfare of animals and the output of the studies. We evaluated post capture and release ranging behaviour responses of a small deer species (roe deer Capreolus capreolus) for five different capture methods across 14 study sites within the EURODEER collaborative project. Roe deer showed modifications in their movement behaviour, independently of the capture method. However, individuals recovered rapidly, converging towards the average behaviour within a relatively short interval of time (between 10 days and one month), demonstrating a general resilience to such stressful events. We encourage researchers to continually adapt capture and handling methods so as to minimize stress and prioritize animal welfare. The fitting of tracking devices to wild animals requires capture and handling which causes stress and can potentially cause injury, behavioural modifications that can affect animal welfare and the output of research. We evaluated post capture and release ranging behaviour responses of roe deer (Capreolus capreolus) for five different capture methods. We analysed the distance from the centre of gravity and between successive locations, using data from 14 different study sites within the EURODEER collaborative project. Independently of the capture method, we observed a shorter distance between successive locations and contextual shift away from the home range centre of gravity after the capture and release event. However, individuals converged towards the average behaviour within a relatively short space of time (between 10 days and one month). If researchers investigate questions based on the distance between successive locations of the home range, we recommend (1) initial investigation to establish when the animals start to behave normally again or (2) not using the first two to three weeks of data for their analysis. We also encourage researchers to continually adapt methods to minimize stress and prioritize animal welfare wherever possible, according to the Refinement of the Three R's.

AB  - China is the world's largest producer and consumer of pork. Thus, identifying the dominant factors influencing hog production is important to promote the sustainable development of hog production. However, few studies have analyzed the dominant factors influencing and their degree of influence on hog production. This study investigated the spatial distribution of hog production in Jilin Province at county scale using a geographic information system (GIS). Then, the dominant factors influencing hog production were analyzed by geographical detection. Moreover, the degree of influence of dominant factors on hog production was measured using the ordinary least squares (OLS) model and geographically weighted regression (GWR) model. Finally, the spatial heterogeneity of dominant factors influencing hog production was measured using the GWR model. Results indicated that the total, largest, and least pork in 2019 were 1,070,409 t in Jilin Province, 99,810 t in Lishu County, and 637 t in Korean Autonomous County of Changbai, respectively. The results also showed that the total output of agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, and fishery; employees in the primary industry; vegetable yield; cultivated land area; elevation; maize yield, and rural population were dominant factors influencing hog production. Furthermore, the results demonstrated that the accuracy of the regression results of the GWR model was better than that of the OLS model. The results also indicated that the GWR model had the advantage of spatially non-stationary detection, which can accurately explain the relationship between hog production and its influencing factors in local fine detection and significantly improve the accuracy of regression results. Such results could improve spatial layout planning of hog production, and structural adjustment of animal husbandry.

AB  - In social insects, individuals of working caste coordinate their actions to manage various collective tasks. Such collective behaviours exist not only in workers but also in winged reproductives (alates). During certain seasons, newly emerged alates fly from the nest to disperse and find mating partners in a synchronized manner. This 'swarming' behaviour is one of the collective behaviours that involve the greatest number of individuals in social insects. However, such synchronization is considered to be caused by the response to specific environmental cues rather than behavioural coordination among colony members. Here, we show that a termite Reticulitermes kanmonensis shows synchronized dispersal flight among alates within the same colony even under the constant temperature environment. Under the semi-field environment with fluctuating temperatures, alates within the same colony synchronized their dispersal flight under higher temperatures, while flight was suppressed under lower temperatures. We observed that termites synchronized their dispersal flights even under constant temperature conditions in the laboratory (20 degrees C), indicating that environmental cues are not always necessary for synchronization. In either case, higher synchronization happened with a larger number of alates. These results suggest that social factors interplay with environmental cues to enable the synchronized swarming flight of social insects.

AB  - Trypanosomes are parasitic protozoa that cause severe diseases in humans and animals. The most important species of Trypanosmes include Trypanosoma evansi and Trypanosoma brucei gambiense. The most well-known human diseases are sleeping sickness in Africa and Chagas disease in South America. The most identified animal diseases include Nagana in the African tsetse fly belt and Surra in South Asia, North Africa, and the Middle East. Surra is caused by Trypanosoma evansi. Diminazene resistance is an emerging threat caused by T. evansi infecting animals. The underlying mechanism of diminazene resistance is poorly understood. Trypanosoma brucei gambiense causes African sleeping sickness. The development of diminazene resistance in Trypanosoma brucei gambiense is associated with the alterations in the corresponding P2 adenosine transporter-1 (AT-1) gene. In the present study, by extrapolating the findings from Trypanosoma brucei gambiense, we analyzed genetic diversity in the P2 adenosine transporter-1 gene (AT-1) from T. evansi to explore a potential link between the presence of mutations in this locus and diminazene treatment in ruminants. We examined T. evansi-infected blood samples collected from goats, sheep, camels, buffalo, and cattle in seven known endemic regions of the Punjab province of Pakistan. Heterozygosity (He) indices indicated a high level of genetic diversity between seven T. evansi field isolates that had resistance-type mutations at codons 178E/S, 239Y/A/E, and 286S/H/I/D/T of the P2 adenosine transporter-1 (AT-1) locus. A low level of genetic diversity was observed in 19 T. evansi field isolates with susceptible-type mutations at codons A178, G181, D239, and N286 of the P2 adenosine transporter-1 (AT-1) locus. Our results on T. evansi warrant further functional studies to explore the relationship between diminazene resistance and the mutations in AT-1.

AB  - Hormonally active tumours are characterized by production and secretion of hormones, irrespective of endogenous feedback mechanisms. An adult llama had exuberant oestrous behaviour, infertility, elevated concentrations of oestradiol and a large ovarian mass. Necropsy revealed the presence of two large abdominal masses, one effacing the right ovary and one in the mesocolon. Considering the clinical and histopathological findings, we conclude that the llama was affected by a granulosa cell tumour. The case suggests that granulosa cell tumours in camelids are hormonally active, and the clinical presentation resembles that of other large animal species. To our knowledge, this is the first case report of an oestrogen-producing, metastatic granulosa cell tumour in a llama.

AB  - Changes in hydrologic and climatic trends will influence the ecology of Florida, and climate scenarios agree that many areas of Florida are susceptible to sea-level rise impacts. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service's Climate Change Action Program focuses on a framework to examine climate change effects on fish, wildlife, plants, and habitats of all three. To follow the program, this study examines how to incorporate current scientific knowledge about regional climate projections in U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service analyses. It provides climate change and sea-level rise projections based on 2017 projections, information on changes in tropical cyclones, temperatures, and precipitation. This study also examines future effects of sea-level rise on existing habitat from saltwater intrusion of the freshwater lens below Big Pine Key. Projections of future sea-water elevations will periodically be reached or exceeded well before 2040 from short-term, stochastic, and extreme events (e.g., king tides and storm surge), and will increasingly inundate the root zone before complete saltwater intrusion. Future trends were connected to 2017 stakeholder-driven conversations about adaptation strategies to develop a suite of actions for creating temporary or permanent freshwater resources. However, beyond 3 ft (0.9 m) of sea-level rise, there are few adaptation options available for the Florida Key deer beyond relocations outside of the Florida Keys. Overall, the approach of connecting future environmental trends to assessments of fish and wildlife resources of concern can be transferred to other situations. Additionally, this approach can be used to update these analyses, such as with the recent 2022 sea-level rise updates by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, released after this work was conducted.

AB  - In this article, we present the results for an analysis of charcoal remains from Klasies River main site cave 1. The analysis was done to understand the environmental conditions of the Tsitsikamma Coast during the late Holocene, approximately 2300 cal BP. A high-resolution reflective light microscope (Olympus BX51) with up to 500X magnification was used to analyse the microanatomy of archaeological and comparative wood char-coal, as well as following standard Anthracology procedures. Common woody species from the contemporary Klasies River landscape along with many others from other parts of southern Africa were used to identify archaeological charcoal samples to species. The vascular structures of archaeological and contemporary woody species from Klasies River were also measured and compared so that wood Vulnerability Indices could be calculated. Two species, Protorhus longifolia and Hibiscus cf. tiliaceus, from the archaeological char-coal assemblage indicate that environmental conditions in the Tsitsikamma Coast are no longer suited for their growth. These species currently grow in the east coastal areas and minimally in the eastern highlands of southern Africa where they tolerate a warm climatic setting. Overall, the taxonomic results indicate that more than 80% of the 17 archaeological species identified here are adapted to year-round and summer rain-fall conditions. This is in contrast with the present environmental setting at Klasies River that includes, pre-dominantly, species that prefer year-round and winter rainfall with fewer summer rainfall adapted species. A comparison of the vascular structure of the archaeological woody species against that of contemporary spe-cies indicates that the archaeological Klasies River landscape received relatively higher rainfall levels in the Late Holocene than it does presently. We conclude that the Klasies River landscape, located in the year-round rainfall region of southern Africa, supported differing amounts of winter and summer rainfall-adapted woody vegetation through time. During the late Holocene, c. 2300 cal BP, environmental or climatic conditions were more favourable for summer rainfall-adapted woody species to thrive better than at present. The same woody vegetation was also less adapted to aridity than that found in the area today.& COPY; 2023 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V. on behalf of SAAB.

AB  - The unsustainable demand for wildlife and its derivatives poses a threat to global biodiversity, requiring attention and intervention. This study investigates the intent to purchase medicines containing saiga antelope horn among respondents in China. Drawing on an expanded theoretical framework rooted in a planned behavior model, and analyzing 576 valid data points collected through online research, this paper employs a structural equation model to consider influencing factors across six dimensions: attitude, subjective norm, perceived behavioral control, consumption experience, protective cognitive level, and personal characteristics. The findings reveal that 31.25% of respondents harbor a positive purchase intention toward medicines containing saiga antelope horn. Additionally, attitude, subjective norm, perceived behavioral control, and consumption experience exhibit positive associations with the purchase intention, while the protective cognitive level demonstrates a negative impact. A significant gender gap was identified, with women displaying a greater inclination to purchase compared to men. To support the global conservation efforts of the saiga antelope, this paper advocates for strategic interventions. Recommendations include reinforcing public science education, fostering awareness, advancing the research and development of alternative medicines, strengthening internal market controls, and employing targeted marketing strategies to shift consumer preferences. These measures collectively contribute to a holistic approach aimed at reducing the demand for wildlife products and safeguarding the saiga antelope population.

AB  - Prior to its extirpation in the 1960s, Ovis canadensis texianus (a subspecies of desert bighorn sheep, DBS) occupied 16 mountain ranges in the Trans-Pecos Region of Texas. Restocking efforts relied on translocating individuals of DBS from Arizona, Nevada, Utah, and Mexico. One recipient site, Elephant Mountain Wildlife Management Area (WMA), now the primary source-stock for translocations in Texas, was examined to measure its genomic ancestry compared to other DBS from the Great Basin, Mojave, and Sonoran deserts. Genomic data (5,434-62,749 single nucleotide polymorphisms) were used to estimate kinship, inbreeding, and effective population size across three time periods (2000, 2017, and 2019). Individuals genetically were most similar to DBS from the Gabbs Valley Range and Muddy Mountains, Nevada (Mojave DBS lineage). Strong signatures of inbreeding were not detected among individuals. In addition, genetic pedigree reconstruction revealed familial relationships, including a four-generation pedigree, and indicated 39.51% and 41.89% of individuals translocated in 2017 and 2019, respectively, were parent-offspring or full-sibling pairs, suggesting capture methods tend to sample highly related individuals. In 2017, population estimates for Elephant Mountain WMA indicated 182 individuals with an effective population size (N-e) of 65, whereas in 2019, N-e was 92 with an estimated population size of 186. Although reintroduction efforts to Elephant Mountain WMA were successful, recurrent epizootic events since 2019 have reduced the population sizes of DBS across the Trans-Pecos Region. Our data illustrate how population genomics and overall assessments of genetic diversity can and should be used to guide management and conservation of DBS.

AB  - Simple Summary To elucidate the differences in milk protein compositions and mammary gland functions between yaks of standard lactation (TL yaks) and prolonged lactation (HL yaks), iTRAQ technique was used to compare the skim milk proteins in the two yak groups. A total of 202 differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) were revealed, among which 109 proteins were up-regulated and 93 were down-regulated in the milk of HL yaks compared to TL yaks. The bioinformatics analysis revealed that the differences in skim milk protein between the HL yaks and the TL yaks suggests that the mammary gland of the HL yak is at a degeneration stage. Extended lactation is a common phenomenon in lactating yaks under grazing and natural reproduction conditions. To elucidate differences in milk protein compositions and mammary gland functions between yaks of standard lactation (TL yaks) and prolonged lactation (HL yaks), whole milk samples of TL yaks and HL yaks (n = 15 each) were collected from a yak pasture at the northwest highland of China. The iTRAQ technique was used to compare the skim milk proteins in the two yak groups. A total of 202 differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) were revealed, among which 109 proteins were up-regulated and 93 were down-regulated in the milk of HL yaks compared to TL yaks. Caseins including kappa-casein, alpha s1-casein, alpha s2-casein, and beta-casein were up-regulated in HL yak milk over 1.43-fold. The GO function annotation analysis showed that HL yaks produced milk with characteristics of milk at the degeneration stage, similar to that of dairy cows. KEGG enrichment showed that the metabolic pathways with the most differences are those that involve carbohydrate metabolism and the biosynthesis of amino acids. The present results highlight detailed differences in skim milk proteins produced by HL yaks and TL yaks and suggest that the mammary gland of HL yak is at the degeneration stage.

AB  - In forest ecosystems, gross primary production (GPP) is the fundamental supporting service under ecosystem management. Energy uptake maintains ecosystem structure and functioning on different trophic levels, including for first-order consumers (herbivores) and second- and higher-order consumers (carnivores) in the hierarchy of energy flow through the ecosystem. In boreal conditions, the scarce availability of nitrogen is among the main factors limiting gross primary production. Carbon uptake is further controlled by temperature, air humidity, atmospheric CO2, and the availability of soil water. GPP releases oxygen into the atmosphere and binds atmospheric carbon in biomass. Carbon remains in the ecosystem for some time but is lost to the atmosphere in respiration and oxidative processes.

AB  - Rewilding is a conservation strategy used to restore ecosystems to previous states and can involve the reintroduction of large carnivores into areas from where they had been previously extirpated. Whilst rewilding has been important for ecosystem functioning, it can have negative implications for naive prey that have had no exposure to the presence of large carnivores. Therefore, understanding prey responses to the reintroduction of predators is crucial for management and conservation. We assessed the effects of reintroduced cheetahs (Acinonyx jubatus) on the vigilance of two species of naive prey: the steenbok (Raphicerus campestris) and the springbok (Antidorcas marsupialis). We hypothesized that both species would increase their vigilance behaviour post-cheetah reintroduction, but that the steenbok would demonstrate a greater response due to their smaller body size and more solitary nature. To test this, we compared the vigilance of both species before and after the reintroduction of cheetahs. Both species increased vigilance within one year post-cheetah reintroduction, but the steenbok demonstrated a much stronger response with a similar to 70% increase in the percentage of time spent vigilant post-cheetah reintroduction. Springbok levels of vigilance were lower (similar to 50% increase), which we suggest is a function of body-size and/or grouping behaviour. Importantly, we showthat naive prey species are able to exhibit a rapid response to the reintroduction of large carnivores. However, the variation in responses highlights the importance of species-level monitoring after large carnivore reintroductions.

AB  - Ammonia (NH3) is a major cause of odor emissions from swine farms, and exposure to high concentrations of NH3 in short-term periods has been reported to cause respiratory and systemic disorders in pigs. However, the impact of long-term NH3 exposure on pig health and productivity remain unknown. This study aimed to assess the impact of long-term NH3 exposure on growth performance and pathological outcomes in pigs. Pigs were reared in the treatment room [34.8 mg/m3 NH3 concentration (50 ppm); TRT group, n = 40] and the control room [5.6 mg/m3 (8 ppm); CON, n = 40]. The experimental period was 107 days (from weaning piglets to market age). Our findings revealed that long-term NH3 exposure results in severe respiratory and systemic pathological lesions, including chronic tracheitis, epithelial metaplasia of the trachea, severe interstitial pneumonia, myocarditis, and interstitial nephritis. In addition, the TRT group exhibited reduced productivity, with two deaths, indicating that uncontrolled NH3 concentrations on pig farms could be linked to a decline in growth performance and even death. Transcriptomic analysis revealed significant changes in immune and inflammatory pathways in lung from TRT pigs, including dysregulated cytokine signaling and incomplete inflammatory responses. The enrichment of DEGs in pathways, such as Cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction, JAK-STAT, and Toll-like receptor signaling, indicated chronic NH3 exposure disrupted immune homeostasis, contributing to chronic inflammation and impaired tissue repair. In conclusion, this study provides valuable insights into the detrimental effects of NH3 exposure on pig health and productivity under farm conditions.

AB  - Rhizocephalan barnacles are parasites of crustaceans that are known for dramatic effects on hosts, including parasitic castration, feminization, molt inhibition, and the facilitation of epibiosis. Most research on rhizocephalans has focused on carcinized hosts, with relatively little research directed to shrimp hosts that may experience distinct consequences of infection. Here, we describe a high-prevalence rhizocephalan-shrimp system in which multiple host changes are associated with infection: the dock shrimp Pandalus danae infected by the rhizocephalan Sylon hippolytes. In field-collected P. danae, infection by Sylon was associated with development of female sex characters at a smaller size and greater probability of epibiosis. Standardized video observations showed that infected P. danae performed grooming activities at higher rates than uninfected shrimp, suggesting that inhibited molting rather than direct behavioral modification is a likely mechanism for higher epibiosis rates. There was no difference in the composition of grooming behavior types or in general activity between infected and uninfected shrimp. Fatty acid compositions differed with infection, but total lipid concentrations did not, suggesting that parasite-driven shifts in host resource allocation were compensated or redirected from unmeasured tissues. Our results show that Sylon alters its host's role by provisioning an epibiotic substrate and also that it influences host physiology, resulting in feminization and fatty acid shifts. This study lays the groundwork for expanding rhizocephalan-shrimp research and encourages recognition of oft-ignored roles of parasitism in ecological communities.

AB  - Tail biting in pigs is a harmful behavioural disorder that negatively affects their welfare. Nutrition has played a crucial role in improving farm efficiency; however, an imbalance in key nutrients is an accepted risk factor for tail biting. The exact contributing factors and the level of risk associated with inadequate nutrition remain unclear. We aimed to assess the effect of dietary protein level on harmful social behaviours in finishing pigs before and after an abrupt dietary change. A total of 80 pigs (Duroc x (Landrace x Large White)) were assigned to this trial over two batches. Pigs were housed in mixed sex groups of 10 and assigned to one of two treatments at 12 weeks of age. These consisted of a control treatment (CON) containing 15.5% Crude Protein (CP) and a low CP treatment (LowCP) containing 13.5% CP. The abrupt dietary change occurred at 16 weeks of age (71.45 kg) in batch 1 and at 15 weeks of age (67.04 kg) in batch 2. This change in diet led to a 1.2% drop in CP in the CON treatment and a 1.4% drop in CP in the LowCP treatment. Behavioural observations were performed before and after the diet change and largely focused on the pigs' social behaviour. Using a "hurdle" model analysis, we investigated whether diet, diet change or sex influenced: 1) the probability that a behaviour was not performed, and 2) the frequency and/or duration when the behaviour was performed. The LowCP treatment led to an increased duration of limb-directed behaviour (P = 0.03) when performed at all, and also an increased duration of 'tail-in-mouth' behaviour (P = 0.02) in males but not females. However, LowCP did not affect the level of ear-directed behaviours in this way (P > 0.05). An increase in standing frequency occurred after the abrupt diet change (P = 0.04). Our study indicates that a small reduction in dietary protein and sex affect behaviour in the finishing phase, with some impacts on important harmful social behaviours. Furthermore, an effect of abrupt diet change on behaviour is suggested, which will require further confirmation.

AB  - A stage-structured matrix population model for the invasive perennial grass Nassella trichotoma (nassella tussock) was used to compare a wide range of hypothetical grubbing and biocontrol management options in a population of 19 visible plants ha(-1) on a typical sheep and beef cattle-grazed farm in North Canterbury, New Zealand. The model has two soil seed banks (ephemeral and persistent), five plant size classes, seed production and ground cover-dependent population growth reaching a carrying capacity of 35,000 plants ha(-1) (80% ground cover) in the absence of management. Elasticity analyses showed that population growth (lambda) was most sensitive to plant size class transitions and relatively insensitive to the soil seed bank transitions, seedling recruitment and seed production, implying management targeting the growth and/or survival of plants will be most effective. This conclusion was supported by population trajectory simulations which revealed that a biological control agent attacking seeds or seedlings would need to be 99.8% effective to achieve the population stability achieved under current management where 34.4% of the plants are grubbed annually. By contrast, a biological control agent attacking tillers and reducing plant transitions (growth) across all size classes by 30% annually gave a population trajectory equivalent to that achieved by annual grubbing. In the presence of annual grubbing, a combination of seed- and tiller-feeding agents giving 10% reductions in fecundity and plant growth, respectively, reduced the population density by 60%. Overall, the modelling shows that relaxing the current practice of annual grubbing (by reducing the rate or frequency of grubbing) whether in spring or autumn will result in the growth of N. trichotoma populations in North Canterbury. It also indicates that a biocontrol agent that impedes tiller production in N. trichotoma plants could potentially be an effective replacement for, or adjunct to, annual grubbing.

AB  - The invasive spotted lanternfly (Lycorma delicatula) poses a significant threat to the US grape and wine industry. Spotted lanternfly feeding affects crop yield and fruit quality while increasing production costs through the increased use of insecticides for its management. This insect has a broad host range with tree of heaven and grapevines being preferred hosts. Although spotted lanternfly can develop when feeding solely on grapevines, the extent to which different grape cultivars support its survival and reproduction is less clear. We investigated the effect of grapevines and tree of heaven diets on spotted lanternfly survival, development, and reproduction. We fed nymphs and adults on either single or mixed diets of tree of heaven and 4 grapevine cultivars: 'Cabernet Franc' (Vitis vinifera), 'Chardonnay' (V. vinifera), 'Concord' (V. labrusca), and 'Sugargate' (Muscadinia rotundifolia). We found that single Sugargate diets supported spotted lanternfly development only to the fourth-instar stage. The development time was consistent across diet treatments, but reproduction varied significantly. Spotted lanternfly fed exclusively on grapevines had limited reproductive capability, with only 2 out of 5 females in the Chardonnay treatment laying a single egg mass each, averaging 13 eggs. While spotted lanternflies fed on mixed diets or single tree of heaven laid an average of 2.53 egg masses and 89.7 eggs per female. In conclusion, some single grapevine diets support development to adulthood but reproduction is limited without tree of heaven. This suggests that reducing tree of heaven near vineyards could help growers manage spotted lanternfly populations and minimize crop damage.

AB  - The nutrition of captive species profoundly affects their physical, behavioral, and psychological wellbeing. Determining a species' ideal zoo diet remains challenging, necessitating assessment of an animal's responses to their diet to establish best practices, including any effects on behaviors. This study investigates the behavioral responses of five female giraffes (Giraffe camelopardalis) to browse from four tree species (willow, Salix caprea; hawthorn, Crataegus monogyna; hazel, Corylus avellana; oak, Quercus robur). This study aimed to assess the effect of browse species on giraffe activity and to identify which of these species was most associated with performance of key welfare indicators. Given this species' adaptations to foraging on spinose (i.e., thorny) trees, we predicted that hawthorn would have the largest effect on giraffe behavior. Focal sampling of individual giraffes was conducted, with equal repetitions for each browse species, across spring and summer 2021 and 2022 at Marwell Zoo. Giraffes were observed for an hour with browse, followed by an additional hour after a 30-minute pause to quantify post-browsing behaviors. Results suggest that willow increased overall browsing time, while oak elicited prolonged interaction with initial browse branches. Willow promoted the highest bark stripping and bite counts, while oak and willow increased time ruminating. Contrary to expectation, hawthorn, with its thorny defences, did not significantly extend browsing or rumination. Social context also influenced browsing behavior with heightened browsing activity occurring when giraffe browsed with other species present. While a case study of four tree species at one zoo, our results show the importance of measuring and assessing animal choice and preferences (regarding their engagement with husbandry) to underpin best practice approaches to care and welfare.

AB  - Syngnathid fishes (seahorses and pipefish) are unique in reproduction, with males becoming pregnant and giving birth. The brood pouch provides osmoregulation, gas exchange, waste transport, immunoprotection and nutrition supply. However, the function of hormone trafficking is rarely studied. By injecting the mixture liquor of human chorionic gonadotrophin (HCG, 2 IU/g) and luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone A3 (LHRH-A3, 5 ng/ g) into the brood pouch of Hippocampus erectus, we found the reproductive interactions accelerated dramatically, and 4 pairs were successfully mated. After 24 h, the inner epithelium was highly folded and the loose connective tissue layer was highly distended. In the inner tissue layer of the brood pouch, fibroblasts secreted vigorously, blood vessels multiplied and expanded, indicating the physiological structure of the brood pouch modified hastily from the unpregnant stage to the progravid phase. Correspondingly, transcriptome results revealed the gene expression of circadian, epitheliogenesis, angiogenesis, lipid transfer, and spermiogenesis were significantly up-regulated. We innovatively found that macromolecule exogenous hormone (HCG) can be not only efficiently transported from brood pouch to body, but also promote mating and the physiological changes of the brood pouch.

AB  - Macroalgae availability is thought to be a major driver of the diet of marine herbivores. In subtropical regions, macroalgal biomass is highly seasonal and the diet of herbivores usually varies accordingly. In Sargassum beds in the Gulf of California, Tripneustes depressus and Eucidaris thouarsii dominate the invertebrate fauna and feed on macroalgae, though they represent different trophic levels. The objective of this study was to relate the availability of macroalgae with their potential contribution to the diet of both sea urchins. Macroalgae biomass and composition in Sargassum beds were analyzed in contrasting seasons (winter and summer) at four sites. Also, the food sources and the percent contribution of selected sources were determined by a mixing model analysis using stable isotope values (13C and15N). In winter and summer, brown macroalgae attained the highest biomass, followed by red and green macroalgae. Red macroalgae showed the highest number of taxa and brown macroalgae the highest biomass. In T. depressus, the red (Gracilaria pachydermatica, Laurencia pedrochei) and brown (D. flabellata and Sargassum horridum) macroalgae made the highest contribution to their diet, consistent with the higher availability of these macroalgae in the local flora throughout the year. In E. thouarsii, mixing model indicate that the red algae Polysiphonia pacifica and G. pachydermatica were the macroalgae species with the greatest contribution to its diet.(c) 2022 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Contamination of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) from animals is a serious issue as they may spread to human pathogenic bacteria. The reduction of ARG contamination from livestock waste is thus essential. High solid anaerobic digestion (HSAD) is a new and effective technology although some aspects, such as change charac-teristics of ARGs at different reaction stages, have not been fully investigated. This study focused firstly on the variations in ARGs at different reaction stages in HSAD systems with five different starting methods: 1 natural start (the control) and 4 rapid starts by changing leachate reflux forms. The results showed that the rapid starting methods could accelerate start-up and increase biogas production by 312.5%. The starting and acidification stages showed higher microbial richness and diversity compared with the other stages. ARGs found to be reduced at acidification stage. Variation in ARGs at the starting and acidification stages was mainly driven by a com-bination of microbial community, mobile genetic elements (MGEs), and environmental factors; while the main contributory factors at the gas production stage were biomass and several unexplained factors. At the ending stage, the main driving factors were biomass and microbial communities. Most of the potential hosts (16/20) of the ARGs belonged to the Firmicutes phylum, which showed the lowest connections with the ARGs at the gas production stage.

AB  - Many field observations of the biological effects of the Fukushima nuclear accident have been reported in the first decade after the accident. A series of observational and experimental studies have demonstrated causal adverse effects on the pale grass blue butterfly even at the low-level radiation exposure in the "field," contrary to the dosimetric view that insects are generally tolerant of radiation exposure. However, it has been demonstrated that the pale grass blue butterfly is tolerant of high oral doses of anthropogenic radioactive cesium (Cs-137) under "laboratory" conditions. This field-laboratory paradox can be explained by ecological field effects; for example, radiation stress in the field causes physiological and biochemical changes in the host plant, which then trophically affects butterfly larvae. The second decade of butterfly-based Fukushima research will be devoted to demonstrating how such adverse field effects occur. Changes in the host plant's nutritional contents likely affect butterfly physiology. The host plant may also upregulate secondary metabolites that affect herbivorous insects. The plant may be affected by changes in endophytic soil microbes in radioactively contaminated areas. If demonstrated, these results will reveal that the delicate ecological balances among the butterfly, its host plant, and soil microbes have been affected by radioactive pollution in Fukushima, which has important implications for environmental policies and human health.

AB  - Most researchers assume cattle avoid milkweeds due to toxic compounds. However, observations suggest cattle graze common milkweed (Asclepias syriaca L.), an important summer host plant for monarch butterflies (Danaus plexippus L.) east of the Rocky Mountains, as well as showy milkweed (Asclepias speciosa Torr.). This directly relates to efforts to add over 1 billion stems of milkweed for monarch butterfly conservation. We sampled whether cattle regularly graze common/showy milkweed in a central Nebraska restored prairie patch-burn-grazing system with patches burned in the year of the main study (2018) or previous years (2017-2016). We also sampled burned control grasslands without livestock. This sampling therefore compared three different types of burn-graze management. Cow-calf pairs were put onto the grasslands in April, and we sampled every 2 wk through September. We found that wild grazers (e.g., deer) were not grazing common/showy milkweed stems in control grasslands, whereas by August > 73% of stems had been grazed in the patch-burn-grazed grasslands-with no noticeable negative effects on cattle. Also, cattle grazing of common/showy milkweed did not differ significantly in different patches, even though big bluestem grass (Andropogon gerardii Vitman) was grazed significantly more in patches burned in 2018. Finally, milkweed abundance in control grasslands ranged from 34- to 185-fold higher than the average milkweed abundance in patch-burn-grazed grasslands. These results suggest that cattle regularly graze common/showy milkweed and that patch-burn-grazing does not increase milkweed abundance when cattle begin grazing in April. The good news of these results is that cattle safely grazed low amounts of common/showy milkweed, suggesting control efforts for these milkweeds are often unnecessary. Future work should examine how to increase milkweed abundance without affecting cattle weight gain, possibly by deferring grazing in some areas during critical milkweed growth periods.

AB  - The stoichiometric knife-edge refers to the reduced performance of consumers encountering food with excess phosphorus (P) relative to carbon (C) or nitrogen (N). Studies that provide evidence for such knife-edge in aquatic systems often apply phosphate supplementation to create P-rich food treatments. However, this method may suffer from artifacts, because after uptake algae may store P in a form different from the P-rich biomolecules typically consumed by zooplankton. Our aim was to test if P supplementation results in potential biases. We experimentally exposed populations of the herbivore rotifer species, Brachionus calyciflorus (Pallas), to four different food quality treatments: algae grown under P-saturating (HPchem, molar C:P ratio = 59.7 +/- 2.7) and P-sufficient (MPchem, molar C:P = 116.3 +/- 5.2) conditions in chemostats, and algae grown under P-limiting conditions, but with molar C:P ratios equal to HPchem and MPchem treatments, respectively (HPLP+P, molar C:P = 59.8 +/- 0.14; MPLP+P, molar C:P = 121.0 +/- 4.3). The latter two treatments were achieved through P-supplementation of P-limited algae. Results show that for rotifers fed algae with either excess or intermediate P content, population growth rates were consistently higher on algae grown in chemostats than algae treated with the P supplementation method. Importantly, growth rates were also consistently lower in HP than in MP treatments and the magnitude of this negative impact was independent on algal growth history. The latter result confirms the existence of a stoichiometric knife-edge and indicates that P supplementation is a reliable method to study the relative effect of excess P on zooplankton performance in a standardized way.

AB  - Many organisms change their phenotype in response to the environment, a phenomenon called phenotypic plasticity. Although plasticity can dramatically change the phenotype of an organism, we hardly understand how this can affect biotic interactions and the resulting phenotypic selection. Here, we use fast cycling Brassica rapa plants in an experiment in the greenhouse to study the link between plasticity and selection. We detected strong plasticity in morphology, nectar, and floral scent in response to different soil types and aphid herbivory. We found positive selection on nectar and morphological traits in hand- and bumblebee-pollinated plants. Bumblebee-mediated selection on a principal component representing plant height, flower number, and flowering time (mPC3) differed depending on soil type and herbivory. For plants growing in richer soil, selection was stronger in the absence of herbivores, whereas for plants growing in poorer soil selection was stronger with herbivory. We showed that bumblebees visited tall plants with many flowers overproportionally in plants in poor soil with herbivory (i.e., when tall plants were rare), thus causing stronger positive selection on this trait combination. We suggest that with strong plasticity under most stressful conditions, pollinator-mediated selection may promote adaptation to local environmental factors given sufficient heritability of the traits under selection.

AB  - Ecologists and evolutionary biologists have revealed that adaptive microevolution (i.e., allele frequency changes through time) and behavioral changes occur rapidly enough to affect contemporary ecological dynamics, and we can consider rapid adaptation for better conservation and management of wild populations. However, previous studies tended to focus on adaptation that increases population densities (e.g., evolutionary rescue), and did not pay attention to adaptation that decreases population densities (e.g., evolutionary suicide). Here, we demonstrate that controlling trait adaptation may be potentially important for decreasing population densities. One possibility is introducing "selfish" genotypes to populations. If the genotypes increase their reproductive success at the expense of population growth (e.g., cheaters in subsocial ants or coercive males in damselflies), we can decrease population densities (intraspecific adaptation load). The other possible option is diverting trait values of animals from the value that maximizes population growth (ecological trap). For example, we may be able to change behavior of a deer population by hunting so that they will not approach the best habitat with ample resources (landscape of fear). Then, we can consider the optimal allocation of our effort to directly decrease their population densities and control their trait values. However, we should carefully conduct controlling trait adaptation because it may result in unintended outcomes through modified genetic compositions and behaviors, such as increasing genetic variation of the focal population that enhances adaptation to changing environments by introducing selfish genotypes or a transient increase of population densities by modified behaviors.

AB  - Manure management is a significant source of global methane emissions, and there is an increased interest in understanding and predicting emissions. The hydrolysis rate of manure organic matter is critical for understanding and predicting methane emissions. We estimated hydrolysis rate constants of crude protein, fibers, and lipids and used the Arrhenius equation to describe its dependency on temperature. Simultaneously, measurements of methane emission, 13/12C isotope ratios, and methanogen community were conducted. This was achieved by incubating fresh pig manure without inoculum at 10 & DEG;C, 15 & DEG;C, 20 & DEG;C, and 25 & DEG;C for 85 days in a lab-scale setup. Hydrolysis of hemicellulose and cellulose increased more with temperature than crude protein, but still, hydrolysis rate of crude protein was highest at all temperatures. Results suggested that crude protein consisted of multiple substrate groups displaying large differences in degradability. Lipids and lignin were not hydrolyzed during incubations. Cumulative methane emissions were 7.13 & PLUSMN; 2.69, 24.6 & PLUSMN; 8.00, 66.7 & PLUSMN; 4.8, and 105.7 & PLUSMN; 7.14 gCH4 kgVS-1 at 10 & DEG;C, 15 & DEG;C, 20 & DEG;C, and 25 & DEG;C, respectively, and methanogenic community shifted from Methanosphaera toward Methanocorpusculum over time and more quickly at higher temperatures. This study provides important parameter estimates and dependencies on temperature, which is important in mechanistic methane emission models. Further work should focus on characterizing quickly degradable substrate pools in the manure organic matter as they might be the main carbon source of methane emission from manure management.
   Fresh pig manure was incubated at 10-25 & DEG;C to determine hydrolysis rates, Arrhenius kinetics, and methane production rates.Lipids and lignin were not hydrolyzed at 10-25 & DEG;C, hence not contributing to methane production.Quickly degradable substrates are a major carbon source of methane production.Methane emission and methanogenic diversity depended on storage temperature.

AB  - Triatoma sanguisuga (Leconte) is one of the most widely distributed kissing bugs in the United States, associated with an extensive zoonotic circulation of Trypanosoma cruzi, the agent of Chagas disease, in a large part of the country. However, the actual risk for human infection in the United States is poorly understood. Here, we further assessed the ecology of T. sanguisuga bugs collected in residents' houses in Illinois and Louisiana, using a metagenomic approach to identify their blood-feeding sources, T. cruzi parasites and gut microbiota. Blood meal analysis revealed feeding on domestic animals (dogs, cats, pigs, goats, and turkeys), synanthropic species (raccoons, opossums, and squirrels), as well as the more sylvatic white-tail deer. Human blood was identified in 11/14 (78%) of bugs, highlighting a frequent vector-human contact. The infection rate with T. cruzi was 53% (8/15), and most infected bugs (6/8) had fed on humans. A total of 41 bacterial families were identified, with significant differences in microbiota alpha and beta diversity between bugs from Louisiana and Illinois. However, predicted metabolic functions remained highly conserved, suggesting important constraints to fulfill their role in bug biology. These results confirmed a significant risk for vector-borne transmission of T. cruzi to humans in Louisiana and Illinois, which warrants more active screening for human infections. Also, while there is broad plasticity in the bacterial composition of T. sanguisuga microbiota, there are strong constraints to preserve metabolic profile and function, making it a good target for novel vector control strategies.

   Newly formed earth structures such as ski slopes are areas causing difficulties in attempts for efficient sodding since colonization with plants, where initial development and adaptation are hindered due to unfavourable climatic and soil factors. The main objective of the study was to demonstrate the feasibility of using nonwoven fabrics made from sheep's wool and waste poultry feathers on steep-gradient mountain slopes.
   Material and methods
   Biodegradable geotextiles can be used not only to protect seeds and soil from washout, but also to promote turf development and improve soil microbial quality. During the experiment, plant growth was monitored together with microbial frequency changes.
   Results and conclusions
   The results showed that the application of nonwoven fabrics after sowing a mix of grasses and clover had many advantages including the acceleration of seedling germination, improvement of plant initial development, and increase in the number of plants per square metre. The ultimate biostimulation effect was found to be strongly dependent on geotextile biodegradability, grammage and the fleece structure. The best yield was obtained with the nonwoven grammage within the range of 150-180 g center dot m(-2). The promotion of plant growth and, in particular, the development of the root system had a significant positive impact on the population of soil microbiota.

AB  - Trindade Island has lost much of its original vegetation cover as a result of approximately three centuries of human occupation and intense herbivory caused by invasive mammals. Since the eradication of some of these herbivores, the recovery of some plant species has started. Plantago trinitatis is an endemic herb from Trindade Island, which was considered extinct until 1998, when it was rediscovered in the higher areas of the island. The regeneration of the species was attributed to the soil seed bank. This communication reports new records of P. trinitatis close to sea level on Trindade Island, at lower altitude than previously documented. The new records suggest that P. trinitatis is recolonizing the island, but leaves doubts whether sampling gaps in the past have led to the non-detection of the plant in its vegetative form in these locations, emphasizing that other species considered extinct may share this issue. Regardless of recolonization or sampling gaps, the eradication of invasive herbivores is necessary as a strategy to protect local flora and native vegetation. Understanding the population status can help in making decisions about the need of environmental management and species population recovery.

AB  - Vertical behavior, such as diel vertical migration (DVM) and swarming are widespread among zooplankton. At higher latitudes, synchronized DVM is mostly absent during summer and predominantly herbivorous copepods tend to form large near-surface swarms. This behavior is risky because it can make them vulnerable to visual predators. Here, we used ca. 12 days of mid-summer (28 June to 10 July 2018) high-frequency acoustic data collected on board of an autonomous surface vehicle (Sailbuoy) to study the vertical behavioral patterns of a zooplankton community in the Norwegian Sea (69-71 degrees N). Comparing acoustic data with zooplankton net samples, we could distinguish the sound scatters into (1). lipid-rich older developmental stages of Calanus spp., (2). younger developmental stages of Calanus spp., smaller copepods and krill and (3). unknown group of strong sound scatters that may have been younger stages of planktivorous fish. We observed shorter-range classic DVM during much of the study period, where in two days, the migration appeared to be pronounced (> 50 m in amplitude), largely synchronous and occurred in the presence of sound scatterer group 3. The observed zooplankton community was concentrated in the upper 20 m in cloudy and calm days but retreated to greater depths at increased near-surface turbulence. This turbulence-driven vertical retreat appeared to be synchronized across the zooplankton community, potentially indicating a schooling behavior.

AB  - Okapi (Okapia johnstoni) belong to the Giraffidae family and is the only representative of the Okapia genus. The species has been declared as endangered and due to its very elusive nature, little is known about its reproductive behavior. The wild population has continued to decrease over the last decades despite the different conservation programs developed worldwide. Captive breeding is difficult and the European population is not self-sustaining. An alternative tool to prevent the extinction of this charismatic species is the use of assisted reproductive technologies (ART). Specifically, we introduce a novel protocol for the in vitro maturation (IVM) and cryopreservation of matured oocytes obtained post-mortem. Out of sixteen cumulus-oocytes complexes isolated from one deceased individual, four matured metaphase II (MII) oocytes were successfully obtained following IVM. Furthermore, these matured oocytes demonstrated resilience during the vitrification/warming process and underwent sperm injection. Although no embryos were obtained, this study represents the first step towards the application of ART in okapi, providing a foundation for future reproductive interventions aimed at preserving self-sustaining captive populations.

AB  - As a flagship taxa for marine ecosystems, seahorses possess a unique reproductive strategy of "male pregnancy". They are severely threatened by marine petroleum-based pollution but the molecular mechanism involved remains unclear. We evaluated the toxic effects and mechanisms of sub-acute exposure to benzo[a]pyrene (BaP), a representative polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH), at three environmental related dosages (0.5, 5, and 50 mu g/L) on the reproductive organs of sex-role-reversed lined seahorses (Hippocampus erectus). BaP induced ovary, testis and brood pouch tissue damage in a concentration-dependent manner. Transcriptomic results suggested that reproductive organs of the seahorse could undergo biotransformation and detoxification of BaP via the P450 enzyme system; the differential expression of key genes related to these pathways determined the differences in the accumulation of toxic substances in the reproductive organs. Moreover, toxic substances directly induced differential tissue damage in situ by activating tissue-specific signaling pathways: BaP-induced ovarian apoptosis and failure by upregulation of the pro-apoptotic genes, vadc1, traf2b, tnfsf10, and pycard (P < 0.05); inhibition of testicular function through disruption of genes associated with "ECM-receptor interaction", "Tight junction", and "Spermatogenesis" pathways; and interference with brood pouch immune responses, significantly suppressing the expression of ripk1, il-1b, casp3a, apaf1, calr, and canx (P < 0.05), thereby impairing "Apoptosis", "Phagosome", and "Necroptosis" processes, ultimately compromising brood pouch maintenance. Toxic substances exacerbate damage to the reproductive organs in seahorses by disrupting Ca2+ homeostasis. At environmentally-relevant concentrations of BaP, the reproductive efficiency of seahorses may be severely affected, increasing the risk of a decline in the abundance and diversity of wild populations.

AB  - A consistent concern of conservation efforts is that relatively poor local communities often bear a high cost for the conservation of wildlife and biodiversity with high ecological significance. In this study, we quantify the cost to local farmers from tigers, leopards, and elephants in the Khata wildlife corridor, which connects two protected areas adjoining Nepal and India. We collected 12 years of data from the records of a local natural resource management committee and obtained information on local market prices through key informant interviews. The losses came from livestock depredation by tiger (Panthera tigris tigris) and its sympatric felid, common leopard (Panthera pardus), as well as loss of rice paddy by elephant (Elephas maximus). In the Khata wildlife corridor, the annual livestock loss was estimated to be USD 399 for tiger and USD 3,053 for common leopard, and the annual crop loss was USD 2,047 for elephant. Although these sums are relatively small given the ecological value of these species, they pose a heavy burden for the people living in the corridor. National and international efforts should help compensate local people affected by the human-wildlife conflict, both to get their cooperation with local conservation and for reasons of equity in the distribution of benefits.

AB  - To explore the spatiotemporal niche characteristics and changing regularities of insect communities under lamps in a semi-arid region, this paper analyzed Levins' niche breadth index and the Pianka niche overlap index of 10 orders and 19 selected common families or superfamilies of insect communities under lamps from April to September 2018 at six vegetation sites in the Habahu National Nature Reserve, a rare desert grassland-wetland reserve in China. The results indicated the following: (1) Different taxa possess varying spatiotemporal, temporal, and spatial niche breadths, suggesting that insects effectively utilized resources in the Habahu Nature Reserve. (2) Among these groups, in terms of the orders aspect, Lepidoptera had the largest temporal niche breadth, the Hemiptera had the largest spatial niche breadth, and Lepidoptera, Coleoptera, and Hemiptera had relatively large spatiotemporal niche breadths, while Odonata had the smallest niche breadth in all three aspects. The orders of Coleoptera and Lepidoptera had the largest spatiotemporal niche overlap value, while Odonata and Diptera had the smallest. (3) In terms of the common families (superfamilies) aspect, Noctuidae had the largest temporal niche breadth and spatiotemporal niche breadth, while Hydrophilidae had the smallest. The spatial niche breadth of Sphingidae was the largest, while Corixidae was the smallest. Noctuidae and Pyraloidea had the largest spatiotemporal niche overlap value among these herbivore groups, Miridae and Chrysopidae, among the herbivore to predatory groups, and Noctuidae and Braconidae, among the herbivore to parasitic groups. This lays a theoretical foundation for developing Chrysopidae and Braconidae as biological control taxa in the Habahu Nature Reserve.

AB  - The aim of this study was to evaluate the changes of ghrelin, microminerals, antioxidants, and vitamins A, E and C levels during different metabolic periods in high yielding Saanen goats subjected to heat stress. Twenty clinically and paraclinically healthy, high yielding and multiparous goats with an average age of 3 +/- 0.5 years and pregnant with a single fetus were included in this study. Sampling was performed at three different physiologic periods: non-pregnancy non-lactation (P1), four-month gestation (P2), and first month of lactation (P3). In this study, the ambient temperature ranged from 19 to 42 degrees C and relative humidity ranged from 14 to 19% during the hot months. Serum concentrations of ghrelin, glucose (Glu), superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione peroxidase (GPx), vitamins (A, E and C) and microminerals (selenium, manganese, cobalt, iron, copper and zinc) were measured. Mean raw milk yield of the goats per day at the first month of lactation was 2.34 +/- 0.2 kg. Concentration of ghrelin at P1 was significantly lower than P2 and P3 (P < 0.05). Glucose levels were significantly lower at P3 compared with P1 and P2 (P < 0.05). There were no significant correlations between ghrelin and Glu at different periods. Concentrations of selenium and manganese were significantly higher at P3 compared with P2 and were significantly higher at P2 compared with P1. Values of copper at P2 were significantly higher than P1 and P3 (P < 0.05). Zinc levels were significantly higher at P1 compared with P2 and P3 (P < 0.05). Values of antioxidants and vitamins were significantly lower at P3 compared with P2. It is concluded that high yielding Saanen goats may suffer from hormonal and metabolic disturbances, oxidative stress and micromineral deficiencies during late gestation and the first month of lactation especially when they are subjected to heat stress.

AB  - Exposure to organophosphorus compounds (OPs) may cause psychiatric, neurologic, biochemical, and cardiovascular abnormalities. Neurotoxicity of OP compounds is primarily due to irreversibly inhibition of the acetylcholinesterase (AChE) enzyme both centrally and peripherally. Chlorpyrifos (CPF) is a widely used OP classified as moderately toxic. Previously, it has been shown that CPF administration, given every other day to adult rats, impairs spatial memory and prepulse inhibition associated with brain AChE inhibition. Our group also found that intermittent treatment with CPF, simulating occupational exposure, impairs the cardiorespiratory reflexes and causes cardiac hypertrophy. Thereby, we aimed to examine whether subchronic and intermittent administration of CPF would affect the behavioural (freezing) and cardiovascular (mean arterial pressure, MAP; heart rate, HR) responses elicited during contextual fear conditioning (CFC) and extinction. Wistar adult male rats were injected with sublethal and intermittent CPF doses (4 and 7 mg/kg) three times a week for one month. Two days after the last injection, a range of tests were performed to assess depression (sucrose preference), anxiety (elevated plus-maze, EPM), locomotion (open field, OF), and conditioned fear expression and extinction. Separate cohorts of animals were euthanized to measure plasma butyrylcholinesterase (BChE), erythrocyte AChE, brain AChE activity, and markers of oxidative-nitrosative stress. Intermittent CPF treatment did not affect sucrose preference. CPF (4 and 7 mg/kg) reduced open-arms exploration in the EPM, suggesting an anxiogenic effect. The higher dose of CPF decreased the total distance travelled in the OFT, suggesting motor impairment. After a seven-day CPF-free washout period, CPF (7 mg/kg) increased the tachycardic response without affecting freezing behaviour in the CFC extinction session. CPF 7 mg/kg decreased AChE activity in the hippocampus, prefrontal cortex and brainstem 72 after the last administration whilst transiently increasing oxidative-nitrosative stress specifically in the brainstem. Overall, our results outlined the behavioural, autonomic and biochemical abnormalities caused by an intermittent dosing regimen of CPF that elicits brain AChE inhibition and brain oxidative-nitrosative stress. This paradigm might be valuable in further exploring long-term consequences and mechanisms of OP neurotoxicity as well as comprehensive therapeutic approaches.

AB  - DNA methylation is environment-sensitive and can mediate stress responses. In trees, changes in the environment might cumulatively shape the methylome landscape over time. However, because high-resolution methylome studies usually focus on single environmental cues, the stress-specificity and long-term stability of methylation responses remain unclear. Here, we studied the methylome plasticity of a Populus nigra cv. 'Italica' clone widely distributed across Europe. Adult trees from different geographic locations were clonally propagated in a common garden experiment and exposed to cold, heat, drought, herbivory, rust infection, and salicylic acid treatments. Whole-genome bisulfite sequencing revealed stress-induced and naturally occurring DNA methylation variants. In CG/CHG contexts, the same genomic regions were often affected by multiple stresses, suggesting a generic methylome response. Moreover, these variants showed striking overlap with naturally occurring methylation variants between trees from different locations. Drought treatment triggered CHH hypermethylation of transposable elements, affecting entire superfamilies near drought-responsive genes. Thus, we revealed genomic hotspots of methylation change that are not stress-specific and that contribute to natural DNA methylation variation, and identified stress-specific hypermethylation of entire transposon superfamilies with possible functional consequences. Our results underscore the importance of studying multiple stressors in a single experiment for recognizing general versus stress-specific methylome responses.
   In poplar, different abiotic and biotic stresses induce methylation changes in common labile genomic regions, while drought induces global CHH hypermethylation, especially over specific transposon superfamilies located close to drought-responsive genes

AB  - 1. Numerous studies have highlighted the roles of nutrient availability and fluctuations therein for invasion success of alien plants. Many others also highlighted the role of herbivores in invasion success. However, how herbivory and the level and fluctuations in nutrient availability interact in driving alien plant invasion into native communities remains largely unexplored.
   2. We grew eight invasive alien species as target species in pot-mesocosms with five different synthetic native communities in a three-factorial design with two levels of nutrient availability (low vs. high), two levels of nutrient fluctuation (constant vs. pulsed) and two levels of above-ground insect herbivory (with vs. without herbivores). As natural communities have both specialist and generalist herbivores, we simulated this using both a generalist and a specialist herbivorous grasshopper.
   3. The relative biomass production of the alien target plants to the total biomass production (i.e. alien biomass/total biomass) decreased in response to an increase in nutrient availability, but increased in response to the presence of herbivores. Furthermore, we found indications that the dominance of the alien target species may depend on interactions of herbivory with changes in nutrient availability and nutrient fluctuations, although these interactions were only marginally significant.
   4. Our multi-trophic multi-species experiment suggests that herbivory could mediate the interactive effect of nutrient enrichment and variability in nutrient supply on invasion of alien plants into native communities. Therefore, we recommend that studies testing the effects of resources on plant invasion should also consider interactive effects of other trophic levels.

AB  - This chapter reviews the literature on the impact of stress and exercise on fear extinction. Given that key brain regions of the fear circuitry (e.g., hippocampus, amygdala and frontal cortex) can be modulated by stress hormones, it is important to investigate how stress influences this process. Laboratory -based studies performed in healthy adults have yielded mixed results, which are most likely attributable to various methodological factors. Among these factors, inter-individual differences modulating the stress response and timing of stressor administration with respect to the task may contribute to this heterogeneity. Given that fear is a core manifestation of various psychopathologies and that exposure-based therapy relies on fear extinction principles, several studies have attempted to assess the role of stress hormones on exposure-based therapy in patients suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder or anxiety disorders. These studies tend to suggest a beneficial impact of stress hormones (through either natural endogenous variations or synthetic administration) on exposure-based therapy as assessed mostly by subjective fear measures. Similar to stress, exercise can have an impact on many physiological and biological systems in humans. Of note, exercise modulates biomarkers such as brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and anandamide (EAE) that act on brain regions implicated in the fear circuitry, supporting the importance of studying the impact of exercise on fear extinction. Overall, the results converge and indicate that fear extinction (tested in the laboratory or via exposure-based therapy in clinical populations) can be enhanced with exercise. Further research is needed to understand the mechanisms by which stress and exercise modulate fear learning and extinction processes, as well as to maximize the applicability to clinical contexts.

AB  - In recent years, gut-tailored probiotics have been proven to be beneficial for host health. Probiotic strains such as lactic acid bacteria (LAB) are known to exhibit antimicrobial activity, acting as natural substitutes for the regulation of foodborne pathogens. In the present study, a complete analysis, isolation, biochemical characterization, and molecular identification of Pediococcus acidilactici (NMCC-11) from Nili Ravi water buffalo (Bubalis bubalis) gut was carried out. NMCC-11 showed the best enzymatic potential, antimicrobial activity against known pathogenic strains, and survivability at a wide pH range (pH 4-pH 6) out of all isolates. The isolates were screened for their antimicrobial activity against the five most infectious microbes such as Escherichia coli (ATCC 8739), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (ATCC9027), Staphylococcus aureus (ATCC6538), Listeria monocytogenes (ATCC13932), and Bacillus cereus (ATCC 11778) using the agar-well diffusion method. Moreover, after NMCC-11 isolation, a comparative diversity analysis against a variety of other randomly selected strains from around the world was carried out using R software. This study showed relatively low genetic diversity, which also contributed to the claim of the stability of this probiotic strain and its potential use as a starter culture and feed probiotic in the dairy industry. However, further studies are certainly warranted to determine its optimal dosage, time frame, and intake frequency.

AB  - Italy has a long history of sheep breeding and counts several local populations that may represent a unique source of genetic diversity. Among these, Nera del Mela is a sheep genetic resource historically reared in Sicily but not officially recognised as a breed. In this study, we genotyped 36 individuals of Nera del Mela using the OvineSNP50K array, in order to estimate the genetic diversity and evaluate the population structure and relatedness with other Italian sheep breeds. Genetic diversity indices, and inbreeding estimated from runs of homozygosity (F-ROH) revealed a moderate level of variability. Runs of homozygosity islands mapped candidate genes involved in the adaptation to local environment and immune response. Population genetic analyses using different approaches highlighted the hypothesis that this sheep possesses a defined genetic structure, especially if compared with other recognised breeds, despite the influence of other populations such as the Sicilian breeds. Overall, our findings represent a starting point for the possible official acknowledgement of this population, for the creation of a conservation plan, and thus for preserving this genomic heritage.

AB  - Light, as a critical environmental factor, plays a pivotal role in photosynthesis, ultimately influencing the timing of bud flush in tea plants. However, the synergistic effects of different photoperiods and light qualities on the timing of bud flush in the albino tea cultivar 'HuangKui' (later germination variety) remain unknown. Thus, the objective of this study was to investigate the effects of different photoperiods (12L/12D, 14L/10D, 16L/8D, and 18L/6D, where L = the number of daylight hours and D = the number of hours of darkness) and ratios of red (R) to blue (B) light (R/B 1:1, R/B 1:2, R/B 1:3, and R/B 2:1) on the germination and growth of the albino tea variety 'HuangKui'. In our study, we examined how different photoperiods and red light and blue light affected tea germination and growth by investigating the timing of bud flush, photosynthesis, chlorophyll content, and growth indicators. First, our study showed that 'HuangKui' germinated 4 days, 2 days, and 1 day earlier under the 16L/8D photoperiod at the one bud and one leaf period compared with plants cultivated under the 12L/12D, 14L/10D, and 18L/6D photoperiods under light simulating the solar spectrum. Also, the growth of 'HuangKui' was maximumly promoted under the 16L/8D photoperiod treatment. Additionally, the earliest germination of 'HuangKui' was observed for the 16L/8D photoperiod under the R/B 2:1 (red/blue) treatment compared with the other treatments. Moreover, the greatest plant height, length of the new shoots, and new leaf areas were detected in the albino tea variety 'HuangKui' under R/B 2:1. Moreover, the contents of auxin (indole acetic acid, IAA) and trans-zeatin (tZ) under R/B 2:1 were significantly higher than those under the R/B 1:1 and control treatments with the 16L/8D photoperiod. Additionally, the auxin-related expression levels of CsIAA13, CsGH3.1, CsAUX1, and CsARF2 under the R/B 2:1 treatment were significantly higher than those in the control. The expression of CsARR-B, a positive regulator of cytokinin-related genes, was significantly higher under the R/B 2:1 treatment than under the control treatment, while the opposite result was found for the expression of the negative regulator CsARR-A. Therefore, the R/B 2:1 treatment with the 16L/8D photoperiod was an appropriate means of timing the bud flush for the albino tea variety 'HuangKui', which may be related to IAA or tZ signal transduction. In conclusion, our research offers a novel lighting strategy that promotes the germination and growth of albino tea cultivars.<br />

AB  - Due to their small population sizes, threatened and endangered species frequently suffer from a lack of genetic diversity, potentially leading to inbreeding depression and reduced adaptability.(1) During the latter half of the twentieth century, North America's largest soaring bird,(2) the California condor (Gymnogyps californianus; Critically Endangered(3)), briefly went extinct in the wild. Though condors once ranged throughout North America, by 1982 only 22 individuals remained. Following decades of captive breeding and release efforts, there are now >300 free-flying wild condors and similar to 200 in captivity. The condor's recent near-extinction from lead poisoning, poaching, and loss of habitat is well documented,4 but much about its history remains obscure. To fill this gap and aid future management of the species, we produced a high-quality chromosome-length genome assembly for the California condor and analyzed its genome-wide diversity. For comparison, we also examined the genomes of two close relatives: the Andean condor (Vultur gryphus; Vulnerable(3)) and the turkey vulture (Cathartes aura; Least Concern(3)). The genomes of all three species show evidence of historic population declines. Interestingly, the California condor genome retains a high degree of variation, which our analyses reveal is a legacy of its historically high abundance. Correlations between genome-wide diversity and recombination rate further suggest a history of purifying selection against linked deleterious alleles, boding well for future restoration. We show how both long-term evolutionary forces and recent inbreeding have shaped the genome of the California condor, and provide crucial genomic resources to enable future research and conservation.

AB  - A typical fossil flora examined for insect herbivory contains a few hundred leaves and a dozen or two insect damage types. Paleontologists employ a wide variety of metrics to assess differences in herbivory among assemblages: damage type diversity, intensity (the proportion of leaves, or of leaf surface area, with insect damage), the evenness of diversity, and comparisons of the evenness and diversity of the flora to the evenness and diversity of damage types. Although the number of metrics calculated is quite large, given the amount of data that is usually available, the study of insect herbivory in the fossil record still lacks a quantitative framework that can be used to distinguish among different causes of increased insect herbivory and to generate null hypotheses of the magnitude of changes in insect herbivory over time. Moreover, estimates of damage type diversity, the most common metric, are generated with inconsistent sampling standardization routines. Here we demonstrate that coverage-based rarefaction yields valid, reliable estimates of damage type diversity that are robust to differences among floral assemblages in the number of leaves examined, average leaf surface area, and the inclusion of plant organs other than leaves such as seeds and axes. We outline the potential of a theoretical ecospace that combines various metrics to distinguish between potential causes of increased herbivory. We close with a discussion of the most appropriate uses of a theoretical ecospace for insect herbivory, with the overlapping damage type diversities of Paleozoic gymnosperms and Cenozoic angiosperms as a brief case study.

AB  - Marine litter pollution, particularly plastics pollution, is an increasing global concern. While various studies have contributed useful information on this topic, there has been a scarcity of data on floating marine macro-litter (FMML) in poorly monitored areas such as the South China Sea (SCS). This paper describes a large-scale FMML assessment research in the northern SCS. Our data indicated the ubiquitous presence, abundant quan-tity, spatiotemporal variability, complex composition, and potential sources of FMML in the investigated region during boreal spring-summer periods over multiple years. According to observer-based records, the average FMML density was estimated to be 131.0 +/- 91.8 items/km2 (mean +/- SD), with anthropogenic FMML density of 118.7 +/- 86.2 items/km(2). Anthropogenic and natural items accounted for 90.6% and 5.5% of the total, respec-tively. Plastics (72.0%) and styrofoam (9.3%) dominated the recorded items. The great majority of items (92.1%) were characterized by small size of <= 20 cm. Labels of plastic bottle/packaging litter indicated that identifiable sources included surrounding countries of the SCS. Fishing activities were recognized as key sources of FMML, with 15.3% of FMML items likely being fishing-related. Globally, known estimates of FMML densities could vary from 0.002 to 578 items/km(2), with plastics accounting for 34.8-99.0%. Therefore, marine pollution from anthropogenic FMML in our investigated area ranked at a medium-to-high level around the globe. To conclude, this study demonstrated that the SCS is one of the world's hotspot areas with FMML pollution and sheds light on marine litter pollution, especially plastics pollution, in this intensively human-exploited but poorly monitored region. In future research, FMML pollution in other sections of SCS and possible negative impacts of FMML on marine ecosystems and megafauna should be further examined.

AB  - Animal health care is critical for livestock production especially in arid and semi-arid areas where majority are agro-pastoralists. Contagious caprine pleuropneumonia (CCPP) is a highly contagious and fatal disease which commonly affects goats in arid and semi-arid areas. The government has been the major provider of CCPP vaccine and few large-scale farmers who are licensed and able to purchase directly from the vaccine producer. Although the vaccine is sold to farmers at a subsidized price by the government, its distribution has been characterized by scarcity, irregular and late administration by the authority concerned. It is envisioned that if the willingness to pay for the CCPP vaccine among the agro-pastoralists was high, the sustainability for the vaccine availability and accessibility to everyone will be assured. This study was conducted in Kajiado and Taita Taveta counties where 323 households were sampled; thus, 276 households who were aware of the CCPP were considered for the analysis. Double-bounded dichotomous choice contingent valuation model was used to elicit agro-pastoralists' willingness to pay for the improved CCPP vaccine with new attributes. The model revealed that off-farm income, membership to a group, previous experience on CCPP attack on goats and access to extension services positively influenced households' willingness to pay for the improved CCPP vaccine. The results implied that provision of extension services by the government through promotion of public awareness on CCPP and on the benefit of vaccination will motivate farmers to willingly pay for vaccination services. This can be done through enhanced trainings, seminars and demonstrations to the village level, encouraging formation of groups which facilitates information sharing between agro-pastoralists as awareness and knowledge can drive the demand for the improved CCPP vaccine.

AB  - Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) and herbivores are ubiquitous biotic agents affecting plant fitness. While individual effects of pairwise interactions have been well-studied, less is known about how species interactions above and belowground interact to influence phenotypic plasticity in plant functional traits, especially phytochemicals. We hypothesized that mycorrhizae would mitigate negative herbivore effects by enhancing plant physiology and reproductive traits. Furthermore, we expected genotypic variation would influence functional trait responses to these biotic agents. To test these hypotheses, we conducted a manipulative field-based experiment with three strawberry (Fragaria x ananassa) genotypes to evaluate plant phenotypic plasticity in multiple functional traits. We used a fully-crossed factorial design in which plants from each genotype were exposed to mycorrhizal inoculation, herbivory, and the combined factors to examine effects on plant growth, reproduction, and floral volatile organic compounds (VOCs). Genotype and herbivory were key determinants of phenotypic variation, especially for plant physiology, biomass allocation, and floral volatiles. Mycorrhizal inoculation increased total leaf area, but only in plants that received no herbivory, and also enhanced flower and fruit numbers across genotypes and herbivory treatments. Total fruit biomass increased for one genotype, with up to 30-40% higher overall yield depending on herbivory. Herbivory altered floral volatile profiles and increased total terpenoid emissions. The effects of biotic treatments, however, were less important than the overall influence of genotype on floral volatile composition and emissions. This study demonstrates how genotypic variation affects plant phenotypic plasticity to herbivory and mycorrhizae, playing a key role in shaping physiological and phytochemical traits that directly and indirectly influence productivity.

AB  - Wolves are known to be habitat generalists, but they may have critical requirements during key life-cycle stages, such as reproduction and pup rearing. Especially in human-dominated landscapes, wolves may become particularly choosy concerning the location of their homesites to reduce human-related risk and disturbance, thus enhancing pup survival. From 2005 to 2010, we investigated habitat selection by wolves when establishing the territory at the landscape scale (i.e., 2nd order selection) and when locating rendezvous sites within the territory (i.e., 3rd order selection), the latter based on 31 acoustically and field-verified rendezvous sites (RVs) in 8 packs in the Abruzzo Lazio and Molise National Park, a historical stronghold of the species in central Italy where wolves always coexisted with humans. Using a hierarchical, multi-scale habitat selection approach through multi-grain resource selection functions (MRSFs), we investigated environmental, topographic, and anthropogenic factors affecting territory and RVs selection by wolves. At the landscape scale, wolves avoided human settlements and primary roads and selected forested areas, shrubland, and rough terrain, likely to improve concealment and decrease human-associated risks; however, they also positively selected pastures and trails to possibly improve efficiency in hunting and traveling. When locating RVs within the territory, wolves still selected forested areas, shrubland, and pastures but differently than the 2nd order, they avoided anthropogenic linear features (secondary roads and trails) and rough terrain. Our findings confirm that habitat selection by wolves is better understood through a multi-scalar approach, which may reveal trade-offs in selection decisions across different spatial scales.

AB  - Aims Legacy effects arising from grazing may alter the effect of plant-soil feedback (PSF), plant-phyllosphere feedback (PPF) and/or transgenerational plasticity on plant performance. Understanding how effects from these mechanisms are influenced by grazing can help predict grassland production and ecosystem dynamics.
   Methods Plant clonal buds and shoot materials of Leymus chinensis (a clonal grass species widely distributed across the eastern Eurasian Steppes), sterilised and non-sterilised soils were collected from sites subjected to long-term grazing or no grazing. We then conducted a series of studies to determine the presence and context-dependency of (1) PSF, (2) PPF and (3) clonal transgenerational plasticity mechanisms on long-term grazing by measuring plant above/belowground biomass, height and density.
   Results Inoculation with soil biota conditioned by L. chinensis from grazed sites increased root growth by 83.99% (positive PSF), but not inoculum from ungrazed sites (neutral PSF). Shoot inocula from grazed and ungrazed sites had similar positive effects on plant growth (positive PPF). Clonal offspring from grazed sites showed transgenerational trait plasticity in terms of herbivory-avoidance (21.24% height reduction and 84.62% tiller density increase), but aboveground production was unaffected. Additionally, grazed field plots with a year of grazing exclusion showed similar plant heights and aboveground biomass as ungrazed plots, which indicated short-term transgenerational trait plasticity.
   Conclusions Positive PSF and short-term clonal transgenerational plasticity of L. chinensis depended on past grazing activity, and together with positive PPF, can aid their recovery and fitness in subsequent growing seasons. Our findings highlighted context-dependent plant-microorganism interactions and trans-generational feedback of plants in response to grazing.

AB  - The use of "green manure "-crops that are cultivated specifically to be incorporated into the soil to increase its organic matter content -has been proposed as an alternative to chemical fertilizer because of its benefits in terms of crop yield. Nonetheless, the differential impacts of green manure on ammonia volatilization remains underexplored. In this study, the influence of various green manure management strategies on ammonia volatilization in maize cultivation were examined. Field experiments conducted from 2020 to 2022, the field experiment applied common vetch after the spring wheat harvest, with five distinct treatments: conventional tillage without green manures as a control (CT); tillage with total green manure incorporation (TG); no-tillage with total green manure mulching (NTG); tillage with only root incorporation (T); and no-tillage with removal of aboveground green manure (NT). The results showed that under TG and NTG, the maize yields were 12.3%-33.2% higher than under CT, and 6.8%-18.8% higher than under T and NT. Compared with CT, all four green manure management practices also significantly increased NH 3 emissions in maize fields, and they increased ammonia volatilization by 12.0%-13.7% in NTG and TG compared to root retention patterns, with NTG exhibiting higher rates than TG. NTG significantly increased soil organic matter, total nitrogen, mineral nitrogen, water -filled pore space (WFPS), microbial biomass carbon and nitrogen, and C: N, and it decreased soil pH compared to TG. Regression analysis showed that these factors were correlated with NH 3 volatilization. In addition, soil urease and ammoniaoxidation functional genes ( amo A) showed differences under green manure management practices. Structural equation modeling showed that NH 4 + -N had the greatest positive impact on NH 3 , and urease activity and total nitrogen had positive effects on NH 4 + -N. Furthermore, microbial biomass carbon and pH had positive and negative effects on urease activity, respectively, both of which were only related to SOM. At the same time, WFPS had a positive impact on total nitrogen. In summary, no-tillage with total green manure mulching increases maize yield but also increases NH 3 emissions. NH 4 + -N formed by the hydrolysis of urea by soil urease and the conversion of total nitrogen were found to be the main reasons for high NH 3 emissions. In addition, SOM can promote urease activity, increase NH 4 + -N content and NH 3 volatilization by increasing MBC and decreasing soil pH.

AB  - While severe shortage of feed has presented livestock industry with a major challenge, millions of tons of fruit by-products (FBPs) are discarded annually, as valuable sources of energy and numerous nutrients. However, some of FBPs contain high tannins that must be treated for use in animal feeding. This study was investigated the effect of tannin-degrading bacteria isolated from the rumen of some ruminants on the in vitro digestibility and gas production of FBPs silage. The FBPs, including pomegranate peel (PP), and the pulps of lemon (LP), grape (GP), and orange (OP) were ensilaged with tannin-degrading bacteria (enzyme activity: 10.46-8.60 U mL-1) isolated from the rumen of male goat (Escherichia coli GHMGHE41), deer (Escherichia fergusonii GHMGHE44), ram (E. fergusonii GHMGHE30), and camel (Klebsiella aerogenes GHMGHE38). After anaerobic incubation (30 days; 39.00 & ring;C), PP + camel strain silage showed the highest dry matter, and the lowest natural acid detergent fiber and pH. The camel strain increased crude protein content of LP silage to the highest level, and decreased acid detergent fiber of GP silage to the lowest level. The highest digestibility was observed for LP + goat strain silage (50.37%) compared to the uninoculated OP silage (42.73%). The maximum ammonia (N-NH3) and minimum level of pH were recorded for the silages of LP + goat strain and PP + CR strain, respectively. Overall, the current results showed that tannin-degrading E. coli GHMGHE41 and K. aerogenes GHMGHE38 were able to improve the digestibility of LP and PP silages as ingredients in ruminants' diets.

AB  - Zooarcheological and geochemical evidence suggests Neanderthals were top predators, but their adherence to a strictly carnivorous diet has been questioned. Recent studies have demonstrated the potential of calcium-stable isotopes to evaluate trophic and ecological relationships. Here, we measure the d44/42Ca values in bone samples from Mousterian contexts at Grotte du Bison (Marine Isotope Stage 3, Yonne, France) and Regourdou (Marine Isotope Stage 5, Dordogne, France) in two new Neanderthal individuals, associated fauna, and living local plants. We use a Bayesian mixing model to estimate the dietary composition of these Neanderthal individuals, plus a third one already analyzed. The results reveal three distinct diets: a diet including accidental or voluntary consumption of bone-based food, an intermediate diet, and a diet without consumption of bone-based food. This finding is the first demonstration of diverse subsistence strategies among Neanderthals and as such, reconciles archaeological and geochemical dietary evidence. (c) 2024 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Background The use of medicinal plants to treat various veterinary illnesses has been practiced for millennia in many civilizations. Punjab is home to a diverse ethnic community, the majority of whom work in dairy farming, agriculture, and allied professions and have indigenous practices of treating animal illnesses using native flora. This study was designed to (1) document and preserve information about the applications of medicinal plant species in ethnoveterinary remedies among inhabitants of Punjab, Pakistan, and (2) identify popular plants for disease treatment by quantitative analysis of the obtained data and to assess the pharmacological relevance of these species.Methods To collect data from informants (N = 279), questionnaires and semi-structured interviews were used. The ethnoveterinary data were analyzed using principal component analysis, relative frequency citation, fidelity level, relative popularity level, and rank order priority.Results A total of 114 plant species utilized in the ethnoveterinary medicinal system were found, which were divided into 56 families and used to treat 16 different illnesses. The Poaceae family, with 16 species, was the most common in the region. The most commonly employed growth form in herbal preparation was herb (49%). The most used part in ethnoveterinary remedies was leaves (35%), while powder was the most commonly used way for preparing ethnoveterinary remedies (51 applications). According to principal component analysis, the most typically used species in the research region were grasses. Five grasses (Arundo donax, Desmostachya bipinnata, Eleusine indica, Hordeum vulgare, and Pennisetum glaucum) showed a 100% FL value when used to treat diuretics, helminthiasis, digestive problems, fever, cough, worm infestation, indigestion, galactagogue, oral infections, and genital prolapse. The maximum value of disease cured level (DCL%) was recorded at 87.6% for endo- and ecto-parasitic ailments in the study area.Conclusion This study demonstrates that medicinal plants play an important part in satisfying farmers' animal healthcare demands, making it a feasible practice. The study also provides a wealth of knowledge regarding ethnoveterinary methods for further planning and application, providing an option for farmers who cannot afford allopathic therapy.

AB  - A study was carried out to validate the Familiar Human Approach Test (FHAT) for the evaluation of the human-animal relationship (HAR) in goats at pasture. The FHAT originally proposed for sheep (AWIN Welfare Assessment Protocol) was modified to be adapted to goats. The validation of this modified version of FHAT was carried out by checking its convergent validity with the Latency to the First Contact Test (Latency; expressed in seconds), which was already developed, validated, and included in the AWIN Welfare Assessment Protocol for Goats to evaluate HAR for dairy goats kept indoors. Eighteen dairy goat farms were included in this study. The FHAT was performed during the grazing season at pasture by familiar assessors (i.e., farmers), while external assessors evaluated the reaction of goats to the routine gathering of animals by the farmer. The Latency was performed both by unfamiliar and familiar assessors during autumn-winter indoor housing. Farms were classified into four classes, based on goats' reactions to farmers at pasture: 1. Avoidance (withdrawal of the whole flock from the farmer, n= 4); 2. Approach (at least one goat allows the farmer to approach and/or follows the farmer; no physical interaction, n= 7); 3. Contact (at least one goat voluntarily approaches the farmer; contact lasts <= 3 seconds, n= 3); and 4. Acceptance (at least one goat accepts to be touched by the farmer; contact lasts >3 seconds, n= 4). Latency time was compared among the four classes. Latency was higher in the classes without contact (Avoidance and Approach) when compared to the classes with contact (Contact and Acceptance) between humans and goats. However, the differences among the classes were significant in response to the presence of the familiar assessor only [familiar assessor (P=0.016): Avoidance: 164.3 +/- 114.83 s, Approach: 115.6 +/- 127.04 s, Contact: 48.0 +/- 40.95 s, Acceptance: 7.8 +/- 5.44 s; unfamiliar assessor (P=0.631): Avoidance: 161.5 +/- 159.96 s, Approach: 144.6 +/- 122.35 s, Contact: 77.3 +/- 39.88 s, Acceptance: 61.0 +/- 67.38 s]. The four classes were then merged depending on the absence (Avoidance+Approach) or presence (Contact+Acceptance) of physical interaction between goats and farmers. Again, Latency time was significantly (133.3 +/- 119.34 s vs 25.0 +/- 32.20 s; P=0.006) and not significantly (150.7 +/- 129.34 s vs 68.0 +/- 53.63 s; P=0.328) different when performed by the familiar and unfamiliar assessors, respectively. The strong correlation between Latency to the familiar and unfamiliar assessors suggests that goats generalize their response to humans based on HAR quality. Results support the use of FHAT for the evaluation of HAR in goats raised in pasture-based systems.

AB  - Phylogeography of terrestrial mammals on islands is complicated because of the geological changes in the island configuration or their past population dynamics on the nearby landmass. To understand the function of Shodoshima Island in the Seto Inland Sea in preserving lineages of Japanese macaques (Macaca fuscata) and sika deer (Cervus nippon), we investigated the molecular phylogeny of these species on the island. We analyzed a partial sequence of the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) control region of the two species. We identified four mtDNA haplotypes in macaques, including western and eastern Japan lineages. Two mtDNA haplotypes for deer were discovered, which were categorized into only the northern Japan lineage. Their nucleotide sequences were identical except for a tandem repeat. These results suggest that the phylogeographic trend was remarkably different between the two species, which may be due to the migration of multiple lineages of macaques to the island when it was connected to Honshu Island, and a bottleneck effect on the deer population caused by overhunting. Some haplotypes were probably unique to the Shodoshima population of both species. The presence of region-specific haplotypes suggests the importance of Shodoshima Island to maintain genetic diversity of the species.

AB  - Simple Summary Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) represents a complex global issue due to the many factors involved. Extended-spectrum beta-lactamase and AmpC (ESBL/AmpC)-producing Escherichia coli deserves attention for its broad repercussions on public health. Moreover, wild host species are of interest, particularly wild boar. Indeed, the constantly increasing population densities and the limited data on AMR in this species lead to health risks where spatial overlap with humans and domestic animals occurs. Therefore, 1504 wild boar fecal samples were analyzed to investigate ESBL/AmpC-producing E. coli and the effects of host-related factors and of human population density on their spread. A high prevalence of ESBL/AmpC-producing E. coli emerged in wild boar, species not treated with antibiotics, supporting that infection may be acquired through environmental contamination, whether of human or animal origin. Young animals were more colonized than older ones, demonstrating higher susceptibility as seen in domestic animals. Moreover, a positive association recorded between frequency of the TEM resistance gene and human population density suggests that spatial overlap may influence the infection in wild boar. Further analyses would be desirable to investigate the origin of the recorded environmental contamination, although a role of wild boar as a maintenance host of AMR strains emerged. The complex health problem of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) involves many host species, numerous bacteria and several routes of transmission. Extended-spectrum beta-lactamase and AmpC (ESBL/AmpC)-producing Escherichia coli are among the most important strains. Moreover, wildlife hosts are of interest as they are likely antibiotics free and are assumed as environmental indicators of AMR contamination. Particularly, wild boar (Sus scrofa) deserves attention because of its increased population densities, with consequent health risks at the wildlife-domestic-human interface, and the limited data available on AMR. Here, 1504 wild boar fecal samples were microbiologically and molecularly analyzed to investigate ESBL/AmpC-producing E. coli and, through generalized linear models, the effects of host-related factors and of human population density on their spread. A prevalence of 15.96% of ESBL/AmpC-producing E. coli, supported by bla(CTX-M) (12.3%), bla(TEM) (6.98%), bla(CMY) (0.86%) and bla(SHV) (0.47%) gene detection, emerged. Young animals were more colonized by ESBL/AmpC strains than older subjects, as observed in domestic animals. Increased human population density leads to increased bla(TEM) prevalence in wild boar, suggesting that spatial overlap may favor this transmission. Our results show a high level of AMR contamination in the study area that should be further investigated. However, a role of wild boar as a maintenance host of AMR strains emerged.

AB  - The rangelands in semi-arid regions have deteriorated quickly because of mismanagement such as early, over, and late grazing. Sustainable improvement measures should be implemented on rangelands that have poor quality and low quantity. This study aims to enhance new cultivars with plant species of sheep fescue from the grass family that are delicious and long-lasting, as well as high-quality. To our knowledge, this is the first study in Anatolian semi-arid conditions, with the most genotypes (61 populations), the broadest range of subject areas (agro-morphological and quality traits), and the most investigated traits (14 in total). Agro-morphological and quality traits were identified in this nursery plots. For morphological traits, G-641 had the highest plant height (39.74 cm), and node number (3.0), among the examined genotypes. The highest fresh forage yield (285 g plant-1) the most important trait, was obtained from the G-625 population among all genotypes in two-year results. As considered quality traits, the G-632 population had the highest protein ratio with 21.06%, and at the same time, it possessed the lowest acid detergent fiber and neutral detergent fiber. In nutrient elements, the G-632, G-598, G-647, and G-596 had the highest calcium, phosphorous, potassium, and magnesium contents, respectively, and thus outperformed the control cultivars in these traits. At the beginning of the breeding program, it is necessary to select materials with characteristics such as plant height, internode distance, and the number of nodes closely related to high fresh grass yield for success and effectiveness.

AB  - Toxoplasmosis, a foodborne disease, in human occurs commonly after the ingestion of tissue cysts via the raw and/or undercooked meat of different infected intermediate hosts such as sheep and cattle. The current study aimed to detect the genetic structure of Toxoplasma gondii isolated from various organs of sheep and cattle in the north of Iran. Conventional PCR was carried out by B1 and REP-529 genes of T. gondii. Nested and RFLP-PCR were performed for all positive samples using SAG2 and GRA6 genetic markers. Amplicons from second round of nested-PCR were sequenced and analyzed with NCBI database. Among of 179 examined samples, 38(21.20%) were positive. The highest of positive cases were found in kidney (28.60%). PCR-RFLP of SAG2 and GRA6 genes demonstrated the alleles of clonal type III in the all of isolates. Sequence analysis of the amplicons revealed the alleles of clonal type III and atypical isolates (Tg-67, Tg-100 and Tg-106). Phylogenetic analyses showed separate clade for the atypical isolates from others in the present study and the reference strains clades. In conclusion, the genetic characterization of T. gondii isolates from sheep and cattle showed high genetic diversity compared with standard type I, II and III genotypes. These results support the hypothesis of the existence of polymorphic and overlapping strains within livestock in Iran. It also suggested the necessity of increased genotyping and sampling efforts to accurately estimate T. gondii intra specific genetic diversity (c) 2022 Urmia University. All rights reserved.

AB  - Simple Summary:& nbsp;In recent years, fake scientific news has spread much faster through the Internet and social media within the so-called "infodemic ". African swine fever (ASF) is a perfect case study to prove how fake news can undermine the public health response, even in the veterinary field. ASF is a contagious infective disease exclusively affecting domestic and wild pigs such as wild boars. ASF can cause social damages and economic losses both directly (due to the high mortality rate) and indirectly (due to international sanctions). Although ASF is not a threat to human health, since 2018, newspapers have often reported false or misleading news, ranging from misinterpreted findings/data to fake or alarmistic news. In some cases, fake news was spread, such as the use of snipers at the border of nations to kill wild boars or the possible risks to human health. In order to provide real and fact-based news on epidemics, some organizations have created easy-to-read infographic and iconographic materials, available on their websites, to help the readers identifying the fake news.& nbsp;In recent years, fake scientific news has spread much faster through the Internet and social media within the so-called "infodemic ".

AB  - Lameness on dairy goat farms is a welfare concern and could negatively affect milk production. This study's objective was to evaluate the effects of clinical lameness on the daily milk production of dairy goats. Between July 2019 and June 2020, 11,847 test-day records were collected from 3145 goats on three farms in New Zealand. Locomotion scoring of goats used a five-point scoring system (0 to 4). The dataset was split into two groups by lactation type, where goats were classified as being in seasonal lactation (<= 305 days in milk) or extended lactation (>305 days in milk). A linear mixed model was used to analyze datasets using milk characteristics as the dependent variables. Severely lame goats (score 4) in seasonal and extended lactation produced 7.05% and 8.67% less milk than goats not lame, respectively. When the prevalence of severe lameness is between 5 and 20% of the herd, the estimated average daily milk income lost was between NZD 19.5 and 104 per day. This study established the negative impact of lameness on milk production and annual income in dairy goats on three farms.

AB  - Plant-associated microbes can influence above- and belowground interactions between plants and other organisms and thus have significant potential for use in the management of agricultural ecosystems. However, fully realizing this potential will require improved understanding of the specific ways in which microbes influence plant ecology, which are both more complex and less well studied than the direct effects of microbes on host-plant physiology. Microbial effects on mutualistic and antagonistic interactions between plants and insects are of particular interest in this regard. This study examines the effects of two strains of Pseudomonas rhizobacteria on the direct and indirect (predator-mediated) resistance of tomato plants to a generalist herbivore (Spodoptera littoralis) and associated changes in levels of defense compounds. We observed no significant effects of rhizobacteria inoculation on caterpillar weight, suggesting that rhizobacteria did not influence direct resistance. However, the generalist predator Podisus maculiventris avoided plants inoculated with one of our rhizobacteria strains, Pseudomonas simiae. Consistent with these results, we found that inoculation with P. simiae influenced plant volatile emissions, but not levels of defense-related compounds. These findings show that rhizobacteria can negatively affect the attraction of generalist predators, while highlighting the complexity and context dependence of microbial effects on plant-insect interactions.

AB  - Simple Summary Improvements in health-promoting milk fatty acids by feeding oil mixtures have been reported in dairy cows. However, in some cases, oil addition reduces milk yield and milk fat content. It is unknown whether the inclusion of linseed oil and fish oil at a high level in goat diets increases health-promoting fatty acids in milk without affecting milk production. The objective of this study was to investigate the effect of linseed oil added alone at 2.5% or in combination with tuna fish oil at 2.5% or 4.16% in goat diets on intake, milk yield, and milk fatty acid profiles. Compared with the control without oil addition, feeding linseed oil and fish oil at 4.16% markedly increased the levels of health-promoting fatty acids in milk such as c9,t11 conjugated linoleic acid, and docosahexaenoic acid but decreased milk total saturated fatty acids, atherogenicity, and thrombogenicity indices. Oil addition did not have a negative effect on intake, milk yield, and milk fat content. Thus, supplementing linseed oil and fish oil at 4.16% in the diet of lactating goats could have a positive impact on human health without any adverse effects on animal performance. This study aimed to evaluate the effect of incorporating linseed oil and fish oil in the diet on intake, ruminal fermentation, milk yield, and milk fatty acid profiles in dairy goats. Four crossbred Saanen lactating goats in mid-lactation and milking 1.30 & PLUSMN; 0.28 g/day were used in a 4 x 4 Latin square design. The basal diet contained concentrate and Para grass (C:F 40:60). Treatments included a basal diet without oil supplementation (Ctrl) or with 2.5% linseed oil (LO2.5), 2.5% linseed oil and fish oil (3:2, w/w, LFO2.5), and 4.16% linseed oil and fish oil (3:2, w/w, LFO4.16). Diets had no effect on intake, milk yield, milk composition, or ruminal fermentation (p > 0.05). Compared with Ctrl, lower (p < 0.05) proportions of C10:0-C14:0 in milk fat were observed with LFO4.16. Compared with the Ctrl and linseed oil added alone, feeding LFO4.16 led to a greater (p < 0.01) concentration of C18:1 t11. Compared with both the Ctrl and LO2.5 diets, milk c9,t11 CLA was 4.53 and 2.94 times greater with the LFO4.16 diet. Compared with Ctrl and LO2.5 diets (0.06% and 0.08%), goats fed LFO2.5, and LFO4.16 had greater (p < 0.001) concentrations of C22:6n-3 (0.63% and 0.87%). Overall, the combined data suggested that including 4.16% linseed oil and fish oil in the diet of dairy goats was effective in improving the concentrations of health-promoting fatty acids in milk without affecting milk production.

AB  - Reproduction can reduce energy allocation to other life-history traits such as survival and growth. Resource constraints give rise to (co)variation in life-history traits and to heterogeneity in energy acquisition and allocation. At each reproductive opportunity, females face a choice between allocation to current reproduction or to maintenance. Many studies compare reproductive trade-offs between two consecutive years, but few account for the cumulative effects of reproduction over multiple years, a crucial factor in understanding life-history evolution in long-lived iteroparous species. We compared short- (interannual) and long-term (cumulative) reproductive trade-offs with a 14-year capture-mark-recapture study of eastern grey kangaroos, where females can have substantial skeletal growth for several years after maturation. We used a multivariate approach to compare how interannual and multi-annual cumulative reproduction affected growth (n = 378 measurements), mass change (n = 376 measurements) and subsequent reproduction (n = 388 measurements), and to quantify (co)variation between these traits among individuals (n = 107) and years (n = 14). Interannually, young females that reproduced experienced decreased skeletal growth compared to young females that did not reproduce. Reproductive females of all ages experienced reduced mass gain and weaning probability in the following year. The cumulative effects of multiple reproductions included decreased skeletal growth, mass gain and weaning probability in the following year. These effects increased with age and reproductive rate. We found positive trait correlations between mass change, leg growth and subsequent reproduction among individuals and years, though weaker at the cumulative than interannual level. Females experience dynamic interannual and cumulative trade-offs. Our analyses of cumulative costs of reproduction revealed long-term trade-offs as well as cumulative costs that were not apparent when estimating interannual costs. Trait correlations suggested heterogeneity in growth and reproduction among females. Years of increased growth were followed by years of increased reproduction, and years of poor growth were followed by years of poor reproduction. Our exploration of both interannual and cumulative costs of reproduction underscores the need to account for long-term reproductive histories to better understand reproductive trade-offs in long-lived iteroparous species.
   Our study provides novel insights into short- and long-term reproductive trade-offs in female eastern grey kangaroos. Utilizing a 14-year dataset, we reveal cumulative costs of reproduction on growth and reproduction that are not evident when only considering interannual effects, highlighting the importance of long-term data in life-history research.image

AB  - Barley grass (Hordeum spp.) is a short-lived annual weed which competes with preferred crop and pasture species and frequently contaminates wool and carcasses, and irritates the ears, eyes and noses of sheep. Barley grass, annual ryegrass (Lolium rigidum L.) and wild radish (Raphanus raphanistrum L.) are annual winter crop weeds which reduce grain yield through competition. In three consecutive years (2015 to 2017) cereal, legume and cereal/legume forage crops were grown and harvested in early October, late October or early November consistent with an early silage harvest (ES), late silage harvest (LS) or hay cut (H). A spring wheat cultivar was sown over each site in the following year (2016 to 2018). Weed density was recorded during the forage crop and wheat phases. Forage crop weed populations varied between years. Late paddock preparation for sowing in 2015 effectively eradicated barley grass from all forage crops; however, the competitiveness of legume and cereal/legume crops against annual ryegrass was reduced. In contrast, legume and cereal/legume mixtures tended to have higher barley grass densities than cereal crops in 2016 and 2017, when paddock preparation was earlier. Cutting in October 2015 reduced annual ryegrass and wild radish populations in 2016 wheat by 92.0% and 86.7%, respectively. In 2017 and 2018, regrowth and subsequent seed set following cutting appeared to negate cutting time effects for all crop and crop/legume combinations. Late paddock preparation, an early October forage harvest and effective regrowth control provided the best opportunity for barley grass, annual ryegrass and wild radish control in a single year.

AB  - Sahlbergella singularis is a major insect pest of cocoa in Cameroon. Conventional insecticides remain the most widely used option for mirid control, which unfortunately have adverse effects on the environment and human health. Improved methods of controlling this species, both environmentally friendly and inexpensive to farmers, are requirements. Varietal control based on the selection of resistant and/or tolerant genotypes can be an interesting approach. Nonetheless, the role of secondary metabolites (SMs) in cocoa defense against mirids is poorly documented; yet, these compounds are reported to be key elements in plant defense against herbivores. For this purpose, SMs of twelve cocoa genotypes were identified and quantified, as well as their impact on food preference by mirids. Food preference was assessed through microtests measuring cocoa attractiveness and antixenosis toward mirids. The results showed that cocoa genotypes were differently accepted as food by mirids, with a significant preference for hybrid IMC60 x SNK605 and a non-preference for T60/887. The ten other cocoa genotypes showed intermediate results. Five SMs classes: alkaloids, flavonoids, polyphenols, saponins, and tannins were identified. Their rates varied between cocoa genotypes: polyphenols > alkaloids > flavonoids > tannins, and saponins. Cocoa genotypes with high total phenolic contents were significantly preferred by S. singularis (r(alpha) = 0.86, R-2 = 74.0%, P < 0.001), while those with low saponins contents were lowly accepted (r(alpha) = - 0.83, R-2 = 68.9%, P < 0.015), independently of the levels of other SMs. Given SMs high potential to affect mirid feeding behavior, analyzing cocoa SMs composition may help in early selection of resistant cocoa varieties against S. singularis.

AB  - Each year temporary puddles are formed on compacted earth roads as a consequence of heavy rains and subsequent flooding in the large floodplain forests of the Danube River, Hungary, Central Europe, Hungary. After the receding of floodwaters, the muddy puddles persist from spring to mid-fall, where they are densely populated by Galba truncatula snails on an annual basis. These snails are the sole intermediate host of Fascioloides magna liver fluke of deer in the forest. According to field observations, G. truncatula is a very rare species on banks of river branches and lakes within the forest but always appears in large aggregations in these semi-natural potholes. Red deer (Cervus elaphus) leave their droppings in puddles while they wallow in the mud, therefore the snails encounter the miracidia of F. magna frequently. Snails are not able to dig themselves into the tamp soil of roads therefore they are destroyed by the wheels of vehicles which drive down the roads from autumn to the end of winter. Therefore, snails colonize these puddles regularly every spring. Since there is no connection between the distant puddles, it is supposed that deer and wild boars repeatedly introduce the snails into the puddles each year carrying snails with the help of mud, which is stuck on their fur while they wallow. This method of transport is supported by the fact that shell remnants of snails can be found on the bark of rubbing trunks situated nearby wallows. It seems that the sequential creation of wallow sites and the repeated introduction of G. truncatula enhance the likelihood for the trematode to infect both hosts.

AB  - Habitat loss and encroachment lead to conservation challenges such as human-elephant conflicts (HEC). Understanding the patterns and predictors of HEC is crucial to identify priority areas for mitigation efforts. Accordingly, a study was conducted across the forest divisions of Tamil Nadu, India. We collected HEC data for 2016-2021 from the forest department compensation database maintained in forest divisions. Our analysis encompassed division-wise, crop-wise, conflict-wise assessments, temporal analysis and conflict risk modelling (CRM). We divided the forest divisions into 4 different zones based on the variables that likely influence HEC. The results revealed that conflict frequency was higher in the forest range Denkankottai, located in the Hosur division, which falls under Zone 1. HEC was higher from November to January in correspondence with the cropping season. Elephants primarily damaged millet (ragi) (Eleusine coracana), with n = 2,182, particularly during November and December, followed by banana (Musa genus) with n = 1,690. The CRM predicts that the southwest and northwest regions of Tamil N & amacr;du had higher conflict risks and area coverage of medium and high conflict risk zones as 17,025 km2 and 3521 km2, respectively. The CRM revealed that the most significant variables in predicting conflict risk are the annual mean temperature, human modification index, and digital elevation model. Areas with higher conflict risk were closer to forest cover, croplands, roads, and water bodies. These regions typically had lower terrain ruggedness, higher human modification, lower temperatures, and dense vegetation. The present study's findings underscore the need for a comprehensive and multidimensional approach to managing HEC, which is crucial for fostering coexistence between humans and elephants in the region.

AB  - ObjectiveTo assess the frequency of chronic maxillary sinusitis (CMS) in a pre-Roman archeological skeletal assemblage from Italy and to evaluate the occurrence of CMS in combination with its environmental and sociocultural context.Materials and MethodsA total of 131 adult individuals from the pre-Roman site of Pontecagnano (eighth to third centuries bce) in southern Italy with intact maxillary sinuses of >= 50% preservation were macroscopically and microscopically observed for the presence of osseous changes per published diagnostic criteria of CMS.ResultsCMS was present in 57.2% of individuals. The prevalence of CMS was higher in females than in males, and this difference was statistically significant (p = 0.043). The frequency of CMS increased with age-at-death. Bilateral CMS occurred more frequently than unilateral CMS. The differences in the prevalence of CMS in the Etruscan (700-450 bce), Samnite (450-375 bce), and final pre-Roman (375-200 bce) phases of occupation were not statistically significant.DiscussionIn combination with viral and bacterial infections, occupational activities (metallurgy, ceramic and textile production, and agriculture) and environmental factors (volcanic ash, marshy environments, and sub-Saharan dust plumes) likely stimulated respiratory disease and resultant CMS in the inhabitants of Pontecagnano. This study provides a framework for future research on CMS and respiratory diseases in the Mediterranean region, in relation to environmental, climatic, and anthropogenic influences. The limited number of individuals per period prevented a proper diachronic analysis. Osteoarcheological assemblages from the Mediterranean region should be systematically analyzed for CMS to increase understanding of how climate, environment, industrialization, and urbanicity affected human health through time.

   The pygmy hog is one of the world's rarest suids and classified as an endangered species. Efforts are being made to breed them in captivity and reintroduce them into the wild. In this study, we examined reproductive hormones in captive pygmy hogs using a non-invasive method by collecting 785 fecal samples from five females and two males for 12 months. High-pressure liquid chromatography was performed to examine the presence of immunoreactive progesterone and testosterone metabolites in the fecal samples. We standardized and validated enzyme immunoassays (EIA) for fecal progesterone and testosterone metabolites. Using progesterone EIA, we were able to detect pregnancies in four females and estimate the relevant gestation period. We also recorded 172 births from the captive breeding center and found strong seasonality patterns in births. In males, fecal testosterone metabolite concentrations were higher in the breeding season than in the non-breeding season as evidenced by elevated testosterone concentrations during breeding season. A significant difference in fecal progesterone metabolites concentration was observed between non-pregnant and pregnant females. This study can directly help in monitoring the reproductive status of reintroduced hogs both in the wild and in conservation breeding programs in India and elsewhere.
   The pygmy hog (Porcula salvania), until recently was classified as a critically endangered suid facing the threat of extinction due to habitat degradation. Efforts are being made to protect the pygmy hog from extinction and breed them in captivity under the Pygmy Hog Conservation Programme (PHCP). However, very little information is available on the reproductive physiology of pygmy hogs. Therefore, the present study aims to standardize enzyme immunoassays (EIAs) for monitoring pregnancy and reproductive status using progesterone and testosterone metabolites. A total of 785 fecal samples were collected from five females and two males over a period of one year from the PHCP Research and Breeding Centre, Guwahati, Assam. High-pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) analysis revealed the presence of immunoreactive progesterone and testosterone metabolites in feces. Mating was observed in all five females, and four of them gave birth successfully. We were able to detect pregnancy using fecal progesterone metabolites. The mean gestation period, based on mating and parturition, was estimated to be 153.25 days from the four females studied. The breeding center recorded 172 births between 1996 and 2000 and found strong seasonal patterns in the birth rate, with most of the births occurring between May and June. In the males, fecal testosterone metabolites were significantly higher in the breeding season than in the non-breeding season. This is the first study on the subject and will help with future breeding programs in other captive breeding centers and with reproductive monitoring of reintroduced populations.

AB  - Resource specialization and ecological speciation arising through host-associated genetic differentiation (HAD) are frequently invoked as an explanation for the high diversity of plant-feeding insects and other organisms with a parasitic lifestyle. While genetic studies have demonstrated numerous examples of HAD in insect herbivores, the rarity of comparative studies means that we still lack an understanding of how deterministic HAD is, and whether patterns of host shifts can be predicted over evolutionary timescales. We applied genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphism and mitochondrial DNA sequence data obtained through genome resequencing to define species limits and to compare host-plant use in population samples of leaf- and bud-galling sawflies (Hymenoptera: Tenthredinidae: Nematinae) collected from seven shared willow (Salicaceae: Salix) host species. To infer the repeatability of long-term cophylogenetic patterns, we also contrasted the phylogenies of the two galler groups with each other as well as with the phylogeny of their Salix hosts estimated based on RADseq data. We found clear evidence for host specialization and HAD in both of the focal galler groups, but also that leaf gallers are more specialized to single host species compared with most bud gallers. In contrast to bud gallers, leaf gallers also exhibited statistically significant cophylogenetic signal with their Salix hosts. The observed discordant patterns of resource specialization and host shifts in two related galler groups that have radiated in parallel across a shared resource base indicate a lack of evolutionary repeatability in the focal system, and suggest that short- and long-term host use and ecological diversification in plant-feeding insects are dominated by stochasticity and/or lineage-specific effects.

AB  - Simple Summary With the rapid development of the mushroom industry, a large number of spent mushroom substrate (SMS) has also been produced. SMS can be easily digested by ruminants and is suitable for feeding animals, such as cows, sheep, as well as deer. The results of this study show that the dietary spent mushroom substrate of Pleurotus ostreatus (SMS-MP) has no obvious effect on the physiological condition of growing sika deer, at the same time it can reduce the cost of feeding and avoid environmental pollution caused by improper disposal of SMS-MP. The purpose of this experiment is to expand the feed of growing sika deer and to explore the effects on growing sika deer of the spent mushroom substrate of Pleurotus ostreatus (SMS-MP). Twelve immature female growing sika deer were randomly assigned to four groups. The ratios of SMS-MP to replace concentration supplements were 0%, 10%, 20%, and 30%, respectively, and the growth performance, feed intake and apparent digestibility, serum biochemical indexes, blood physiological indexes, serum immune globulin and plasma amino acid of growing sika deer were measured. The results of the current study confirmed the applicability of SMS-MP as a feed ingredient in growing sika deer diets. There was no significant change in growth performance and hematology of growing sika deer when the concentrate supplement was replaced with 10-20% SMS-MP. However, replacing 30% of concentrate supplements with SMS-MP in the growing sika deer diet resulted in significantly decreased Hb and HCT levels. It can be concluded that, as a waste resource, adding a small amount of SMS-MP has no significant effect on the growth of sika deer, and at the same time can reduce the consumption of concentrate supplements, thereby improving the economic benefits of sika deer breeding.

AB  - Dietary partitioning is one of the key mechanisms that help in understanding the potential for competition and coexistence among large sympatric carnivores. Using scat analysis, we studied food habits of Indian leopard and Asiatic lion to understand dietary niche partitioning between them and its role in their coexistence in the Gir protected area of Gujarat, India. A total of 585 scats were collected between 2017 and 2020, of which 327 were from leopards and 258 were from lions. The food habits of leopards and lions were quantified by calculating the frequency of occurrence and biomass consumption model. Dietary partitioning was quantified by calculating dietary overlap, niche breadth, and prey partitioning based on prey weight. Wild ungulates made up more than 50% of the diet for both leopards and lions, while livestock contributed 10% and 15% to the diet of leopards and lions, respectively. Chital was the most significant contributor to the diet of both leopards and lions compared to other prey species. The dietary overlap between leopards and lions was very high (0.94%). Both predators consumed mostly large size and medium-sized prey. Both leopards (0.27) and lions (0.28) had narrow dietary niche breadth. Wild ungulates emerged as important prey for leopards and lions in Gir. The disproportionate abundance and differential distribution patterns of wild ungulate prey were critical reasons for the high dietary overlap between leopards and lions. The conservation implications of the study have also been discussed.

AB  - The role of norfloxacin (NOR) and sulfamethoxazole (SMX) in mesophilic and thermophilic anaerobic digestion (AD) of pig manure, with respect to methane production and variations in the microbial community and resistance genes, including antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs), class I integrase (intIl), and heavy metal resistance genes (MRGs), was investigated. The results indicated that NOR exerted little influence on the microbial community, whereas SMX negatively affected the acetoclastic methanogens. The abundance of two sulfonamide resistance genes (sul1 and sul2), three quinolone resistance genes (qnrS, parC, and aac(6)-Ib-cr), and intI1 decreased by 2-3 orders of magnitude at the end of thermophilic AD. In contrast, mesophilic AD was generally ineffective in reducing the abundance of resistance genes. According to the results of redundancy analysis, the abundance of ARGs was affected primarily by microbial community dynamics (68.5%), rather than the selective pressure due to antibiotic addition (13.3%). Horizontal gene transfer (HGT) through intI1 contributed to 26.4% of the ARG variation. The archaeal community also influenced the changes in the resistance genes, and ARG reduction was significantly correlated with enhanced methane production. Thermophilic AD presented a higher methane production potential and greater reduction in resistance gene abundance.

AB  - In this study, the feasibility of tracing the origin of yak meat in Xizang Autonomous Region based on stable isotope combined with multivariable statistics was researched. The delta C-13, delta N-15, delta H-2 and delta O-18 in yak meat were determined by stable isotope ratio mass spectrometry, and the data were analyzed by analysis of variance, fisher discriminant analysis (FDA), back propagation (BP) neural network and orthogonal partial least squares discrimination analysis (OPLS-DA). The results showed that the delta C-13, delta N-15, delta H-2 and delta O-18 had significant differences among different origins (P < 0.05). The overall original correct discrimination rate of fisher discriminant analysis was 89.7 %, and the correct discrimination rate of cross validation was 88.2 %. The correct classification rate of BP neural network based on training set was 93.38 %, and the correct classification rate of BP neural network based on test set was 89.83 %. The OPLS-DA model interpretation rate parameter (RY)-Y-2 was 0.67, the model prediction rate parameter Q(2) was 0.409, which could distinguish yak meat from seven different producing areas in Xizang Autonomous Region. The results showed that the origin of yak meat in Xizang Autonomous Region can be traced based on stable isotope combined with multivariate statistics.

AB  - Vigilance is an important anti-predator behaviour that can be an indicator of the predation risk faced by potential prey animals. Here, we assess the collective vigilance, or the vigilance level of an entire group, of corvids (Family: Corvidae) at experimentally placed carcasses in a desert environment in Australia. Specifically, we explore the relationship between collective vigilance levels and the habitat in which the carcass was placed, the time since a potential predator (dingo Canis dingo, wedge-tailed eagle Aquila audax or red fox Vulpes vulpes) was present at a carcass, and the group size of corvids around the carcass. We found that corvids are more vigilant in open habitat, but that group size and the recent presence of a potential predator does not affect the collective vigilance behaviour of corvids. The results demonstrate the important link between habitat and vigilance, and that animals may adopt anti-predator behaviours irrespective of the size of the group in which they occur or the recent presence of a potential predator.

AB  - Simple Summary Enterocytozoon bieneusi is the most prevalent microsporidian species that can cause significant intestinal diseases in both humans and animals worldwide. This study investigated the overall E. bieneusi prevalence of 21.9% (47/215) in captive and free-ranging deer species in Beijing, China. Thirteen E. bieneusi genotypes including six known and seven novel genotypes were identified. These resources will provide the insights to understand the veterinary and public health and the transmission dynamics between animal environments and human ones. Enterocytozoon bieneusi is the most prevalent microsporidian species that can cause zoonotic diseases in humans and animals. Despite receiving increasing attention in relation to domestic animals, there has been limited information on the infection burden of E. bieneusi in cervids. Altogether, 215 fecal samples collected from four deer species in Beijing, China were examined by nested- Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR)targeting the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region. The overall prevalence of E. bieneusi in deer was 21.9% (47/215), with 30.0% (24/80) in Pere David's deer, 27.3% (15/55) in fallow deer, 12.5% (5/40) in sika deer, and 7.5% (3/40) in Chinese water deer. Thirteen E. bieneusi genotypes were identified, including six known (HLJD-V, MWC_d1, BEB6, CGC2, JLD-XV, and HND-I) and seven novel genotypes (BJED-I to BJED-V, BJFD, and BJCWD). A phylogenetic analysis showed that 38.3% of the isolates belonged to zoonotic Group 1. In addition, E. bieneusi infection was first detected in fallow deer and Chinese water deer, which could act as potential zoonotic reservoirs. Our findings suggest that E. bieneusi circulates in deer and might be of importance to public health.

AB  - Simple Summary Goats are susceptible to ectoparasite infection, and lice control is based on studies conducted in cattle and sheep through the topical application of several synthetic insecticides such as organophosphates, carbamates, and pyrethroids. However, the overuse of these compounds has led to insect resistance phenomena. Thus, natural insecticides could be preferred, considering that synthetic insecticides and their metabolites negatively impact the environment and human and animal health. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of neem oil on caprine pediculosis and on kids' growth performances. The neem (Azadirachta indica) belongs to the Meliaceae family, and in Eastern countries it is mainly considered for the insecticidal activities of the kernel oil. The neem seeds contain bioactive principles, such as azadirachtin A, salannin, nimbin, and nimbolide. The trial was carried out on 24 kids, 120 days old, maintained in open yards. Animals were divided in 4 homogeneous groups (n = 6 animals/group) based on age, louse count, body condition score (BCS) and live body weight: Control Group (C, saline NaCl, 0.9%), Neem Group 1 (NO-100, 100 mL of neem oil per 10 kg), Neem Group 2 (NO-200, 200 mL/10 kg), Neem Group 3 (NO-300, 300 mL/10 kg). The treatments were performed by spraying the insecticide on the goat's body. The study lasted 56 days, and weekly, the kids underwent louse count, BCS and body weight determination, and FAMACHA score. Data were analyzed by ANOVA for repeated measures. The species of lice identified was Linognathus stenopsis. Kids belonging to NO-200 and NO-300 showed a stronger reduction of louse count throughout the study (>95%). The daily weight gain recorded was significantly higher (p < 0.05) in NO-300 than C. No differences were found for BCS and FAMACHA scores. The results of this trial showed that the administration of neem oil to control caprine pediculosis caused by sucking lice represents an alternative to synthetic compounds.

AB  - Incomplete combustion of solid fuels (animal dung and bituminous coal) is a common phenomenon during residential cooking and heating in the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau (QTP), resulting in large amounts of pollutants emitted into the atmosphere. This study investigated the pollutant emissions from six burning scenarios (heating and cooking with each of the three different fuels: yak dung, sheep dung, and bitumite) in the QTP's pastoral dwellings. Target pollutants such as carbon monoxide (CO), gas-phase polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), volatile organic compounds (VOCs), fine particles (PM2.5, particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter < 2.5 mu m), carbonaceous aerosols, water-soluble ions, and particle-phase PAHs were investigated. Emission factors (EFs) (mean +/- standard deviation) of PM2.5 from the six scenarios were in the range of 1.21 +/- 0.47-7.03 +/- 1.95 g kg(-1), of which over 60% mass fractions were carbonaceous aerosols. The ratio of organic carbon to elemental carbon ranged from 9.6 +/- 2.7-33.4 +/- 11.5 and 81.7 +/- 30.4-91.9 +/- 29.0 for dung and bitumite burning, respectively. These values were much larger than those reported in the literature, likely because of the region's high altitudes-where the oxygen level is approximately 65% of that at the sea level-thus providing a deficient air supply to stoves. However, the toxicity and carcinogenicity of PAHs emitted from solid fuel combustion in the QTP are significant, despite a slightly lower benzo(a)pyrene-equivalent carcinogenic potency (Bap(eq)) in this study than in the literature. The gas-to-particle partitioning coefficient of PAHs and VOC emission profiles in the QTP differed significantly from those reported for other regions in the literature. More attention should be paid to the emissions of PAH derivatives (oxygenated PAHs and nitro-PAHs), considering their enhanced lightabsorbing ability and high BaPeq from solid fuel combustion in the QTP.

AB  - Diet preference of the black rhinoceros Diceros bicornis was determined in Welgevonden Game Reserve (WGR), located in the Waterberg region of Limpopo Province, South Africa. Fieldwork was conducted in the dry, early wet and late wet seasons. Diet preference was determined using microhistological faecal analysis and browse availability surveys. A chi-square goodness-of-fit test assessed similarity between the observed diet composition based on dung samples and the expected diet composition. To account for potential non-independence between browse availability and diet composition, a weighted approach was employed where browse availability was just one of several contributing factors to the expected composition. Plant species selectivity was quantified by Ivlev's electivity index. Results obtained from this indicated that these black rhinos preferentially browsed certain plant species across different seasons. Plant species observations in the dung samples from the dry season totalled 3 984, with the evergreen Natal gum Euclea natalensis dominating the diet; for the early wet season, plant observations in the dung totalled 1 479, with buffalo thorn Ziziphus mucronata dominating in the diet; for the late wet season, plant observations in the dung totalled 4 424, with the small deciduous tree Ochna pulchra dominating in the diet. By obtaining information on food selection and the availability of browse species across seasons, this study provides a clearer understanding of black rhinos' forage preference in WGR.

AB  - Aerobic methanotrophic bacteria are pivotal in the global carbon cycle by converting methane into biomass and inorganic carbon species. Light rare earth elements (light-REE; La, Ce) are part of the metalloenzymes mediating the biochemical processes in methanotrophs. However, the partitioning of trace metals and REE in chemosymbiotic megafauna with methanotrophic endosymbionts remains largely unknown. Here we determine stable isotope compositions (delta 13C, delta 15N) of soft tissues (gill, mantle, foot) as well as trace metal and REE contents of soft tissues and shells of chemosymbiotic bivalves dwelling at methane seeps (Site F and Haima seeps) of the South China Sea. Isotopic compositions of soft tissues are found to reflect the mode of chemosymbiosis (i.e., methanotrophy vs. thiotrophy). Particularly gill tissues of bivalves with methanotrophic endosymbionts display marked light-REE and trace metal enrichments, which is interpreted to reflect the enzymatic activity of endosymbionts. Additionally, correlations between light-REE and copper (Cu), zinc (Zn), and molybdenum (Mo) contents in soft tissues of chemosymbiotic mussels are ascribed to the uptake of these elements by the methanotrophic symbionts. An observed higher trace metal content in the tissue of the semi-infaunal and infaunal bivalves with thiotrophic endosymbionts is believed to reflect the uptake of metals associated with sulfide particles. This study documents diagnostic enrichment of trace metals and light-REE in the soft tissues of bivalves with chemotrophic endosymbionts and provides new constraints for future identification of chemosymbiosis at ancient seeps.
   Hydrocarbon seeps, sites on the seafloor where methane-rich fluids leak into seawater, are an important source of methane. Yet, the transfer of this greenhouse gas to the ocean is reduced by microbial activity, particularly aerobic and anaerobic oxidation of methane. Some trace metals and rare earth elements (REE) are key to such methanotrophic activity, representing cofactors of metalloenzymes involved in methane oxidation. Although the actual enzymatic activity is well understood, the modes of biological uptake and the partitioning of these elements in seep ecosystems remain largely unconstrained. Here, chemosymbiotic bivalves, harboring chemotrophic bacteria in their soft tissues, were collected from two active seep provinces in the South China Sea. Comprehensive geochemical analyses have been conducted to characterize nutritional sources and trace element enrichment. The observed element patterns are best explained by simultaneous uptake of the trace elements by methanotrophic endosymbionts. Higher sulfide levels in the environment of bivalves with thiotrophic endosymbionts are held responsible for the observed greater trace metal enrichment in the tissues of bivalves harboring sulfide oxidizers. This study deepens our understanding of the behavior of trace metals and REE in methane-seep ecosystems. It will also help to better understand the adaptation of metazoans to ancient chemosynthesis-based environments.
   Stable isotopic composition of bivalve tissue reflects nutritional sources Correlations between light-rare earth elements and trace metal enrichment in mussel tissues reflect in vivo uptake by endosymbiotic methanotrophic bacteria Elemental distributions have the potential to identify chemosymbiosis in fossil bivalves

AB  - Silicon (Si) accumulation by grasses is a key mechanism for alleviating biotic and abiotic stresses, including insect herbivory. In addition to conferring physical resistance, tissue silicification may enhance anti-herbivore phytohormone production, such as the jasmonic and salicylic (JA and SA) acid pathways, and downstream regulation of defence genes, although this is poorly understood. Elevated atmospheric carbon dioxide (eCO2) concentrations predicted by climate models are reported to reduce Si accumulation in several plant taxa and may therefore compromise Si-augmented resistance. We investigated how Si enrichment and eCO2 regulate the JA and SA pathways and expression of defence genes in wheat (Triticum aestivum) challenged by a global insect pest (Helicoverpa armigera). Si treatments increased JA production and expression of beta-1,3-ENDOGLUCANASE (GNS), and MITOGEN-ACTIVATED PROTEIN KINASE (MAPK; WCK-1) defence genes, while suppressing SA production, resulting in reduced feeding and growth of H. armigera. In contrast, under eCO2 conditions, Si accumulation was reduced, GNS downregulated, but SA production was upregulated. Despite compromised plant defences, H. armigera growth rates were reduced under eCO2. We conclude that eCO2 and Si supplementation contrastingly regulate anti-herbivore defences in wheat; these important drivers operate independently and may influence future patterns of pest resistance in wheat under projected rises in atmospheric CO2.

AB  - The suitability of wild boar liver as a bioindicator of per-and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) in the terrestrial en-vironment was investigated. Samples from 50 animals in three different areas associated with (1) contaminated paper sludges distributed on arable land (PS), (2) industrial emissions of PFAS (IE) and (3) background contamination (BC) were analyzed for 66 PFAS, including legacy PFAS, novel substitutes and precursors of perfluoroalkyl acids (PFAAs). Additionally, the Total Oxidizable Precursor (TOP) assay was performed to determine the formation potential of PFAAs from precursors. In total, 31 PFAS were detected with site-specific contamination profiles. PFAS concentrations in livers from area PS and IE (567 and 944 mu g kg-1 wet weight, respectively) were multiple times higher than from area BC (120 mu g kg-1). The dominating PFAS were the legacy compounds perfluorooctane sulfonic acid (PFOS) in areas PS and BC (426 and 82 mu g kg-1, respectively) and perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) in area IE (650 mu g kg-1). In area IE, the compounds 4,8-dioxa-3H-perfluorononanoic acid (DONA) and hexafluoropropylene oxide dimer acid (HFPO-DA) - which are used as substitutes for PFOA - were determined at 15 and 0.29 mu g kg-1, respectively. The for-mation potential of PFAAs was highest in area PS, but generally lower than the contamination with PFAAs. The pattern of perfluoroalkyl carboxylic acids (PFCAs) in wild boar liver reflects the contamination of the local soil at the two hot-spot areas IE and PS. This first comparison of PFAS contamination between wild boars and soil suggests that wild boar livers are suitable bioindicators for PFAS contamination in the terrestrial environment. Moreover, in terrestrial sam-ples from area IE, legacy PFAS were found to be retained for a longer period as compared to riverine samples (suspended particulate matter and chub filet).

AB  - This paper proposes a multi-objective planning framework for electric vehicle (EV) charging stations in emerging power networks that move towards green transportation electrification. Four cases are investigated to study the impacts of EV integration on environmental and economic requirements. In order to facilitate the installation of EV charging stations, the proposed model is formulated to combine the planning models of renewable energy systems, energy storage systems (ESSs), thyristor-controlled series compensators, and transmission lines into the EV-based planning problem. The first objective function aims to maximize EVs' penetration by increasing the networks' capacity to supply charging stations throughout the day, whereas the second objective, on the other hand, emphasizes lowering the carbon dioxide emissions from fossil fuel-based generation units in order to benefit the environment. The third objective is to meet the financial requirements by lowering the initial investment and operating costs of the installed devices. The proposed model is written as a multi-objective optimization problem that is solved using the multi-objective version of the Gazelle optimization algorithm (MGOA). The efficiency of the MGOA was tested by solving a set of four benchmark test functions and the proposed problem. The obtained results demonstrated the MGOA's superiority in solving multi-objective optimization problems when compared to some well-known optimization algorithms in terms of robustness and solution quality. The MGOA's robustness was between 20% and 30% and outperformed other algorithms by 5%. The MGO was successful in outperforming the other algorithms in providing a better solution. The Egyptian West Delta Network simulations revealed a 250 MWh increase in the energy supplied to EVs when energy storage was not used. However, storage systems were necessary for shifting EV charging periods away from high solar radiation scenarios. The use of ESS increased greenhouse gas emissions. When ESS was installed with a capacity of 1116.4 MWh, the carbon emissions increased by approximately 208.29 million metric tons. ESS's role in improving the EV's hosting capacity grows as more renewables are added to the network. ESS's role in improving the EV's hosting capacity rises as more renewables are added to the network.

AB  - The pig farm sector has been developing rapidly over recent decades, leading to an increase in the production of slurry and associated environmental impacts. Breeding farms require the maintenance of adequate indoor thermal environments, resulting in high energy demands that are frequently met by fossil fuels and electricity. Farm heating systems and the storage of slurry constitute considerable sources of polluting gases. There is thus a need to highlight the advantages that new green heating solutions can offer to reduce the global environmental impact of pig farming. This research presents an overview of alternative pig farm slurry technology, using geothermal heat pumps, which reduces the harmful effects of slurry and improves the energy behavior of farms. The results reflect the environmental benefits of this solution in terms of reducing carbon and hydric footprints. Reducing the temperature of slurry with the geothermal heat pump of the system also reduces the annual amount of greenhouse gases and ammonia emissions, and, via the heat pump, slurry heat is used for installation heating. Annual emissions of CO(2)e could be reduced by more than half, and ammonia emissions could also experience a significant reduction if the slurry technology is installed. Additional advantages confirm the positive impact that the expansion of this renewable technology could have on the global pig farm sector.

AB  - The invasive sally lightfoot crab Percnon gibbesi (H. Milne Edwards, 1853) has spread among the coasts of the Mediterranean Sea, including the coasts of Annaba Gulf (Algeria). Investigating the trophic position of the species and looking for the seasonal variations in the diet of this alien decapod was the aim of this study. To do this, samples of P. gibbesi were collected along Annaba coasts within a year. The traditional stomach content analysis (SCA) was integrated to the stable isotope analysis (SIA) of nitrogen and carbon to provide a comprehensive evaluation of the feeding ecology of P. gibbesi, and its within-year variability. Results highlighted, for the first time, significant seasonal variation in P. gibbesi diet, improving our understanding of its trophic plasticity and potential dietary overlaps with other herbivore species. Its feeding plasticity is an asset in the successful expansion of its distribution. Relating its diet composition through the different seasons with the interactions with native herbivores will be essential to fully appreciate the impact of the spread of P. gibbesi in the Mediterranean Sea.

AB  - In the past decade, there has been increased interest in rapeseed cultivation in Iran due to its role in crop rotation with cereals and its contribution to edible oil production. In this regard, a two-year experiment was conducted to investigate the effect of chitosan application on the yield and physiological traits of rapeseed genotypes under drought stress conditions. The experiment was designed as a factorial split plot with a randomized complete block design (RCBD) and three replications. The main plots included irrigation at two levels, normal irrigation (control) and stopping irrigation after the flowering stage, and chitosan at two levels, foliar spraying with pure water (not using chitosan) and foliar spraying with chitosan at a rate of 250 mg per liter. The subplots included rapeseed genotypes, including BAL104, DIE710/08, BAL101, BAL102, QUIE03/11, and Okapi. Result of the mean comparison of irrigation and genotype interaction on grain yield showed that under normal irrigation conditions, Okapi had the highest grain yield with an average of 6,884 kg/ha. However, when irrigation was stopped after the flowering stage, genotype DIE710/08 had the highest grain yield with an average of 3,261 kg/ha. Furthermore, the Okapi genotype showed a sharp decrease in grain yield under water stress. Results also showed that the application of chitosan treatment caused a significant decrease of erucic acid and glucosinolate (18% and 17%, respectively) under stress conditions compared to the control treatment. The Okapi cultivar thrives best when there are no restrictions on irrigation water. However, it's recommended to use the DIE710/08 genotype when there is stress during the flowering stage. This genotype can still provide a decent grain yield in these conditions.

AB  - Sheep was one of the first domesticated animals in Neolithic West Eurasia. The zooarchaeological record suggests that domestication first took place in Southwest Asia, although much remains unresolved about the precise location(s) and timing(s) of earliest domestication, or the post-domestication history of sheep. Here, we present 24 new partial sheep paleogenomes, including a 13,000-year-old Epipaleolithic Central Anatolian wild sheep, as well as 14 domestic sheep from Neolithic Anatolia, two from Neolithic Iran, two from Neolithic Iberia, three from Neolithic France, and one each from Late Neolithic/Bronze Age Baltic and South Russia, in addition to five present-day Central Anatolian Mouflons and two present-day Cyprian Mouflons. We find that Neolithic European, as well as domestic sheep breeds, are genetically closer to the Anatolian Epipaleolithic sheep and the present-day Anatolian and Cyprian Mouflon than to the Iranian Mouflon. This supports a Central Anatolian source for domestication, presenting strong evidence for a domestication event in SW Asia outside the Fertile Crescent, although we cannot rule out multiple domestication events also within the Neolithic Fertile Crescent. We further find evidence for multiple admixture and replacement events, including one that parallels the Pontic Steppe-related ancestry expansion in Europe, as well as a post-Bronze Age event that appears to have further spread Asia-related alleles across global sheep breeds. Our findings mark the dynamism of past domestic sheep populations in their potential for dispersal and admixture, sometimes being paralleled by their shepherds and in other cases not.

AB  - Little is known about the potential responses of ecologically specialized tropical species to atmospheric change and global warming. In 2 years of greenhouse experiments simulating climate change impacts, we quantified the effects of mean ambient temperature, elevated temperature (Te), current ambient CO2 concentration ([CO2]a), and doubled CO2 concentration ([CO2]e) on biomass, growth rate, and foliar chemistry of the morning glory vine, Camonea umbellata. In addition, we measured the impacts of climate change simulations on the performance and survival of the tortoise beetle, Acromis sparsa, which feeds exclusively on C. umbellata. Full-sib A. sparsa larval broods were divided into cohorts. Each cohort was placed in one of four temperature-CO2 controlled chambers and fed leaves grown in their respective treatments. Vines growing in [CO2]e more than doubled their biomass and their leaves expanded faster. The [CO2]a and Te treatments interacted to yield the greatest foliar [C]. Vines in [CO2]e and Te had the greatest C:N ratios, the lowest availability of nitrogen, and highest larval mortality. Whereas pupae were smaller and suffered lower survival in Te, pupal mass and survival increased in both the [CO2]e and Te treatments. Overall, the simultaneous elevation of both [CO2] and temperature caused declines in host quality, larval survivorship, and pupal mortality that were not observed when only one climate factor was altered. Based on this first tropical experimental study, we predict that C. umbellata will benefit from elevation of temperature and atmospheric [CO2] by altering its foliar chemistry to the detriment of its diet-specialized herbivore enemy.

AB  - There is a growing recognition of the influence of both genetic and ecological context in shaping different cognitive traits. The hippocampal region is identified as a critical area for memory and learning in mammals, susceptible to modification by environmental influences. Although previous studies have identified the effects of various factors on cognitive parameters during early development, comparatively few research was conducted on wild species to analyze the role of natural environmental stimuli in the formation of spatial learning and memory abilities. Thus, to assess the importance of exposure to a complex and challenging environment during early development, we compared spatial learning performance of captive-born tuco-tucos with previous data obtained in our laboratory from wild-born adult tuco-tucos. The results showed that wild-born individuals learned faster, requiring less time to complete a labyrinth and making fewer errors than those who had no experience in their natural environment. These findings underscore the importance of considering ecological factors in understanding the evolution of brains and cognitive abilities.

AB  - Background Coexisting plant species frequently exhibit marked differences in leaf damage caused by chewing insects. Such variation in leaf herbivory has often been attributed to interspecific differences in leaf defensive traits, leaf nutritional quality and leaf abundance. Aims We aimed to investigate the hypothesis that plants surrounded by more similar neighbours tend to exhibit higher levels of herbivory than plants surrounded by less similar neighbours. Methods We sampled 27 tree and shrub species in 49 plots of 10 m(2) located in a Neotropical savanna. For each of the 815 plants sampled, we quantified leaf damage, specific leaf area, leaf toughness, height, and conspecific abundance. We analysed the relationship between herbivory levels and plant traits comparing each individual with its neighbouring plants. The effect of phylogenetic similarity was addressed using the mean phylogenetic distance between a focal plant individual and its neighbours (i.e., the phylogenetic isolation). Results Leaf herbivory damage ranged from zero to 29.6%. We found that phylogenetic isolation, specific leaf area, plant height, and plant abundance were not related to differences in leaf herbivory at the individual level in a neighbourhood. Conclusions Our findings show that leaf herbivory damage of individual plants was not consistently influenced either by phylogenetic or by trait similarity with neighbours.

AB  - The Rhino Bond is the first financial instrument dedicated to protecting a species. The Bond allows investors to invest in the conservation of the black rhinoceros Diceros bicornis, with the amount of money returned by the investment depending on whether rhinoceros numbers increase (and by how much). In this paper we focus on how the Bond was brought into being. We draw on an analysis of organizational reports along with data collected from interviews with key informants to investigate the roles of the various stakeholders in the Bond, how species and sites were selected, the motivations and experiences of the stakeholders and the involvement of stakeholders in decision-making. We found that although conservation actors are attracted by the potential for new funding, they have experienced challenges navigating complex financial instruments. The needs of financial actors often dictated decision-making, with implications for the species and sites chosen for the Bond. As profits are tied to an increase in population size of a specific species (which needs to be monitored), the instrument has favoured large and easily counted species and populations. Only some sites were able to meet the stringent conditions of financial instruments, including metrics on financial sustainability. We argue that the dominance of financial principles and motives means that not all species or sites will be viable candidates for investment and that conservation finance should not be seen as a panacea.

AB  - Commercial Hog Operations (CHOs) produce large amounts of fecal waste, which is often treated in lagoons and sprayed onto fields as fertilizer. The effects of these systems on proximal water quality compared to ambient conditions have not been well-studied, and are particularly important for understanding the dissemination of fecal bacteria and antimicrobial resistance. A longitudinal, case-control watershed study was designed to study effects of CHOs on microbial water quality among watersheds with similar soil, land use, human population, and area. We compared water-sheds with (n = 13) and without (n = 9) CMOs over one year measuring fecal indicator bacteria (FIB), microbial source tracking (MST) fecal markers, and antimicrobial resistance in isolated Escherichia coli. E. coli concentrations were higher (p < 0.001) at sites downstream of CHOs (1284 CFU/100 mL, n = 103) compared to background sites (687 CFU/100 mL, n = 74). The human MST marker HF183 was detected at similarly low concentrations (PR = 1.3 (0.91, 1.8), p = 0.30). However, the swine MST marker pig-2-bac was found at more sites downstream of CMOs (PR = 3.5 (0.98, 12),p = 0.035) and at a significantly higher (p = 0.003) mean concentration at sites downstream of CHOs (283 copies/mL) compared to background sites (0.76 copies/mL). The presence of any antimicrobial resistance was observed more often for E. coli isolated downstream from CHOs (19%, n = 556) than background sites (6%, n = 356), with tetracycline resistance observed most often. Nine isolates from four sites downstream of CHOs and one isolate from a background site were confirmed beta-lactamase-producing E. coli. Overall, these results show that fecal microbes and antimicrobial resistance from CHOs may be transported off-site, however more research is needed to characterize timing and conditions of off-site transport. Mitigation strategies such as optimizeation of waste treatment, buffers, and antibiotic stewardship could help reduce the contributions of microbial contaminants to surface water.

AB  - Animals experience seasonal changes of environmental and ecological conditions in most habitats. Fluctuations in ambient temperature have a strong influence on thermoregulation, particularly on small endothermic mammals. However, different mammalian species cope differently with these changes. Understanding the physiological responses of organisms to different seasons and analysing the mechanisms that account for intra- and inter-specific differences and the ecological consequences of these variations is important to predict species responses to climatic changes. Consequences of climatic changes will be most pronounced in climatically already challenging habitats, such as the dry regions of western Madagascar. We aimed to identify the seasonal responses and adaptive possibilities in energy budgeting of Lepilemur edwardsi, a small primate of this habitat, by measuring metabolic rate (MR; open-flow respiratory) and skin temperature in the field during different seasons. Resting metabolism was generally low, but our study did not detect any signs of regular heterothermic episodes, despite the fact that these are known in other sympatrically living lemurs with a similar lifestyle. Surprisingly, L. edwardsi responded by elevating its resting MR in the poor-resourced dry season, compared to the better-resourced wet season, presumably to master detoxification of their increasingly toxic diet. As body mass decreased over this time, this strategy is obviously not energetically balanced on the long term. This is cause for concern, as it suggests that L. edwardsi has a very small leeway to adjust to changing conditions as experienced due to climate change, as dry season are expected to become longer and hotter, straining water budgets and food quality even more. Moreover, our findings highlight the importance of studying physiological parameters directly in the field and under differing climatic conditions.

AB  - Simple Summary Insects use visual stimuli to find habitats, food, or a mate while moving around. This trait might be exploited to intercept flying insects to monitor their populations and reduce their presence. Among the various visual stimuli, colours are commonly used to attract insects. Lipoptena fortisetosa is a hematophagous deer ectoparasite native to Japan that has spread to several central European countries and was recently recorded in Italy. Measures to monitor and control L. fortisetosa would be helpful given its potential threat as a pathogen vector for animals and humans. The objective of this research was to assess the potential use of colour to attract and trap L. fortisetosa. The response of the winged adults was evaluated through an experimental trial carried out in a wooded area of Tuscany using differently coloured sticky panels as traps. Blue panels attracted the highest number while yellow panels showed the lowest performance. This preference for blue could be useful in the design of traps to reduce the population of this parasitic fly which, at certain times, can reach a very high density, causing annoyance to wildlife and humans visiting natural areas. Lipoptena fortisetosa, a deer ked native to Japan, has established itself in several European countries and was recently recorded in Italy. This hippoboscid ectoparasite can develop high density populations, causing annoyance to animals and concern regarding the potential risk of transmitting pathogens to humans. No monitoring or control methods for L. fortisetosa have been applied or tested up to now. This research evaluated the possible response of L. fortisetosa winged adults to different colours as the basis for a monitoring and control strategy. In the summer of 2020, a series of six differently coloured sticky panels were randomly set as traps in a wooded area used by deer for resting. The results indicated a clear preference of the deer ked for the blue panels that caught the highest number of flies during the experimental period. Lower numbers of flies were trapped on the red, green, black, and white panels, with the yellow panels recording the fewest captures. The response clearly demonstrates that this species displays a colour preference, and that coloured traps might be useful for monitoring and limiting this biting ectoparasite in natural areas harbouring wildlife and visited by people.

AB  - Nothofagus (southern beech) species form a major component of southern hemisphere forests, and in many regions are becoming an important focus for restoration efforts. However, restoration projects are predominantly carried out at small, local scales using a wide range of different techniques that have produced mixed results. In order to improve outcomes and develop general strategies for southern beech restoration, we review and compare data from previous trials to determine what techniques have been scientifically tested, identify the most effective methods, and pinpoint gaps in current practices. We assessed the effects of restoration techniques, applied in 91 trials from 22 publications across the southern hemisphere, on seedling survival and growth. Providing shelter improved both seedling survival and growth, controlling weeds improved survival, and protecting from herbivores improved seedling growth. Despite being one of the most commonly applied techniques, fertilizer application only marginally improved seedling survival and did not significantly influence seedling growth. Other techniques, such as increasing glasshouse container size or growth time or manipulating soil before planting, showed mixed results. Surprisingly, no trials examined the use of ectomycorrhizal fungal inoculum as a restoration technique. We discuss the outcomes of this review in the context of our current understanding of southern beech regeneration ecology, to inform future Nothofagus restoration practices and suggest where future research should be directed.

AB  - Tropical macroalgae serve importance ecological roles on coral reefs but can supplant corals in phase shifts as shown worldwide. Thus, it is important to understand their fundamental photophysiology and effects on calcification mechanisms. We examined organic delta C-13, inorganic CaCO3 delta C-13 and delta O-18, and organic %C, %N, C:N of abundant macroalgae on Little Cayman Island (LCI) reefs across a broad light gradient (5-2,000 mu mol photons m(-2) s(-1)). We hypothesized that LCI macroalgae utilize greater CO2 in low light environments as carbon concentration mechanisms (CCMs) to take up HCO3- have high energetic costs. We proposed that calcification mechanisms are also influenced by light and Ci-use strategies. LCI macroalgae had organic delta C-13 values (-12% to -25%) indicative of CCMs and exhibited only a 1-3% delta C-13 depletion under irradiances < 5 mu mol photons m(-2) s(-1). Light and phyla were significant in a mixed model explaining similar to 80% of variance in organic delta C-13. Organic delta C-13 was a weak predictor and light insignificant in explaining inorganic delta C-13 values of thalli carbonates. Biogenic carbonate delta C-13 values were taxa-specific based on cluster analysis of delta C-13:delta d(18)O ratios, an indication of diverse calcification mechanisms. LCI macroalgal photosynthesis utilized CCMs across a broad range of irradiances, thus greater CO2 availability under ocean acidification is not likely to enhance community dominance of macroalgae of concern (e.g., Lobophora sp.) due to shifts in photophysiology. The mechanisms of Ci sequestration for photosynthesis appeared to be mostly uncoupled from calcification mechanisms that were diverse across phyla, likely due to distinct macroalgal forms, sites of calcification and carbonate structure.

AB  - Home-range estimates are a common product of animal tracking data, as each range represents the area needed by a given individual. Population-level inference of home-range areas-where multiple individual home ranges are considered to be sampled from a population-is also important to evaluate changes over time, space or covariates such as habitat quality or fragmentation, and for comparative analyses of species averages. Population-level home-range parameters have traditionally been estimated by first assuming that the input tracking data were sampled independently when calculating home ranges via conventional kernel density estimation (KDE) or minimal convex polygon (MCP) methods, and then assuming that those individual home ranges were measured exactly when calculating the population-level estimates. This conventional approach does not account for the temporal autocorrelation that is inherent in modern tracking data, nor for the uncertainties of each individual home-range estimate, which are often large and heterogeneous. Here, we introduce a statistically and computationally efficient framework for the population-level analysis of home-range areas, based on autocorrelated kernel density estimation (AKDE), that can account for variable temporal autocorrelation and estimation uncertainty. We apply our method to empirical examples on lowland tapir Tapirus terrestris, kinkajou Potos flavus, white-nosed coati Nasua narica, white-faced capuchin monkey Cebus capucinus and spider monkey Ateles geoffroyi, and quantify differences between species, environments and sexes. Our approach allows researchers to more accurately compare different populations with different movement behaviours or sampling schedules while retaining statistical precision and power when individual home-range uncertainties vary. Finally, we emphasize the estimation of effect sizes when comparing populations, rather than mere significance tests.

AB  - Relating physiological stress to habitat quality could refine conservation efforts. Habitat quality, which is often inferred from patch occupancy or demographic rates, might be measured in a more timely and nuanced way using metrics of physiological stress. To understand whether stress-associated hormones vary with metrics of habitat quality, we measured fecal glucocorticoid metabolite (FGM) levels in the American pika (Ochotona princeps), a small mammal with well-defined habitat (talus), which can vary in quality depending on the presence of subsurface ice features. In spring and fall 2018, we collected feces noninvasively from pika territories in taluses "with" or "without" subsurface ice to capture seasonal variation in FGM between habitat types. We used linear mixed effects models to explore the interactions among season, habitat metrics (including subsurface ice status), and subsurface temperature as predictors of FGM. We found support for interacting effects on FGM levels, which covaried with season, elevation, putative ice presence, graminoid to forb ratio, graminoid cover, and measures of acute subsurface heat exposure. However, only one subsurface temperature metric differed according to putative presence of subsurface ice. Our results contribute to the growing evidence that FGMs might be developed as a tool to assess habitat quality.

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic, which modified levels of visitor attendance to urban forests and green spaces, provided a unique opportunity to measure the effects of human presence on wild animals and their activity. The aim of our study was to describe how the daily activity pattern of roe deer (i.e. proportion of day- and night-time observations) changed in response to visitor frequency in urban forests of Warsaw in four periods of 2020 (the year the COVID-19 pandemic was announced) compared to the same periods in 2019 (control year). In total, 662 observations of roe deer were recorded by camera traps in both years. The frequency of roe deer observations in urban forests of Warsaw in day- and night-time did not differ between March 2019 and 2020 (period before lockdown, no changes in the number of visitors). Next, between 1 and 20 April 2020 (national lockdown; urban forests were closed for public) the activity of roe deer increased during the day-time. Between 21 April and 30 June in both 2019 and 2020 the frequency of roe deer observations in day and night-time did not differ (green areas were reopened, remote learning). Finally, in July-August 2020 (summer holidays, tourist traffic in forests elevated all day round) the activity of roe deer visibly increased during the night-time. Our research shows how their activity rapidly shifted toward day-time when forests were closed for visitors, and toward night-time when the number of visitors was higher in urban forests after the lockdown. To summarize, roe deer in urban forests showed high ecological plasticity to human presence and rapidly adjusted to changes in the number of visitors in urban forest during the COVID-19 pandemic.

AB  - Personality studies are increasingly relevant and applicable to a broad range of conservation issues, including a role for selecting compatible mates in conservation breeding programs (CBPs). Choosing compatible breeding pairs is essential for maximizing reproductive success in CBPs, which provide assurance populations for species facing extinction and candidates for translocation to support wild populations. We investigated the value of caretaker-assessed personality ratings of the critically endangered 'Alala (Hawaiian Crow, Corvus hawaiiensis) in predicting reproductive outcomes: nest quality, fertile egg production, and hatchability in the 'Alala CBP. Caretakers used well-defined operational definitions to rate 22 personality traits for 69 male and 59 female 'Alala, achieving high inter-rater agreement (ICC >= 0.85) for 8 traits - aggressive, bold/fearless, fearful, imprinted/abnormal, inept, submissive, territorial, and tendency to feather pluck (a stereotypic behavior) - used in a principal components analysis to distill intercorrelated variables into three principal components. While we did not find that personality influences nest quality or hatchability (based on limiting inferences to fixed effects with high relative importance scores; >= 0.8), we found some evidence that pairs with males that were more territorial/aggressive and fearful than their mates had a higher probability of egg fertilization, but there was substantial variability in this relationship, with confidence intervals overlapping zero. These personality traits may influence pair dynamics, enhancing compatibility, may predict better pair coordination on the nest, or both. Our results highlight the ability of caretakers to successfully identify 'Alala personality traits and provide some support for integrating personality into the pairing process; however, further research is needed to understand the value of 'Alala personality as a mate selection tool. The application of similar approaches to enhance CBP performance in other taxa is promising, but will require overcoming methodological challenges surrounding the complexity of data collection and interpretation of consistency among raters.
   We evaluated caretaker-rated personality effects on conservation breeding outcomes in the 'Alala (Hawaiian Crow, Corvus hawaiiensis). We found that caretaker ratings were useful in identifying personality types in 'Alala and some (albeit weak) evidence that certain caretaker-rated personality traits (territoriality/aggressiveness and fearfulness) may predict variation in egg fertility. Moreover, we describe how the application of similar personality assessments may be used to enhance conservation breeding outcomes in other taxa, while underscoring the importance of overcoming methodological challenges surrounding the complexity of data collection and interpretation of among-rater consistency. image

AB  - The tree shrew brain has garnered considerable attention due to its remarkable similarities to human brain. However, the cellular composition and genetic signatures of tree shrew hippocampus across postnatal life remain poorly characterized. Here, we establish the first single-nucleus transcriptomic atlas of tree shrew hippocampus spanning postnatal life, detailing the dynamics and diversity of the neurogenic lineage, oligodendrocytes, microglia, and endothelial cells. Notably, cross-species transcriptomic comparison among humans, macaques, tree shrews, and mice reveals that the tree shrew transcriptome resembles that of macaques, making it a promising model for simulating human neurological diseases. More interestingly, we identified a unique class of tree shrew-specific neural stem cells and established SOX6, ADAMTS19, and MAP2 as their markers. Furthermore, aberrant gene expression and cellular dysfunction in the tree shrew hippocampus are linked to neuroinflammation and cognitive impairment during tree shrew aging. Our study provides extensive resources on cell composition and transcriptomic profiles, serving as a foundation for future research on neurodevelopmental and neurological disorders in tree shrews.

AB  - Most studies of trade-offs between defence, growth and reproduction have examined pairwise correlations between these processes, used ratio-based measures for defence allocation such as allelochemical concentration and trichome density and estimated resource allocation to growth and reproduction in terms of biomass. However, for statistical and biological reasons, it may be preferable to analyse these processes holistically, to use absolute amounts of resistant traits and leaf mass/area, and to measure growth and reproduction in terms of nodes with or without flowers. We aimed to identify how leaf stinging hairs as resistant structures and leaf area as a functional trait affected growth and reproduction in the Japanese stinging nettle Urtica thunbergiana. We conducted a greenhouse experiment with nettles derived from a population that has been historically exposed to heavy browsing by Sika deer (Cervus nippon) in Nara Park, Japan. We analysed causal relationships between stinging hair number, leaf area, growth rate, growth performance and reproductive output using structural equation modelling (SEM). In this analysis, we adopted newly developed indices for a plant's stinging hair number and leaf area, and measures of growth and reproductive traits in terms of nodes instead of biomass. There was a significant covariation between stinging hair number and leaf area. Stinging hair number had direct negative effects on growth rate and performance, while leaf area had positive direct effects on growth rate, growth performance and reproductive output. The growth rate had a significant direct positive effect on reproductive output, resulting in a significant indirect negative effect of stinging hair number on reproductive output. This indicates that there is not only a trade-off between resistance and growth but also an indirect trade-off between resistance and reproduction through reduced growth rate and suggests that U. thunbergiana sacrifices growth rather than reproduction to increase resistance. Our study provides future work on trade-offs between defence, growth and reproduction with a new methodological framework that can assess indirect as well as direct trade-offs, together with the effects of leaf area as a functional trait on these processes.Read the free Plain Language Summary for this article on the Journal blog.

AB  - How did hunter-gatherers initially settle and move across extreme environments? We conducted a multi-disciplinary study to tackle this question, focusing on how Paleoindigenous populations inhabited the hyperarid core of the Atacama Desert. Particularly, we examined the stable isotopic values of similar to 12,000-11,200-year-old camelid and rodent bones and hair samples retrieved from low-elevation archaeological sites (Pampa del Tamarugal basin - PdT, 800-1200 masl). By integrating novel and existing data into a regional stable isotope ecology, we offer a baseline for interpreting our results. delta C-13 and delta N-15 values on archaeological remains show animals with different geographical origins. A first group includes camelids and rodents with lower delta N-15 values and delta C-13 values indicating a dominantly C-3 diet, corresponding to animals either local to the PdT or from the Andean Steppe, at least similar to 80 km away and between 4000 and 4500 masl. Most of these remains, however, come from residential sites and belong to young camelids, indicating a local origin. A second group presents a higher delta N-15 signal and delta C-13 values indicative of a mixed C-3-C-4 based diet. These animals were not local but source to the Puna at least similar to 60 km away between 3200 - 4000 masl. We hypothesize that the first would correspond to animals associated with hunter-gatherer bands settled around a wetland and grove environment in the PdT. The second group could correspond to remains brought by humans from the Puna to the PdT. Our results demonstrate that during the Late Pleistocene/Early Holocene the Atacama was very different than today, supporting life that included large and mid-size game. These results also show that the core of the Atacama attracted animals and people and counters the notion of this ecosystem as a barren passageway from the Andes to the coast.

AB  - There has been a recent push to accelerate nuclear fuel qualification by combining advanced modeling and simulation with accelerated separate effects irradiation testing. One separate effects irradiation testing capability is the MiniFuel vehicle designed to accelerate burnup accumulation in "mini " fuel samples under isothermal temperature conditions. These steady-state MiniFuel irradiations effectively decouple the fuel temperature from the fission rate (i.e., power) by minimizing the fuel volume and relying on gamma heating in the surrounding components for temperature control. This provides experimenters a flexible means for targeting and evaluating specific fuel microstructures for a wide range of fuel types and operating conditions. However, the accelerated fuel qualification process must be informed by modeling and simulation to properly evaluate the most impactful fuel performance parameters and to identify modeling and data gaps. A test matrix can then be designed to fill those gaps and, ultimately, refine and validate the fuel performance models. This work uses the BISON fuel performance code to conduct an assessment and sensitivity study on calculated fission gas release (FGR) from UO2 MiniFuel disks during isothermal irradiation and temperature transients. Qualitatively, the existing fission gas behavior model in BISON reproduces the effects of temperature and burnup as expected. However, when quantitatively compared with FGR data from irradiated (103 MWd/kgU) UO2 disks under thermal annealing representative of LOCA conditions, the model shows a less satisfactory predictive capability. As a result, development needed to model the specific mechanisms of transient FGR during LOCAs, including fuel fragmentation and the role of the high burnup structure (HBS), are identified. Finally, a UO2 MiniFuel test matrix is proposed to extend the temperature and burnup ranges covered by previous experiments and provide new model validation data for fission gas behavior under high burnup and transient conditions.

AB  - Managers of threatened species in remote protected areas play a pivotal role in shaping the outcomes of management and conservation programmes. The island of Java supports the last remaining population of the Javan rhinoceros Rhinoceros sondaicus, a Critically Endangered megaherbivore with only 72 individuals persisting in the wild, in Ujung Kulon National Park. Substantial resources are being invested to manage the Javan rhinoceros and it is difficult to monitor it in the rainforest to assess whether management actions have been successful. Insights from frontline staff into the outcomes of past conservation actions and the future actions required may be key to enhancing the outcomes of conservation actions for threatened species. To study the perceptions of frontline staff towards the conservation of the Javan rhinoceros, management actions and their outcomes, we surveyed all 36-frontline staff in Ujung Kulon National Park. Although staff perceptions of conservation outcomes were generally positive, they noted key anthropogenic threats and challenges to rhinoceros protection inherent to the survival of the last Javan rhinoceros population. Staff identified increased threat of disease transfer from domestic stock to the rhinoceros, in spite of protective fencing, and the combined effects of illegal firewood collection and agricultural encroachment on rhinoceros habitat. Systematically recording and incorporating the perceptions of frontline staff in remote and often inaccessible protected areas can help identify important areas for future conservation and threat mitigation that can facilitate better protection for the Javan rhinoceros and other iconic species.

AB  - GPS is an important tool for real-time monitoring of individual livestock. Analysis of the spatial and temporal changes in the grazing trajectory of Sunit sheep provided a scientific basis for the rational use of Inner Mongolia desert grassland resources and optimal breeding of livestock. In this study, GPS collars were used to track Sunit sheep in the Inner Mongolia desert grassland. These data were combined with ground measurement data and spatial remote sensing data to investigate the spatial and temporal variation patterns of sheep grazing tracks. The results showed that the distance travelled by sheep in June was significantly different from that in July and August (p < 0.05). The effective daily foraging time was mainly concentrated in the time ranges of 7:00-10:00 and 15:00-18:00 in June and August, and in the time ranges of 7:00-9:00 and 16:00-19:00 in July, for more active grazing behavior in the morning and evening hours. The degree of nuclear density of foraging track points was significantly different from the edible forage biomass (p < 0.05), with the average daily walking distance negatively correlated with the total grass biomass (R-2 = 0.49). Overall, the results of this study confirm that GPSpositioning technology can be applied to study the spatial and temporal variation patterns of sheep and suggest new strategies for more effective grassland management in this region.

AB  - While temperature is well known to affect many life history traits of ectothermic organisms, any attempt to scale up these individual-level processes to population-level consequences must assume a relationship between temperature and the strength of per capita density dependence. Yet, theory has made contrasting predictions about this relationship, and we still need clear experimental tests to determine which relationship is realized in natural systems, especially in heterotrophs. Here, we experimentally isolated and quantified the thermal response of density dependence from the population dynamics of the herbivore Daphnia pulex. We show that the strength of negative density dependence increased linearly with temperature, doubling every 7 degrees C, while the intrinsic growth rate of increase showed a humped shape relationship. This difference caused a humped-shaped relationship of carrying capacity with temperature, with a dramatic 50% decline at the highest temperature. The results provide a sorely needed test of theory and highlight the importance of accounting for thermal responses of indirect effects that only emerge at the population level when forecasting the effects of global warming. While warming temperatures may benefit the individual (via increased growth and reproduction), our results reveal that warming still can be a detriment to the population by strengthening density-dependent processes.

AB  - Solid success in conserving the protected areas would obviously require the participation and cooperation from local people particularly in developing countries where the locals bear most of the expense of Human wildlife coexistence. Considering this, the present research attempts to explore the factor affecting Human-Wildlife Coexistence (HWC) and the related mitigation measures adopted by the buffer zone community of Shivapuri Nagarjun National Park, Nepal (SNNP). The research also intends to determine the livelihood status of the locals, policies and compensations offered by buffer zone management. Data for the quantitative approach has been collected from 446 households residing in the buffer zone regions through structured questionnaire. Qualitative data are fetched through nine KII (Key Informant Interviews) who were the stakeholders of the buffer zone community. The overall results of the research find that locals in the buffer zone of SNNP are affected by the wildlife interventions. Due to this, crop damage is regarded as the massive loss experienced, wild boar is found to be the major conflicting wildlife followed by monkey and leopard. Local people are observed to have positive attitude towards the policies and programs of buffer zone management particularly, fuel-wood supply is the most appreciated benefits proffered.

AB  - Simple Summary This study investigated the genetic attributes of the Jiangshan black pig conservation population, with a specific focus on genetic diversity, family structure, and levels of inbreeding. The results provide significant insights for the management and conservation of a pig population with limited numbers. The study proposes the use of genomic data by breeders to improve breeding practices, especially by taking into account familial relationships. Suggestions include maintaining an equitable distribution of male and female pigs within each family and choosing individuals with a kinship coefficient lower than 0.1 for breeding purposes.Abstract The Jiangshan black pig is an indigenous pig breed in China, renowned for its superior meat quality and adaptability to roughage. However, the population of Jiangshan black pigs has dwindled due to the introduction of cosmopolitan pig breeds and the outbreak of African swine fever, putting them at risk of extinction. To offer insights into the conservation and breeding of Jiangshan black pigs, this study involved 118 Jiangshan black pigs as the research subjects and employed the Zhongxin-1 Porcine Breeding Array PLUS chip to detect whole-genome SNPs. Additionally, various software tools were utilized to accurately analyze the genetic diversity, phylogenetic relationship, inbreeding coefficient, and pedigree structure of the Jiangshan black pig conservation population. The findings indicated that the effective population size (Ne) of the Jiangshan black pig was 4.9, with an average inbreeding coefficient of 0.253 within the population. A genetic relationship analysis identified that the 16 male pigs were clustered into four families, and the 100 female pigs were also assigned to these familial groups. Furthermore, two female pigs were classified as "other" due to their distant genetic relatedness to all the males. These results contribute to a better understanding of the current status of the conservation of the Jiangshan black pig population and offer a theoretical foundation for the development of conservation strategies.

AB  - The present study was carried out to investigate the effects of selenium (Se) supplementation on gut microflora and immune parameters in goats. Twelve female cross breed goats (BW: 10-12 kg) were equally divided into two groups i.e., Control that offered basal diet and Se supplemented group that offered basal diet + selenium yeast (0.15mg/kg BW). In basal diet concentrate was fed at the rate of 2% body weight while roughage (hay)was given as ad-libitum. The dietary treatments were continued for 2 months. The results showed that microbial count (E. coli and Lactobacillus) was higher (p<0.05) in goats offered basal diet supplemented with organic selenium compared to goats fed on basal diet with no Se supplementation. However, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus were significantly higher (p<0.05) in control group goats compared to goats in supplemented group. Significantly higher (p<0.05) IgG concentration was found in Se supplemented goats as compared to control group. The bacterial species produced weak positive biofilm formation (p<0.05) in Se supplemented goats as compared to control group. The hematological indicators revealed that the values of hemoglobin, hematocrit, erythrocytes, mean cell hemoglobin, mean corpuscular volume, mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration, leukocytes, neutrophils, lymphocytes and monocytes count were significantly higher (p<0.05) in the Se treated group compared to control. It was concluded that Se supplemented goats have better gut microflora composition and immune response compared to goats fed on basal diet without Se supplementation.

AB  - For air-breathing marine predators that must save energy during dives, the ability to adopt hunting tactics that minimise the risk of triggering an escape reaction from the prey is crucial for efficient foraging. Female southern elephant seals (SES) Mirounga leonina forage on small mesopelagic prey that they must hunt almost continuously to meet their high-energy requirements. Here we aimed at understanding how these large time-limited deep-divers can efficiently exploit their small-sized prey. To do so, we used data recorded by a new biologger, the sonar tag, deployed on SES during their post-breeding foraging trips. This tag combines an active acoustic sensor with ultra-high-resolution movement and bioluminescence sensors. This combination of sensors offers a unique opportunity to simultaneously describe SES hunting tactics and defence mechanisms of their prey. We analysed more than 5800 prey capture events in 9 SES and show that they adopt a 'stalking' hunting behaviour, allowing them to get as close as possible to their prey before attacking. The ability of SES to adopt stealth approach tactics, minimising the risk of initiating a flight reaction from their prey, might be a key factor in the success of this far-ranging generalist predator.

AB  - The Middle Paleolithic site of Mutzig-Rain, discovered in 1992, has been studied through several pits (called M1 to M15) and excavation area since 2009, evidencing several localities and delivering more than 5000 lithic artifacts and 12,000 well preserved paleontological remains. The main excavation M2 sequence corresponds to a collapsed rock shelter, containing several levels of Middle Paleolithic occupation. The faunal assemblage of the main archaeological levels (l.7a to 7c) from this sequence includes woolly mammoth, reindeer, horse, bison and woolly rhinoceros, reflecting both cold climate and a steppe context for the whole sequence, while microfauna from the lower levels (l.7d and l.10) indicate the occasional presence of forests that could correspond to a cooler climate. In 1995, U-series analyses on bones from M8 were attempted but the obtained results did not follow the sample stratigraphic order. Later, an OSL dating study has placed the M2 archaeological sequence as coeval to the onset of the Weichselian glacial stage (MIS5d-5a), between 100 and 80 ka. The good preservation of the abundant faunal remains at Mutzig-Rain has allowed their use for ESR/U-series dating studies and the results obtained on Mutzig horse teeth are given in the present paper. A first set of analyses of teeth carried out from the M2 excavation provided ages around 106-96 ka for levels M2 l.7, in agreement with the OSL data, despite quite systematic evidence of U-leaching from the dental tissues and the consequent use of the Accelerating Uptake (AU) model for the age calculation. A second set of analyses on teeth from the M2 and M8 localities confirms this uranium leaching trend, placing the deposition of these levels ca 133 -122 ka. Taking the whole set of ESR/U-series ages, which are slightly older than the OSL dates, would suggest that the stratigraphic sequence was deposited between ca 130 ka (M8 l. 6 and M2 l.10) and ca 100 ka (M2 l.7), i.e. on a time range covering the Eemian Interglacial (MIS5e) and the subsequent Early Weichselian Glacial stage (MIS5d5a). However, as the faunal record indicates a cool climate and an open steppe-like environment for the whole archaeological sequence, the ESR/U-series dating to the Eemian Interglacial in the Mutzig-Rain sequence seems unlikely. In order to check the quality of the paleodosimetric reconstruction of the ESR/U-series analyses, an additional isochron study was performed for the two levels for which several teeth were analyzed: M2 l.7 (n = 4) and M8 l.6 (n = 3). This isochron study validates the proposed reconstruction and confirms the Early Weichselian age of these two levels. These results confirm the chronology established previously with OSL and places MutzigRain as a reference site for the understanding of the Neanderthal Middle Palaeolithic occupation in Eastern France.

AB  - Simple Summary Placental blood circulation is the carrier of material exchange, which affects successful pregnancy and fetal development. Placental angiogenesis is very important for the embryo implantation, normal growth and development of the fetus, and animal reproductive performance, but its regulatory mechanism is very complex. In this study, we investigated the relationship between vascular distribution and the expression and methylation patterns of major angiogenic factors in the goat caruncle during the early stage of pregnancy. This research aimed to better understand the genetic mechanism of animal reproductive performance differences and the molecular mechanism of caruncle angiogenesis. The placenta is a temporary maternal-fetal organ, and its maternal placenta (caruncle) is essential for fetal growth and development. The exchange function of the placenta requires vascular development (angiogenesis). However, the angiogenesis of the caruncle is poorly understood in goats during the early stage of pregnancy. Here, we investigated the vascular distribution, mRNA expression of major angiogenic factors, and the methylation levels of ANGPT2 in the goat caruncle. It showed that CAD (capillary area density), CSD (capillary surface density), and APC (area per capillary) increased gradually, while CND (capillary number density) showed an insignificant change, probably due to the variability between animals. The proportion of proliferating cells was observed to be very high (>26%) and increased (p < 0.002) approximately 2-fold from day 20 to 60 of pregnancy. Furthermore, the expression patterns of major angiogenic factors changed during the early stage of pregnancy. Interestingly, we discovered an absolute correlation between the mRNA for ANGPT2, TEK, FGF2, and vascular distribution. Subsequently, we evaluated the DNA methylation of ANGPT2, where we found that mean methylation was negatively correlated with CAD. The methylation at the CpG sites, such as CpG 4/18, CpG 9.10.11, and CpG 15, showed significant changes during the early stage of pregnancy. Thus, our findings suggest that the methylation of ANGPT2 may be involved in the regulation of caruncle angiogenesis during the early stage of pregnancy.

AB  - A long-held paradigm in marine herbivore ecology is that calcified coralline algae are less nutritious than their uncalcified, fleshy counterparts, partially explaining why herbivores prefer to consume uncalcified algae. The basis for this assumption is that calcium carbonate (CaCO3) comprises a large portion of coralline thalli and is a dense, non-nutritious compound that lowers the relative caloric value. Caloric analyses generally make comparisons using dry weight, which is not a biologically relevant metric to assess algal caloric value: algae are not consumed dry and are consumed by volume rather than by weight. We determined the caloric value of 5 fleshy, uncalcified algal species and 5 calcified coralline algal species on a per-dry-weight and per-volume basis. Results clearly indicated that when compared on a per-dry-weight basis, uncalcified thalli were more calorie rich than coralline thalli. However, on a per-volume basis, coralline and uncalcified thalli were more similar, and the caloric value of some corallines exceeded that of some kelps. Our data show that calcified and uncalcified thalli have similar proportions of organic tissue, with a large portion of uncalcified thalli composed of water and a similar portion of calcified thalli composed of water and CaCO3. We argue that a volumetric assessment of the caloric values of macroalgae is more relevant and accurate than a dry-weight metric. The widespread observation that herbivores prefer uncalcified over coralline algae cannot be explained by differences in caloric content, indicating that another mechanism must account for many marine herbivores' avoidance of calcified coralline algae.

AB  - The optimization of the spatial layout of animal husbandry has great significance for the sustainable development of animal husbandry. However, limited research has focused on the optimization of the spatial layout of animal husbandry based on comprehensive competitive advantage evaluation and nutrient balance between planting and breeding. This study established a comprehensive competitive advantage evaluation model of animal husbandry. Based on this model, we performed comprehensive competitive advantage evaluation of animal husbandry. We further calculated the land-carrying capacity index of animal manure and potential land-carrying capacity of animal according to the principle of nutrient balance. Finally, the spatial layout of animal husbandry was optimized using Geographic Information System spatial analysis. Results showed that Harbin had obvious comprehensive competitive advantage in pig, cattle, sheep, and poultry breeding. Daqing had obvious comprehensive competitive advantage in cattle and sheep breeding. The land-carrying capacity index of animal manure of Daxing'anling constantly exceeded 1. The potential land-carrying capacity of animal in Heilongjiang province was uneven, and most regions in Heilongjiang province had development potential of animal husbandry. The optimized target regions of the spatial layout of pig, cattle, sheep, and poultry breeding were all Harbin. A total of 77 956.03 pig equivalent in Daxing'anling was recommended to be transferred to Harbin. Our results are useful for the spatial layout of animal husbandry, environmental pollution prevention from animal husbandry, and optimization of animal products structure.

AB  - Aims Plants can influence the level of herbivory experienced by neighboring plants. The importance of such belowground associational effects are poorly understood. In this study we examine whether Jacobaea vulgaris provides associational resistance against nematodes to neighboring plants. Methods Thirteen species (6 forbs, 3 grasses and 4 legumes) were each grown in mixtures with J. vulgaris and in monocultures. A nematode community was introduced to half of the pots. After 12 weeks, plant dry mass was assessed for each individual plant in each pot, and the number of nematodes in the soil and roots were identified. We then examined for each plant species its performance in mixtures and in monocultures, in presence and absence of nematodes and analyzed the abundance and composition of nematodes. Results Forbs produced more, grasses similar, and legumes less biomass in mixtures with J. vulgaris than in monocultures. Nematode addition did not influence biomass. There were fewer root-feeding nematodes in the soil in mixtures than in monocultures, but this was only true for plants that were good hosts for nematodes. The community composition of soil nematodes was different in monocultures and mixtures. Densities of migratory endoparasitic nematodes in the roots of neighboring plants were lower in mixtures than in monocultures. Moreover, the presence of nematodes changed the outcome of plant-plant interactions, often in favor of J. vulgaris. Conclusions Jacobaea vulgaris provides belowground associational resistance to other plants against migratory endoparasitic nematodes, and the presence of nematodes can change the outcome of plant-plant interactions.

AB  - Fish, whales, and seabirds along the productive west coast of Vancouver Island (WCVI), NE Pacific, rely on copepod prey that are assumed to be rich in lipid. However, the total lipid (TL) and fatty acid content of most copepod species and other mesozooplankton in this region have not been measured. To assess the diets and quality of zooplankton prey off the WCVI, we investigated differences in lipid content and composition of mesozooplankton according to their taxonomic versus functional group identities. Copepods, chaetognaths, euphausiids, and amphipods, belonging to 3 different functional groups, were sampled on the WCVI during pre-, mid-, and post-bloom conditions. Compared to taxonomic classifications, the functional group approach was superior in its ability to discern statistical differences in TL among zooplankton and between seasons. Furthermore, multivariate analyses using zooplankton fatty acid composition from all oceanographic regimes produced 3 to 4 statistically different clusters of species that corroborated functional group designations. However, some trophic flexibility was observed in several copepod species, particularly Calanus marshallae, that may relate to food scarcity or the presence of potentially noxious prey. The omnivorous-herbivorous functional group frequently contained higher amounts of TL and masses of essential fatty acids than the carnivorous group. Euphausiids and C. marshallae contributed the most lipid (mg m(-3)) to the pelagic 'lipid pool', due to very high lipid content and high abundance, respectively. However, on the continental slope and shelf break, chaetognaths and Neocalanus spp. copepods contributed substantially to the lipid pool.

AB  - Innovation is the ability to solve new problems or find novel solutions to familiar problems, and it is known to provide animals with crucial fitness benefits. Although this ability has been extensively studied in some taxa, the factors that predict innovation within and across species are still largely unclear. In this study, we used a novel foraging task to test 111 individuals belonging to 13 ungulate species-a still understudied taxon. To solve the task, individuals had to open transparent and opaque cups with food rewards, by removing their cover. We assessed whether individual factors (neophobia, social integration, sex, age, rank) and socio-ecological factors (dietary breadth, fission-fusion dynamics, domestication, group size) predicted participation and performance in the task. Using a phylogenetic approach, we showed that success was higher for less neophobic and socially less integrated individuals. Moreover, less neophobic individuals, individuals of domesticated species and having higher fission-fusion dynamics were more likely to participate in the task. These results are in line with recent literature suggesting a central role of sociality and personality traits to successfully deal with novel challenges, and confirm ungulates as a promising taxon to test evolutionary theories with a comparative approach.

AB  - Simple Summary: Wolves are known for their cooperative hunting behaviour, which has been thoroughly studied. On the contrary, little is known about lone wolves' hunting strategies. Between 2017 and 2019, we monitored a lone male wolf living in a Mediterranean coastal area. The wolf settled in a protected estate where both wild and domestic ungulates were available as potential prey. His predatory behaviour was recorded through a combination of camera trapping and active search for kill sites and prey carcasses. Features of kill sites were modelled to test for selection by the wolf. The main prey resulted to be fallow deer. The wolf avoided dense habitats to hunt and usually attacked his prey in open areas where the presence of fences could support him in constraining and successfully killing deer. The prey body condition, estimated as the percentage of fat content in the bone marrow of hind legs, was above the average of the population, suggesting a high efficacy for the lone wolf hunting strategy but also the adoption of a high-risk feeding strategy by deer.
   The aim of the study was to assess which kill site characteristics were selected by a lone wolf living in a protected Mediterranean coastal area near the city of Pisa, Italy, where both wild and domestic ungulates were available as potential prey. Between 2017 and 2019, we monitored the wolf's predatory behaviour through a combination of camera trapping and active search for kill sites and prey carcasses. The main prey found was the fallow deer (n = 82); only two wild boars and no domestic ungulates were found preyed upon. The features and habitat of kill sites were modelled to test for selection by the wolf. The habitat type of kill site was composed of meadows and pastures (89.3%), woods (7.3%), degraded coastal areas (1.9%), roads and rivers (1.1%), and marshes (0.5%). We calculated their distance from landscape features and ran a binomial generalised linear model to test the influence of such landscape variables. The distance of kill sites from landscape elements was significantly different from random control sites, and a positive selection for fences was found. In fact, the wolf pushed fallow deer towards a fence to constrain them and prevent them from escaping. We also analysed the body condition of predated fallow deer as a percentage of fat content in the bone marrow of the hind legs. Our results revealed the selection of the lone wolf for deer in good body condition. This is a possible outcome of the habitat selection shown by fallow deer in the study area, where fenced open pastures are the richest in trophic resources; therefore, our findings suggest a high efficacy for the lone wolf hunting strategy, but also the adoption of a high risk feeding strategy by deer. This study suggests that a lone predator can take advantage of human infrastructures to maximise its predatory effectiveness.

AB  - Opuntia stricta var. stricta (Haworth.) Haworth (Cactaceae) is an important invasive alien plant (IAP) in South Africa, that invades both disturbed and undisturbed habitats mainly within grasslands and savannas. Fortunately, substantial control has been achieved using the biological control agent, Dactylopius opuntiae (Cockerell) (Hemiptera: Dactylopiidae), a sap sucking scale insect. With rising atmospheric CO2 concentrations, many plants alter their growth traits, most notably leaf nutritional quality which in turn affects their arthropod herbivores. Therefore, we tested whether D. opuntiae fitness and its subsequent efficacy as a biological control agent is altered by O. stricta plants grown at elevated CO2. Using walk-in Conviron growth chambers, O. stricta was grown at three CO2 concentrations; 250 (sub-ambient - sCO2). 400 (ambient -aCO2) and 600 ppm (elevated - eCO2). After 70 days of growth, plants were inoculated with 20 first instar D. opuntiae crawlers and we subsequently measured parameters to assess their fitness. Plant traits were measured regularly throughout the 6.5-month experiment. Dactylopius opuntiae fitness index was significantly lowered on eCO2 plants which slowed the rate of herbivory. Dactylopius opuntiae fitness index was negatively correlated to cladode carbon/nitrogen ratios indicating reduced plant quality was a potential driver. However, despite reduced D. opuntiae fitness and slowed rates of damage, O. stricta growth at eCO2 was still inhibited by the insect, and final plant biomass did not differ from aCO2 plants, unlike that observed for the control plants. Furthermore, irrespective of CO2 treatment, all plants succumbed to D. opuntiae herbivory with plants grown at eCO2 taking approximately-three weeks longer than sCO2 and aCO2 plants to die. Despite mortality of O. stricta plants grown at eCO2 due to D. opuntiae feeding, the long-term potential cumulative effects of reduced agent fitness and their subsequent efficacy may hinder the manage-ment of this IAP with rising atmospheric CO2 concentrations.

AB  - Although sessile, plants have sophisticated systems of perceiving their environment. They respond to biotic and abiotic stress, for instance, they can detect damage caused by insect feeding or oviposition and respond by releasing volatile compounds, known as herbivore- or oviposition-induced plant volatiles (HIPVs or OIPVs). The corn leafhopper, Dalbulus maidis (DeLong and Wolcott), is a sap-sucking insect that has been causing challenges to maize growers across the Americas by transmitting phytopathogens that cause substantial production losses. In this study, we evaluated whether maize plants modify their volatile emissions in response to different densities of pathogen-free D. maidis adults, the type of injury, and varying injury durations at two distinct vegetative stages. The results showed that injury caused by corn leafhoppers induced the release of HIPVs and OIPVs, with the response influenced by the plant stage, insect density, type of injury and injury duration. Density primarily affected the quantity of volatile induction, injury duration shaped the induced blend, and plant stage influenced all these aspects. Consistently induced compounds by all the factors tested included (E)-4,8-dimethyl-1,3,7-nonatriene (DMNT), (E,E)-4,8,12-trimethyl-1,3,7,11-tridecatetraene (TMTT), (E)-beta-caryophyllene, and (E)-beta-farnesene. Whereas the oviposition injury induced only two volatiles: nonanal and decanal. This study highlights how maize respond with different blend profile of HIPVs and OIPVs, demonstrating that maize adapts its volatile emissions depending on the intensity of stress it has been submitted. These findings can be further explored in multitrophic interactions, potentially influencing natural enemies that utilize these volatiles as cues in the environment.

AB  - This research aimed to evaluate the inclusion of mealworm frass (MF, from Tenebrio molitor L.) in the rations of dairy goats. The hypothesis was that adding MF may improve the utilization of protein. Twenty-four Damascus goats (body weight similar to 48.2 +/- 0.9 kg) of the third and fourth parity were divided into three groups (n = 8). Goats in the control group (MF0) were fed Egyptian clover ad libitum plus a concentrate feed mixture to cover 55 % of their nutritional requirements (basal diet). Goats in the second (MF1) and third (MF3) groups received the basal diet supplemented with 1 % and 3 % MF, respectively. The experimental period lasted 120 days, (30 days prepartum and 90 days postpartum). Digestibility, performance, blood metabolites, and milk yield and quality were assessed. The inclusion of MF in rations increased (P < 0.05) digestibility coefficients for DM and CP (dry matter and crude protein). Concentration of ruminal ammonia and volatile fatty acids were higher (P < 0.05) for goats fed on a diet containing 3 % MF. Likewise, the estimated blood metabolites (total proteins, albumin, globulin, urea, creatinine, ALT, and AST) were significantly increased (P < 0.05) for the MF3 goats. Actual milk, fat-corrected milk (4 %), and energy-corrected milk yields were higher (P < 0.05) for MF1 and MF3 goats. The best feed conversion was observed with the MF3 group compared to the control (0.98 vs. 1.17 kg DMI/kg milk). The economic efficiency of milk improved (P < 0.05) for MF1 and MF3 goats by 22, and 50 %, respectively. In conclusion, incorporating mealworm frass up to 3 % in the concentrate feed mixture enhanced goat growth and feed utilization rate as well as milk production.

AB  - The genus Plasmodium, best known for causing malaria in humans, also infects a diverse array of vertebrates, including ungulates. Despite the first report of Plasmodium in ungulates dating back to 1913, research on these parasites has remained scarce, largely overshadowed by studies on primate, avian, and rodent Plasmodium. A century later, in 2016, three independent publications renewed interest by reporting the first genetic sequences of ungulate Plasmodium from different host species and continents. Since then, several studies have explored their genetic diversity across various host species and geographic regions. Among these, two studies investigated Plasmodium in African forest and savanna ungulates, identifying several new host species, particularly within the genera Tragelaphus, Syncerus, and Cephalophus. However, these findings remained largely unnoticed by the Plasmodium research community, as the primary focus of the publications was on xenosurveillance (the use of hematophagous flies and their blood meals to detect pathogens) rather than malaria parasites per se. Here, we reanalyze these overlooked data to clarify the evolutionary relationships of ungulate Plasmodium. Phylogenetic analyses confirm that these parasites form a monophyletic group, distinct from Plasmodium infecting primates, rodents, and bats. Within this group, two main clades were identified, encompassing parasites from various ungulate hosts. While Cephalophus parasites cluster with previously described sequences, those from Tragelaphus and Syncerus form distinct lineages, likely representing novel species. Expanding knowledge of ungulate Plasmodium, particularly in under-explored regions and host species, is crucial for understanding the evolution and diversity of these parasites.

AB  - Opy2 is an important membrane-anchored protein upstream of the HOG-MAPK signaling pathway and plays important roles in both the HOG-MAPK and Fus3/Kss1 MAPK. In this study, the roles of MaOpy2 in Metarhizium acridum were systematically elucidated. The results showed that the MaOpy2 disruption significantly reduced fungal tolerances to UV, heat shock and cell-wall-disrupting agents. Bioassays showed that the decreased fungal pathogenicity by topical inoculation mainly resulted from the impaired penetration ability. However, the growth ability of increment MaOpy2 was enhanced in insect hemolymph. Importantly, MaOpy2 deletion could significantly increase the conidial yield of M. acridum by shifting the conidiation pattern from normal conidiation to microcycle conidiation on the 1/4SDAY medium. Sixty-two differentially expressed genes (DEGs) during the conidiation pattern shift, including 37 up-regulated genes and 25 down-regulated genes in increment MaOpy2, were identified by RNA-seq. Further analysis revealed that some DEGs were related to conidiation and hyphal development. This study will provide not only the theoretical basis for elucidating the regulation mechanism for improving the conidial yield and quality in M. acridum but also theoretical guidance for the molecular improvement of entomopathogenic fungi.

AB  - Addressing cadmium (Cd) contamination in agricultural lands is crucial, given its health implications and accumulation in crops. This study used pot experiments to evaluate the impact of foliar selenium spray (Se) (0.40 mM), corn straw biochar (1%), and pig manure (1%) on the growth of rice plants, the accumulation of Cd in rice grain, and to examine their influence on health risk indices associated with Cd exposure. The treatments were designated as follows: a control group without any amendment (CK), biochar (T1), pig manure (T2), Se (T3), Se and biochar (T4), Se and pig manure (T5), and Se along with biochar and pig manure (T6). Our results indicated that the treatments affected soil pH and redox potential and improved growth and the nitrogen and phosphorus content in rice plants. The soil-plant analysis development (SPAD) meter readings of leaves during the tillering stage indicated a 5.27%-15.86% increase in treatments T2 to T6 compared to CK. The flag leaves of T2 exhibited increases of 12.06%-38.94% for electrolyte leakage and an 82.61%-91.60% decline in SOD compared to treatments T3 to T6. Treatments T1 to T6 increased protein content; however, amylose content was significantly reduced in T6. Treatment T6 recorded the lowest Cd concentration in rice grains (0.018 mg/kg), while T2 recorded the highest (0.051 mg/kg). The CK treatment group showed a grain Cd content reduction of 29.30% compared to T2. The assessment of acceptable daily intake, hazard quotient, and carcinogenic risk revealed an ascending order as follows: T6 < T3 < T5 < T4 < T1 < CK < T2. In conclusion, the application of treatment T6 demonstrates the potential to lower oxidative stress, enhance production, reduce cancer risk, and ensure the safe cultivation of rice in environments affected by Cd contamination.

AB  - After fertilization, elasmobranch eggs (mostly megalecithal) are encapsulated in a tertiary membrane of different complexity, in the oviducal gland. The gross morphological characteristics of this membrane in elasmobranchs are highly variable, attaining it most sophisticates' forms within the oviparous species. The purpose of this study was to contribute to the knowledge of the elasmobranch tertiary membranes, in both viviparous and oviparous species, and to discuss the relation with their role in protecting the embryos their development. In addition, the limitations of yolk-sac viviparity as a single reproductive mode category are commented, suggesting a new arrangement of taxa within that reproductive mode and new terminology. Data on tertiary membranes in elasmobranchs come from a large number of sources ranging from 1977 to date. Specimens were captured on board of commercial and scientific research cruises, from the following some major geographic regions: South Western Atlantic, South Western Pacific, and different areas of the Mediterranean Sea. In all, our records of tertiary membranes belong to ten species of sharks of five orders; Hexanchiformes, Squatiniformes, Heterodontiformes, Lamniformes, Carcharhiniformes, and eight species of rays and skates, of four orders: Rajiformes, Rhinopristiformes, Torpediniformes and Myliobatiformes. The reproductive modes reported for all this species were both lecithotrophic (yolk-sac viviparity, short single oviparity) and matrotrophic (ovotrophy, placentotrophy, limited and lipidic histotrophy). Six morphological and structural major patterns were detected within the yolk-sac viviparous species (type I to VI); a thin, diaphanous, shapeless membrane; candle capsules; oviparous-like tough egg capsule, and cases where no tertiary membrane was present.

AB  - Despite their ubiquity in many freshwater habitats, little is known about the spatial and movement ecology of Cooter turtles (Pseudemys). We captured and tracked 24 Florida Red-bellied Cooters (P. nelsoni) and 24 Peninsula Cooters (P. peninsularis), 12 of each sex, in the protected spring-fed Wekiva River, Wekiwa Springs, and Rock Springs system. Most cooters stayed in the same spring or river section (n = 30). We hypothesized and found similar to 25% of Peninsula Cooters preferred slower moving water in the Wekiva River, while > 90% Florida Red-bellied Cooters preferred faster moving spring boils or runs. We hypothesized females would have larger ranges than males but using 1,061 movements summarized with ten movement metrics, we observed few differences between species or sexes. Instead, the high variability between individuals clustered into two movement modes-20 turtles that were relocated in the same vicinity (typically < 500 m) and 27 turtles that moved throughout the spring system. We attribute the lack of differences between sexes and species to the optimality of spring systems for herbivorous turtles with constant water temperature, dense macrophytes, and abundant basking spots. Our study highlights the need for continued protection of spring systems to conserve these refuges of Pseudemys abundance in increasingly altered hydroscapes.

In this study, we assessed changes in the gut microbiota of resistant segregated phenotypic pigs under Porcine Reproductive and Respiratory Syndrome Virus exposure. The results showed that the resistance of pigs was related to the composition of gut microbiota. The quantity and relative abundance of probiotics in resistant individuals positively affected host immunity and growth performance, whereas high levels of pathogenic bacteria in susceptible individuals were associated with poorer clinical outcomes. The results of this study suggest that gut microbiota may serve as an effective probiotic resource to provide new methods for PRRS prevention and treatment. Porcine Reproductive and Respiratory Syndrome (PRRS) is one of the serious infectious diseases that threatens the swine industry. Increasing evidence shows that gut microbiota plays an important role in regulating host immune responses to PRRS virus (PRRSV). The aim of this study was to investigate gut microbiota difference between PRRSV-resistant pigs and PRRSV-suspectable pigs derived from a Tongcheng pigs and Large White pigs crossed population. PRRSV infection induces an increase in the abundance and diversity of gut microbiota. Correlation analysis showed that 36 genera were correlated with viral loads or weight gain after PRRSV infection. Prevotellaceae-NK3B31-group, Christensenellaceae-R7-group, and Parabacteroides were highly correlated with both viral load and weight gain. Notably, the diversity and abundance of beneficial bacteria such as Prevotellaceae-NK3B31-group was high in resistant pigs, and the diversity and abundance of pathogenic bacteria such as Campylobacter and Desulfovibrio were high in susceptible pigs. Gut microbiota were significantly associated with immune function and growth performance, suggesting that these genera might be related to viremia, clinical symptoms, and disease resistance. Altogether, this study revealed the correlation of gut microbiota with PRRSV infection and gut microbiota interventions may provide an effective prevention against PRRSV infection.

AB  - Simple Summary The use of boars for breeding purposes is common on small farms in rural regions of Italy. These animals are butchered at the end of their reproductive life for the production of charcuterie. In this regard, orchiectomy is required to remove boar taint caused by testosterone metabolites. The purpose of this study is to validate the efficacy of a safe, rapid and inexpensive castration procedure. To accomplish this objective, 91 boars were orchiectomised using the suture ligation technique. Following castration, characteristics of the severed ductus deference were evaluated in order to understand how much force would be required to tie knots without breaking the deferens and achieving proper haemostasis. After identifying a correlation between tensile strength and the age and weight of boars, a sutureless technique was successfully applied to 20 animals. The heterogeneity of Italian manufacturing processes results in the production of a large variety of pork products. In Sardinia, boars are raised and butchered to produce charcuterie. These animals are castrated before slaughter as androstenone would otherwise taint the meat, rendering it unfit for human consumption. However, to date, the literature concerning surgical orchiectomy in adult boars is limited. The goal of this study is to assess whether a sutureless swine orchiectomy procedure is feasible. Additionally, this study aims to determine the appropriate traction force needed to tie knots in the deferens duct of pigs of different weights and ages. Two groups were created: the first (n = 91) underwent orchiectomy by suture ligation; the second (n = 20) was castrated using the sutureless technique. Deferens ducts of animals in the first group (n = 182) were collected following castration, and their tensile strength was measured. Pearson's linear correlation was used to determine the relationship between the maximum traction force and weight and age groups. A correlation of 0.99 and 0.96 was shown between traction force and age and traction force and weight, respectively. In accordance with these results, sutureless castration was performed on 20 animals, calibrating the pulling force needed according to the age and weight of the boars. No complications were observed during the feasibility study, thus validating sutureless orchiectomy in adult boars.

AB  - This study examines the impact of bio-organic fertilizers on the physiological characteristics and leaf nutrient content of "Qi-Nan" agarwood seedlings. The aim is to provide a theoretical foundation for the efficient cultivation of "Qi-Nan". The experiment was conducted under field conditions using a Randomized complete block design. The control group received no fertilization, while the three fertilizer-treated groups received vermicompost, sheep manure, or microbial organic fertilizer. The results indicate that the application of bio-organic fertilizer significantly promoted the growth of plant height and diameter, increased the contents of soluble proteins, soluble sugar, chlorophyll, and leaf nutrients; and decreased the contents of free proline, peroxidase, malondialdehyde, and other stress indices. Redundancy analysis showed that the main factors affecting the seedlings height and diameter were free proline, chlorophyll, total nitrogen, and total potassium. Principal component analysis and membership function analysis revealed significant variations in growth, physiological characteristics, and nutrient content among the three fertilizer groups and the control group, with vermicompost > microbial organic fertilizer > sheep manure > no fertilization. In conclusion, biological organic fertilizer significantly promotes the growth of "Qi-Nan" seedlings, and vermicompost is the most effective fertilizer in this experiment.

AB  - While senescence is a common occurrence in wild populations, not all traits decline with age simultaneously and some do not show any senescence. A lack of senescence in secondary sexual traits is thought to be due to their importance for reproductive success. However, if reproductive success senesces, why would secondary sexual traits apparently not senesce? Here, we explored this question in a wild population of red deer (Cervus elaphus) using antler form (number of points), a secondary sexual trait which shows little senescence, despite the occurrence of reproductive senescence. In line with expectations for traits that senesce, genetic variance in antler form increased with age and selection weakened with age. Therefore, there was no indication that a stronger selection on individuals that survived to older ages was countering the dilution of selection due to fewer individuals being alive. Furthermore, the effect of selective disappearance masking a slight decline in antler form in the oldest years was small. Interestingly, although genetic variance and positive selection of antler form were found, there was no evidence of a response to selection, supporting a genetic decoupling of antler senescence and reproductive senescence. Finally, a positive genetic covariance in antler form among age classes provides a possible explanation for the lack of senescence. These findings suggest that the antler form is under a genetic constraint that prevents it from senescing, providing an interesting evolutionary explanation for negligible senescence in a secondary sexual trait, and consequently, the existence of asynchrony in senescence among traits within populations.

AB  - center dot Increased temperature can induce plastic changes in many plant traits. However, little is known about how these changes affect plant interactions with insect pollinators and herbivores, and what the consequences for plant fitness and selection are. center dot We grew fast-cycling Brassica rapa plants at two temperatures (ambient and increased temperature) and phenotyped them (floral traits, scent, colour and glucosinolates). We then exposed plants to both pollinators (Bombus terrestris) and pollinating herbivores (Pieris rapae). We measured flower visitation, oviposition of P. rapae, herbivore development and seed output. center dot Plants in the hot environment produced more but smaller flowers, with lower UV reflectance and emitted a different volatile blend with overall lower volatile emission. Moreover, these plants received fewer first-choice visits by bumblebees and butterflies, and fewer flower visits by butterflies. Seed production was lower in hot environment plants, both because of a reduction in flower fertility due to temperature and because of the reduced visitation of pollinators. The selection on plant traits changed in strength and direction between temperatures. center dot Our study highlights an important mechanism by which global warming can change plant-pollinator interactions and negatively impact plant fitness, as well as potentially alter plant evolution through changes in phenotypic selection.

AB  - (1) Background and Aims: Manure is an important source of nutrients for plants, and organic substrate, as an effective soil amendment substrate, is a common material for maintaining soil health in the context of agricultural intensification. The use of organic fertilizers to meet the nutrient requirements of crops and to improve soil structure is a natural choice for sustainable agriculture. The high cost of chemical fertilizers and their overuse can lead to agricultural pollution, so farmers' awareness of organic farming is increasing, which is helping to drive agriculture in a more environmentally friendly and sustainable direction. (2) Methods: In a fertilization experiment conducted on 38-year-old 'Changfu No.2' apple trees, four different fertilization treatments were designed to assess their effects on soil fertility, fruit quality, and apple yield. These treatments included no fertilizer as a control (CK); chemical fertilizer combined with organic substrate (NPK + O); chemical fertilizer combined with sheep manure (NPK + SM); and a combination of chemical fertilizer, organic substrate, and sheep manure (NPK + O + SM). Principal component analysis (PCA) was used to comprehensively evaluate soil fertility, apple yield, and quality under these treatments. (3) Results: The NPK + O + SM treatment significantly improved soil fertility and apple yield compared to the other treatments. It provided comprehensive nutrition, meeting the diverse needs of plant growth. The slow-release properties of the organic substrate combined with the immediate nutrient supply from the sheep manure ensured stable nutrition throughout the growing season. This mixed fertilizer also improved soil biological activity. (4) Conclusion: The fertilization strategy combining organic substrate and sheep manure (NPK + O + SM) is highly effective in improving soil fertility, fruit quality, and apple yield, thus supporting sustainable agricultural practices.

AB  - Simple Summary Modern zoos aim to provide the best facilities possible for their animals, staff and visitors. Here, we present findings from a study focusing on the behaviour and visibility of four species pre- and post-translocation to a new environment, Islands, within Chester Zoo, UK: the Sumatran orangutan (Pongo abelii), crested macaque (Macaca nigra), Malayan tapir (Tapirus indicus) and the Malayan sun bear (Helarctos malayanus). We used full activity budgets to demonstrate that the move to new, custom-built facilities influenced the behaviour of all four species. Following relocation, both non-human primate species were found to spend more time interacting socially with group members and abnormal behaviours remained low for all four species. Malayan tapirs and crested macaques chose to spend more time in areas out of public view post-move, whilst Malayan sun bears were more visible to visitors in their new environment. We demonstrate the value of giving animals choice and control over how they interact with their surroundings, the importance in investment in behavioural monitoring throughout translocation events and add to the knowledge-base of this understudied area. Modern zoos strive to construct habitats which both enable and encourage animals to engage in species-specific behaviour, without compromising their visibility to visitors. Here, we present the findings of a within-zoo move to a custom-built exhibit (Islands at Chester Zoo, UK) with respect to the behaviour of four mammal species; the Sumatran orangutan (Pongo abelii), crested macaque (Macaca nigra), Malayan tapir (Tapirus indicus) and the Malayan sun bear (Helarctos malayanus). We used full activity budgets along with Compositional Data Analysis (CoDA) to gain insight into how the move to a more naturalistic exhibit influenced behaviour. Engagement in abnormal behaviour remained low during the study period for all four species, suggesting no adverse responses to the change in environment. Following the move, both the non-human primate species spent more time engaged in positive social interactions with conspecifics, highlighting the importance of social support during enclosure moves. Time spent visible to the public was largely unaffected by the enclosure move for the Sumatran orangutan, whilst the movement to a new environment increased visibility for the Malayan sun bear and decreased visibility for the crested macaque and Malayan tapir. We demonstrate the value of monitoring behaviour throughout the translocation of zoo-housed species and outline the positive behavioral impacts of providing individuals with naturalistic, species-appropriate environments.

AB  - Bacterial gut symbionts of insect herbivores can impact their host through different mechanisms. However, in most lepidopteran systems we lack experimental examples to explain how specific members of the gut bacterial community influence their host. We used fall armyworm (Spodoptera frugiperda) as a model system to address this objective. We implemented axenic and gnotobiotic techniques using two semi-artificial diets with pinto bean and wheat germ-based components. Following an initial screen of bacterial isolates representing different genera, larvae inoculated with Enterococcus FAW 2-1 exhibited increased body mass on the pinto bean diet, but not on the wheat germ diet. We conducted a systematic bioassay screening of Enterococcus isolated from fall armyworm, revealing they had divergent effects on the hosts' usage pinto bean diet, even among phylogenetically similar isolates. Dilution of the pinto bean diet revealed that larvae performed better on less-concentrated diets, suggesting the presence of a potential toxin. Collectively, these results demonstrate that some gut microorganisms of lepidopterans can benefit the host, but the dietary context is key towards understanding the direction of the response and magnitude of the effect. We provide evidence that gut microorganisms may play a wider role in mediating feeding breadth in lepidopteran pests, but overall impacts could be related to the environmental stress and the metabolic potentials of the microorganisms inhabiting the gut.

AB  - Tea-oil tree (Camellia oleifera Abel) is an important woody oil crop with high economic value. However, it has low photosynthetic production considering the low light intensity of its growth environment. To understand the acclimation mechanism of tea-oil trees to low light conditions, three light intensity treatments were conducted: high light (450-500 mu mol. m(-2). s(-1)), medium light (180-200 mu mol. m(-2). s(-1)), and low light (45-50 mu mol. m(-2). s(-1)). The carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) metabolism network were constructed by investigating the leaf anatomy, photosynthetic characteristics, N partitioning, transcriptome and metabolome. Results demonstrated that a larger proportion light energy was used for photochemical reactions in an environment with lower light intensity, which resulted in an increase in photosystem II photochemical efficiency and instantaneous light use efficiency (LUE) at the leaf level. As the light intensity increased, decreased electron transfer and carboxylation efficiencies, photorespiration and dark respiration rates, LUE at plant level, and N use efficiency (PNUE) were observed. Leaves trended to harvest more light using higher expression levels of light-harvesting protein genes, higher chlorophyll content, more granum and more tightly stacked granum lamella under lower light intensity. At transcriptional and metabolic levels, the TCA cycle, and the synthesis of starch and saccharides were weakened as light intensity decreased, while the Calvin cycle did not show the regularity between different treatments. Less N was distributed in Rubisco, respiration, and cell wall proteins as light decreased. Storage N was prominently accumulated in forms of amino acids (especially L-arginine) and amino acid derivatives as under medium and low light environments, to make up for C deficiency. Therefore, tea-oil trees actively improve lightharvesting capacity and enlarges the storage N pool to adapt to a low light environment, at the cost of a decrease of photosynthetic C assimilation and PNUE.

AB  - The acclimation capacity of Betula pendula and Betula pubescens was studied over 4 years in common gardens in central Italy (43 degrees N) and southern (61 degrees N) and northern Finland (67 degrees N), representing drastically different photoperiod and climate in temperate, boreal and subarctic vegetation zones. Two study sites that differed in soil fertility were established at each location, giving a total of six common gardens. The birch material was micropropagated from naturally regenerated stands of B. pendula and B. pubescens from Susa Valley and Rochemolle Valley in northern Italy, Punkaharju in southern Finland and Kittil & auml; in northern Finland. The plants were measured for height growth, stem diameter, leaf chlorophyll content, leaf herbivory and pathogen damage. The effects of soil fertility on the common garden results were also analyzed. The results showed high acclimation capacity of B. pendula and B. pubescens after a long-range transfer from southern to northern Europe, despite the major shift in climate and photoperiod. First-year growth on average was best in boreal southern Finland for all origins. Betula pendula grew more than B. pubescens in Italy and southern Finland, while B. pubescens grew more in northern Finland and better tolerated the northward transfer. The height growth of origins showed a clear latitude gradient from slowly growing northern to fast growing southern origins in the nursery and laboratory, but not in the field. Soil fertility explained a significant part of variation among locations not only for growth variables, but also for leaf chlorophyll content and leaf herbivory and pathogen damage. Leaf herbivore and pathogen damage was greatest in southern Finland. Our results demonstrate good survival of birch from northern Italy in Finnish conditions and support the possibility of long-range south-to-north transfer of Betula species to provide resistant planting material in boreal forests for the rapidly changing climate.

AB  - The warming impact of methane (CH4) emissions calculated using the metrics proposed by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), which measure its global warming potential in 100 years (GWP(100)) expressed as carbon dioxide equivalents (CO2 e), accounts for the greatest impact in animal production chains. This work uses the new metrics, proposed to consider the difference between short living climate pollutants (SLCP), such as CH4, and long living climate pollutants (LLCP), such as carbon dioxide (CO2), which measure the warming equivalent (we) effect relative to that of CO2 in a given time frame (GWP*) and expressed as CO2 we. The GWP* was applied to CH4 emissions from all Italian livestock supply chains and compared with GWP(100) for annual and cumulative assessment from 2010 to 2020 of the impact of this gas on climate change. Using official data published by Istituto Superiore per la Protezione e la Ricerca Ambientale (ISPRA) from 1990 to 2020, almost all species, except for buffalo (+272.6% of emissions calculated with the new metrics), revealed lower CH4 emissions with the greatest re-dimensioning for non-dairy cattle (-53786 kt of CO2 we of calculated with GWP* compared to +66437 kt of CO2 e estimated with the GWP(100) method). The total cumulative contribution of Italian livestock production to global warming over the past 10 years, including the nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions, has been greatly negative (-48759 kt of CO2 we) compared to the data calculated using the GWP(100) method (+206091 kt of CO2 e). In conclusion, the application of GWP* metric to CH4 emissions of all Italian livestock supply chains allowed to better identify the role of Italian livestock on climate change. Over the 2010-2020 time frame, the Italian animal supply chains reduced the warming impact related to its CH4 emission, with the ruminants (expect buffaloes) being the major contributor to this positive effect.

AB  - Intraepithelial T lymphocytes (T-IELs) are T cells located within the epithelium that provide a critical line of immune defense in the intestinal tract. In pigs, T-IEL abundances and phenotypes are used to infer putative T-IEL functions and vary by intestinal location and age, though investigations regarding porcine T-IELs are relatively limited. In this study, we expand on analyses of porcine intestinal T-IELs to include additional phenotypic designations not previously recognized in pigs. We describe non-conventional CD8 alpha(+)CD8 beta(-) alpha beta T-IELs that were most prevalent in the distal intestinal tract and primarily CD16+CD27-, a phenotype suggestive of innate-like activation and an activated cell state. Additional T-IEL populations included CD8 alpha(+)CD8 beta(+) alpha beta, CD2(+)CD8 alpha(+) gamma delta, and CD2(+)CD8 alpha- gamma delta T-IELs, with increasing proportions of CD16+CD27- phenotype in the distal intestine. Thus, putative non-conventional, activated T-IELs were most abundant in the distal intestine within multiple gamma delta and alpha beta T-IEL populations. A comparison of T-IEL and respective mucosal microbial community structures across jejunum, ileum, and cecum of 5-and 7 -week-old pigs revealed largest community differences were tissue-dependent for both T-IELs and the microbiota. Between 5 and 7 weeks of age, the largest shifts in microbial community compositions occurred in the large intestine, while the largest shifts in T-IEL communities were in the small intestine. Therefore, results indicate different rates of community maturation and stabilization for porcine T-IELs and the mucosal microbiota for proximal versus distal intestinal locations between 5 and 7 weeks of age. Collectively, data emphasize the intestinal tract as a site of location-and age-specific T-IEL and microbial communities that have important implications for understanding intestinal health in pigs.

AB  - Despite providing important ecosystem services, termites are also serious pests of wooden structures. Termites are highly adaptive organisms that cause concern as an invasive species. Predictions of the future spread of their distribution range due to factors such as climate change, urban growth, and global trade present new challenges to our capacity to protect our wood and wood-based materials and structures effectively. Reticulitermes grassei Clement, 1978 (Blattodea: Rhinotermitidae) is a subterranean termite native to the Iberian Peninsula and France, whose global distribution has widened over recent years. This article updates the distribution range of this species, confirming its identification in the Azores, Madeira, and Morocco through molecular analysis. The origin and consequences of these putative invasive populations are discussed in light of previously available data. The resulting network showed a highly structured base consisting of many haplotypes from the southern and southwestern Iberian Peninsula (Spain and Portugal), including those from Morocco (in natural landscapes) and Switzerland (in infrastructures). The more derived part of the network includes the haplotypes from southwest France, the northwest Iberian Peninsula, the United Kingdom, Azores, and Madeira, the last 3 being linked probably to human-mediated transportation events. The potential impacts of invasive subterranean termite populations expanding into new regions are concerning, especially in urban environments, and remain uncertain in natural areas. The challenges posed by these termites could be especially worrying in island ecosystems. Hence, it is crucial to implement early warning systems and monitoring programs in regions susceptible to subterranean termite invasions.

AB  - Plant elemental content can vary up to 1,000-fold across grasslands, with implications for the herbivores the plants feed. We contrast the regulation, in grasses and forbs, of 12 elements essential to plants and animals (henceforth plant-essential), 7 essential to animals but not plants (animal-essential) and 6 with no known metabolic function (nonessential). Four hypotheses accounted for up to two thirds of the variation in grass and forb ionomes across 54 North American grasslands. Consistent with the supply-side hypothesis, the plant-essential ionome of both forbs and grasses tracked soil availability. Grass ionomes were more likely to harvest even nonessential elements like Cd and Sr. Consistent with the grazing hypothesis, cattle-grazed grasslands also accumulated a handful of metals like Cu and Cr. Consistent with the NP-catalysis hypothesis, increases in the macronutrients N and P in grasses were associated with higher densities of cofactors like Zn and Cu. The plant-essential elements of forbs, in contrast, consistently varied as per the nutrient-dilution hypothesis-there was a decrease in elemental parts per million with increasing local carbohydrate production. Combined, these data fit a working hypothesis that grasses maintain lower elemental densities and survive on nutrient-poor patches by opportunistically harvesting soil nutrients. In contrast, nutrient-rich forbs use episodes of high precipitation and temperature to build new carbohydrate biomass, raising leaves higher to compete for light, but diluting the nutrient content in every bite of tissue. Herbivores of forbs may thus be particularly prone to increases in pCO(2) via nutrient dilution.

AB  - In Poland, Pissodes castaneus (De Geer), the small banded pine weevil, is increasingly common in young Scots pine Pinus sylvestris L. stands weakened by various biotic (root diseases, deer) and abiotic (drought, hail, etc.) factors. In Europe, an increasing threat to young P. sylvestris stands by this pest has been observed since the early 2000s, most likely due to ongoing climate change. It seems that weakening of young trees by droughts may have contributed to the increase in pest numbers. The intensification of damage caused by P. castaneus, as well as the lack of effective pro??? tection methods, justified conducting research on the insects co???occurring with P. castaneus on P. sylvestris, with special emphasis on its natural enemies. The 3???5???year???old P. sylvestris trees colo??? nized by P. castaneus were collected in 2015???2017 at three locations in Central Poland. All these trees were weakened mainly by drought. Their roots and stems were divided into sections according to their diameters and kept in the laboratory until the emergence of associated insects was com??? plete. A total of 13 species of Coleoptera and 2 species of Hymenoptera were collected from the trees colonized by P. castaneus. Among the co???occurring insects (not trophically related to the pest), the Curculionidae family was most numerous, in which Pityogenes bidentatus (Herbst) dominated, with a proportion of almost 90% of the collected insects, followed by Pogonocherus fasciculatus (De Geer) (5% share) and Magdalis phlegmatica (Herbst) (2%). Only two co???occurring species were found in the fragments of the stems with a diameter 3 cm: Rhagium inquisitor (L.) and P. bidentatus. In stems <1 cm only Ernobius nigrinus (Sturm) and M. phlegmatica were observed. Most species (5) were observed in stems 1???3 cm in diameter: Phaenops formaneki Jacobs, Anthaxia quadripunctata (L.), Chrysobothris igniventris Reitt, P. fasciculatus, and P. bidentatus. P. castaneus occurred over the entire height of the stems. The share of natural enemies of P. castaneus was negligible ??? less than 3%. In this group of insects, the parasitoid Coeloides melanostigma Strand was the most numer??? ous (1.4%), followed by the predators Crypturgus pusillus (Gyll.) and Corticeus linearis (Fabr.), both with 0.5% share. The results indicate that predatory insects and parasitoids have little influence on the number of P. castaneus. Several beetles and larvae of Hylobius abietis (L.) were reared from the roots of trees colonized by P. castaneus. This publication is the first report on the occurrence of this species on weakened but still living P. sylvestris young trees.

AB  - Introduction: Agriculture predominantly follows three farming systems: natural, organic (organic manures for soil nutrition), and agrochemical intensive. Agrochemical-intensive farming uses synthetic fertilizers, insecticides, pesticides, and weedicides. It holds the most prominent place in the modern agriculture business. Humankind realizes that over-reliance on synthetic agrochemicals has resulted in the declining health of the ecosystem's soil, water, and living species. It must explore strategies to reduce synthetic agrochemicals without compromising agricultural production to restore the ecological balance. Nano-formulations help lower dosages of agrochemicals, leading to the emergence of nano-agriculture. However, the critical challenge is how we could exploit nanomaterials' power to selectively improve crop plants' metabolic performance so that it has a better competitive edge in the field to withstand the nutrient-seeking pressure exerted by other plants. Methods: Here we have achieved the same by root treatment of the onion crop and then growing them in the presence of organic goat manure. Results: In a 2 years field trial with onion crops, we report an increase in yield through root treatment with nano-pyrite (FeS2) plus soil application of goat dropping (Test) as compared to the use of goat dropping alone (Control). In the first-year field trial (November 2018- April 2019), the total biomass (bulb + leaf) weight of the test sample was 4.75 kg (n = 86), while control samples weighed 3.5 kg (n = 83). The total bulb weight for the control and test was 2.6 and 3.6 kg, respectively. In the second-year field trial (December 2019- April 2020), the total biomass of the test sample was 2.65 kg (n = 64), while control samples weighed 2.30 kg (n = 64). We observed a yield-boosting effect of root treatment with nano-pyrite plus soil application of goat dropping in onion crops. As monitored by spectroscopic absorbance, there is a significant increase in the anthocyanin content in test bulbs (0.069) compared to control bulbs (0.02). Similarly, the relative flavanol content in test leaves (0.253) was significantly higher compared to the control samples (0.086). We have integrated nano-agriculture and organic farming, resulting in a hybrid form; nano-organic farming bolsters the metabolic fitness of the onion (Allium cepa) to achieve sustainable food production.

AB  - During in-vitro maturation, the oocyte experiences stressful conditions that likely compromise its development. Epinephrine is a catecholamine that plays a vital role during cellular stress by scavenging free radicals. The hypothesis is that epinephrine addition in maturation media improves the developmental competence of oocytes in cattle and buffalo. The objectives of the experiments were to investigate the effect of epinephrine addition in maturation media on nuclear maturation, developmental competence, and oocyte mRNA abundance of genes related to antioxidants and growth pathways in cattle and buffalo. In experiment 1, cattle oocytes were matured for 24 h in maturation media supplemented with increasing concentrations of epinephrine 0, 0.01, 1.0, and 100 mu M. Oocytes were cultured to assess cleavage at 48 h and blastocyst on day 7 of the culture. The cumulus-oocyte complexes (COCs) expansion, nuclear maturation, and oocyte mRNA abundance of genes (SOD1, GPX4, GDF9, CASP9) were evaluated. In experiment 2, buffalo oocytes were matured and assessed for development and mRNA abundance as described for cattle. In addition, the blastomere number was counted in the hatched blastocyst. The data were analyzed using GLIMMIX and MIXED procedures of SAS. Results revealed that the supplementation of epinephrine increased (P <= 0.03) the COCs expansion, nuclear maturation, and developmental competence of oocytes in cattle. Interestingly, all the responses were maximized (quadratic effect; P <= 0.08) at 1 mu M concentrations. The mRNA abundance of genes in cattle oocytes was not affected by the treatment. The experiment in buffalo revealed that epinephrine increased blastocyst formation without affecting COCs expansion, and nuclear maturation. The higher blastocyst was achieved at 0.01 mu M concentrations of epinephrine. Interestingly, the addition of epinephrine increased the mRNA abundance of genes related to antioxidant pathways (SOD1, GPX4). Moreover, supplementation of epinephrine increased the blastomere count of the hatched blastocyst in buffalo. In conclusion, epinephrine addition in maturation media benefited oocyte development in cattle and blastocyst yield in buffalo at 1 and 0.01 mu M concentrations, respectively. It appears that the addition of epinephrine affected different cellular pathways, COCs expansion, and nuclear maturation in cattle and increased antioxidant genes for buffalo.

AB  - This study aimed to assess the effects of prepartum milking training of primiparous goats on behavior, plasma cortisol concentration, and milk yield and quality traits. Thirty-one primiparous Saanen goats were assigned into two treatments: CT = milking-trained (n = 16) and ST = not milking-trained (n = 15) goats. Milking training consisted of the handler entering the pen where the goats were and walking calmly among them for 20 minutes/ day for seven days, and then driving the goats to the milking parlor, positioning them in the stanchion, and gently touching their ribs, legs, and udders for five minutes for seven days. Behavioral assessments were carried out measuring the latency that each goat took to get close to a known person (voluntary approach = LC) and the flight distance (FD) before training (BT), just after training (AT), at the beginning (between days five and seven, d5-7) and 30 days of lactation (d30). Milking reactivity was assessed by recording the step-kick (SK) and head, ear and tail movement (MOV) scores. Plasma cortisol concentrations (PCC) were measured after milking. All measurements were recorded at 5-7 (d5-7), 30 (d30), and 60 (d60) days of lactation, defining the assessment days. The number of animals that required restraint during milking was also recorded. Milk yield was recorded daily throughout the 120 days of the lactation period, and milk quality traits (dry matter, density, fat, protein, lactose, minerals, acidity, SCC, Staphylococcus and total bacterial count- TBC) at d5-7, d30, d60, d90, and d120. The goats' reactivity decreased throughout lactation. CT goats showed a lower LC on d30 than before training. PCC showed higher values on d60 than prepartum. At the beginning of lactation, 73 % of ST goats were restrained for milking, while for CT goats, 45 %. Milk yield was highest in the period from 8 to 90 days of lactation and 0.5 kg/day higher (although not significant) in CT than in ST. Milk quality traits showed significant differences between assessment days, except for TBC and Staphylococcus counts. In conclusion, the training protocol did not significantly impact goats' reactivity during milking, PCC, and milk quality traits. However, there was a tendency to increase milk yield and reduce the number of animals restrained during milking.

AB  - The golden jackal (Canis aureus) has rapidly expanded its range in Europe, prompting questions about its ecological impact and management. The species' expansion strategy differs from other European countries. Despite its presence demonstrated for thirty years, it still has a limited presence in Austria; its successful reproduction has just recently been confirmed. Our study provides the first comprehensive insights into the dietary habits of jackals in Austria. The analysed jackal stomachs, with 48 food items, revealed a diverse diet. The primary foods were wild ungulates, mostly from scavenging, mostly cervids and partially wild boar, making up nearly half of their diet. Domestic animals and household food comprised secondary sources, while plant matter had tertiary importance. The consumption of small mammals, birds, and invertebrates had little importance. We detected the consumption of a smaller carnivore, a marten. Our findings align with observations from other central-southeastern European regions, indicating that jackals exhibit diverse and opportunistic foraging behavior. This adaptability will likely contribute to their continued expansion in Austria and Europe. Further research is needed to explore potential ecological implications. Addressing the golden jackal's expansion requires coordinated conservation and management to balance its coexistence with humans and local biodiversity preservation.

AB  - In order to prioritize the conservation and management efforts to protect jaguars (Panthera onca), it is of utmost importance to determine their tolerance in face of human disturbances, habitat modifications and varying degrees of prey availability. We assessed the occupancy probability of jaguars and five of their most common prey species throughout a heterogeneous landscape in the Selva Maya in southern Mexico: armadillo (Dasypus novemcinctus), coati (Nasua narica), paca (Cuniculus paca), white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus), and collared peccary (Dicotyles tajacu). Additionally, we projected prey and Jaguar occupancies onto a 5993 km(2) landscape based on the habitat type in the area. We averaged the best prey models ranked by QAICc and found that white-tailed deer had the highest average occupancy probability of 0.72 +/- 0.06 and paca the lowest with 0.14 +/- 0.04. The average occupancy probability for jaguars was 0.35 +/- 0.07 and the strongest predictor of jaguar occupancy was a positive effect of collared peccary occupancy. These findings support previous studies that show that predator distribution is largely influenced by their prey availability, even in the midst of degraded habitats, and underlies the essential need to incorporate protection plans for prey species in jaguar conservation strategies.

AB  - There is a growing interest in finding reliable methods for monitoring soil health using bioindicators. Free-living nematodes are an ideal indicator group because of their rapid response to changes in soil conditions. This UK study aims to assess their efficacy as bioindicators using two field experiments. In Experiment-1, the treatments included Farmyard Manure, Green Manure consisting of a mix of Raphanus sativus and Vicia sp., and Standard Practice serving as the control receiving N-fertiliser only. The same treatments, except Farmyard Manure, were compared in Experiment-2, which was on a sloping site with a different textured soil. Soil samples were collected twice during each crop season, in Spring and Autumn, for Experiment-1, and only in Autumn for Experiment-2. Ecological indices that categorise nematodes by feeding preference using morphological differences and life strategies (i.e. functional guilds) were calculated. Indices were compared with the abundance of nematode trophic groups to evaluate their use as soil indicators for understanding crop management practices and their legacy effects. Results showed that identification to trophic groups alone was not a sufficiently sensitive approach for assessing changes in the selected management practices. The variations among trophic groups and treatments within the same sampling period were significantly different for bacterivores, fungivores, predators, omnivores, and herbivores. These differences did not always cooccur within the same sampling period, with bacterivores and plant-parasites of economic importance showing greater responses. The food web analyses, calculated by applying the Enrichment Index and Structure Index, and Plant Parasite Index, provided a more sensitive indicator and allowed more effective diachronic monitoring. While using the composition of trophic groups appears to be an attractive solution, their application is best linked to quantifying short-term changes in soil condition and were not as well suited to longer-term soil health monitoring.

AB  - The time-honored paradigm in the theory of virulence evolution assumes a positive relation between infectivity and harmfulness. However, the etiology of respiratory diseases yields a negative relation, with diseases of the lower respiratory tract being less infective and more harmful. We explore the evolutionary consequences in a simple model incorporating cross-immunity between disease strains that diminishes with their distance in the respiratory tract, assuming that docking rate follows the match between the local mix of cell surface types and the pathogen's surface and cross-immunity the similarity of the pathogens' surfaces. The assumed relation between fitness components causes virulent strains infecting the lower airways to evolve to milder more transmissible variants. Limited cross-immunity, generally, causes a readiness to diversify that increases with host population density. In respiratory diseases that diversity will be highest in the upper respiratory tract. More tentatively, emerging respiratory diseases are likely to start low and virulent, to evolve up, and become milder. Our results extend to a panoply of realistic generalizations of the disease's ecology to including additional epitope axes. These extensions allow us to apply our results quantitatively to elucidate the differences in diversification between rhino- and coronavirus caused common colds.

AB  - Evolution can occur over contemporary timescales, which may be crucial for the invasive success of non-native plant species. Many studies have shown rapid evolution by comparing native and non-native populations in common gardens. However, our understanding of the mechanisms underpinning rapid evolution is still incomplete. Here, we identify the progress, applications, and limitations of studies on rapid evolution of non-native plants with respect to sampling, experimental design and experimental methods. To encompass broad variation within and between the ranges, we recommend sampling across large-scale environmental gradients. We also suggest careful consideration of pitfalls related to the choice of seed families and of the biotic interaction under focus. The latter should be chosen with a view on both the experimental treatment and the corresponding field data to estimate population history. Furthermore, we suggest exploiting multiple omics approaches to address the complexity of biotic interactions, and to account for non-adaptive evolution with molecular data on demographic history of populations. We also reviewed papers that studied rapid evolution in non-native plants and quantified how many of these met our criteria. We anticipate that disentangling adaptive and non-adaptive drivers of among-population variation can increase the accuracy of research on rapid evolution, and that integrating phenotypic, metabolomic and population genomic data can bring opportunities for studying complex biotic interactions. We also illustrate the importance of large collaborative networks and present our scientific network iCONNECT (integrative CONyza NEtwork for Contemporary Trait evolution), with the goal of motivating similar studies on the mechanistic understanding of rapid evolution.

AB  - Purpose Radiocarbon and tritium are the dominant radionuclides released by nuclear industries over the world. Close interactions of these elements with particulate organic matter (POM) in soils and rivers are widely reported in the literature but only few studies focus on their relationships with POM within nuclearized rivers. Here, we focus on the nuclearized Rhone River (France) and its tributaries in order to highlight the behavior of these two radionuclides owing to POM amounts and nature . Materials and methods Over the 2001-2021 period, suspended sediments (TSS) samples were acquired and analyzed thanks to the MOOSE network (Mediterranean Ocean Observing System for the Environment) and of the Rhone Sediment Observatory. Over this period, TSS, particulate organic carbon (POC), dissolved organic carbon (DOC), and chlorophyll and phaeopigment contents were determined at the SORA monitoring station located at the downstream part of the Rhone River. These parameters were measured from daily to weekly after continuous filtration of the waters collected from high-frequency water samplings. Larger amounts of TSS were also collected by using time integrating particle traps (PT) at the SORA station and on several Rhone tributaries. These latter samples were analyzed for global biogeochemistry (Rock Eval 6), organically bound tritium (OBT), and radiocarbon. Results and discussion At the downstream part of the Rhone River, POC represents from 1 to 10 wt.% of the TSS even though this amount rises to 20 wt.% very occasionally. POC/TSS shows a positive relationship with the chlorophyll/phaeopigment amounts reinforcing the non-negligible production of autochthonous POM in this river. The increase of C-14 contents and Delta C-14 signatures with the amount of aquatic POM underlines that a significant part of C-14 from industrial releases is transported as fresh and labile particulate organic compounds. In tributaries, Delta C-14 signatures decrease with the rising amounts of C-14 depleted refractory carbon (RC/TOC) coming from soil erosion in a similar way. OBT contents show no relationships with neither the contents nor the nature of naturally occurring POM. Conclusions Autochthonous POM would constitute a key route to transfer radiocarbon from nuclear releases towards the food chain. Normalizing radiocarbon contents with RC/POC constitutes a new powerful tool to better assess the environmental labelling of radiocarbon discharged by the nuclear industries as the dilution effect generated by dead carbon is discarded. In the Rhone River, OBT is mostly associated with synthesized organic particles inherited from watch industries.

AB  - Introduction. As a main consumer of energy, the brain is particularly susceptible to the effects of hypoxia. However, during long-term evolution, the brain of the plateau yak developed adaptive mechanisms enabling it to maintain normal physiological conditions. Material and methods. A total of 20 male yaks belonging to two age groups [newborns (1-6 days old; n = 10) and adults (3-5 years old; n = 10)] were obtained, and the brain tissue was fixed and processed by standard methods. RT-qPCR, ELISA and IHC assays were used to investigate the expression and localization of HIF1 alpha, BNIP3 and beclin-1 in the hippocampus, cerebral cortex, thalamus, medulla oblongata and cerebellum of newborn and adult yak brains and to explore their potential neuroprotective role. Results. We found that the expression levels of HIF1 alpha, BNIP3 and beclin-1 at the mRNA and protein levels varied in the different regions of yak brain, with the highest expression observed in the hippocampus, followed by the cerebral cortex, thalamus, medulla oblongata and the cerebellum. Moreover, the HIF1 alpha, BNIP3 and beclin-1 expression were significantly higher in the newborn yaks' brains than in the adult yak. The IHC results showed that HIF1 alpha, BNIP3 and beclin-1 were mainly distributed in the neurons of the cerebral cortex, hippocampus, thalamus, medulla oblongata and cerebellum. In particular, HIF1 alpha accumulated in the nucleus and cytoplasm. Furthermore, the immunoreactivity of BNIP3 and beclin-1 was concentrated in the cytoplasm. Conclusions. The results indicate that the yak hippocampus and cerebral cortex may be more resistant to hypoxia than thalamus, medulla oblongata and cerebellum, and the expression of BNIP3 and beclin-1 may be regulated by HIF1 alpha to serve a neuroprotective role in the yak's brain to adaptation to hypoxia. Additionally, the brain of adult yaks may have a higher tolerance to hypoxia than the brain of newborn yaks. (Folia Histochemica et Cytobiologica 2023, Vol. 61, No. 1, 26-33)

AB  - Sacoglossan sea slugs have developed a variety of defence mechanisms against predation. Research on these mechanisms has focused primarily on the chemical defences of these slugs, and little information is available on nonchemical modes of defence, such as autotomy, a behaviour in which an organism voluntarily detaches body structures at a predetermined breakage point in response to danger or stress. Autotomy is diverse in sacoglossan sea slugs and has been well documented. Within Oxynidae, members can autotomize their tail and parapodial lobes, and slugs in Limapontiidae and Hermaeidae can detach their cerata. More recently, reports have been made of Elysia with the capacity to autotomize most of their body. However, despite the widespread assumption that autotomy in this group serves a defensive purpose, the effectiveness of the behaviour in ensuring survival against predation has seldom been examined. The objective of this study was to evaluate the role of autotomy in sacoglossans by assessing the effectiveness of ceratal autotomy in ensuring survival against the attacks of a generalist predator. Placida kingstoni is a small sacoglossan native to Florida and the Caribbean with the ability to autotomize its cerata. Individual P. kingstoni were exposed to shrimps of the Lysmata wurdemanni species complex for 10-min interactions. Most sea slugs were attacked by the predator, often more than once, but the majority of the slugs readily autotomized cerata and survived. Structure detachment was accompanied by the secretion of a mucus that facilitated the formation of ceratal clumps. Most of these clumps were consumed by the predator and effectively diverted their attention, allowing P. kingstoni to crawl away. In this species, the success of autotomy as a defensive strategy appears to be directly related to the palatability of autotomized cerata. The results of this study show that ceratal autotomy in P. kingstoni is an effective defence against predation. Autotomy is a behaviour with a high-energetic cost; however, it has convergently evolved within Heterobranchia on multiple occasions, and it is highly prevalent in cerata-bearing slugs. Although in sacoglossans much of this behaviour remains a mystery, this study provides a clear example of autotomy as a defensive mechanism.

AB  - Numerous studies have been devoted to individual cases of horizontally acquired genes in fungi. It has been shown that such genes expand the hosts' metabolic capabilities and contribute to their adaptations as parasites or symbionts. Some studies have provided an extensive characterization of the horizontal gene transfer (HGT) in Dikarya. However, in the early diverging fungi (EDF), a similar characterization is still missing. In order to fill this gap, we have designed a computational pipeline to obtain a statistical sample of reliable HGT events with a low false discovery rate. We have analyzed 44 EDF proteomes and identified 829 xenologs in fungi ranging from Chytridiomycota to Mucoromycota. We have identified several patterns and statistical properties of EDF HGT. We show that HGT is driven by bursts of gene exchange and duplication, resulting in highly divergent numbers and molecular properties of xenologs between fungal lineages. Ancestrally aquatic fungi are generally more likely to acquire foreign genetic material than terrestrial ones. Endosymbiotic bacteria can be a source of useful xenologs, as exemplified by NOD-like receptors transferred to Mortierellomycota. Closely related fungi have similar rates of intronization of xenologs. Posttransfer gene fusions and losses of protein domains are common and may influence the encoded proteins' functions. We argue that there is no universal approach for HGT identification and inter- and intra-kingdom transfers require tailored identification methods. Our results help to better understand how and to what extent HGT has shaped the metabolic, adaptive, and immune capabilities of fungi.
   Horizontal gene transfer is a transmission of genes between unrelated organisms that seems to occur in all living organisms, including fungi. Although several studies focused on the description of the horizontal gene transfer patterns in terrestrial fungi, similar characterization is still missing for early diverging fungi. Through the development of computational pipeline enabling to obtain a statistical sample of reliable horizontal gene transfer events minimizing false positive hits, we demonstrate that it is driven by bursts of gene exchange and duplication, resulting in highly divergent numbers and molecular properties of xenologs between different fungal lineages. These detected gene transfers seem to expand the metabolic, adaptive, and immune capabilities of early diverging fungi.
   Horizontal gene transfer is a transmission of genes between organisms, distinct from vertical inheritance from parents to offspring. HGT seems to occur among all living forms. Our study focuses on horizontally transferred genes present in early diverging fungi (EDF). EDF is a relatively understudied group of organisms with vastly diverse lifestyles and tremendous ecological importance. They include arbuscular mycorrhizal Glomeromycota, the gut-dwelling symbionts of herbivores Neocallimastigomycota, or the parasitic Batrachochytrium. HGT has been reported to contribute to this diversity by facilitating niche adaptations in certain lineages. In our work, we have analyzed horizontally acquired genes in 44 fungal genomes, focusing on cases with clear phylogenetic evidence. We have designed a computational pipeline that detects a statistical sample of reliable HGTs. The pipeline is published alongside the article. We have analyzed the donors, acceptors, and properties of the transferred genes. We found transfers of genes that can expand the metabolic, adaptive, and immune capabilities of fungi.

AB  - Aviation mutagenesis is a breeding method for the rapid selection of superior plant varieties. In this study, rhizosphere soil chemical indexes, soil enzyme activities, and soil metabolites were measured in Dahongpao tea trees with aviation mutagenesis (TM) and without aviation mutagenesis (CK). The main soil metabolites distinguishing TM and CK and their relationships with soil chemical indexes and soil enzyme activities were analyzed and obtained. The results showed that there was no significant change in the rhizosphere soils' pH of TM tea trees compared to CK (p = 0.91), while all other chemical indexes of TM were significantly higher than CK (p < 0.05). In addition, the activities of enzymes related to soil nutrient cycling such as urease, protease, sucrase, acid phosphatase and cellulase, and enzymes related to soil antioxidants such as superoxide dismutase, catalase, peroxidase, and polyphenol oxidase were significantly increased (p < 0.05) in the rhizosphere soils of TM tea trees compared to CK. Soil metabolite analysis showed that the main soil metabolites distinguishing CK from TM were carbohydrates, nitrogen compounds, and amines. Of these, carbohydrates and nitrogen compounds were significantly positively correlated with soil chemical indexes and soil enzymes, whereas amine was significantly negatively correlated with soil chemical indexes such as organic matter, total nitrogen, total potassium, available nitrogen, available phosphorus; amine showed significant negative correlation with soil enzymes such as catalase, peroxidase, polyphenol oxidase, and urease. It can be seen that aviation mutagenesis is conducive to improving the ability of tea tree rhizosphere aggregation and transformation of soil nutrients, increasing the total amount of soil nutrients and the content of available nutrients, which is more conducive to promoting the uptake of nutrients by the tea tree, and thus promoting the growth of the tea tree.

AB  - Dromornithids are an extinct group of large flightless birds from the Cenozoic of Australia. Their record extends from the Eocene to the late Pleistocene. Four genera and eight species are currently recognised, with diversity highest in the Miocene. Dromornithids were once considered ratites, but since the discovery of cranial elements, phylogenetic analyses have placed them near the base of the anseriforms or, most recently, resolved them as stem galliforms. In this study, we use morphometric methods to comprehensively describe dromornithid endocranial morphology for the first time, comparing Ilbandornis woodburnei and three species of Dromornis to one another and to four species of extant basal galloanseres. We reveal that major endocranial reconfiguration was associated with cranial foreshortening in a temporal series along the Dromornis lineage. Five key differences are evident between the brain morphology of Ilbandornis and Dromornis, relating to the medial wulst, the ventral eminence of the caudoventral telencephalon, and morphology of the metencephalon (cerebellum + pons). Additionally, dromornithid brains display distinctive dorsal (rostral position of the wulst), and ventral morphology (form of the maxillomandibular [V-2+V-3], glossopharyngeal [IX], and vagus [X] cranial nerves), supporting hypotheses that dromornithids are more closely related to basal galliforms than anseriforms. Functional interpretations suggest that dromornithids were specialised herbivores that likely possessed well-developed stereoscopic depth perception, were diurnal and targeted a soft browse trophic niche.

AB  - Providing shade in situ in paddocks may lead to better animal welfare and/or improved sheep production outcomes. However, there are no replicated experiments detailing the effect of the provision of shade in situ under grazing during summer on behavioral, physiological, and production outcomes of sheep in the sci-entific literature. This study uses a replicated field experiment to examine the effect of provision of shade in situ to sheep under grazing on animal behavior, respiration rate, core body temperature (CBT), growth, and immunological function during summer in south east Australia. The experiment consisted of eight un-shaded pasture plots and eight shaded pasture plots with an 18 m2 shade structure. Each plot was stocked with 20 sheep. Sheep with access to shade chose to use the shade in the hottest part of the day, reducing their 12 pm respiration rate to 64 breaths per minute (bpm) compared with sheep without shade at 98 bpm (P < 0.0001). However, the provision of shade had no effect on CBT, immunological function, or animal production. In the hottest part of the day, sheep without shade exhibited shade seeking behavior by either being located along the fence line (P < 0.0001) or at the water trough (P < 0.001). In conclusion, provision of shade in situ to sheep under grazing during summer conditions improved the affective state, and thus welfare, of the sheep by reducing the respiration rate needed to maintain thermostability.Crown Copyright & COPY; 2023 Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Urine is an important biological specimen for assessing various metabolic functions and drug clearance. In urinary tract infection research, urine is particularly important as urinary bacterial titres constitute the main diagnostic outcome for assessing the course of infection. Collecting uncontaminated urine samples from pigs can be done by bladder catheterization or suprapubic bladder aspiration, which are both laborious and invasive procedures that require the need for anaesthesia. To improve animal welfare and optimize urine sampling protocols, we developed a method of clean-catching midstream urine specimens from pigs during spontaneous micturition. The quality of urine specimens collected by clean-catch, bladder catheter and suprapubic bladder aspiration were compared using microbiological culturing. We show that urine specimens collected by clean-catch are only minimally contaminated by skin- and vaginal-commensals with no influence on urinary bacterial titres during ongoing infection. In conclusion, we describe a method in which spontaneous micturition can be prompted in pigs, facilitating fast and reliable collection of quality specimens suitable for microbiological culturing. The method supersedes the need for anaesthesia, which not only represents a considerable refinement in terms of animal welfare but also facilitates more frequent collection of specimens that can enhance the scientific outcome of experimental animal studies in pigs.

AB  - The Yanjinggou fauna has long been recognized as the quintessential Middle Pleistocene fauna in South China. However, the recent discovery of the Dayakou fauna in the same region has unveiled a fossil assemblage indicative of the Early Pleistocene. Our new excavations at the Dayakou pit have yielded a substantial increase in fossil materials, which not only enriched the composition of the local fauna but also play a pivotal role in reconsidering the geochronology of the faunal complex in Yanjinggou area. The newly recovered fossil remains from the Dayakou pit comprise at least ten mammal taxa, including carnivorans ( Homotherium sp., Neofelis nebulosa, Panthera tigris and Ailuropoda melanoleuca wulingshanensis), proboscidean ( Stegodon huananensis), perissodactyls ( Hesperotherium sinense, Tapirus sinensis and Rhinoceros cf. sinensis), and artiodactyls (Cervini gen. et sp. indet. and Leptobos sp.). thereinto, A. m. wulingshanensis, T. sinensis and Leptobos sp. represent the first discoveries of their kinds in the Yanjinggou area. The faunal combination, along with the combined ESR and Useries dating of the Stegodon tooth, resulting in an age estimate of 1010 +/- 115 ka, suggests that the geologic age of the mammalian assemblage of the Dayakou pit corresponds to transition phase from the middle to late Early Pleistocene. Our study challenges preconceived notions and provides a more sophisticated understanding of the temporal framework for the Yanjinggou faunal complex, offering new insights into the Pleistocene mammalian faunas of South China. Furthermore, the Dayakou fauna is proposed to mark the onset of Early-Middle Pleistocene Transition mammalian faunas in South China, reflecting an ecosystem of mountainous subtropical forest mixed with arbor and shrub vegetation. The Dayakou locality witnesses the first appearances of modern clouded leopards and tigers in Asia, prompting the origin and early dispersal considerations of these two species.

AB  - The Dmrt gene family, with conserved functions throughout evolution, contains DM domains that play roles in various physiological processes like sex determination and gonadal differentiation. The mud crab (Scylla paramamosain), a significant marine culture crab in China, exhibits sexual dimorphism and is an important subject for reproduction research. In this study, the ORFs of the SpDmrt-1 and SpDmrt-3 genes from the mud crab gonad transcriptome database were obtained and confirmed by PCR. Both genes were expressed at the highest level in the testis among various tissues and in the T2 stage testis during different gonad developmental stages. In situ hybridization results showed that both genes were expressed during spermatogenesis. Silencing one gene led to a decrease in the expression of the other. Moreover, the expressions of some gonadal development-related genes (dsx, foxl-2, vasa, Dmrt-like, and IAG) changed significantly. Transcriptomic data indicated that SpDmrt-1 and SpDmrt-3 regulate various signaling pathways, including the Notch signaling pathway, the MAPK signaling pathway, the Hippo signaling pathway, the Calcium signaling pathway, and several other gender-related pathways, showing their involvement in male mud crab development. Furthermore, after long-term interference with SpDmrt-1 in vitro, most cells in the testis of the mud crab were at the spermatid stage, only a small amount of spermatozoa could be observed, and obvious empty plaque-like areas appeared in the tissue. Our findings provided a crucial foundation for understanding the role of the Dmrt in the process of gonadal development in crustaceans.

AB  - Insect herbivores can be limited by host plants in two ways: density-dependent competition for food resources or density-independent search time limitation. Our understanding of density-dependent host plant limitation is relatively well developed and well integrated into conservation plans for at-risk insects. Search time limitation, a density-independent process, is much less well developed. Here, we explore both mechanisms using empirically based models of monarch butterfly population dynamics. These mechanisms differ fundamentally in their predictions: resource competition leads to matching of herbivore densities to host plant densities, and visible competition via consumption of host plants. Search time limitation leads to changes in population growth rate that can cause herbivore numbers to decline when host plant densities are constant. Search time limitation also implies that host plants can limit herbivores, even when many individual plants are uneaten. For monarch butterflies, our calculations suggest that many parts of North America have host plant densities below the threshold for search time limitation, which contrasts with the typical assumption of resource competition. More generally, incorporating search time limitation into conservation plans is important for reframing our understanding of how host plants limit insect herbivores in highly fragmented landscapes.

AB  - Simple Summary: The yak is the dominant livestock on the Tibetan plateau, providing milk, meat, fur, and income for the local residents; however growth-retarded yaks are of a high proportion and reduce the yak farming profitability. Our study found that the obstruction of energy metabolism and ATP synthesis in ruminal epithelium contributed to the growth retardation of yaks. It provided a fundamental understanding of how the energy metabolism of ruminal epithelium affected the growth retardation of yaks and provided new ideas for improving rumen health and the growth performance of growth-retarded yaks through nutritive regulation methods. Growth-retarded yaks are of a high proportion on the Tibetan plateau and reduce the economic income of farmers. Our previous studies discovered a maldevelopment in the ruminal epithelium of growth-retarded yaks, but the molecular mechanisms are still unclear. This study aimed to reveal how the proteomic profile in the ruminal epithelium contributed to the growth retardation of yaks. The proteome of the ruminal epithelium was detected using a high-resolution mass spectrometer. There were 52 proteins significantly differently expressed between the ruminal epithelium of growth-retarded yaks and growth-normal yaks, with 32 downregulated and 20 upregulated in growth-retarded yaks. Functional analysis showed the differently expressed proteins involved in the synthesis and degradation of ketone bodies (p = 0.012), propanoate metabolism (p = 0.018), pyruvate metabolism (p = 0.020), and mineral absorption (p = 0.024). The protein expressions of SLC26A3 and FTH1, enriched in the mineral absorption, were significantly downregulated in growth-retarded yaks. The key enzymes ACAT2 and HMGCS2 enriched in ketone bodies synthesis and key enzyme PCCA enriched in propanoate metabolism had lower protein expressions in the ruminal epithelium of growth-retarded yaks. The ATP concentration and relative mitochondrial DNA copy number in the ruminal epithelium of growth-normal yaks were dramatically higher than those of growth-retarded yaks (p < 0.05). The activities of citrate synthase (CS), the alpha-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase complex (alpha-KGDHC), isocitrate dehydrogenase (ICD) in the tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA), and the mitochondrial respiratory chain complex (MRCC) were significantly decreased in ruminal epithelium of growth-retarded yaks compared to growth-normal yaks (p < 0.05). The mRNA expressions of COQ9, COX4, and LDHA, which are the encoding genes in MRCC I, IV and anaerobic respiration, were also significantly decreased in the ruminal epithelium of growth-retarded yaks (p < 0.05). Correlation analysis revealed that the average daily gain (ADG) was significantly positively correlated to the relative mitochondrial DNA copy number (p < 0.01, r = 0.772) and ATP concentration (p < 0.01, r = 0.728) in the ruminal epithelium, respectively. The ruminal weight was positively correlated to the relative mitochondrial DNA copy number (p < 0.05, r = 0.631) and ATP concentration in ruminal epithelium (p < 0.01, r = 0.957), respectively. The ruminal papillae had a significant positive correlation with ATP concentration in ruminal epithelium (p < 0.01, r = 0.770). These results suggested that growth-retarded yaks had a lower VFA metabolism, ketone bodies synthesis, ion absorption, and ATP synthesis in the ruminal epithelium; it also indicated that the growth retardation of yaks is related to the obstruction of cellular ATP synthesis in rumen epithelial cells.

AB  - Simple Summary This study aimed to provide data about thyroid and lipid profiles in 30 Nicastrese goats along different physiological periods: before mating, during pregnancy, and in early lactation. Total triiodothyronine and thyroxine were lower in pregnant and milking goats, while BCS was lower in pregnant ones only, and total cholesterol, triglyceride, and very-low-density lipoprotein cholesterol were in milking goats only. During pregnancy and lactation, total triiodothyronine was positively correlated with free triiodothyronine and total thyroxine. These results show that under similar environmental, nutrition, and management conditions, different physiological phases play a significant role in the thyroid and lipid profiles in Nicastrese goats. These endocrine and metabolic resources could contribute to the knowledge useful for the salvage of this endangered, local, native breed. This study aimed to determine the thyroid and lipid profiles in 30 Nicastrese goats, along different physiological periods: before mating (nonpregnant goats), during the whole pregnancy (pregnant goats), and during postpartum and early lactation (milking goats). Blood samples were collected monthly from March 2020 to January 2021. Serum thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), total and free triiodothyronine (T-3, fT(3)), and thyroxine (T-4, fT(4)) concentrations were measured using immunoenzymatic assay kits and serum lipid panels (triglyceride (TG) and total cholesterol (tCho)) by enzymatic colorimetric method; very-low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (VLDL Cho) was calculated. Pregnant and milking goats showed the lower T-3 (p < 0.0002) and T-4 (p < 0.0005) concentrations, with lower BCS (p < 0.001) only in pregnant ones. Milking goats showed tCho (p < 0.006) concentrations lower than nonpregnant ones, and TG and VLDL Cho (p < 0.001) lower than both pregnant and nonpregnant goats. T-4:T-3 and T-3:fT(3) were significantly and positively correlated in both pregnancy and lactation. Under similar environmental, nutrition, and management conditions, different physiological phases play a significant role in the thyroid and lipid profiles in Nicastrese goats. These endocrine and metabolic resources could contribute to the knowledge useful for the salvage of this endangered, local, native breed.

AB  - Simple Summary
   Domestic mammals may become invasive alien species when introduced within natural environments and when they establish reproductive populations. One of the most common pathways of species introduction is represented by intentional or accidental escapes from confined environments, including zoos, farms and enclosures. A feral population of llama Lama glama has been present in Central Italy since 2016 after escaping from a zoological garden. In 2020, only three individuals were confirmed to be still present within a 40-hectare area, following a field survey. We carried out questionnaires with the resident human population to determine the local perception and the acceptance of two possible management actions, i.e., direct killing and surgical sterilization. Llamas are quite docile domestic animals, thus local perception was, in general, very positive and also linked to the exotic origin of the species, making llamas a welcome observation and a pleasant surprise. The observed decline of this population may be due to predation by wolves and poaching, together with the lack of suitability of natural environment, which may have prevented llamas establishing an invasive population. In this context, however, individual removal action should be conducted before the population shows a demographic rebound.
   Since 2016, a feral population of llama Lama glama has been present in Central Italy after escaping from a zoological garden and starting to reproduce. We updated demographic status and distribution of this population and investigated societal perception towards the llama presence and management in the area through a standard questionnaire. Field data were collected through direct (transects traveled by car and on foot) and indirect (newspapers, social networks and online platforms) research. The feral population appears to be declining. In July 2020, the population was represented by three individuals (one male and two females), identified also through photoidentification, most likely located within a 40-hectare area. The majority of citizens are aware of the presence of feral llamas and show a positive attitude toward them and a negative one toward management actions. The case of feral llamas in Italy is an evident example of unsafe management of a species which should have kept in a zoo and which, once set free, was able to catalyze the attention of the general public. The decline of this population limits the need of drastic management actions that, given the appreciation expressed by people and press toward these animals, would have been at risk of conflict with the public opinion. Removal action should be rapidly taken, i.e., before any demographic rebound and before the population becomes a stable feature of the local landscape.

AB  - Antarctic coastal polynyas are persistent and recurrent regions of open water located between the coast and the drifting pack-ice. In spring, they are the first polar areas to be exposed to light, leading to the development of phytoplankton blooms, making polynyas potential ecological hotspots in sea-ice regions. Knowledge on polynya oceanography and ecology during winter is limited due to their inaccessibility. This study describes i) the first in situ chlorophyll fluorescence signal (a proxy for chlorophyll-a concentration and thus presence of phytoplankton) in polynyas between the end of summer and winter, ii) assesses whether the signal persists through time and iii) identifies its main oceanographic drivers. The dataset comprises 698 profiles of fluorescence, temperature and salinity recorded by southern elephant seals in 2011, 2019-2021 in the Cape-Darnley (CDP;67S-69E) and Shackleton (SP;66S-95E) polynyas between February and September. A significant fluorescence signal was observed until April in both polynyas. An additional signal occurring at 130m depth in August within CDP may result from in situ growth of phytoplankton due to potential adaptation to low irradiance or remnant chlorophyll-a that was advected into the polynya. The decrease and deepening of the fluorescence signal from February to August was accompanied by the deepening of the mixed layer depth and a cooling and salinification of the water column in both polynyas. Using Principal Component Analysis as an exploratory tool, we highlighted previously unsuspected drivers of the fluorescence signal within polynyas. CDP shows clear differences in biological and environmental conditions depending on topographic features with higher fluorescence in warmer and saltier waters on the shelf compared with the continental slope. In SP, near the ice-shelf, a significant fluorescence signal in April below the mixed layer (around 130m depth), was associated with fresher and warmer waters. We hypothesize that this signal could result from potential ice-shelf melting from warm water intrusions onto the shelf leading to iron supply necessary to fuel phytoplankton growth. This study supports that Antarctic coastal polynyas may have a key role for polar ecosystems as biologically active areas throughout the season within the sea-ice region despite inter and intra-polynya differences in environmental conditions.

AB  - Anthelmintics, drugs against parasitic worms, are frequently used in livestock and might act as danger environmental microcontaminants. The present study was designed to monitor the possible circulation of common anthelmintic drug albendazole (ABZ) and its metabolites in the real agriculture conditions. The sheep were treated with the recommended dose of ABZ. Collected faeces were used for the fertilization of a field with fodder plants (alfalfa and clover) which served as feed for sheep from a different farm. The selective ultrasensitive mass spectrometry revealed surprisingly high concentrations of active ABZ metabolite (ABZ-sulphoxide) in all samples (dung, plants, ovine plasma, rumen content and faeces). Our results prove for the first time an undesirable permeation of ABZ metabolites from sheep excrement into plants (used as fodder) and subsequently to other sheep in real agricultural conditions. This circulation causes the permanent exposition of the ecosystems and food-chain to the drug and can promote the development of drug resistance in helminths.

AB  - Agroecological interventions are imperative for boosting agricultural productivity and soil fertility while increasing profitability of subsistence farmers in low-income countries by replacing synthetic fertilizers. With this context, the present study was aimed to evaluate the impact of animal manures (sheep and poultry manure) and plant residue-based organic amendments (rice husk biochar and sugarcane pressmud) on soil quality, nutrient uptake and balance, yield, and sustainability of rice-wheat cropping in alluvial (rainfed) and red lateritic soil (dryland) of middle Gangetic plains (Narayanpur) and Vindhyan region (Rajgarh) of Mirzapur district in eastern UP. The field experiments were conducted for three years at the above two sites and amendments were done at a rate by replacing 30% standard recommended doses of fertilizer (RDF) for rice-wheat cropping system. Field trials were conducted with the 100% RDF as control, and 70% RDF with sheep manure, poultry manure, rice-husk biochar and sugarcane pressmud in a randomized block design. The organic amendments were done during the rice cultivation stage and the residual effect was observed during the subsequent wheat cultivation. Though soil organic carbon (SOC) was found to show significant (p >= 0.05) increase in biochar amended plots, animal manures followed by pressmud showed year wise increase in both SOC and microbial biomass carbon. In rainfed areas, plant growth and yield attributes for both rice and wheat were at par in amendments than control while in dryland, the 100% RDF showed better performance during the first year, after that amended plot showed better performance. All amendments resulted in higher benefit: cost ratio except biochar addition in Narayanpur, whereas in Rajgarh, the poultry manure resulted in significant improvement in benefit: cost ratio from second year onward. Our study advocates that validation of suitable amendment packages based on organic inputs are imperative for improving the yield, soil quality and nutrient balance of rice-wheat cropping system and thereby attaining the UN-SDGs at the village/local level.

AB  - Like alien plant invasion, range expansion of native plants may threaten biodiversity and economies, rendering them native invaders. Variation in abiotic and biotic conditions across a large geographic scale greatly affects variation in traits and interactions with herbivores of native plant invaders, which is an interesting yet mostly unexplored issue. We used a common garden experiment to compare defensive/nutritional traits and palatability to generalist herbivores of 20 native (23.64 degrees N-30.18 degrees N) and introduced range (31.58 degrees N-36.87 degrees N) populations of Reynoutria japonica, which is a native invader following range expansion in China. We analyzed the relationships among herbivore pressure, climate, plant chloroplast haplotypes, leaf traits, and herbivore performance. Of the 16 variables tested, we observed range differences in 11 variables and latitudinal clines in nine variables. In general, herbivores performed better on the introduced plants than on the native plants, and better on the high-latitude plants than on the low-latitude plants within the introduced populations. Three key traits (leaf thickness, specific leaf area, and carbon-to-nitrogen [C:N] ratio) determined palatability to herbivores and were significantly associated with temperature and/or precipitation of plant provenance as well as with plant haplotypes but not with herbivore pressure. Our results revealed a causal sequence from plant-range-based environmental forces and genetic context to plant quality and palatability to herbivores in R. japonica. These findings suggest a post-introduction evolution of R. japonica, which may partly explain the colonization success of this important native, but invasive plant.

AB  - Simple Summary: As pigs are sensitive to heat, high temperature produces large economic losses in pig production. The Iberian pig (Sus mediterraneus) is a rustic breed that thrives in the Mediterranean forest in the southwest of the Iberian Peninsula, with hot summers, with a peak in July (32-36 degrees C) being more frequent due to the appearance of heatwaves in the Mediterranean area. It is well known that betaine and zinc are growth promoters in pigs under thermoneutral conditions. Betaine acts as an osmolyte, decreasing basal heat production, and zinc is very important as an enzymatic cofactor and structural element for proteins, and improves intestinal functionality. Whether betaine and zinc may mitigate heat stress in pigs remains unclear. Our aim was to study the effect of heat, and the dietary supplementation of betaine or zinc on the heat production of Iberian pigs. At 30 degrees C, betaine or zinc supplementation had no effect on heat production; in addition, these parameters were not affected by temperature, indicating that Iberian pigs are well adapted to hot environments. However, the ratio of CO2 production/O-2 consumption indicated that supplementation with betaine may have a positive effect on lipogenesis and, thereafter, overall growth. The effect of heat, and dietary betaine or zinc on the heat production (HP) of Iberian pigs was studied. Thirty barrows (44 kg) were individually housed for 28 days and assigned to one of five treatments: (1) thermoneutrality (20 degrees C) and fed a control diet (TN-CON) ad libitum; (2) hot (30 degrees C) and fed a control diet (HT-CON) ad libitum; (3) thermoneutrality and pair fed a control diet (TN-CON-PF) to HT-CON; (4) hot and fed a betaine-supplemented (0.5%) diet (HT-BET) ad libitum; and (5) hot and fed a zinc-supplemented (0.012%) diet (HT-ZN) ad libitum. On the 18th day, pigs were moved to a respirometry chamber (two chambers) under their respective treatment. The metabolizable energy (ME) intake, HP and respiratory quotient (RQ) were measured over 24 h. No differences (p > 0.05) were found in HP and RE between treatments. For RQ, TN-CON was greater (p < 0.01) than HT treatments, except for HT-BET. All RQs indicated an overall lipogenesis where betaine supplementation showed an intermediate value, indicating that it may have a positive effect on lipogenesis and overall growth. At 30 degrees C, betaine or zinc had no effect on HP and RE; ME intake was not reduced, indicating a genetic adaptation of Iberian pigs to heat.

AB  - Simple Summary In the Pyrenees, traditional guided herding practices have often shifted to free-ranging flocks, impacting the management of mountain grasslands. This study utilizes GPS-based livestock tracking systems and Geographic Information Systems (GISs) to understand livestock behavior in remote areas. Tracking a flock of free-ranging sheep during the summers of 2019 to 2021, preferences for grazing on specific geomorphological features and plant communities were assessed. The results indicate that sheep prefer altitudes between 2400 and 2600 m and SE-, SW-, and E-facing sites with slopes under 20%. Preferred pastures include Festucion eskiae, Primulion intricatae, and Nardion strictae, while Festucion scopariae communities are rejected. This knowledge contributes to the efficient management of summer mountain pastures and aids in their preservation.Abstract For centuries, mountain grasslands have been part of the grazing cycle of sheep and cattle in extensive management systems in the Pyrenees; however, traditional guided herding has been, in many cases, replaced by free-ranging flocks at these pastures. The goal of this study was to analyze the grazing behavior of free-ranging sheep in mountain pastures using GPS-based tracking systems and Geographic Information Systems. During the summer seasons of 2019, 2020, and 2021, a transterminant flock of free-ranging sheep was tracked with GPS devices attached to collars at the mountain pastures of Collarada mountain (Central Pyrenees, Spain). Preferences for grazing on certain geomorphological features (slope, aspect, and altitude) and different plant communities present in the area were evaluated using the Manly's standardized preference index. The results show that sheep prefer altitudes between 2400 and 2600 m; SE-, SW-, and E-facing sites; and slopes under 20%. The preferred pastures were Festucion eskiae, Primulion intricatae, and Nardion strictae; however, they reject Festucion scopariae communities. This study demonstrates the effectiveness of GPS and GIS technologies in monitoring free-ranging sheep activity, providing valuable data for enhancing pastoral practices and ensuring sustainable pasture use.

AB  - Including grape pomace in goat diets presents a potentially valuable strategy for enhancing the sustainability of goat farming and mitigating environmental risks. This work aimed to investigate the impact of dietary dried grape pomace (DGP) on milk yield, milk composition and milk fatty acid (FA) profile in goats. Gas chromatography was utilised to obtain an extensive profile of FA in milk fat. Dry matter intake, as well as milk yield and composition were not altered by dietary DGP. Despite the predominance of linoleic acid (LA, 18:2 cis-9,cis-12) in the lipids of DGP and the presence of phenolic compounds, its inclusion in the diet did not negatively affect the quantitatively main groups of FA. Furthermore, there was no significant impact on butyric, caproic, caprylic, and capric acids, the major 18:1 trans isomers, including vaccenic acid (18:1 trans-11), LA, alpha-linolenic acid (18:3 n-3), and the long chain polyunsaturated n-6 and n-3 FA. However, rumenic acid in milk fat was significantly reduced from 0.36 to 0.30 g/100 g of total fatty acid methyl esters. This study supports that up to 6%, DGP can be safely included in conventional dairy goat diets without compromising the production results or altering to great extent the milk FA profile.

AB  - Tetracycline antibiotics (TCs) are a broad-spectrum antibiotic, widely used in livestock and poultry breeding. Residue of tetracycline antibiotics in animal manure may cause changes in vegetable TCs content and soil microbial community. On the basis of the investigation and analysis of TCs pollution in the soil of main vegetable bases and the livestock manure of major large-scale farms in Chongqing, China, field experiment was conducted to study the residues of tetracycline antibiotics in Brassica juncea var. gemmifera and soil under different kinds and different dosages of livestock manures. Effects of tetracycline antibiotics on the structure and diversity of soil microbial community were also investigated by high-throughput sequencing. TCs content in soil was increased by applying livestock manure. The contents of tetracycline, oxytetracycline (OTC) and chlortetracycline (CTC) in the soil under pig manure treatment were 171.07-660.20 mu g kg(-1), 25.38-345.78 mu g kg(-1) and 170.77-707.47 mu g kg(-1), respectively. The contents of TC, OTC and CTC in the soil under the treatment of chicken manure were 166.62-353.61 mu g kg(-1), 122.25-251.23 mu g kg(-1) and 15.12-80.91 mu g kg(-1,) respectively. TCs in edible parts of Brassica juncea var. gemmifera was increased after livestock manure treatment Proteobacteria, Acidobacteria, Actinobacteria, Chioroflexi and Bacteroidetes under livestock manure treatment were the dominant phyla, accounting for 85.2-92.4% of the total abundance of soil bacteria. The soil OTUs under the treatment of pig manure was higher than that under the treatment of chicken manure. Biogas residue (Livestock manure after fermentation treatment) can effectively reduce the environmental and ecological risks caused by antibiotic residues.

AB  - Increasing evidence shows that plant Endophytes play a crucial role in the fitness and productivity of hosts. Surface sterilization is an indispensable process before high-throughput sequencing (HTS) and tissue separation of plant endophytes, but its potential impact on the composition and diversity of endophytes has rarely been investigated. In the present work, the influence of sodium hypochlorite (NaClO) on the diversity of endophytic bacteria and fungi in leaves and stems of tea plants was investigated. We found that the diversity of bacterial endophytes was significantly affected by the concentration of NaClO as well as the pretreatment time. Pretreatment with 0.5% NaClO for 8 min and 2.0% NaClO for 3 min were suitable for the tea plant leaves and stems, respectively, but the effects of NaClO on the diversity of fungal endophytes were limited according to the results from HTS. Regardless of NaClO sterilization, most of the endophytes in tissues, such as the dominant taxa, could not be Isolated by using the regular culture-dependent approaches. Collectively, our results demonstrated that the pretreatment with NaClO should be modified to precisely understand the diversity of endophytes from different tissues of tea plants and also indicate that more attention should be paid to establish specific culture-dependent protocols for the isolation of plant endophytes.

AB  - In May-June 2021 a herd of wild Asian elephants made global headlines when they trekked hundreds of km into areas where elephants had been absent for centuries, mobilizing a response of unprecedented scale. Here, we analyze the movement attributes and body condition of these elephants to understand this unusual behavior and its implications for megafauna conservation in the Anthropocene. We propose that these movements are a form of partial and irruptive nomadic behavior, although the data is also compatible with a failed attempt of dispersal. In their path to Kunming, the elephants made unusual habitat choices, using landscapes with higher nightlight intensity, and moving close to towns and villages, while avoiding areas with high forest cover, which we interpret as habituation to feeding on crops and lack of fear of people. Fifteen months after starting their journey, the elephants showed high body condition scores and had successfully delivered two babies, both indicators of good health, suggesting that their decision to leave their previous home range had paid off. In China, we recommend an elephant conservation strategy founded on area-based and area-specific measures, including protected areas, landscape connectivity, and the mitigation of human-elephant conflicts, as well as preparedness for expectable population range expansions, potentially on the scale of hundreds of km, in the coming decades. Our study highlights the ecological and behavioral plasticity of elephants and the importance of integrating movement ecology in conservation planning, especially for wide-ranging species.

AB  - The goal of this work was to assess the effect of combined pollution of galaxolide (HHCB) and cadmium (Cd) on soil microbial community as measured by phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA). Combined effects of HHCB and Cd were different from that of HHCB alone. The total microbial biomass increased with the concentrations of HHCB in both the single and combined treatments. Comparing to the single HHCB treatments, addition of Cd significantly reduced both the total microbial biomass and Gram-positive/Gram-negative bacteria (G+/G-) ratio, while increased the bacteria/fungi (B/F) ratio in the combined pollution treatments. The principal component analysis (PCA) revealed that the microbial community structure was significantly altered by the combined effects of HHCB and Cd. Results of redundancy analysis (RDA) showed that there was complex relationship between pollutant and microbial community and the combined effects was higher than the single pollution. Taken together, these results suggest that combined pollution of HHCB and Cd caused a greater influence on the soil microbial community than the single pollution of HHCB.

AB  - BackgroundGrowing global demand for meat and milk has fuelled an increase in the trade in animal products, but there is still little awareness of the magnitude and characteristics of the trade in live animals. In this study, we investigated the international trade of 12 live food-producing animal species, including poultry ('chickens', 'ducks', 'geese' and 'turkeys'), ruminants ('cattle', 'sheep', 'goats', 'camels' and 'buffalo'), pigs and 'other' food-producing animals ('rabbits and hares' and 'horses') as reported to the FAOStat database between 2005 and 2021.ResultsThe analysis revealed that international trade in most species had increased over the study period. Chickens were numerically the most traded species with an average of 1.4 billion live chickens internationally traded annually. Live export of chickens demonstrated the greatest growth over the study period, with an estimated additional 58 million animals traded each year. Intercontinental trade was also substantial, contributing to 10% or more of the international trade in eight of the 12 species. Many countries were also bidirectional traders for multiple species. The Netherlands, Germany and Poland were among both the highest importers and highest exporters for multiple species between 2019 and 2021.ConclusionThis study provides valuable insight on the scale and trends in the international trade in livestock to inform regulations and practices that might be needed to mitigate potential threats associated with livestock movements, including disease emergence and spread, poor animal welfare, antimicrobial resistance and environmental degradation, while supporting demands and need for livestock-based foods.

AB  - Extreme temperatures and heatwave events present challenging conditions for wildlife and are increasing in frequency and intensity in many regions due to climate change. High daily temperatures increase physiological stress and cause mortality in susceptible individuals (e.g. from poor health or exposure) but may also drive behavioural changes as individuals seek to thermoregulate (e.g. seeking shelter or water). As daily high temperatures accumulate into heatwave events, the ability of wildlife to tolerate conditions can diminish and exacerbate stress. Although climate change is well known to decouple species interactions, here we examined how extreme conditions may intensify interactions between predators and prey. In particular, we explored whether predators can exploit the thermoregulatory requirements of prey as they increasingly require access to water. We presented evidence from the use of artificial waterpoints by dingoes, Canis dingo, and eastern grey kangaroos, Macropus giganteus, on a wildlife property in Australia's semiarid drylands, asking whether high temperatures and heatwaves alter species behaviour and interactions between them. Both species increasingly accessed waterpoints as daily maximum temperatures increased; however, the degree of co-occurrence at waterpoints increased significantly as the temperatures became extreme and resulted in heatwaves. Not only did waterpoints become increasingly important for both species during heatwaves, but dingo hunting attempts on kangaroos at these times were significantly higher than expected based on the number of days when heat anomalies occurred. Additionally, dingoes relaxed their predisposition to hunt kangaroos in poor body condition, making kangaroo hunting opportunistic during these times. Our findings emphasize the potential for climate change to exacerbate predator-prey interactions, which may have an impact on species persistence if prey is unable to adapt to predators that exploit their thermoregulatory demands.

AB  - Ticks are blood-sucking parasite and transmit pathogens to humans, domestic and wild animals. Ticks are seriously damage the production of sheep and goats, resulting in heavy economic loss to farmers. The present study investigated microscopic and molecular identification of ticks and tick-borne anaplasmosis infesting sheep and goats in three agro-ecological zones of Pakistan. The collected ticks were identified at species level based on their morphological features through microscopy by using taxonomic keys. Four Rhipicephalus (R.) species namely: R. guilhoni Rh. geigyi, R. annulatus, R. pulchellus, two Haemaphysalis (Hae) spp. Hae. sulcate, Hae. punctate, one Ixodes ricinus and Hyalomma anatolicum were identified. The morphological variations in their body sizes, scutal pattern, female genital opening, spiracular plate length and male adanal plate were recorded. Furthermore, we assessed the effectiveness of utilizing the 16S rRNA gene sequence to differentiate Anaplasma samples at the species level. Microscopically suspected positive blood samples for Anaplasma were subjected to DNA extraction. Anaplasma was observed in the blood of 14 animals. The sequence similarity between Anaplasma marginale and the reference genome were 99.25%, while below this value indicating a distinct species. Phylogenetic analysis revealed close similarity with A. marginale isolates from Iran, Vietnam and Pakistan This study contributes to the epidemiology of ticks and TBPs in the KP province and highlights the importance of proactive TBP surveillance in livestock.

AB  - Surveillance of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is necessary and urgent. This study emphasizes the critical role of One Health surveillance in monitoring AMR, integrating metagenomics to assess microbiota and antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) across human, pig, and soil ecosystems in swine farms. The human and pig gut microbiota are predominantly composed of the phyla Firmicutes, Bacteroidota, Proteobacteria, and Actinobacteria, whereas the soil microbiota exhibits a distinct profile, with Proteobacteria, Acidobacteria, Actinobacteria, and Planctomycetes being the most prevalent. A diverse array of ARGs is identified, including multidrug resistance, with Acidobacteria and Proteobacteria as potential ARG hosts. The study reveals shared ARGs and mobile genetic elements (MGEs) among human, pig, and soil, indicating microbial interdependence and potential for horizontal gene transfer. A positive correlation between biocide and metal resistance genes (BMRGs) and MGEs suggests the role of disinfectants and metals in ARG selection and dissemination. Network analysis of BMRGs, MGEs, and ARGs finds positive associations between copper resistance genes (corR), zinc and lead resistance genes (zraR/ hydH, zraS/hydG), and ARGs such as macB, tetA(58), mlaF, and mtrA. This correlation is also evident with insertion sequences like ISAcba1 and ISArsp9. The findings reveal the potential for horizontal gene transfer and the influence of disinfectants and metals on ARG selection and dissemination, advancing the application of metagenomic monitoring within the One Health framework. This research underscores the need for integrated strategies to mitigate antibiotic resistance and informs sustainable agricultural practices.

AB  - An estimated 73% of emerging infections are zoonotic in origin, with animal contact and encroachment on their habitats increasing the risk of spill-over events. In Vietnam, close exposure to a wide range of animals and animal products can lead to acquisition of zoonotic pathogens, a number of which cause central nervous system (CNS) infections. However, studies show the aetiology of CNS infections remains unknown in around half of cases. We used samples and data from hospitalised patients with CNS infections, enrolled into the Vietnam Initiative on Zoonotic Infections multicentre study, to determine the association between aetiology and animal contact including those in whom the cause was unknown. Among 933 patients, a pathogen or an antibody response to it was identified in 291 (31.2%, 95% CI 28.3-34.3%). The most common pathogens were Streptococcus suis (n = 91 (9.8%, 8.0-11.9%)) and Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) (n = 72 (7.7%, 6.1-9.7%)). Commonly reported animal contact included keeping, raising or handling (n = 364 (39.0%, 35.9-42.2%)) and handling, cooking or consuming raw meat, blood or viscera in the 2 weeks prior to symptom onset (n = 371 (39.8%, 36.6-43.0%)), with the latter most commonly from pigs (n = 343 (36.9%, 33.8-40.1%). There was no association between an unknown aetiology and exposure to animals in a multivariate logistic regression. Further testing for unknown or undetected pathogens may increase diagnostic yield, however, given the high proportion of zoonotic pathogens and the presence of risk factors, increasing public awareness about zoonoses and preventive measures can be considered.

AB  - The degradation of organic matter (OM) and CH4 emissions during composting greatly influence the composting efficiency and greenhouse effect. This study evaluated the effects of adding phosphogypsum (PPG) and medical stone (MS) on OM breakdown, CH4 emissions, and their underlying mechanisms. MS accelerated the breakdown of OM in the early composting stage, whereas PPG increased it in the cooling and maturation periods. At the ending of composting, humification was also significantly promoted by PPG and MS (P < 0.05). Moreover, MS and PPG reduced CH4 emissions by 27.64% and 23.12%, respectively, and significantly inhibited the activities of methanogens in terms of their abundance (mcrA) and composition (dominant genera such as Methanobrevibacter, Methanocorpusculum, and Methanothermus) (P < 0.05). Interestingly, MS enhanced the activity of enzymes and bacterial metabolism related to OM degradation in the early composting stage, whereas PPG promoted them during the cooling and maturity stages. MS and PPG inhibited the activities of enzymes related to CH4 release during the cooling and maturity stages. Therefore, PPG and MS may have influenced OM degradation and CH4 releases during composting via changes in bacterial metabolism and enzyme activity levels. PPG and MS could have altered the activities of methanogens to influence the transformation of carbon and CH4 emissions according to network analysis and partial least-squares path modeling analysis. These findings provide insights at the molecular level into the effects of adding PPG and MS on OM degradation and CH4 emissions during composting, thereby facilitating the application of PPG and MS in composting systems.

AB  - The transition toward more sustainable plant protection with reduced pesticide use is difficult, because there is no "silver bullet " available among nonchemical tools. Integrating several plant protection approaches may thus be needed for efficient pest management. Recently, increasing the genetic diversity of plantations via cultivar mixing has been proposed as a possible method to reduce pest damage. However, previous studies have not addressed either the relative efficiency of exploiting cultivar mixing and intrinsic plant herbivore resistance or the potential utility of combining these approaches to increase cropping security. Here, using a full factorial experiment with 60 woodland strawberry plots, we tested for the relative and combined effect of cultivar mixing and intrinsic plant resistance on herbivore damage and yield. The experiment comprised two levels of diversity ( "high " with 10 varieties and "low " with two varieties) and three levels of resistance ( "resistant " comprising only varieties intrinsically resistant against strawberry leaf beetle Galerucella tenella; "susceptible " with susceptible varieties only; and "resistance mixtures " with 50:50 mixtures of resistant and susceptible varieties). The experiment was carried out over two growing seasons. Use of resistant varieties either alone or intermixed with susceptible varieties in "resistance mixtures " reduced insect herbivory. Interestingly, resistant varieties not only reduced the mean damage in "resistance mixtures " by themselves being less damaged, but also protected intermixed susceptible varieties via associational resistance. The effect of higher genetic diversity was less evident, reducing herbivory only at the highest level of herbivore damage. In general, herbivory was lowest in plots with high diversity that included at least some resistant varieties and highest in low diversity plots consisting only of susceptible varieties. Despite this, no significant difference in yield (fruit biomass) was found, indicating that strawberry may be relatively tolerant. Our results demonstrate that combined use of high genetic diversity and resistant varieties can help reduce pest damage and provide a useful tool for sustainable food production. "Resistance mixtures " may be particularly useful for sensitive food crops where susceptible varieties are high yielding that could not be completely replaced by resistant ones.

AB  - Simple Summary Phan Rang sheep is a term used to collectively refer to the sheep raised in the central Vietnam provinces of Ninh Thuan and Binh Thuan. Given the extreme weather conditions of their habitat, Phan Rang sheep are assumed to be heat-resilient. With climate change's mounting challenges, the sheep have become a focus of government-led breeding and conservation initiatives. However, there is a critical knowledge gap regarding the sheep's genetic information, including their origins, diversity, population structure, and genetics, as well as the morphological basis of their adaptive traits. This gap has hindered the development of breeding programs and genetic resource conservation efforts. In an effort to contribute to filling this knowledge gap, we employed a two-fold approach to investigate Phan Rang sheep's morphometrics and genetic lineages. First, we collected body conformational data to facilitate the quick identification of purebred individuals. Secondly, we collected and analyzed the mitochondrial DNA control region (D-loop) and the Y chromosome SRY and SRYM18 sequences to elucidate the maternal and paternal lineages of the sheep. Of the sheep analyzed for the D-loop, approximately one-third belonged to haplogroup A, while the remainder belonged to haplogroup B. For the paternal lineage, two main Y haplotypes, H5 and H6, were identified. Overall, the findings supported the hypothesis of dual origins for the Phan Rang sheep.Abstract The Phan Rang sheep, considered the sole indigenous breed of Vietnam, are primarily concentrated in the two central provinces of Ninh Thuan and Binh Thuan, with Ninh Thuan accounting for more than 90% of the country's sheep population. These provinces are known for their high temperatures and frequent droughts. The long-standing presence of the Phan Rang sheep in these regions suggests their potential resilience to heat stress-a trait of increasing interest in the face of global climate change. Despite the breed's significance, a critical knowledge gap hinders conservation and breeding programs. To address this, our study employed a two-pronged approach. First, we collected body conformational data to aid in breed identification. Second, we analyzed mitochondrial DNA (D-loop) and Y chromosome markers (SRY and SRYM18) to elucidate the maternal and paternal lineages. Among the 68 Phan Rang sheep analyzed for their D-loop, 19 belonged to mitochondrial haplogroup A, while 49 belonged to haplogroup B. The haplogroups can be subdivided into 16 unique haplotypes. All 19 rams surveyed for their paternal lineages belonged to haplotypes H5 and H6. These findings strongly support the hypothesis of dual origins for the Phan Rang sheep. This study presents the first genetic data for the Phan Rang breed, providing crucial insights for future research and conservation efforts.

AB  - Simple Summary The rapidly growing wild boar population has resulted in an increasing rate of human-wildlife conflicts, including economic damage to crops or spreading African swine fever (ASF), which affects the pork industry. This situation necessitates the adoption of various measures to prevent wild boar movement, mitigate spreading of diseases, and protect crops. We evaluated the impact of commonly used odor fences (Wildschwein Stopp) using GPS telemetry of tagged individuals. The telemetry of free-ranging wild boars demonstrated no effect on their crossing of the odor fence lines compared to before the installation. Moreover, no difference was found when comparing the home range size of monitored individuals during the 22 days before and after odor fence installation. Therefore, our findings do not support using odor fences to prevent wild boar movement as a mitigation measure of ASF transmission or line protection against the damage caused by wild boars to crops.Abstract Wild boars are an opportunistic wildlife species that has successfully colonized the human-modified landscape in Europe. However, the current population boom has negative consequences, which result in a rapid increase in human-wildlife conflicts and disease transmission, including African swine fever (ASF). The increasing frequency of conflicts requires adequate solutions for these issues through various measures. Application of deterrents is a common non-lethal measure whose effects have been insufficiently verified until recently. Thus, this study aims to evaluate the effectiveness of odor fences, often applied as a barrier against wild boar movement. For this purpose, 18 wild boars were marked with GPS collars. After 22 days of initial monitoring, 12 sections of odor fences were installed on their home ranges. The monitored wild boars crossed the area 20.5 +/- 9.2 times during the pre-installation period and 19.9 +/- 8.4 times after the odor fence installation. Moreover, the average home range varied between 377.9 +/- 185.0 ha before and 378.1 +/- 142.2 ha after the odor fence installation. Based on GPS telemetry results, we do not support using odor repellent lines for crop protection or for limiting wild boar movement to lessen ASF outbreaks.

AB  - Simple Summary The Amur tiger has a status of being endangered on the world's IUCN red list. The northwestern part of its range is situated in Russia and China, where tigers were killed by humans 50-70 years ago. To restore the tiger population within the historical range, firstly we estimated the condition of the environment there. We assessed suitability of habitats for the tiger's prey species (wild ungulates) in the Lesser Khingan mountains (North China). For this we made modeling and calculations that were based on the information from satellite images and data we collected personally on the land surface during our expeditions. The resulting species distribution maps were used to design an ecological network. The habitat patches with the best quality (for tiger) were assigned as cores for the ecological network, which were connected by calculated green corridors. The recovery of the Amur tiger in habitats of China's Lesser Khingan is confirmed possible. Natural green corridors for moving tigers are mainly located at the forests' edges and characterized with high variability of the trees species. In this study, we describe three potential transboundary corridors and make recommendations to establish protected areas in the important tiger places. Moreover, it is necessary to implement habitat recovery activities for tiger key areas. The Amur tiger (Panthera tigris) has a status of being endangered on the world's IUCN red list. The northwestern part of its range is situated in Russia and China, where tigers were exterminated by humans in the 1950-1970s. To restore tiger population within a historical range, an estimation of the habitat suitability is firstly needed. The Lesser Khingan mountains (Heilongjiang) was analyzed. Habitat types were mapped by satellite images analysis and field proven. The potential habitats of the main tiger's prey species (wild boar (Sus scrofa), roe deer (Capreolus pygargus), and red deer (Cervus elaphus xanthopygus) were also assessed. Maximum entropy and linear discriminant analysis methods were applied and compared for species distribution modeling (SDM). Species distribution maps were used to design an ecological network. The fragmentation of habitat patches was evaluated by spatial ecological metrics. The habitat patches with the best metrics were assigned as cores for the ecological network, which were connected by calculated corridors. The least cost distance method (based on distance to roads and settlements) was used. The recovery of the Amur tiger in habitats of China's Lesser Khingan is shown to be possible. Types of habitats were calculated as natural corridors for moving tigers. They are mainly located at the forests' edges and characterized with various canopy structures and high variability in the tree species composition. Three potential transboundary corridors are described: (a) foothills and low mountains of the northern Lesser Khingan; (b) connection between the southeast Lesser Khingan and the western part of the Wandashan mountain system; and (c) corridor within foothills and low mountains of the eastern part of Lesser Khingan. It is recommended to establish protected areas for the important tiger core habitats, and the main optimal ways for their migrations are described during the current investigation. Moreover, it is necessary to implement habitat recovery activities for key areas.

AB  - In plant ecology, the terms growth and development are often used interchangeably. Yet these constitute two distinct processes. Plant architectural traits (e.g. number of successive forks) can estimate development stages. Here, we show the importance of including the effect of development stages to better understand size-related trait scaling relationships (i.e. between height and stem diameter). We focused on one common savanna woody species (Senegalia nigrescens) from the Greater Kruger Area, South Africa. We sampled 406 individuals that experience different exposure to herbivory, from which we collected four traits: plant height, basal stem diameter, number of successive forks (proxy for development stage), and resprouting. We analysed trait relationships (using standardized major axis regression) between height and stem diameter, accounting for the effect of ontogeny, exposure to herbivory, and resprouting. The number of successive forks affects the scaling relationship between height and stem diameter, with the slope and strength of the relationship declining in more developed individuals. Herbivory exposure and resprouting do not affect the overall height-diameter relationship. However, when height and stem diameter were regressed separately against number of successive forks, herbivory exposure and resprouting had an effect. For example, resprouting individuals allocate more biomass to both primary and secondary growth than non-resprouting plants in more disturbed conditions. We stress the need to include traits related to ontogeny so as to disentangle the effect of biomass allocation to primary and secondary growth from that of development in plant functional relationships.
   We show how scaling relationship among growth-related traits are mediated by individuals' developmental stage (captured by the number of successive forks) and vary depending on exposure to disturbance and life history (resprouting versus non-resprouting individuals). image

AB  - This study examined the African elephant's (Loxodonta africana) seasonal space use and movement using elephant telemetry data in Hwange National Park. The adaptive-local convex hull (a-LoCoH) was adopted to understand the elephant movement metrics and home range. Paired t test was used to compare the mean seasonal speed of each group (n = 10) of elephants, while the Wilcoxon signed-rank test was used to determine differences in the 50% and 90% home range. Results show that mean elephant movement speed significantly differed (t = -3.07, df = , p < 0.01) for all elephant groups across seasons. Moreover, significant differences (W = 3, Z = 2.4973, p < 0.012) were observed between core a-LoCoH home-range distributions for the wet and dry seasons. However, no significant differences (W = 10, Z = 1.7838, p > 0.05) were detected between the two seasons for the total (90%) a-LoCoH ranges. NDVI, Distance to water sources and Slope were positively related with elephant movement speed while Aspect and Distance to roads were negatively related with elephant speed. These findings underscore the importance of resource variability in driving elephant movement and foraging behaviour in a semi-arid savannah ecosystem.

AB  - Wild goat ( Capra aegagrus Erxleben, 1777) is a prominent mountain mammal found in many habitats in T & uuml;rkiye, but few studies have investigated its relationship with the habitat. This species is significantly affected by various anthropogenic activities such as illegal hunting and marble quarries. This study aimed to determine the changes in potential suitable habitats for wild goats over time by creating habitat suitability models. This study was carried out in the province of Isparta. The occurrence data of wild goats were collected mostly from S & uuml;t & ccedil;& uuml;ler and E & gbreve;irdir districts. The data were obtained for two periods, 2009 and 2019. The habitat suitability modeling was performed using the Maximum Entropy (MaxEnt) method. The results showed that habitat use of wild goat was influenced by factors such as elevation, ruggedness, slope, radiation index, annual precipitation (bio12), and annual mean temperature (bio1). The AUC values for the training and test datasets of the model obtained using data from the year 2009 were found to be 0.990 and 0.987, respectively. Similarly, for the year 2019, the values were found to be 0.987 and 0.978, respectively. It was observed that the identified suitable areas for both periods were mostly limited to local areas in the southwest and southeast of the study area. Finally, the habitat suitability maps were thresholded at a value of 0.5. As a result, the thresholded habitat suitability maps predict that there could be a 2,659 -hectare (ha) increase in potential suitable areas in 2019.

AB  - Trophic plasticity is an important factor in assessing the ability of a species to remain in an altered environment or its ability to be introduced into a new environment. The Nile tilapia is a species that has been illegally introduced for aquaculture purposes in the central portion of the Amazon. Its escape into the natural environment has occurred, and it is already possible to find specimens in streams around Manaus, capital of the state of Amazonas, Brazil. This study aimed to investigate the diet of Nile tilapia in the stream known as Cachoeira Alta do Tarum & atilde; (Manaus, Amazonas, Brazil), a small tributary of the Tarum & atilde;-a & ccedil;u river that has been affected by anthropogenic actions. To identify its feeding habit, 43 stomachs were analyzed according to their degree of repletion, frequency of occurrence of food items, volumetric method, and the food importance index. The species was identified as being detritivores with a tendency to herbivory. Plastic was identified in the diet of this species, which indicates generalist and opportunistic habits when inserted in habitats with a low supply of food.

AB  - Q fever is a zoonotic disease caused by Coxiella burnetii (C. burnetii), a pathogen with a high capability for infection. The disease primarily affects ruminants, leading to reproductive disorders, but can also be transmitted to humans through contact with infected animals or their products. In Algeria, Q fever is endemic, but little is known about the presence and circulation of C. burnetii in domestic goats. This study aimed to perform a multicentric serological analysis of C. burnetii antibodies in domestic goats from four provinces in the North East Region of Algeria. A total of 504 goat serum samples were collected from 77 herds, and serological analysis was performed using an indirect ELISA. The overall seroprevalence at the herd level was 35.06%, and 8.73% at the individual level. Herds with a history of abortions showed a high seropositivity rate of 88.9%. This research indicates the wide distribution of C. burnetii in goats in this region, suggesting the potential for zoonotic transmission to humans. Further studies and monitoring programs are essential to gain a comprehensive understanding of C. burnetii epidemiology in Algeria and to prevent or mitigate potential outbreaks. Awareness among practitioners and farmers is crucial to address this public health concern effectively.

AB  - Agricultural systems tend to be characterised by large diversity, therefore, solving socio-economic and environmental problems in agriculture requires targeted and contextualised policies. However, policies often fail to recognize this heterogeneity in their design or implementation. This can result in the use of sector-wide characteristics and, consequently, generic policies that are not tailored to specific farming systems. In this context, farm typologies can be a useful tool, as they help to identify differences and commonalities in highly heterogeneous groups. In this study, we focused on the Irish beef and sheep farming sectors and used a wide range of structural, socio-economic, and environmental indicators to develop a farm typology. This resulted in the identification of six distinct farm types: Small Cattle Farms, Extensive Sheep Farms, Medium-size Sheep Farms, Medium-size Cattle Farms, Medium-size Mixed Farms, and Intensive Cattle Farms. We then analysed the socio-economic and environmental performance of these six farm types and discussed the potential variation of the implementation and impact of currently proposed policies and interventions among farm types. We argue that failing to consider different farm types within policies can make their farm-level implementation unsuccessful and thus hinder the achievement of sector-wide sustainability goals. The approach we developed in this manuscript could also be applicable to other sectors and locations, and could help guide the design of more successful targeted policies.

AB  - Simple Summary In the freezing process of boar sperm, there are obvious differences in freezability between individuals. Studies suggest that specific freezability markers might be useful in good (GFE) and poor freezability ejaculate (PFE) selection prior to cryopreservation. Therefore, we performed UHPLC-qTOF-MS analysis to explore the difference in the metabolic level of seminal plasma between boars with differential freezability, and the results showed that the content of D-aspartic acid, N-acetyl-L-glutamate (NAG), and inosine were significantly different. These findings present new insights into the role of metabolism in sperm freezability and provide research directions for exploring potential biomarkers of freezability. Some potential markers of boar sperm freezability have been found in spermatozoa, but little attention has been paid to seminal plasma. The seminal plasma is composed of secretions from the testis, epididymis, and accessory sex glands. The exposure of spermatozoa to small molecules such as metabolites can affect sperm function. However, details and significance of the seminal plasma metabolome related to boar sperm freezability are unknown. Therefore, the main aim of this study was to explore the differences in the metabolic level of seminal plasma between boars with differential freezability and to explore the candidate biomarkers of semen freezability. A total of 953 metabolites were identified in boar semen plasma by UHPLC-qTOF-MS analysis, and 50 metabolites showed significant change between the GFE group and PFE group. Further, twelve metabolites were subjected to metabolic target analysis, and three metabolites (D-aspartic acid, N-acetyl-L-glutamate (NAG), and inosine) showed differences. In conclusion, there is significant difference in the metabolome of seminal plasma between GFE and PFE individuals. D-aspartic acid, NAG, and inosine in seminal plasma may be potential markers for assessing sperm cryopreservation resistance in boars.

AB  - Caseous lymphadenitis (CL) is an infectious disease clinically characterized by suppurative necrotic inflammation in superficial and internal lymph nodes and organs. This pathology is responsible for economic impacts in the sheep industry worldwide. In Morocco, where sheep farming is considered an important source of income for the rural population, CL causes significant economic losses to breeders due to the low prices and limited saleability of sheep showing superficial lesions. In this study, a 12-month longitudinal follow-up was carried out to evaluate the effect of seasons, the animals' age, sex, body score and shearing on the clinical incidence of CL, relapses and abscess location in sheep. As a result, both season and age showed significant effects on superficial CL incidence. A high incidence of CL in lambs and young sheep occurred between April and September, which coincided with the fattening periods and indoor housing. It appears promising to focus attention and preventive measures against CL on young animals during spring and summer to improve CL control strategies.
   Caseous lymphadenitis is an infectious disease that has a significant economic impact on sheep breeding. The objectives of this study were to evaluate the effect of season, animals' age, sex, body score and shearing on the clinical incidence of caseous lymphadenitis, relapses and abscess location in sheep from Settat province, Morocco. In this longitudinal study, 274 clinically healthy sheep were recruited in six flocks among 1451 inspected sheep and followed during 12 months to cover four seasons. The animals involved in this study were assigned to different age categories at continuous recruitment from February to July 2021 (lambs younger than 6 months, young sheep between 6 and 24 months and old sheep more than 24 months) and to sex categories. Selected animals were clinically examined every 2 months to detect superficial abscesses by palpation of superficial lymph nodes. Information about the number of abscesses and their locations was recorded and analyzed in multivariable statistical models. The results showed that 185/274 (67.5%) of the monitored animals developed superficial CL abscesses. The risk ratio (RR) of superficial CL was significantly higher between April and September compared to between January and March (RR similar to 4.4; p < 0.0001). No significant difference was found between October and December compared to between January and March (RR = 1.2; p = 0.64). Regarding the effect of age, the results revealed that the RR was significantly lower in old sheep compared to lambs (RR = 0.45, p < 0.0001). No significant difference was detected between lambs and young sheep (RR = 0.7, p = 0.07). The prevalence of caudally located abscesses (prefemoral and popliteal lymph nodes, as well as in testicles, scrotum and mammary glands) was significantly higher in old sheep than in lambs (20% versus 3%; odds ratio = 7.8, p = 0.02). The sex, body score and shearing since the last examination did not show any significant effect on CL incidence (p > 0.1). Abscess relapse was significantly lower in old sheep than in lambs (IRR = 0.4, p = 0.003). The highest clinical CL incidence was observed in young animals between April and September and was likely due to indoor intensive rearing management. To conclude, both season and age had significant effects on superficial CL incidence. Farmers, veterinarians and technicians should focus attention and preventive measures against CL on young animals during spring and summer.

AB  - Simple Summary Buffalo Mozzarella cheese from Campania is made from the fresh milk of the Italian Mediterranean buffalo. In 1996, thanks to its distinctive characteristics (specific environmental conditions and production method), Regulation (EC) No. 1107/96 recognized it as a Protected Designation of Origin product. The limited availability of milk and the increased demand for buffalo mozzarella cheese, especially during the spring-summer period (when milk production is lowest), have induced the use of frozen milk or curd for its production. The aim of this research was to provide preliminary results about the effect of freezing on microbial communities of fresh buffalo milk, curd and Buffalo Mozzarella cheese, and on physical properties (whiteness, hardness, and oxidation state) of Buffalo Mozzarella cheese. The preliminary results obtained have allowed us to conclude that the freezing process if properly carried out, does not compromise the microbiological quality of the products but produces only slight changes of some physical properties. Buffalo Mozzarella cheese from Campania is one of the most worldwide appreciated Italian dairy products. The increased demand for buffalo dairy products and the limited availability of the finest buffalo milk has prompted the diffusion of illicit practices, such as the use of milk, curd, or other products that are frozen or bought at low cost. The aim of this research was to provide preliminary results about the trend of the microbial communities of buffalo milk, curd and Buffalo Mozzarella cheese, during freezing storage of eleven months. At the same time, the alterations of physical properties and the presence of the molecular marker "gamma 4-casein", have been investigated. The results showed that freezing reduced the concentrations of the total bacterial count, Enterobacteriaceae, coliforms, Escherichia coli and yeasts in fresh milk and, the concentrations of the total bacterial count, coliforms, lactic acid bacteria and yeasts in mature curd. In the finished product, no notable decreases were observed, except for lactic acid bacteria. About the gamma 4-casein, no increase was observed in all matrices. These preliminary results allow us to conclude that the freezing process if properly carried out, does not compromise the microbiological quality and the physical properties of the Buffalo Mozzarella cheese.

AB  - Although the bushmeat trade is a significant component of the Anthropocene crisis in the tropics, the reliability of species-level identification is generally lacking from bushmeat surveys. We conducted a comprehensive study of 23 bushmeat markets in Cameroon and one seizure from a French airport using a multi-gene DNA-typing approach and a dedicated species-assignment pipeline (DNABUSHMEAT). We identified 39 species-level taxa from 318 collected bushmeat items, including nine Cetartiodactyla, six Carnivora, three Pholidota, seven Rodentia, 12 Primates, one Squamata and one Crocodilia. DNA-typing allowed detecting three species previously unreported from the Cameroonian trade and clarifying the status of taxa subject to cryptic diversity (rodents) and shallow diagnostic characters (small carnivores, antelopes and guenons). Only 7% of the samples could not be assigned to the species-level, including two guenons and one snake, because of fluctuant taxonomy and weak representation in nucleotide databases. Almost half (43%) of the morphological identifications were corrected or refined by our DNA-typing approach. Generalized linear models showed that smoked specimens and primates were significantly suffering from inaccurate species identification. We also observed that customs (Paris) and market-recruited assistants (Cameroon) peaked at very high rates of inaccurate species identifications (87 and 100%, respectively), calling for cautiousness when third parties are involved in bushmeat surveys. Overall, >50% of the bushmeat species traded in Cameroon were nationally protected. Because accurate species identification is a central component of conservation strategies, we posit that our DNA-typing approach is a valuable asset for improving the traceability of the domestic and international bushmeat trade.

AB  - This study evaluates the environmental impact assessment of sustainable pig farm via management of nutrient and co-product flows in the farm. Manure management and biogas production are among the most promising pathways towards fully utilizing organic waste within a circular bioeconomy as the most environmentally friendly solution mitigating gaseous emissions and producing bioenergy and high-quality bio-fertilizers. The concept of farm management includes rearing pig, growing all the feeds needed, and managing the nutrients and co-product flows in the farm. A consequential life cycle assessment (LCA) was performed to examine three scenarios in which all the generated manure is used as fertilizer for barley cultivation and mineral fertilizer is used where necessary (SC1); produced surplus straw is used for thermal energy generation and maize is used for sale, substituting maize biomass in the market (SC2); and all co-products are circulated in a closed system (SC3). The functional unit (FU) was defined as a "farm with 1000 fattening pigs at farm gate". The analysis showed that heat generation from wheat, barley and legumes straw has a significantly higher positive environmental impact than the use of these cereal straw for biogas production. The partial replacement of mineral fertilizers with digestate has positive environmental effects in terms of abiotic depletion, photochemical oxidation, terrestrial ecotoxicity, freshwater aquatic ecotoxicity, human toxicity, and marine aquatic ecotoxic aspects. The amount of digestate generated on a farm is not sufficient to completely eliminate the use of mineral fertilizers for plant fertilization. The generated pig manure (SC1) and digestate (SC2) is only enough for the fertilization of 8.3% of the total cultivated land of farm applying 22.9 t/ha rate.

AB  - Heavy metal residues in natural ecosystems have emerged as a significant global environmental problem requiring urgent resolution. Because these elements are non-biodegradable, organisms can accumulate excessive levels of heavy metal elements into their tissues. Previous studies suggest that prolonged exposure to heavy metal enrichment poses comprehensive toxicity to various organs in vertebrates. However, few studies have focused on elucidating the molecular mechanism underlying the hepatotoxic effects of heavy metal enrichment in Chiroptera. In this study, 10 Hipposideros armiger individuals were dissected from Yingde City (YD, relatively pollution-free) and Chunwan City (CW, excessive heavy metals emission). Environmental samples were also obtained. To investigate the mechanism of heavy metal toxicity in bat livers, we employed a combination of multi-omics, pathology, and molecular biology methods. Our results revealed significant enrichment of Cd and Pb in the bat livers and food sources in the CW group (P<0.05). Furthermore, prolonged accumulation of heavy metals disrupted hepatic transcription profiles associated with the solute carriers family, the ribosome pathway, ATP usage, and heat shock proteins. Excessive heavy metal enrichment also altered the relative abundance of typical gut microbe taxa significantly (P<0.05), inhibiting tight-junction protein expression. We observed a significant decrease in the levels of superoxide dismutase, glutathione peroxidase, and glutathione (P<0.05), along with elevated reactive oxygen species (ROS) density and malondialdehyde content following excessive heavy metal enrichment. Additionally, hepatic fat accumulation and inflammation injuries were present under conditions of excessive heavy metal enrichment, while the contents of metabolism biomarkers significantly decreased (P<0.05). Consequently, prolonged heavy metal enrichment can induce hepatotoxicity by disturbing the microbes-gut-liver axis and hepatic transcription modes, leading to a decrease in overall metabolic activity in bats. Our study offers strategies for biodiversity conservation and highlights the importance of addressing environmental pollution to raise public awareness.

AB  - Seed predation and dispersal by rodents plays an important role in seedling establishment and forest regeneration. Spatiotemporal variation in seed availability at fine scales is ubiquitous in the forest because of the different spatial locations and fruiting phenology among tree species, which may further lead to spatiotemporal variation in seed-rodent interactions. However, previous research has generally treated such variation as random effects among experimental replicates and provides few relevant explanations. Therefore, in this study, we directly tested the spatiotemporal variation in seed predation and dispersal at a fine-scale by manipulating a dynamic pattern of seed availability, releasing different species of seeds into the forest at 10 m intervals in space and 6 day intervals in time. In total, we tracked the dispersal and predation of 40,500 seeds belonging to 45 tree species in a subtropical forest in southwest China for three consecutive years. Our results provide strong evidence that fine-scale spatiotemporal variation in seed dispersal and predation by rodents always exists, although the overall intensity of seed harvest and removal significantly differs among experimental years and plots. Furthermore, the fine-scale spatiotemporal effect differs among plant species, indicating that the spatiotemporal effect may be species specific. Consequently, any specific seed may have the probability to survive or be dispersed as long as it appears at a specific site and time. Our findings further suggest that the fine-scale spatiotemporal variation in seed-rodent interactions may contribute to species coexistence in the forest, at least at the seed stage. Generally, we expect that similar fine-scale spatiotemporal variations occur in other plantanimal interactions, such as herbivory and pollination. Incorporating fine-scale spatiotemporal variation into future plant-animal studies may help us to gain a better understanding of species coexistence and biodiversity maintenance.

AB  - Heat stress negatively affects pig production by disrupting the immune homeostasis of Sertoli cells (SCs), which compromises sperm quality, culminating in male infertility. Herein, we aimed to study the mechanism by which the NLRP3 inflammasome is activated by heat stress through N6-methyladenosine (m6A) modification regulation in SCs. Initially, it was found that heat stress (44 degrees C, 30 min) markedly activated ERK1/2 signaling, which subsequently promoted NLRP3 inflammasome activation and inflammatory cytokine release from SCs. Then, using an m6A dot-blot assay, m6A sequencing, and methylated RNA immunoprecipitation, we found that heat stress augmented the level of m6A modification in SCs, and METTL3 augmented the m6A modification of mRNA encoding SOS Ras/Rho guanine nucleotide exchange factor 2 (SOS2), a key activator of the ERK pathway. Furthermore, YTHDF1 recognized and bound to the m6A-modified SOS2 mRNA to enhance its translation efficiency, ultimately triggering ERK1/2 signaling activation. In vivo experiments demonstrated that heat stress- induced decline in semen quality in mice was associated with elevated levels of m6A modifications in the testis and NLRP3 inflammasome activation. However, the damage caused by heat stress could be attenuated by intraperitoneal injection of S-Adenosylhomocysteine (SAH), a specific methyltransferase inhibitor. Our results emphasize the critical roles of m6A in regulating NLRP3 inflammasome activation under heat stress, identifying a novel therapeutic avenue to address heat stress.

AB  - Increased parental relatedness occurs in small wild populations and in closed colonies in captivity and reduces offspring fitness. A closed colony of Peromyscus maniculatus is maintained as genetically diverse stock at the Peromyscus Genetic Stock Center since 1963. Breeding records are available for all the years of breeding in captivity, which allows evaluation of the breeding performance since the inception of the stock. Kinship calculations showed that increased parental relatedness results in offspring loss, which is consistent with the operation of inbreeding depression and is common in small populations, both wild and captive. Nonetheless, an adaptive response was recorded that mitigated the adverse consequences of inbreeding and contributed to the long-term stability of the colony: When parental relatedness increased, more offspring were produced, resulting in the overall number of viable offspring being unaffected. The underlying mechanism involved adjustments in the interval for mating between related parents, causing the production of more litters. These adaptive changes indicate that the harmful consequences of inbreeding may be partially relieved by mechanisms involving changes in the animals' reproductive strategy. The availability of the breeding records of P. maniculatus enables the performance of additional studies asking different questions regarding the breeding dynamics of a closed colony under regulated conditions.

AB  - Historical contingency, such as the order of species arrival, can modify competitive outcomes via niche modification or pre-emption. However, how these mechanisms ultimately modify stabilising niche and average fitness differences remains largely unknown. By experimentally assembling two congeneric spider mite species feeding on tomato plants during two generations, we show that order of arrival affects species' competitive ability and changes the outcome of competition. Contrary to expectations, order of arrival did not cause positive frequency dependent priority effects. Instead, coexistence was predicted when the inferior competitor (Tetranychus urticae) arrived first. In that case, T. urticae colonised the preferred feeding stratum (leaves) of T. evansi leading to spatial niche pre-emption, which equalised fitness and reduced niche differences, driving community assembly to a close-to-neutrality scenario. Our study demonstrates how the order of species arrival and the spatial context of competitive interactions may jointly determine whether species can coexist.

AB  - Here we report the first record of the Marbeled spinefoot, Siganus rivulatus Forsskal and Niebuhr, 1775 (Acanthuriformes: Siganidae), collected in July 2022 from Maltese coastal waters. The specimen was identified through morphological characters and confirmed genetically through DNA barcoding, given that the family Siganidae is composed of several species belonging to only one genus with similar and overlapping morphological characters. Previous to this report, the closest record of S. rivulatus was off the island of Sicily. Thus, the presence of S. rivulatus in Maltese waters suggests that this species is expanding its distribution within the Mediterranean Sea. Additionally, this study compares this central Mediterranean record of S. rivulatus with genetic data of the Dusky spinefoot, Siganus luridus (Ruppell, 1829), a previously established species. Individual records of Siganus (rabbitfishes) are important to note, as they represent the first warning signs of a possible invasion. Previous work has shown that these species drastically alter the ecosystems of the Mediterranean region through their herbivorous diet and grazing behaviour. Therefore, we need to closely monitor for more individuals and establish mitigation measures against established and expanding populations of these two species.

AB  - Over the last decades, wolves have considerably expanded their distribution in Europe. Their range expansion even led to recolonizing densely human-populated countries such as Belgium and the Netherlands. The few available studies on the effects of returning wolves in these landscapes focus primarily on the behavioral responses of wild ungulates, such as deer. While livestock in intensive farming practices can be protected against wolves, free-ranging cattle in nature areas often have to protect themselves. How these cattle respond to the returned wolves is thus far unclear, yet highly relevant for conservation management. There is very little information about how free-ranging cattle respond to the re-appearance of wolves in terms of anti-predator behavior and ability to defend themselves. In June 2022, a newly established wolf pair was located in a natural area in Drenthe. This natural area is grazed year-round by free-ranging Galloway cattle, a small and hornless primitive breed commonly used in conservation management. Here, we reported on the behavioral responses of the herd following two wolf attacks that occurred at nighttime in April 2023, the first caught on wildlife cameras in the Netherlands. During these events, the Galloways showed a clear behavioral response: they became active, restless and vigilant, and showed grouping behavior, presumably to protect the calves. Chasing behavior towards the attacking wolf was even exhibited by some individuals. The reported attacks did not result in killed or injured cattle. These two well-documented wolf-cattle interactions show promising information as they highlight anti-predator behaviors from an unexperienced cattle breed, all within a year of the wolves' return. We broadly discuss the relevance of these findings for grazing management, including selection for breeds, anti-predator behaviors, and impact of herd structure and size, and we provide avenues for future research to address current knowledge gaps.

AB  - Several research papers over the past three decades have reported the profound influence of root herbivores on above-ground plant-insect interactions. Root-feeding insects significantly alter plant nutrient levelscarbon, nitrogen(N), phosphorus(P), and amino acids(AA)triggering the production of defensive compounds like terpenoids, phenolics, gossypol, and DIMBOA in shoots. Jasmonate translocation from roots to shoots impairs shoot herbivore performance, while root herbivory suppresses salicylic acid (SA)-mediated defenses, benefiting phloem feeders. Reduced leaf water content and increased abscisic acid (ABA) levels enhance phloem feeder success. Nematode infestations lower AA and N, but increase foliar nicotine, aiding leaf chewers. Mycorrhizal fungi reduce plant N but raise carbon and P, while earthworms increase phytosterols, hindering aphid fecundity. These systemic changes cascade through trophic levels, even affecting hyperparasitoids. This review highlights root herbivory's intricate, cascading effects, reshaping our understanding of plant defense mechanisms and ecological interactions.

AB  - Changes in phenology are a conspicuous fingerprint of climate change, leading to fears that phenological mismatches among interacting species will be a leading cause of population declines and extinction. We used quantile regression to analyze museum collection data and estimate changes in the phenological overlap of Baltimore checkerspot butterflies and 12 common nectar plant species over several decades in two geographic regions. We combined these museum data with field estimates of each species' flower density and nectar sugar production to estimate changes in resource availability caused by shifts in phenological overlap. Phenological overlap (measured as the proportion of plant flowering during the flight period of an average butterfly) decreased through time, primarily because the flowering period of nectar plants was longer, but the flight period of butterflies was shorter in recent years. Our study was also motivated by the hypothesis that phenological mismatches may be more severe in the southern region due to a midsummer dearth in floral resources, but this hypothesis was not supported by our data. Although phenological overlap was somewhat smaller in the southern region, changes in overlap through time were similar in both regions. When phenological overlap was weighted by nectar sugar production of different species, the overlap increased in the southern region but decreased in the northern region (the opposite of our prediction). Overall, nectar resources were much more abundant at study sites in our northern region than in our southern region, possibly due to differences in land management. Our study demonstrates the complexities of phenological mismatch of interacting species and highlights that phenological changes may have small impacts on population viability.

AB  - Rising temperatures may alter consumer diets through increased metabolic demand and altered resource availability. However, current theories assessing dietary shifts with warming do not account for a change in resource availability. It is unknown whether consumers will increase consumption rates or consume different resources to meet increased energy requirements and whether the dietary change will lead to associated variation in morphology and nutrient utilization. Here, we used populations of Gambusia affinis across parallel thermal gradients in New Zealand (NZ) and California (CA) to understand the influence of temperature on diets, morphology and stoichiometric phenotypes. Our results show that with increasing temperature in NZ, mosquitofish consumed more plant material, whereas in CA mosquitofish shifted towards increased consumption of invertebrate prey. In both regions, populations with plant-based diets had fuller guts, longer relative gut lengths, better-orientated mouths and reduced body elemental %C and N/P. Together, our results show multiple pathways by which consumers may alter their feeding patterns with rising temperatures, and they suggest that warming-induced changes to resource availability may be the principal determinant of which pathway is taken.

AB  - Increasing evidence suggests that artificial light at night (ALAN) can negatively impact organisms. However, most studies examine the impacts of ALAN on a single species or under high levels of artificial light that are infrequent or unrealistic in urban environments. We currently have little information on how low levels of artificial light emanating from urban skyglow affect plants and their interactions with herbivores. We examined how short-term, low levels of ALAN affect grass and insects, including growth rate, photosynthesis, and stomatal conductance in grass, and foraging behavior and survival in crickets. We compared growth and leaf-level gas exchange of Kentucky Bluegrass (Poa pratensis) under low-levels of ALAN (0.3 lux) and starlight conditions (0.001 lux). Furthermore, each light treatment was divided into treatments with and without house crickets (Acheta domesticus). Without crickets present, bluegrass grown under ALAN for three weeks grew taller than plants grown under natural night light levels. In the fourth week when crickets were introduced, grass height decreased resulting in no measurable effects of light treatment. There were no measurable differences in grass physiology among treatments. Our results indicate that low levels of light resulting from skyglow affect plant growth initially. However, with herbivory, the effects of ALAN on grass may be inconsequential. Gaining an understanding of how ALAN affects plant-insect interactions is critical to predicting the ecological and evolutionary consequences of anthropogenic light pollution.

AB  - The aim of our study was to investigate the effects of dietary supplementation with different protein levels after grazing on growth performance as well as on the proteomics of the LL muscle of Jersey-yak. The results showed that a certain amount of crude protein supplementation to Jersey-yak at the end of grazing significantly improved growth performance and increased their economic efficiency. In addition, we analyzed the proteomic differences in the longest dorsal muscle of Jersey-yak. From our analyses, we identified differences in the abundance of 434 proteins involved in pathways related to muscle growth and development and energy metabolism, among others. Several of the proteins enriched in these pathways, such as MYH8, are associated with myoblast development and differentiation as well as muscle development. In conclusion, the results of this study provide proteomic insights into the different feeding patterns of yak crossbred progeny, suggesting that a greater economic income can be achieved by improving their feeding conditions.
   Jersey-yak is a hybrid offspring of Jersey cattle and yak (Bos grunniens). Changing the feeding system of Jersey-yak can significantly improve its growth performance. In this study, tandem mass tag (TMT) proteomics technology was used to determine the differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) of the longissimus lumborum (LL) muscle of Jersey-yak fed different protein levels of diet. The results showed that compared with the traditional grazing feeding, the growth performance of Jersey-yaks was significantly improved by crude protein supplementation after grazing. A total of 3368 proteins were detected in these muscle samples, of which 3365 were quantified. A total of 434 DEPs were identified. Through analyses, it was found that some pathways related to muscle growth and development were significantly enriched, such as Rap1 signaling pathway, mTOR signaling pathway, and TGF-beta signaling pathway. A number of DEPs enriched in these pathways are related to muscle cell development, differentiation, and muscle development, including integrin subunit alpha 7 (ITGA7), myosin heavy chain 8 (MYH8), and collagen type XII alpha 1 chain (COL12A1). In conclusion, the results of this study provide insights into the proteomics of different feeding patterns of Jersey-yak, providing a stronger basis for further understanding the biological mechanism of hybrid varieties.

AB  - Mastitis is a global threat that challenges dairy farmers' economies worldwide. Sub-clinical mastitis (SCM) beholds the lion's share in it, as its visible clinical signs are not evident and are challenging to diagnose. The treatment of intramammary infection (IMI) demands antimicrobial therapy and subsequent milk withdrawal for a week or two. This context requires a non-invasive diagnostic tool like infrared thermography (IRT) to identify mastitis. It can form the basis of precision dairy farming. Therefore, the present study focuses on thermal imaging of the udder and teat quarters of Murrah buffaloes during different seasons to identify SCM and clinical mastitis (CM) cases using the Darvi DTL007 camera. A total of 30-45 lactating Murrah buffalo cows were screened out using IRT regularly throughout the year 2021-22. The IMI was further screened using the California mastitis test. The thermogram analysis revealed a significant difference (p < 0.01) in the mean values of the udder and teat skin surface temperature of Murrah buffaloes between healthy, SCM, and CM during different seasons. The mean values of udder skin surface temperature (USST) during different seasons ranged between 30.28 and 36.81 degrees C, 32.54 to 38.61 degrees C, and 34.32 to 40.02 degrees C among healthy, SCM, and CM-affected quarters. Correspondingly, the mean values of teat skin surface temperature (TSST) were 30.52 to 35.96 degrees C, 32.92 to 37.55 degrees C, and 34.51 to 39.05 degrees C, respectively. Further results revealed an increase (p < 0.01) in the mean values of USST during winter, summer, rainy, and autumn as 2.26, 4.04; 2.19, 3.35; 1.80, 3.21; and 1.45, 2.64 degrees C and TSST as 2.40, 3.99; 2.28, 3.26; 1.59, 3.09; and 1.68, 2.92 degrees C of SCM, CM-affected quarters to healthy quarters, respectively. The highest incidence of SCM was observed during autumn and CM during winter. Henceforth, irrespective of the seasons studied in the present study, IRT is an efficient, supportive tool for the early identification of SCM.

AB  - Camera traps are a popular tool in terrestrial wildlife research due to their low costs, easy operability, and usefulness for studying a wide array of species and research questions. The vast numbers of images they generate often require multiple human data extractors, yet accuracy and inter-observer variance are rarely considered. We compared results from 10 observers who processed the same set of multi-species camera trap images (n = 11,560) from seven sites. We quantified inter-observer agreement and variance for (1) the number of mammals identified, (2) the number of images saved, (3) species identification accuracy and the types of mistakes made, and (4) counts of herbivore groups and individuals. We analysed the influence of observer experience, species distinctiveness and camera location. Observers varied significantly regarding image processing rates, the number of mammals found and images saved, and species misidentifications. Only one observer detected all 22 mammals (range: 18-22, n = 10). Experienced observers processed images up to 4.5 times faster and made less mistakes regarding species detection and identification. Missed species were mostly small mammals (56.5%) while misidentifications were most common among species with low phenotypic distinctiveness. Herbivore counts had high to very high variances with mainly moderate agreement across observers. Observers differed in how they processed images and what they recorded. Our results raise important questions about the reliability of data extracted by multiple observers. Inter-observer bias, observer-related variables, species distinctiveness and camera location are important considerations if camera trapping results are to be used for population estimates or biodiversity assessments.

AB  - Several anthropogenic factors are responsible for the decline of Cystoseira sensu lato (hereafter Cystoseira) forests along Mediterranean coasts. Some Cystoseira species are already regionally extinct, and their decline has been widely recorded. Sustainable and efficient techniques for the restoration of Cystoseira are needed. In this context, the objectives of this study were i) to analyse the reproductive traits of three populations of Gongolaria barbata from three nearby donor sites in the northern Adriatic Sea, assessing the differences in their reproductive potential and reproductive success; and ii) to evaluate the outplanting success in terms of the effectiveness of G. barbata restoration, in relation to the different donor and receiving sites (Miramare MPA and in front of the Marine Biology Station Piran - MBSP) and implemented methods (ex situ and hybrid method combining a mesocosm cultivation and a suspended culture in the field). After 2 weeks of cultivation in mesocosms, half of the tiles with germlings were transported to the receiving sites and placed on suspended lantern nets (hybrid method), which were later (after 3 months) transferred to the seabed on concrete plates with protective cages. The remaining tiles were placed on the seabed on concrete plates with protective cages after a 4-week culture (ex situ method). At both sites, lantern nets and plates were randomly placed at 3 m depth. Thallus length was measured monthly in each treatment. Seedlings in suspended culture showed lower performance at the Miramare MPA, most likely due to the unfavourable environmental conditions. The satisfactory results obtained at MBSP demonstrate the efficiency of the hybrid method and confirm its potential to reduce the cost and time required for cultivation. Since unpredictable climatic events pose the greatest threat to restoration performance, these challenges must be considered when establishing new restoration practices. Moreover, herbivore regulation is extremely urgent and should be planned and implemented on a larger regional scale.

AB  - Arthropod herbivore assemblages are used to gain insight into questions about evolution, ecology, diversity, and conservation. However, determination at the species level of small arthropods may be challenging risking underestimating diversity. Here we suggest morphometric analyses as a supplementary determination method, and we demonstrate its use for a study of Chaitophorus species collected from Aspen trees (Populus tremula). Although sampled as one colony, the aphids represented three species. Rearing the species separately allowed us to get estimates characteristic of the developmental stages from each of the three species for morphometric comparisons. Recursive partitioning (RP) was used to create a decision tree for choice of morphometric parameters that with significance (p < 0.05) could determine the aphids by species and developmental stage; this insight could then be used as a key for determination. Eight of fifteen morphometric traits were selected by RP to be used in the key. Body length was responsible for nine splits and was consequently the more consistent morphometric trait used in the key.

AB  - Simple Summary Reintroductions are important tools to achieve the long-term conservation of endangered species; however, these projects are dangerous for translocated animals. Reintroduced animals face novel habitats where food availability and secure resting sites are unknown, and in this context, such animals likely engage in long exploratory movements. Furthermore, reintroductions can be dangerous for domestic and wild animals inhabiting the reintroduction site due to the potential risk of catching diseases carried by reintroduced animals. Our study aimed to evaluate the spatial behavior of reintroduced Corsican red deer in central-eastern Sardinia and, on the basis of the obtained results, build a species distribution model to forecast the expansion of reintroduced deer and plan future reintroduction projects. Furthermore, we evaluated the sanitary risk for domestic animals (sheep) linked to Bluetongue virus potentially carried by deer. Our results highlighted the great habitat suitability of central-eastern Sardinia for Corsican red deer. However, deer are healthy carriers of Bluetongue virus, as confirmed by health analyses we performed on captured animals in the source areas. Particular attention in reintroduction planning is needed to avoid any negative impacts on domestic or wild animals of conservation measures. The Corsican red deer is an endangered subspecies that needs artificial translocation projects to gain its complete recovery with the formation of viable, interconnected populations. Between 2007 and 2017, we performed two reintroduction projects in four sites in central-eastern Sardinia via tracking 32 deer by means of GPS/GSM radiotelemetry. On the basis of the obtained results, we built a species distribution model (SDM) using MaxEnt software, selecting 200 random points from the merged deer core areas as presence data. Furthermore, to evaluate the sanitary risk linked to artificial translocations, we analyzed deer positivity to Bluetongue virus (BTV) in the founder populations. The SDM showed a high deer capability to colonize central-eastern Sardinia, but it also showed the possibility of spreading BTV to domestic sheep because sanitary analyses confirmed the virus' presence in the founder populations. Our main conclusion was that reintroductions are effective tools for the long-term conservation of the Corsican red deer, as long as sanitary risks are minimized by means of sanitary monitoring of translocated deer.

AB  - Simple Summary New or revised techniques are being developed to improve management of expanding populations of invasive wild pigs. In southern Oklahoma, we set out to evaluate the success of various trap types: a conventional corral trap design, drop nets developed for capturing other wildlife, and recently developed suspended traps. Suspended traps removed 88.1% of the estimated population of wild pigs, whereas drop nets removed 85.7% and corral traps removed 48.5%. Suspended traps removed one pig for every 0.64 h invested in control, whereas drop nets had a 1.9 h investment per pig and corral traps had a 2.3 h investment per pig. Drop nets and suspended traps removed more of the wild pig population, mainly through whole sounder removal. The suspended trap required the least amount of time per pig removed because of real-time notifications and remote actuation from a cell phone. Drop nets and suspended traps offer greater control and time savings with the use of remote technology, making intensive, large-scale removal of pigs possible. Now, with commercially available technology, corral traps also can be configured to be user operated with real-time monitoring and trapping. Strategic control and eradication programs for wild pigs (Sus scrofa) are being developed to help curtail the expanding populations of this invasive, alien species. Drop nets and corral traps have a long history of capturing a multitude of wildlife species, so we evaluated the effectiveness and efficiency of these traps for controlling wild pigs in southern Oklahoma. We also developed and evaluated a suspended metal trap that provided real-time monitoring and deployment to capture animals. Effectiveness of each trap type was estimated as the proportion of pigs removed from the total population, whereas efficiency was calculated based on catch per unit effort (CPUE) (i.e., the number of person hours per pig removal). During 3 years of study (2010-2012), we removed 601 pigs, 296 using drop nets, 60 using corral traps, and 245 using suspended traps. Suspended traps removed 88.1% of the estimated population, whereas drop nets removed 85.7% and corral traps removed 48.5%. CPUE was 0.64 person hours/pig using suspended traps followed by 1.9 person hours/pig for drop nets and 2.3 person hours/pig for corral traps. Drop nets and suspended traps were more effective at removing a large proportion of the population (>85%), mainly through whole sounder removal, but the suspended trap with real-time notifications was the most efficient trap type, requiring fewer person hours to operate.

AB  - Glandular trichomes are well known to participate in plant chemical and physical defenses against herbivores, especially herbivorous insects. However, little is known about large-scale geographical patterns in glandular trichome occurrence. Herbivory pressure is thought to be higher at low elevations because of warmer and more stable climates. We therefore predicted a higher proportion of species with glandular trichomes at low elevations than at higher elevations. We compiled glandular trichome data (presence/absence) for 6,262 angiosperm species from the Hengduan Mountains (a global biodiversity hotspot in southwest China). We tested the elevational gradient (800-5,000 m a.s.l.) in the occurrence of plant species with glandular trichomes, and its correlations with biotic (occurrence of herbivorous insects) and abiotic factors, potentially shaping the elevational gradient in the occurrence of glandular trichomes. We found a significantly positive relationship between elevation and the occurrence of glandular trichomes, with the proportion of species having glandular trichomes increasing from 11.89% at 800 m a.s.l. to 17.92% at above 4,700 m. This cross-species relationship remained significant after accounting for phylogenetic relationships between species. Herbivorous insect richness peaked at mid-elevations and its association with the incidence of glandular trichomes was weak. Mean annual temperature was the most important factor associated negatively with glandular trichomes. Our results do not support the hypothesis that plant defenses decrease with increasing elevation. In contrast, a higher proportion of plant species with glandular trichome toward higher elevations is observed. Our results also highlight the importance of considering the simultaneous influences of biotic and abiotic factors in testing geographical variation in multifunctional plant defenses.

AB  - Abiotic resource limitation presents organisms with a dilemma about how to use resources when they become available. Characterizing how resource allocation affects investment in growth or defensive traits that affect organismal survival strategies allows us to understand the environmental contexts in which species interact. Our goal was to measure how macronutrient availability drives nitrogen and phosphorus allocation towards functional growth and defensive chemical traits of the Neotropical passion vine, Passiflora biflora. We investigated this question with a paired field study in La Selva, Costa Rica and a full factorial greenhouse experiment to determine whether the concentration of a key secondary chemical defence is driven by nitrogen availability. We correlated defensive chemical concentration with soil nitrogen availability in naturally occurring plants, measured the effects of nitrogen and phosphorus availability on growth and secondary chemical defence traits in the greenhouse and characterized the P. biflora leaf metabolome to assess how nutrient availability affected shifts in metabolism related to plant fitness. We found that nutrient allocation increased the magnitude of both growth and defence traits. Increased nitrogen availability resulted in higher concentrations of toxic leaf secondary chemicals, longer vines, greater biomass and more leaves with a superior ability to capture sunlight. In addition, plants from high nitrogen environments had metabolomes with significantly greater secondary metabolite richness and biochemical pathway diversity, as well as increases in the number of metabolites from several chemical classes related to basic cell function and defence. Nutrient availability had no significant effect on the richness and diversity of primary metabolites involved in basic cell functions. A direct comparison of the relative strength of quantitative growth and secondary defence traits indicated that P. biflora favours nutrient allocation to growth at low nitrogen levels but invests in both strategies more evenly as nitrogen availability increases. These findings lead us to predict that passion vines are better prepared to tolerate and resist herbivory when nutrients are plentiful and experience a trade-off between growth and chemical defence against natural enemies when they are scarce. These findings are consistent with both the 'escape' and 'defend' syndromes that are often used to describe tropical plant survival strategies. This is one of the only studies to measure nutrient allocation in vines, a group comprising a significant percentage of global plant diversity. Moreover, this work demonstrated the power of leveraging untargeted metabolomics to characterize how nutrient addition affects plant growth and defence, highlighting its potential for understanding functional trait variation.Read the free Plain Language Summary for this article on the Journal blog.
   La limitacion de recursos abioticos presenta a los organismos con un dilema sobre como utilizar los recursos cuando estan disponibles. Caracterizar como la asignacion de recursos afecta la inversion en rasgos de crecimiento o defensa que influyen en las estrategias de supervivencia de los organismos nos permite entender los contextos ambientales en los que interactuan las especies. Nuestro objetivo fue medir como la disponibilidad de macronutrientes afecta la asignacion de nitrogeno y fosforo hacia caracteristicas de crecimiento funcional y quimicos defensivos de la enredadera neotropical Passiflora biflora. Investigamos esta pregunta con un estudio de campo en La Reserva Biologica La Selva, Costa Rica, y un experimento de invernadero con factorial completo para determinar si la concentracion de una defensa quimica secundaria esta afectada por la disponibilidad de nitrogeno. Correlacionamos la concentracion de productos quimicos defensivos con la disponibilidad de nitrogeno en el suelo en plantas que ocurren naturalmente, medimos los efectos de la disponibilidad de nitrogeno y fosforo en el crecimiento y las caracteristicas de defensa quimica secundaria en el invernadero, y caracterizamos el metaboloma (perfil quimico total) de las hojas de P. biflora para observar como la disponibilidad de nutrientes afecto los cambios en el metabolismo relacionados con la defensa de la planta. Encontramos que la asignacion de nutrientes aumento la magnitud tanto de los caracteristicas de crecimiento como de defensa. Una mayor disponibilidad de nitrogeno resulto en concentraciones mas altas de productos quimicos secundarios toxicos en las hojas, en endredederas mas largas, mayor masa y hojas con una capacidad superior para capturar la luz solar. Ademas, las plantas crecidas con alto contenido de nitrogeno tenian metabolomas con una riqueza de metabolitos secundarios significativamente mayor y una mayor diversidad de vias bioquimicas, asi como un aumento en el numero de metabolitos de varias clases quimicas relacionadas con la funcion celular basica y la defensa. La disponibilidad de nutrientes no tuvo un efecto significativo en la riqueza y diversidad de metabolitos primarios involucrados en funciones celulares basicas. Una comparacion directa de la fuerza relativa de los caracteristicas de crecimiento y defensa secundaria indico que P. biflora prefiere la asignacion de nutrientes al crecimiento en niveles bajos de nitrogeno, pero invierte en ambas estrategias de manera mas igual a medida que aumenta la disponibilidad de nitrogeno. Estos resultados nos llevan a predecir que las Passiflora estan mejor preparadas para tolerar y resistir el herbivorismo cuando los nutrientes son abundantes, y tienen un intercambio entre el crecimiento y la defensa quimica contra los enemigos naturales cuando los nutrients son pobres. Estos resultados son consistentes tanto con los sindromes de 'escape' y 'defence' que muchos utilizan para describir las estrategias de supervivencia de las plantas tropicales. Este es uno de los pocos estudios que miden la asignacion de nutrientes en enredaderas, un grupo que tiene un porcentaje grande de la diversidad vegetal global. Ademas, este trabajo demostro el poder de aprovechar la metabolomica para caracterizar como la adicion de nutrientes afecta el crecimiento y la defensa de las plantas, mostrando su potencial para entender la variacion en los caracteristicas funcionales.

AB  - Highly competitive and aggressive ant species are efficient bodyguards that monopolize the more attractive plants bearing extrafloral nectaries. Given that herbivory often increases the quality of extrafloral nectar, we hypothesized that plants damaged by herbivory would be more prone to interact with high-quality ant bodyguards and be better defended against herbivores. We performed an experiment with Chamaecrista nictitans plants. We induced anti-herbivore responses by applying jasmonic acid to a group of plants while keeping another group unmanaged. We measured extrafloral nectar production, censused ants visiting extrafloral nectaries and, subsequently, added herbivore mimics to measure the efficiency of ant anti-herbivore defence in both conditions. Induction increased the volume of extrafloral nectar and the mass of sugar per nectary without affecting the sugar concentration or the patterns of plant attendance and defence by ants. Thus, we found no evidence that defence-induced C. nictitans plants are more prone to interact with high-quality bodyguards or to receive better anti-herbivore defence. These findings highlight that increases in extrafloral nectar production are not always rewarded with increases in the biotic defences; instead, these rewards might be dependent on the traits of the nectar induced by herbivory events and/or on the ecological context in which the interaction is embedded. Consequently, herbivory might increase the costs of this induced biotic defence to plants bearing extrafloral nectaries when the induced defence does not increase the attractiveness of the plants to ants.

AB  - The scenarios discussing the evolution of the spatiotemporal cognitive abilities of vagile plant eaters generally assume that their movement strategies are linked to their cognitive abilities, which are themselves shaped by the distribution patterns of plants considered invariant over long time periods. Yet, if plant distribution patterns are likely to remain unchanged over short time periods, they may change over long time periods as a result of animal exploitation. In particular, animals can shape the environment by dispersing plant seeds. Using an agent-based model simulating the foraging behaviour of a seed disperser endowed with spatiotemporal knowledge of resource distribution, I investigated whether resource spatiotemporal patterns could be influenced by the level of spatiotemporal cognition involved in foraging. This level of spatiotemporal cognition represented how well the agent predicted resource locations and phenology. I showed that seed-dispersing agents moving based on spatiotemporal memory could affect resource distribution on the long-term through routine movements between known patches, with a larger effect the higher the level of spatiotemporal cognition. The level of engineering also resulted from the conjunction of two additional forces: the agents' movement strategy (e.g. including opportunistic visits to plants encountered en route or not) and the competition for space between plants. In turn, resource landscape modifications affected the benefits of spatiotemporal memory. This could create eco-evolutionary feedback loops between animal spatiotemporal cognition and the distribution patterns of plant resources. Combined with previous works, the results emphasise that spatiotemporal cognition is a cause and a consequence of resource heterogeneity.

AB  - Termites can regulate the environment, including temperature and humidity, within their nests. In this study, we investigated the impact of environmental factors such as soil humidity, temperature, soil pH, and relative humidity on the ratio of workers to soldiers and the wood utilization rate of Coptotermes gestroi from their foraging activities. An environmental gauge was used three times every two weeks during inspections to monitor temperature and humidity parameters. The total number of termites was also counted from active aboveground and inground monitoring stations. Among the counted termites, the worker-to-soldier ratio was determined. This study found significant correlations between the number of termite workers and soldiers and humidity (Pearson correlation (r) = -1.000). Humidity affected the termites' total wood consumption (r = -0.814) and the total number of workers (r = -7.92) and soldiers (r = 0.792). Temperature also affected the total number of workers (r = 0.718) and soldiers (r = -0.718). Compared to soil pH and moisture, temperature and humidity had positive effects on the overall worker-to-soldier ratio during foraging activity, with a significant impact on termite abundance and the wood consumption. By exploiting these parameters, the efficacy of termite treatments could be greatly improved in the future.

AB  - The artificial selection of traits in wildlife populations through hunting and fishing has been well documented. However, despite their rising popularity, the role that artificial selection may play in non-extractive wildlife activities, for example, recreational feeding activities, remains unknown. If only a subset of a population takes advantage of human-wildlife feeding interactions, and if this results in different fitness advantages for these individuals, then artificial selection may be at work. We have tested this hypothesis using a wild fallow deer population living at the edge of a capital city as our model population. In contrast to previous assumptions on the randomness of human-wildlife feeding interactions, we found that a limited non-random portion of an entire population is continuously engaging with people. We found that the willingness to beg for food from humans exists on a continuum of inter-individual repeatable behaviour; which ranges from risk-taking individuals repeatedly seeking and obtaining food, to shyer individuals avoiding human contact and not receiving food at all, despite all individuals having received equal exposure to human presence from birth and coexisting in the same herds together. Bolder individuals obtain significantly more food directly from humans, resulting in early interception of food offerings and preventing other individuals from obtaining supplemental feeding. Those females that beg consistently also produce significantly heavier fawns (300-500 g heavier), which may provide their offspring with a survival advantage. This indicates that these interactions result in disparity in diet and nutrition across the population, impacting associated physiology and reproduction, and may result in artificial selection of the begging behavioural trait. This is the first time that this consistent variation in behaviour and its potential link to artificial selection has been identified in a wildlife population and reveals new potential effects of human-wildlife feeding interactions in other species across both terrestrial and aquatic habitats.

AB  - Previous studies have shown that low doses of ketamine, an N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor antagonist, produce aberrantly strong internal representations of associatively activated but absent stimuli in humans and nonhuman animals, suggesting the validity of ketamine treatment as a preclinical model of the positive symptoms of schizophrenia, including hallucinations and delusions. However, whether acute ketamine treatment also impairs the ability to ignore present but informationally redundant stimuli, which is another hallmark of schizophrenia, remains unclear. Accordingly, the present study investigated whether injections of low-dose ketamine attenuate Kamin blocking in an appetitive conditioning preparation in mice. Mice in the blocking group were initially trained with A+ conditioning (i.e., conditioned stimulus A paired with a sucrose solution), followed by compound AX+ training, before the conditioned responses to the cue X were tested in extinction. The animals in the control group received B+ training before the AX+ training. Half of the mice in each group received an injection of 16 mg/kg ketamine before each compound conditioning session and the extinction test, whereas the other half received saline. The results showed a reliable blocking effect in the saline-treated mice, whereas the blocking effect was absent in the ketamine-treated mice. Specifically, the absence of blocking was due to the ketamine-treated mice learning about the blocked cues. This finding further validates the use of low-dose ketamine as a preclinical model of schizophrenia. It also suggests a possible link between hallucination-like aberrant processing of absent events and a reduced ability to suppress attentional processing of task-irrelevant stimuli.

AB  - The diffusion of fission products in intact TRISO particles depends on particle geometry, fission product source rates, time, temperature, and temperature-dependent diffusion coefficients. Simulating this diffusion process requires models for source rates and diffusion coefficients, plus a computation of the temperature field if not prescribed. In addition, the simulation quality depends on the discretization of the geometry, appropriate time stepping, and the accuracy of the solution method.
   In this paper, we explore the simulation of fission product diffusion in TRISO fuel particles using the finite element method via the fuel performance code BISON. Recent material model development has occurred in BISON for each material present in tri-structural isotropic (TRISO) fuel particles: the buffer, inner pyrolytic carbon, silicon carbide, and outer pyrolytic carbon layers, as well as the fuel kernel. Also, new mesh generation and fission product release fraction capabilities have been added.
   Diffusion capabilities are shown to converge to the correct solution via formal verification tests. A large number of code benchmarking problems are also given, with good results, showing that BISON's computed release fractions closely match those of other software tools. Finally, a significant validation effort is detailed in which fission product release, measured as part of the AGR-1 capsule experiments, is compared to BISON outputs. BISON outputs compare favorably to the experimental data and to PARFUME results.

AB  - ABS T R A C T Insects in agroecosystems contend with many stressors - e.g., chemicals, heat, nutrient deprivation - that are often en-countered at low levels. Exposure to mild stress is now well known to induce hormetic (stimulatory) effects in insects, with implications for insect management, and ecological structure and function in agroecosystems. In this review, we examine the major ecological niches insects occupy or guilds to which they belong in agroecosystems and how hormesis can manifest within and across these groups. The mechanistic underpinnings of hormesis in insects are starting to become established, explaining the many phenotypic hormetic responses observed in insect reproduction, development, and behavior. Whereas potential effects on insect populations are well supported in laboratory experi-ments, field-based hypothesis-driven research on hormesis is greatly lacking. Furthermore, because most ecological paradigms are founded within the context of communities, entomological agroecologists interested in hormesis need to 'level up' and test hypotheses that explore effects on species interactions, and community structure and func-tioning. Embedded in this charge is to continue experimentation on herbivorous pest species while shifting more focus towards insect natural enemies, pollinators, and detritivores - guilds that play crucial roles in highly functioning agroecosystems that have been understudied in hormesis research. Important areas for future insect agroecology re-search on hormesis are discussed.

AB  - Antlers are formed anew each year to realise an optimal relationship between their size and weight and the physical body condition in Cervidae. This results in the objective to match fighting abilities with size and mechanical performance of the antlers, as well as to advertise these correlated abilities to other males and females. The resulting variation in individual antler characteristics from year to year can show considerable differences. To characterise and understand these differences is important in hunting, game management and deer breeding, as well as potentially to assess the habitat quality. However, relatively few traits of the antler have been scientifically tested for this purpose, and only a few studies were conducted on the same individual in free-ranging red deer over the years. The objective of the present study was to quantify the influence of the individual (repeatability), the age and the site on the expression of 125 antler characteristics. For this purpose, we collected 35 stags with an average of about 10 consecutive antlers per individual (confirmed by genetic analysis), a total of 355 antlers. The antlers were scanned 3-dimensionally and measured semi-automatically. Numbers, lengths, distances, circumferences, bending, curvatures, angles, forms and CIC (International Council for Game and Wildlife Conservation) characteristics were compiled and evaluated in a generalised linear mixed model adapted to the distribution of the characteristics. The complete model explained 1.6 to 83% of character variation. Mean repeatability of the characteristics varied between 2.7 and 74.4%. The stags' age explained 0 to 36.4%, and the side explained 0 to 2.5% of the variability. Some characteristics of burr, signet, beam and the lower tines reached the highest repeatability; the highest variability was found in characteristics of the crown. Values of 11 features that are frequently used in other studies corresponded very well with the present study. However, some features reached higher repeatability every year, whereas others varied more closely with age. Such characteristics might be selectively included into further research or practical applications to increase informative value.

AB  - One of the main constraints for sheep production in tropical and subtropical areas is the lack of knowledge of how to manage erect tropical grasses for lambs. The objective of this study was to assess the effect of pasture height and structure of an erect tropical grass, Aruana Guinea grass (Megathyrsus maximus cv. IZ-5) on the intake and performance of young weaned lambs. The experiment was repeated in two consecutive years. Thirty young weaned lambs were equally assigned, each year, to three pasture heights: (1) Tall 75 cm; (2) Medium 50 cm and (3) Short 25 cm. Herbage mass (HM), pasture height, plant morphological composition, pasture nutritional quality, lambs' average daily gain, gain per hectare and herbage intake were measured. The Short treatment had higher (p < 0.05) leaf:stem ratio (L:S; 2.6 & PLUSMN; 0.27) and average daily gain (ADG; 92 & PLUSMN; 10 g day(-1)) than the Tall treatment (0.9 & PLUSMN; 0.11 and 40 & PLUSMN; 13 g, respectively). The Medium treatment showed intermediate ADG (69 & PLUSMN; 11 g) and L:S ratio (1.4 & PLUSMN; 0.09). The height of the pasture affects the rate at which the number of stems increases relative to the number of leaves. There was a significant interaction between treatment and period (summer and early autumn) for herbage intake. Intake decreased markedly on the Tall treatment from the first to the second period. This study showed that for a better performance of weaned young lambs during summer-autumn, it is important to maintain tropical swards at a short height (25 cm). However, if the grass height exceeds this condition, the use of cattle or a mower are good options to maintain the sward height.

AB  - Simple Summary The European bison is a dramatically low-diversified species, commonly analyzed using cattle-dedicated tools. Our aim was to compare two genotyping-by-sequencing (GBS) pipelines: de novo and reference pipeline, using the STACKS software and to reveal the maximum possible number of species-specific SNPs for our further project on European bison health. Therefore, we compared two genotyping-by-sequencing (GBS) pipelines: de novo (non-reference based) and a reference-based, using the STACKS software. We found a higher number of polymorphic loci from the reference pipeline in comparison to the de novo one. Next, we compared the results of the reference pipeline for the draft genome of European bison and completely annotated the Bos taurus genome. Higher numbers of polymorphic loci were revealed in European bison than in Bos taurus through the reference pipeline. We observed a possible effect of PCR duplicates on GBS data, as previously reported with the RADSeq approach. We recommend using a reference pipeline without PCR duplicates as a more efficient tool for species with low genetic diversity. The European bison is a non-model organism; thus, most of its genetic and genomic analyses have been performed using cattle-specific resources, such as BovineSNP50 BeadChip or Illumina Bovine 800 K HD Bead Chip. The problem with non-specific tools is the potential loss of evolutionary diversified information (ascertainment bias) and species-specific markers. Here, we have used a genotyping-by-sequencing (GBS) approach for genotyping 256 samples from the European bison population in Bialowieza Forest (Poland) and performed an analysis using two integrated pipelines of the STACKS software: one is de novo (without reference genome) and the other is a reference pipeline (with reference genome). Moreover, we used a reference pipeline with two different genomes, i.e., Bos taurus and European bison. Genotyping by sequencing (GBS) is a useful tool for SNP genotyping in non-model organisms due to its cost effectiveness. Our results support GBS with a reference pipeline without PCR duplicates as a powerful approach for studying the population structure and genotyping data of non-model organisms. We found more polymorphic markers in the reference pipeline in comparison to the de novo pipeline. The decreased number of SNPs from the de novo pipeline could be due to the extremely low level of heterozygosity in European bison. It has been confirmed that all the de novo/Bos taurus and Bos taurus reference pipeline obtained SNPs were unique and not included in 800 K BovineHD BeadChip.

AB  - The ex-situ propagation of the Malayan tapir in Malaysia is an important conservation strategy to increase the population of this endangered species. However, the scarcity of reproductive physiology studies impedes potential conservation efforts. This study aimed to investigate the expression of estrus signs through observation of estrus behaviour and vulva score in captive Malayan tapirs. This study was conducted from January to April at the Sungai Dusun Wildlife Conservation Centre, Selangor, Malaysia. A total of five female Malayan tapirs aged between 3 to 18 years old were involved in this study. Two of the tapirs were kept with a male partner, while three others were kept individually. Closed-circuit television (CCTV) cameras with night vision and audio recording function connected to a digital video recorder were used to record the female activity from 1930 to 0730 hours. The recorded videos were evaluated for estrus behaviour such as vocalisation, flehmen response, urine spraying and excretion smelling. The vulva score (scale of 0 to 4) was determined based on the vulva size and the presence of discharge. The most common estrus behaviour observed in the female Malayan tapirs was vocalisation (81%), followed by flehmen response (10%), urine spraying (5%) and excretion smelling (4%). The paired females were observed to exhibit more estrus behaviours than the non-paired females. Vulva changes were observed in both groups with evidence of cyclic pattern with an average median length of 31.0 days (range of 28 days to 33 days). Mann-Whitney U test revealed difference between and non for vocalisation and urine spraying. Meanwhile, Spearman's rho test showed a strong positive correlation between vulva score and flehmen response and very strong positive correlation between vulva score and excretion smelling. This study provides important information for the establishment of future captive propagation programmes.

AB  - Caprine paratuberculosis (PTB) is a progressive, debilitating and production-limiting disease that causes significant economic losses and raises public health concerns. The goal was to study active surveillance and associated epidemiological risk factors of caprine PTB in selected district of Odisha, India. The 818 goats of various ages, sexes and breeds were randomly screened in ten different districts for a year based on history, clinical signs and fecal smear examination using the Ziehl-Neelsen stain, yielding an overall prevalence of 38.75%, with clinical and sub-clinical PTB at 8.06 and 30.68%, respectively. A molecular tool, IS900 polymerase chain reaction, was also used to confirm the disease. With Mycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis (MAP) bacilli and endoparasite infections, the majority of affected goats (69.08%) were low shedders. Puri coastal district had the highest prevalence (52.29%) followed by Sambalpur (48.61%), while Khordha had the lowest prevalence (26.41%). Caprine PTB was more common in goats over 2 years old (51.23%), in the Ganjam breed (42.30%), in females (39.17%) and in goats housed on earthen floors (55.83%) according to chi-square analysis. The current study concluded that higher (30.68%) observations of subclinical PTB were cause of real concern due to its insidious spread as well as its zoonotic significance with potential human consequences, which requires immediate attention at all levels. Because of the public health importance of this hidden killer disease, the current findings would be useful in developing a roadmap for implementing prevention and control policies, prompting provision for adequate funding with elaborative research.

AB  - Different light intensities in cerrado stricto sensu (CSS) and semideciduous seasonal forests (SSF) can result in distinct morphological responses among woody species. This research evaluated the size and bud composition, budbreak time, and crown architecture of woody species in response to precipitation and varying light intensities in these two environments. The study was conducted in CSS (19 degrees 57 ' 29 '' S and 44 degrees 25 ' 29 '' W) and an SSF fragment (19 degrees 53 ' 84 '' S and 44 degrees 25 ' 56 '' W) in Minas Gerais, Brazil. The research focused on four species: Miconia albicans and Xylopia aromatica, which occur in both environments, as well as Bauhinia cfr. ungulata (CSS) and B. cfr. rufa (SSF). Shoots from the main axis were manually dissected, and budbreak times were recorded. Crown architecture was evaluated based on diagrams of the vegetative above-ground structure, excluding leaves. Light intensities was measured with a luxmeter at the crown's apex, interior, and base. Shoots were larger and had more preformed organs in CSS than in SSF trees. Trichomes were observed on shoots of all CSS and SSF trees. The number of cataphylls varied: B. cfr. ungulata had one, B. cfr. rufa had 1-3, while compound buds of X. aromatica averaged 5.4 in CSS and 3.7 in SSF. Simple buds of X. aromatica and all M. albicans buds lacked cataphylls. Budbreak occurred in September for M. albicans (CSS and SSF), October for B. cfr. ungulata, Juy-October for X. aromatica and August-October for B. cfr. rufa. A positive correlation between budbreak and rainfall was recorded only for B. cfr. ungulata. Despite differences in bud size and composition between environment, these didn't result in distinct crown architectures. The findings highlight that tropical woody species with cataphyll-protected buds are as common as in temperate regions. Further research is needed to explore phylogenetic traits and the ecological role of cataphylls in tropical species.

AB  - Fire ecology has a long history of empirical investigation in rangelands. However, the science is inconclusive and incomplete, sparking increasing interest on how to advance the discipline. Here, we introduce a new framework for qualitatively and quantitatively understanding the ranges of variability in fire regimes typical of experimental investigations in rangeland fire science compared with the range of conditions that actually occurred during contemporary social-ecological times. We implement this framework for one of rangelands' most pyrogenic systemsdthe Great Plains of North America. We identify four social-ecological fire eras that have epitomized people's relationship with wildland fire in the Great Plains since the last glacial maxima. These cultural fire eras include the now-extinct coexistence era (indigenous fire use), the suppression era (extermination of wildland fire occurrence), the shadow era (localized prescribed burning groups), and the emerging wildfire era (resulting from wildland fire management failures, continued decoupling of human-fire ignitions, and global change). Our synthesis demonstrates that experimental fire conditions have not explored the types and ranges of variation in fire regime components responsible for shaping rangeland vegetationdnow, in the past, or into the future. Instead, scientific investigations have focused largely on controlling and minimizing sources of uncertainty and experimental variation, essentially eliminating ranges of variation that underpin the functioning of fire in modern social-ecological systems. Yet a series of scientific investigations exist that targeted a wider range of variability in fire regime components, leading to major advancements and the rejection of a number of long-standing rules of thumb in rangeland science and management. These include 1) the manipulation of fire return interval, 2) the pyric herbivory experiments, and 3) the extreme fire trials. We discuss the general philosophy shared among these studies, introduce scientific standards needed to avoid common pitfalls, and highlight opportunities to better understand how rangeland pattern and process correspond to critical ranges of variation in the humanfire relationship.

AB  - Wide-Area Larviciding techniques (WALSTM) using aqueous suspensions of Bacillus thuringiensis israelensis and various types of mist sprayers have typically been employed against container-inhabiting species of mosquitoes such as Aedes albopictus and Ae. aegypti in urban peridomestic environments. However, relatively little work has been done to examine the use of WALS-applied aqueous suspensions of Lysinibacillus sphaericus (Ls) against susceptible species of mosquitoes in larger natural habitats such as forest pools, floodwaters, and marshes. This study characterized the spray of an aqueous suspension of VectoLex (R) WDG (Ls) dispersed with a Buffalo Turbine (R) Mist Sprayer retrofitted with a Micronair rotary atomizer. The results indicate that when VectoLex WDG is applied similarly to traditional urban WALS methodologies, this material is highly effective at reducing larval mosquito populations in areas holding floodwater (an average 88.5% reduction over 6 wk).

AB  - The lipid oleoylethanolamide (OEA) has been shown to affect reward-related behavior. However, there is limited experimental evidence about the specific neurotransmission systems OEA may be affecting to exert this modulatory effect. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of OEA on the rewarding properties of cocaine and relapse-related gene expression in the striatum and hippocampus. For this purpose, we evaluated male OF1 mice on a cocaine-induced CPP procedure (10 mg/kg) and after the corresponding extinction sessions, we tested drug-induced reinstatement. The effects of OEA (10 mg/kg, i.p.) were evaluated at three different timepoints: (1) Before each cocaine conditioning session (OEA-C), (2) Before extinction sessions (OEA-EXT) and (3) Before the reinstatement test (OEA-REINST). Furthermore, gene expression changes in dopamine receptor D1 gene, dopamine receptor D2 gene, opioid receptor mu, cannabinoid receptor 1, in the striatum and hippocampus were analyzed by qRT-PCR. The results obtained in the study showed that OEA administration did not affect cocaine CPP acquisition. However, mice receiving different OEA treatment schedules (OEA-C, OEA-EXT and OEA-REINST) failed to display drug-induced reinstatement. Interestingly, the administration of OEA blocked the increase of dopamine receptor gene D1 in the striatum and hippocampus caused by cocaine exposure. In addition, OEA-treated mice exhibited reduced striatal dopamine receptor gene D2 and cannabinoid receptor 1. Together, these findings suggest that OEA may be a promising pharmacological agent in the treatment of cocaine use disorder.

AB  - Climate change is now unequivocal and influences crops and the incidence of insect pests. Understanding the spatially variable, species-specific, and complex effects of climate change is essential in developing an appropriate pest management strategy. The two dimensions of climate change i.e., elevated temperature (eTemp.) and elevated CO2 (eCO(2)) influence insect herbivores. In the present study, the growth and development of an invasive insect pest, fall armyworm, Spodoptera frugiperda (J E Smith) (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae) on maize at eCO(2) and eTemp conditions using CO2 and temperature Gradient Chambers (CTGC) was estimated. Dilution of bio-chemical constituents was noted with lower leaf nitrogen (9%-14%), higher carbon (3%-11%), higher C : N (18%-26%), and higher tannins (13%) in maize foliage at eCO(2)+eTemp levels. A significant influence on primary parameters of insect viz., higher total consumption by larvae (38%), extended larval duration (13%) with increased larval weights (17%), and differential pupal weights (14%) in successive generations was recorded at eCO(2) + eTemp compared to ambient. Their effect was continued on various insect performance indices also, with higher relative consumption rate, RCR (40%), lower relative growth rate, RGR (11%), and varied approximate digestibility (AD), the efficiency of conversion of ingested food (ECI) and digested food (ECD) of S frugiperda larvae. The interactive effect of eCO(2) and eTemp led to a higher Potential Population Increase Index (PPII) (19%) due to higher fecund adults. The effect of eCO(2) offsets the impact of eTemp when interacting together on some of the insect parameters. The present results indicate that eCO(2) and eTemp play a key role in influencing the growth and development of S frugiperda indicating higher pest incidence in future climate change periods.

AB  - The present research is aimed to evaluate the diverse husbandry practices, ethno-veterinary practices, socio-economic status and distressing constraints of camel pastoralists inhabiting desert (Thal) areas of Pakistan, where they maintain herds of Marecha and Barela dromedaries in extensive production regimes. For this purpose, 200 pastoralists were selected at random to fill out an on-site questionnaire. According to the farmers' responses, it was perceived that their living status had improved in the last decades due to the progressive optimization of camel productivity and herdsmen responsiveness. In contrast, calf mortality rates, some traditional husbandry practices and the lack of market investments continued to be the major constraints affecting camel overall production. Ethno-veterinary medicines are widely applied as primary health care, thus influencing the general health, production potentials and relief of camels in the study region. With this scenario, concerned stakeholders and authorized institutions must re-evaluate the urgent needs of indigenous communities; their education and husbandry skills to promote economic/ financial support in low-income remote areas. In turn, traditional communities will be adapted to the changing socio-economic and cultural values with regard to camel husbandry and welfare. Current societal perceptions and demands within this livestock production industry, where camels are conceived as a sustainable food security animal, if accomplished to the highest possible extent, will increase effectiveness of the camel value chain and breeders' quality of life will be noticeably enhanced. However, this success could be multiplied if government may devise community education, veterinary cover, marketing facilitates and interest-free small loans for pastoralists.

AB  - In recent years, due to the destruction of the culture environment and serious ecological pressure, especially in the process of culture, residual bait, faeces and fishery drug abuse will lead to the accumulation of harmful metabolites such as ammonia nitrogen and nitrite, and biological denitrification is the most economical and effective method to remove the single. Therefore, in this study, a nitrite removal strain XA19 was isolated and screened from a shrimp biofloc culture pond. This strain was identified as a clade of Vibrio proteolyticus because the homology between XA19 and V. proteolyticus WDVP was as high as 99.86% by using 16S rDNA gene sequence analysis and NCBI database comparison. Scanning electron microscopy images showed that V. proteolyticus is short-rod-shaped with a curved body and no budding spores, pods and flagella. Antimicrobial susceptibility test proved that V. proteolyticus was resistant to ampicillin, oxacillin, penicillin, vancomycin and clindamycin. In the median lethal concentration 50 (LC50) test, at 7-day post-infection (dpi), LC50 of V. proteolyticus for Fenneropenaeus merguiensis was 1.69 x 10(4) CFU/mL. Transcriptome sequencing analysis was carried out on hepatopancreas of F. merguiensis at 24 and 48 hpi. A total of 176 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were screened at 24 hpi, including 104 up-regulated DEGs and 72 down-regulated DEGs, and a total of 52 DEGs were screened at 48 hpi, including 32 up-regulated DEGs and 20 down-regulated DEGs. In the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment analysis of DEGs, many immune-related signalling pathways were significantly enriched, including Hippo signalling pathway, phagosome, Toll and Imd signalling pathways and Wnt signalling pathway. In addition, some pathways related to Warburg effect were also enriched, including Glycolysis/Gluconeogenesis, Biosynthesis of amino acids, amino sugar and nucleotide sugar metabolism and so on. In this study, the toxicity and drug sensitivity of V. proteolyticus were systematically studied, and the immune response of hepatopancreas of F. merguiensis to V. proteolyticus infection was preliminarily revealed from the molecular level. The results may provide a reference for the prevention and control of V. proteolyticus.

AB  - We used stable isotopes to investigate isotopic niche size, overlap, and diet composition in green (black and yellow morphotype Chelonia mydas; 50.0 to 95.0 cm curved carapace length, CCL) and hawksbill turtles (Eretmochelys imbricata; 38.5 to 83.0 cm CCL) in a recently described foraging habitat in North Pacific Costa Rica. We measured whole blood stable carbon (delta C-13) and nitrogen (delta N-15) ratios in black (n = 39; mean +/- SD, - 16.54 +/- 0.66 parts per thousand and 14.39 +/- 0.77 parts per thousand), yellow (n = 13; - 15.74 +/- 0.65 parts per thousand and 12.37 +/- 0.55 parts per thousand) and hawksbill turtles (n = 13; - 16.23 +/- 1.34 parts per thousand and 12.63 +/- 0.32 parts per thousand) and skin delta C-13 and delta N-15 values in black (n = 36; - 15.32 +/- 0.79 parts per thousand and 15.16 +/- 0.72 parts per thousand), yellow (n = 12; - 15.38 +/- 0.91 parts per thousand and 13.78 +/- 0.75 parts per thousand) and hawksbill turtles (n = 10; - 14.33 +/- 1.49 parts per thousand and 13.77 +/- 0.29 parts per thousand). Isotopic niche space revealed distinctly higher delta N-15 area in black turtles and significant overlap between yellow and hawksbill turtles, and a recent shift in diet in yellow turtles from omnivory to herbivory. In black turtles, isotopic niche suggests individual specialization during the non-upwelling season and generalization in diet during the upwelling season. Mixing model results suggest that black turtles forage at multiple trophic levels (fish: 34.8 +/- 10.1% of diet and macroalgae: 51.8 +/- 12.8% of diet), while yellow and hawksbill turtles primarily forage on macroalgae (85.0 +/- 6.6% in yellow turtles and 85.1 +/- 5.9% in hawksbill turtles). These results add to a growing understanding that diet in sea turtles is influenced by diet items present in the environment and suggest that black turtles are potential tertiary consumers.

KW  - CONSERVATION
AB  - The black rhinoceros (Diceros bicornis), distinguished by its distinctive horned snout and imposing size, stands perilously close to the precipice of extinction. The survival of this majestic species is threatened by a combination of factors, necessitating urgent scientific inquiry into the underlying causes. In this research article, a nonlinear stochastic Ricker model is employed to investigate the challenges faced by the population of black rhinoceros. By integrating innovative mathematical approaches with ecological understanding, the aim is to unravel the intricate dynamics contributing to the endangered status of the black rhino. The critical role of habitat loss and illicit poaching activities in driving the decline of this remarkable species is highlighted by the analysis. These findings emphasise the need for immediate and decisive action to protect the black rhinoceros and mitigate the risk of its extinction. It is imperative that comprehensive conservation efforts be implemented to ensure the long-term survival of the black rhinoceros and preserve its invaluable place within the ecosystem.

AB  - The forest cockchafer Melolontha hippocastani Fabr., is a significant forest pest in Europe; food tree quality is limiting for the fecundity of its females. Laboratory experiments with breeding adults were conducted after their hibernation, with each individual offered leaves from 20 tree species. The weight of adults and production of eggs in relation to food were studied in the first oviposition. Food trees affected the fecundity and the frequency of egg-laying females very positively (Quercus petraea, Larix decidua, Acer pseudoplatanus, Populus nigra), significantly (Q. rubra, Aesculus hippocastanum, Carpinus betulus, Sorbus aucuparia, Malus sp.), non-significantly (Betula pendula, Fagus sylvestris, Corylus avellana, Juglans regia, Populus tremula). Tilia cordata, Sambucus nigra, and Robinia pseudoacacia exhibited no influence on egg laying. Food tree species during breeding positively affected the increasing weight of females feeding on Q. petraea, Q. rubra, P. nigra, P. tremula, C. betulus, A. hippocastanum, and S. aucuparia.

AB  - This study investigates the impact of light intensity on the physical defenses of sugar maple (Acer saccharum Marshall [Sapindaceae]) saplings and how these defenses affect interactions with insect herbivores. The study conducted at the Kenauk Nature Reserve in Quebec involved 12 sites representing both shaded and sunlit environments. Leaf traits, including thickness, specific leaf area (SLA), water content, and toughness, were measured from 216 leaves collected in 2021 and 40 in 2022. To explore herbivore interactions, we used two Erebid caterpillar species, the invasive spongy moth (Lymantria dispar (Linnaeus) [Lepidoptera: Erebidae]) and the native white-marked tussock moth (Orgyia leucostigma (J. E. Smith) [Lepidoptera: Erebidae]), in controlled bioassays that assessed caterpillar feeding preference and performance. The results revealed that sunlit leaves were significantly thicker and had lower SLA compared with shaded leaves across both years. While water content was lower in sunlit leaves in 2021, it showed no significant difference in 2022. Leaf toughness, measured only in 2022, did not significantly differ between sunlit and shaded leaves. Caterpillar feeding preference tests indicated that white-marked tussock moth caterpillars consumed more sunlit leaves, showing a significant preference for them. However, spongy moth caterpillars did not exhibit a significant preference. In terms of performance, white-marked tussock moth caterpillars had a higher survival rate and larger pupal mass on sunlit saplings in 2021. However, no significant differences were observed in laboratory feeding initiation assays with first-instar caterpillars in 2022. These findings suggest that trees' investment in sun leaves to maximize photosynthesis is not necessarily followed by increased defense against herbivory. This research contributes to our understanding of how environmental factors like light can shape plant defense strategies and impact insect herbivore dynamics in temperate forests.

AB  - The Gongshan muntjac (Muntiacus gongshanensis) is one of the least understood ungulate species and is classified as Critically Endangered (CR) on China's Vertebrates Red List and assessed as Data Deficient (DD) by the IUCN. Its elusive behavior, remote habitat, and restricted distribution have hindered efforts to understand its ecological characteristics. To address this gap, we conducted an extensive camera trap survey in Gedang, Medog County, Southeast Tibet, from April 2023 to December 2024. A total of 4846 images and videos from 914 independent detections were collected from 52 cameras that captured the Gongshan muntjac. The results revealed that Gongshan muntjac was widely distributed at elevations below 2800 m, with particularly frequent habitat use below 2200 m in broadleaf forests. The observed sex ratio favored males, with a female-to-male sex ratio of 1:1.13 in this wild population. Solitary individuals were the most common social structure (89.71% of independent detections), followed by female-male pairs (6.94%), whereas other groups with limited detections altogether accounted for only 3.35%. The daily activity patterns followed a crepuscular bimodal rhythm, with the primary activity intensity concentrated at dusk (19:00-21:00) and a smaller peak at dawn (07:00-09:00), and there were no significant differences between males and females. Although activity frequencies were higher in summer and autumn, daily activity intensity exhibited no significant seasonal variation. These findings contribute critical baseline data on the habitat preferences, activity rhythms, and population structure of Gongshan muntjac, offering valuable guidance for conservation planning and future ecological monitoring of this poorly understood species.

AB  - Food waste digestate (FWD) disposal is a serious bottleneck in anaerobic digestion plants to achieve a circular bioeconomy. FWD could be recycled into nitrogen-rich compost; however, the co-composting process optimisation along with bulking agents is required to reduce nitrogen loss and unwanted gaseous emissions. In the present study, two different-sized bulking agents, namely, wood shaving (WS) and fine sawdust (FS), were used to investigate their impact on FWD composting performance along with the nitrogen dynamics. The mixing of FWD with different bulking agents altered the physiochemical characteristics of composting matrix and the effective composting performance was observed through reduced ammonium nitrogen and increased seed germination index during 28 days of composting. The carbon loss of 19-22% through CO2 emission indicated similar carbon mineralisation with both types of sawdust; however, the nitrogen transformation pathways were different. Only WS treatment demonstrated the nitrification process, whereas the nitrogen loss was higher with FS. A total nitrogen loss of similar to 15% was observed in treatments with FS, whereas WS treatments displayed a nitrogen loss of 12%. The outcome of the present study could significantly contribute to the practical aspect of the FWD composting operation with the promotion of the bio-recycling economy.

AB  - Increased poaching in northern South Africa has necessitated relocation of large numbers of southern white rhinoceros (Ceratotherium simum simum) to the Eastern Cape Province. The climate and grassland ecology of this province differ from that of northern South Africa which may impact the health of this species. This assessment of fecal steroid levels and microbiome in 10 free-ranging southern white rhinoceros in the Eastern Cape will provide insights into white rhinoceros physiology in this biome. Fecal steroid metabolites were analyzed using enzyme immunoassay (EIA) and ultra-performance convergence chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (UPC2-MS/ MS). Fecal microbial composition was assessed via next generation sequencing. EIAs with antibodies raised against progesterone (P4; mouse monoclonal - CL425 clone), testosterone (T; rabbit polyclonal), corticosterone (B; sheep polyclonal) were utilized. Pregnant females had large quantities of fecal progesterone metabolites (FPMs) detected by CL425 EIA. Pregnant females also had native P4 and 11 alpha-hydroxydihydroprogesterone (11 alpha OHDHP4; 4-pregnen-11 alpha-ol-3,20-dione) detected by UPC2-MS/MS but these concentrations were 1000-fold less than the concentrations of FPMs detected by the CL425 EIA. By contrast, non-pregnant females had FPM concentrations detected by CL425 EIA which were similar to native P4 and 11 alpha OHDHP4 concentrations detected by UPC2-MS/MS. Mean fecal androgen metabolite (FAM) concentrations detected by the T EIA were similar between males and females. 11-ketoandrostenedione (11KA4) detected by UPC2-MS/MS was higher in females than males. However, there was no difference between males and females in the concentration of fecal gluco-corticoid metabolites (FGMs) detected by the B EIA. Bacteroidia, followed by Clostridia, was the most abundant classes of fecal microbes. The unfiltered microbiome of females was more diverse than that of males. The core fecal microbiome of young rhinoceros had a higher observed species richness (Shannon diversity index, and Simpson diversity index) than that of old rhinoceros. In the alpha male, immobilization was associated with an increase in FGMs detected by 11-deoxycortisol (S) detected by UPC2-MS/MS coupled with decreased abundance of Spirochaetia. We detected substantially different FAM and FPM concentrations from those previously reported for both captive and wild white rhinoceros. Comparison of our UPC2-MS/MS and EIA results underscores the fact that most EIAs are highly cross reactive for many steroid metabolites. Our data also demonstrates a distinct effect of stress not only on FGMs but also on the fecal microbiome. This is the first non-invasive assessment of fecal steroid metabolites by UPC2-MS/MS and the fecal microbiome in wild white rhinoceros.

AB  - Socially flexible species might be at an advantage when facing environmental unpredictability, human-induced rapid environmental changes, or unnatural conditions such as encountered in captivity. The European roe deer (Capreolus capreolus) was originally described as solitarily living forest-dwelling species. In recent decades, it has expanded its range into urban and agricultural areas forming large aggregations in open habitats. Captive en-vironments are thought to mimic some challenges encountered in rapidly changing habitats, however, to date no study has assessed how roe deer social structure changes in captive conditions. In this study, we explored the social network of a small group of captive and unrelated roe deer over the course of a ten-month period using camera traps. We found that the roe deer established a temporally stable and non-random social network with the buck as the most central and dominant individual. In addition, we analysed affiliative interactions, which have not been described in roe deer yet. We found that the affiliation network consisted not only of preferential associations between the buck and other females, but also between females, whereby a young female played a central role. The seasonal changes in roe deer' gregariousness observed in the wild were also observed in the captive population with an increase in association strength and social interactions in autumn. These results suggest that roe deer kept in a group setting in captivity seem to flexibly adjust their social behaviour; thus, supporting the assumption that roe deer show a high social flexibility that facilitates adaptations to various habitats.

AB  - Galectin-4 is a prominent antimicrobial peptide primarily expressed in the gastrointestinal tract of animals. It plays crucial roles in antimicrobial defense and in regulating the repair of intestinal epithelial cells. Given the unique immune system in seahorses, which are known for male pregnancy, the function of galectin-4 in their intestinal tract, which lack gut-associated lymphoid tissues, remains unknown. In this study, we identified a galectin-4 gene (HeGal-4) in the lined seahorse ( Hippocampus erectus). The sequence length of the open reading frame (ORF) was 1041 bp, encoding 346 amino acids. The mRNA expression of He Gal-4 in the intestine was significantly higher than that in other internal organs. However, the synthesized peptide fragment (HeGal- 4 (302-315) ) from the functional domain of He Gal-4 only showed moderate inhibitory effects against Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Micrococcus luteus. Interestingly, in situ hybridization showed that He Gal-4 was predominantly expressed in seahorse intestinal epithelial cells, while genes associated with galectin-4 in the repair of intestinal epithelium, such as beta- catenins, were highly expressed in their intestines. Therefore, our results suggest that He Gal-4 may be crucial for regulating the repair of intestinal epithelial cells in seahorse intestinal epithelial cells, and that it possesses significant potential for the prevention and control of intestinal diseases in seahorse aquaculture.

AB  - Microhaplotypes are small linked genomic regions comprising two or more single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that are being applied in forensics and are emerging in wildlife monitoring studies and genomic epidemiology. Typically, targeted in non-coding regions, microhaplotypes in exonic regions can be designed with larger amplicons to capture functional non-synonymous sites and minimise insertion/deletion (indel) polymorphisms. Quality control is an important first step for high-confidence genotyping to counteract such false-positive variants. As genetic markers with higher polymorphism compared to biallelic SNPs, it is critical to ensure sequencing errors across the microhaplotype amplicon are filtered out to avoid introducing false-haplotypes. We developed the MhGeneS pipeline which works in tandem with Seq2Sat to help validate microhaplotype genotyping of the coding region of genes, with broader applicability to any microhaplotype profiling. We genotyped microhaplotype regions of the Zfx (congruent to 160 bp) and Zfy (congruent to 140 bp) genes, as well as an exon of the prion protein (Prnp) gene (congruent to 370 bp) in caribou (Rangifer tarandus) using paired-end Illumina technology. As important quality metrics affecting microhaplotype calling, we identified the sequencing error rate profile related to the overlap or non-overlap of paired-end reads as well as the read depth as significant. In the case of Prnp, we achieved confident microhaplotype calling through MhGeneS by removing small sections of the 5 ' and 3 ' amplicons and using a minimum read depth of 20. Read depth and sequence trimming may be locus-specific, and validation of these parameters is recommended before the high-throughput profiling of samples.

AB  - Background: Calluna vulgaris (heather) is native to Europe, where it dominates several plant communities, but is invasive in countries like Australia and New Zealand (NZ). In its native ranges, including the United Kingdom (UK), heather provides habitat to arthropods of several feeding guilds and recent studies in its invaded and native ranges show that this plant is a prolific producer of volatile organic compounds (VOCs). These defensive metabolites can modify the behaviours of neighbouring plant and insect species. However, differences in VOC emissions between growth stages (ontogeny) have not yet been explored. Aims: The aim of this study was to explore the role of plant growth stages (pioneer, building and mature) and arthropods on VOC emissions of heather plants on a managed stand in Scotland during the summer season. Methods: We applied the contact insecticide deltamethrin to exclude arthropods from half of the tested plants for each growth stage, collected above-ground volatiles from plants in each treatment, and analysed them using gas chromatography - mass spectrometry (GC-MS). Data were statistically analysed using sparse partial least square discriminant analysis (sPLS-DA) and general linear models (GLM). Results: Results showed differences in volatile emission between growth stages, whereas the effect of arthropod removal was only observed for plants at the building stage. The results suggest that heather plants display different defence strategies as they mature, showing high phenotypic plasticity. Pioneer plants released fewer, ubiquitous compounds in relatively high amounts, building-unprayed plants were the most prolific VOC emitters showing herbivore-induced responses, and mature plants released a higher number of compounds but not in higher quantity than building plants. Thus, mature plants possibly rely more on mechanical and structural defences. Conclusion:: These results highlight the complex and changing nature of heather's volatile emissions during plant ontogeny and contribute to understanding the chemical ecology of heather in heathland ecosystems.

AB  - The suborder Auchenorrhyncha ("true hoppers") comprises nearly half of known Hemiptera, with >43,000 known species of sap-sucking herbivores distributed worldwide, including many important agricultural pests and vectors of plant disease. More than half of the known Auchenorrhyncha belong to superfamily Membracoidea (leaf- and treehoppers), which has been a source of phylogenetic contention for many years. To construct an improved backbone phylogeny of this superfamily, we obtained transcriptome data for multiple representatives of all 5 previously established extant families and nearly all subfamilies to test their monophyly and relationships. 138 taxa (132 Membracoidea and 6 outgroups) were sampled with an emphasis on families Cicadellidae and Membracidae, which were paraphyletic as previously defined by most authors, several problematic subfamilies (Aphrodinae, Eurymelinae, Ledrinae, Nicomiinae, Stegaspidinae and Tartessinae). We analysed different combinations of data sets (amino acid, complete nucleotide and degeneracy-coded nucleotide) using different modelling schemes. The resultant trees based on different analyses are congruent in most nodes. Discordant nodes mainly pertain to relationships among cicadellid subfamilies and tribal relationships within Aphrodinae and Eurymelinae. Analyses of gene- and site concordance factors and quartet scores indicate that this instability is largely attributable to an overall lack of informative characters across genes and sites rather than strongly supported conflict among genes. According to the congruent nodes, we make the following revisions: combine Stegaspidinae and Centrotinae into a single subfamily, Centrotinae sensu lato; restore Stenocotini from Tartessinae to its original position in the Ledrinae; and transform Holdgatiella Evans from Nicomiinae to Melizoderinae. In addition, to solve the paraphyly of both Cicadellidae and Membracidae, a preferred option would be to combine all five previously recognized families into a single family, Membracidae sensu lato; the other option could be to render Cicadellidae monophyletic by excluding Megophthalminae and Ulopinae from Cicadellidae and elevating them to status as separate families.

AB  - Conspecific negative density dependence (CNDD) is thought to be a key process in maintaining plant diversity. However, the strength of CNDD is highly variable in space and time as well as among species, and correlates of this variation that might help to understand and explain it remain largely unquantified. Using Bayesian hierarchical models, we took advantage of 10-year seedling monitoring data that were collected annually in every dry and rainy season in a seasonal tropical forest. We quantified the interspecific variation in the strength of CNDD and its temporal variation. We also examined potential correlates of this interspecific and temporal variation, including species functional traits (such as drought-tolerant traits, defense-related traits, and recourse acquisition traits) and species abundances. In the dry season, we found a negative relationship between the density of neighboring conspecific seedlings on seedling survival, while in the rainy season, there was a negative relationship between the density of neighboring conspecific adults on seedling survival. In addition, we found that interspecific variation in CNDD was related to drought-tolerant traits in the dry season but not in the rainy season. Across years, we found that drought-intolerant species suffer less CNDD during the dry seasons that have higher rainfall, whereas drought-tolerant species suffer less CNDD when the dry season has lower rainfall. We also found that rare species suffered stronger CNDD in the dry season. Overall, our study highlights that CNDD is highly variable among species and through time, necessitating a deeper appreciation of the environmental and functional contexts of CNDD and their interactions.

AB  - The present work aimed to explore the effect of Gloeophyllum trabeum pretreatment on phenol dynamics, humic substance (HS) formation and bacterial community succession during co-composting of wheat straw (WS) and pig manure (PM). The results showed that the phenol production was significantly improved during WS pretreatment with G. trabeum. Moreover, the phenol conversion during composting was significantly promoted after G. trabeum pretreatment of WS. Compared with raw WS, the composting process was accelerated by 13 days and HS content was increased by 15.7% during co-composting of pretreated WS and PM. Furthermore, G. trabeum pretreatment increased the relative content of aromatic functional groups in HS by enhancing the correlations between phenolic compounds and chemical structure of HS. The influence of phenol on bacterial community shift was strengthened by G. trabeum pretreatment, resulting in increased relative abundance of laccaseproducing bacteria. Our findings provide a new way to promote the humification process by enhancing phenolic precursors turnover with functional microorganisms.

AB  - Anthropogenic climate change is causing demographic shifts at species' range edges. Trailing edge populations, which may be genetically distinct and adapted to relative climate extremes, already are showing declines in some species. The associated loss of trailing edge genetic diversity may limit possibilities for future climate-adaptive restoration. For plants with recalcitrant seed, such as oaks, that cannot tolerate conventional seed banking, we propose a novel approach to the conservation of climate-threatened genetic diversity: dispersed, participatory field gene banking. In this collaborative model, trailing edge transplants are stewarded at dispersed sites across a species' projected regional refugia. In 2018, we initiated a pilot participatory field gene bank for the foundational, endemic California blue oak (Quercus douglasii), a species experiencing increasing climate-related declines at its trailing edge. To evaluate seedling performance, the gene bank was designed as a set of 23 small, dispersed common gardens with paired local and trailing edge seeds. Trailing edge seedlings showed lower survival and growth relative to locals, yet they also showed lower levels of leaf disease and herbivory, traits that could confer an adaptive advantage in a more xeric future. The substantial early survival of translocated seeds suggests that participatory field gene banking may offer an effective means of preserving trailing edge genetic diversity for oaks, thereby maintaining genetic resources that could be critical for future climate change-adaptive restoration. However, further observations are needed to confirm the strategy's longer-term viability and evaluate evidence of local adaptation.

AB  - In developing countries, intercropping is commonly used to boost land productivity and agricultural benefits. However, in the Yucatan region of Mexico, maize (Zea mays L.) yields remain low, despite consistent fertilizer and pesticide inputs in traditional intercropping systems. Furthermore, little is known about the photosynthetic mechanisms that occur when maize plants interact with legumes, and there is a lack of understanding of how intercropping systems affect other organisms in the system, such as beneficial and insect pest population dynamics. A field experiment was carried out on the Yucatan Peninsula in 2021 to assess the impact of maize-legume intercropping systems on maize yield, physiological characteristics as evaluated by gas exchange measurements, and the abundance of beneficial insects in traditional and novel maize intercropping systems. The experiment was carried out with a randomized complete block design with three replicates. Treatments included maize intercropped with a novel legume, crotalaria (Crotalaria juncea L.), maize intercropped with a traditional legume, cowpea (Vigna unguiculata (L.) Walp.), and sole maize as a control. Significant differences in plant height were shown at growth stages V12 (45 days after sowing) and VT (60 days after sowing). No differences were observed in stem diameter, leaf area index, or chlorophyll content. The maize/cowpea intercrop increased the photosynthesis rate by 12.9% and 9.84% in the maize/crotalaria and sole maize, respectively (p < 0.001), and transpiration rate by 6.5% and 8.5% in the maize intercropped with crotalaria and sole maize treatments, respectively (p < 0.001), of maize plants. No significant effects on stomatal conductance or water use efficiency were observed, but the carbon intercellular rate was reduced by 9.74% and 9.15 when compared to the maize/crotalaria and the sole maize treatments, respectively. Overall, intercropping treatments attracted more beneficial insects than sole maize. For predators, the families that stood out were Coccinelidae, Formicidae, Araneidae, Thomisidae, Syrphidae, Chrysomelidae, Oxypidae, Vespidae, Reduviidae, Carabidae, Asilidae, Salthicidae, Dolichopodidae, while among parasitoids, the most frequent families were Eurytomydae, Braconidae, Tachinidae, Pteromalidae, Scelionidae, and Figitidae. In comparison to the maize/cowpea and maize/crotalaria treatments, the sole maize treatment resulted in a grain yield increase of 24.5% and 32%, respectively. However, sole maize was not statistically different to that of maize/cowpea intercropping. In conclusion, our findings suggest that maize/cowpea intercropping could be a viable alternative to sole maize cropping systems for enhancing maize yield and the abundance of beneficial insects, without increasing interspecific competition with the maize crop. Therefore, the maize/cowpea intercropping system represents a sustainable planting alternative for promoting maize grain yield and also promoting edible legume production within the system. Furthermore, the outcomes of this study can serve as a theoretical framework for increasing maize-legume intercropping profitability under growing conditions on the Yucatan Peninsula.

AB  - The manuscript examines the patterns of the opening and use of the preorbital gland in the Visayan spotted deer (Rusa alfredi) and its diverse signalling role. This study focused on two captive herds of Visayan spotted deer observed across different social contexts and revealed a variety of behaviours associated with the opening of the preorbital gland, some of which have never been described previously. The findings reveal a dynamic interplay between visual and chemical signalling. As expected, preorbital gland opening for visual signalling occurred during excitement-inducing activities, such as suckling, agonistic and reproductive interactions, as well as human handling. However, it was also observed in new contexts, like during flehmen, antler rubbing, alertness towards humans, and even during relaxing activities like grooming. We also observed occurrences in young animals for the first time during low-intensity interactions like playing or mounting. The broad context of displaying this behaviour in a forest-dwelling species like the Visayan spotted deer suggests a potentially higher relevance than in species adapted to open environments. These observations contribute to our understanding of ungulate social communication.

AB  - Arar (Juniperus phoenicea L.) is a small monoecious or dioecious evergreen species presenting as a shrub or tree around the Mediterranean. This widespread plant is also causing problems in Croatia, along its Adriatic coastal area and in particular on the island of Pag. It affects the establishment and growth of other species that share its habitat and has also reduced the grazing areas of local sheep breeding and beekeeping communities. Arar is also a frequent cause of wildfires in the region. Its spread is indeed far-reaching, from its impact on plants and livestock to its adverse effects on the local population and its tourism, which is one of the main components of the island's economy. This research aimed to evaluate biomass and biochar samples of arar, using standard methods to verify their potential energy value. Results of the study showed a favorable content of coke (16.28%) and volatiles (77.26%) in the samples. The C, H, S, N, and O ratios of the samples were 50.14%, 6.57%, 0.31%, 0.84% and 42.13%, respectively. The higher calorific value was 20.45 MJ center dot kg(-1) for biomass and 29.01 MJ center dot kg(-1) for biochar. Accordingly, this species can be used as a solid biofuel for direct combustion or similar processes and for other value-added applications.

AB  - At lower latitudes ungulate reproduction is often seasonal, but the duration of mating and parturition seasons can be long. To further understand the adaptive significance of synchrony in reproductive events, we examined two hypotheses to link over-winter body mass with lower synchrony of conceptions in a wild population of white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus (Zimmermann, 1780)) in central Texas. If females maintain over-winter body mass, then the window of time that conception occurs should be relaxed and longer relative to females where over-winter body mass declines. Across 9 years, we measured body mass in 1.5-year-old and older females in November (n = 170) and in March (118). In March, we also measured forehead- rump lengths in offspring of gravid females and calculated conception dates. Over-winter body mass did not decline but was maintained, on average, across the years of study. Conception dates ranged over 50 days and 52% of conceptions occurred in a 2-week period centered on the median conception date. Relative to northern populations of deer, there was lower synchrony in conception dates. White-tailed deer across the geographic range appear to be flexible in over-winter body mass dynamics that affects duration of reproductive events such as conception.

AB  - Male goats stimulated by the "male-to-male effect" for one month and then introduced to anestrous does are as efficient as those stimulated by photoperiod in inducing cyclicity in anestrous does. Here, we determined whether the sexually active (SA) male goats can stimulate reproduction in does and males when housed together in the same flock during the non-breeding season, and whether male goats exposed to the "male-to-male effect" can fertilize does with the same efficiency and timeframe as SA males stimulated by photoperiod. In March, one group of does was kept isolated from male goats, while three other groups were housed with seasonally hypoactive males (SH). In April, the isolated group was joined with two SA male goats (SA group), while the other three groups were managed as follows: one group was joined with two SA male goats (SA + SH group); the second group was joined with two SA male goats which were fitted with aprons to prevent mating (SA-apron + SH group); and the third group was joined with two SH male goats (SH + SH group). The percentages of does that kidded did not differ among SA (73 %), SA + SH (70 %) and SA-apron + SH (76)% groups; however, all three had greater kidding rates than the SH + SH group (29 %). We conclude that SA male goats stimulate the reproductive activity in both does and male goats during non-breeding season when housed together in the same group. Furthermore, male goats stimulated by the "male-to-male effect" can achieve fertility rates and fertilization timeframe comparable to those of SA male goats.

AB  - Androgenic glands (AGs) regulate male sexual differentiation in M. rosenbergii, and AG ablation may induce sex reversal and male-to-neofemale transformation. However, information on gonad development following AG ablation is scarce. To investigate the effects of gonad development and sex reversal after AG ablation, we utilized transcriptomic profiling, RT-qPCR, and histological and morphological observation. Transcriptomic profiling generated 42.32-42.92 million clean reads. A total of 94,747 unigenes were assembled with a total length, average length, N50, and GC content of 160,460,655 bp, 1693 bp, 3438 bp, and 39.86%, respectively. Hsp70, IGFBP7, Mar-Mrr, Serpin, TUBA3, CREB, EF1a, and BMP7 were identified as differentially expressed by gonad transcriptome profiling after AG ablation. Interestingly, the Rap1, Hippo, PI3K, oxytocin, thyroid hormone, and apoptosis signalling pathways were all found to be involved in the sex-reversal process by regulating cell proliferation and gonad development and maintaining homeostasis. Sexual morphology features and histological changes following AG ablation validated the sex reversal from male to neofemale. Sexual manipulation permits monosex culture while considerably improving output yield. Taken together, these findings provide insight into the sexual reversal mechanism of M. rosenbergii after AG ablation. The findings in this study may aid in the future investigation of the sex-reversal mechanisms in other decapod species and offer a new breeding and culture strategy for M. rosenbergii aquaculture industry.

AB  - Manure application increases the transfer risk of antibiotic resistance to farmland. Especially, its impact remains unclear when it occurs in arsenic (As)-contaminated paddy soils, which is considered as a global environmental problem. In this work, we investigated the fate of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) in As-antibiotic co contaminated paddy soils under the application of manure from different sources (pig manure, cow dung, and chicken manure). Differences in the aliphatic carbon and electron-donating capacities of these dissolved organic matters (DOM) regulated the transformation of iron and As by both biotic and abiotic processes. The regulation by pig manure was stronger than that by cow dung and chicken manure. DOM regulation increased the abundance of As-related functional genes (arsC, arrA, aioA, and arsM) in the soil and accelerated the transformation of As speciation, the highest proportion of As(III) being 45%-61%. Meanwhile, the continuous selection pressure provided by the highly toxic As(III) increased the risk of ARGs and mobile genetic elements (MGEs) via horizontal gene transfer. As-resistant bacteria, including Bacillus, Geobacter, and Desulfitobacterium, were finally considered as potential host bacteria for ARGs and MGEs. In summary, this study clarified the synergistic mechanism of As antibiotic on the fate of ARGs in co-contaminated paddy soils, and provided practical guidance for the proper application of organic fertilizers.

This short communication describes the effects of a two-week salinity stress (0, 6, 12 g L- 1 NaCl) on Pelibuey sheep. The parameters measured in response to salinity stress were animal weight, rectal temperature, and levels of hemoglobin, hematocrits, lymphocytes, neutrophils, leukocytes and proteins. Specific activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT) in blood samples were also recorded. The results showed that the 6 g L- 1 NaCl treatment resulted in the significantly highest body weight. There were no significant differences in the rectal temperature of animals. In terms of the hematological parameters, animals exposed to 6 g L- 1 NaCl displayed the significantly highest hemoglobin and hematocrit contents. There appeared to be no effect of consumption of saline water on the amount of lymphocytes, neutrophils, leukocytes or proteins. It was found that animals that consumed 12 g L- 1 NaCl supplemented water had the lowest levels of SOD activity. There were no significant differences in CAT specific activities in animals exposed to the saline water or the control. This is the first report on the response of Pelibuey sheep to short-term saline stress under Cuban environmental conditions.

AB  - Intraspecific and habitat-mediated responses to chemical cues play key roles in structuring populations of marine species. We investigated the behaviour of herbivorous-stage juvenile crown-of-thorns sea stars (COTS; Acanthaster sp.) in flow-through choice chambers to determine if chemical cues from their habitat influence movement and their transition to become coral predators. Juveniles at the diet transition stage were exposed to cues from their nursery habitat (coral rubble-crustose coralline algae (CCA)), live coral and adult COTS to determine if waterborne cues influence movement. In response to CCA and coral as sole cues, juveniles moved towards the cue source and when these cues were presented in combination, they exhibited a preference for coral. Juveniles moved away from adult COTS cues. Exposure to food cues (coral, CCA) in the presence of adult cues resulted in variable responses. Our results suggest a feedback mechanism whereby juvenile behaviour is mediated by adult chemical cues. Cues from the adult population may deter juveniles from the switch to corallivory. As outbreaks wane, juveniles released from competition may serve as a proximate source of outbreaks, supporting the juveniles-in-waiting hypothesis. The accumulation of juveniles within the reef infrastructure is an underappreciated potential source of COTS outbreaks that devastate coral reefs.

AB  - The pasture mowing in late winter removes the old forage, improving the pasture structure in spring and summer. However, the residue after mowing can affect tillering, thus limiting forage production and the structural characteristics of pasture. We hypothesized that the high amount of cut vegetal residues on the plants in late winter causes a decrease in forage production and modifies the structural characteristics of the forage canopy during the spring and summer. The treatments were four cut vegetal residues (0; 2,000; 4,000 and 8,000 t ha(-1) of natural material) deposited on Urochloa brizantha cv. Marandu canopy in late winter. After that, the forage production and structure characteristics were evaluated during the spring and summer for two years. The complete randomized block design, with four replications, was used. The defoliation management was characterized by the adoption of pre- and post-cut heights of 25 and 15 cm, respectively. For both years, there was no effect of cut vegetal residue on all the characteristics evaluated. No variable was affected by the interaction cut vegetal residue amount x year of evaluation. The dead leaf blade percentage was greater in year 2 (6.9%) than in year 1 (3.5%). The average values of variables were live leaf blade percentage = 84.2%; live stem percentage = 8.7%; dead stem percentage = 1.9%; number of vegetative tiller = 653 tiller/m(2); number of reproductive tiller = 5 tiller m(-2). The forage production rate presented an average value of 46 kg/ha/day of dry matter. The cut vegetal residue amount of up to 8,000 t/ha of natural material on the plants in late winter does not affect the forage production or modifies the structural characteristics of marandu palisadegrass during the subsequent spring and summer.

AB  - Anthropogenic climate change has led to globally increasing temperatures at an unprecedented pace and, to persist, wild species have to adapt to their changing world. We, however, often fail to derive reliable predictions of species' adaptive potential. Genomic selection represents a powerful tool to investigate the adaptive potential of a species, but constitutes a 'blind process' with regard to the underlying genomic architecture of the relevant phenotypes. Here, we used great tit (Parus major) females from a genomic selection experiment for avian lay date to zoom into this blind process. We aimed to identify the genetic variants that responded to genomic selection and epigenetic variants that accompanied this response and, this way, might reflect heritable genetic variation at the epigenetic level. We applied whole genome bisulfite sequencing to blood samples of individual great tit females from the third generation of bidirectional genomic selection lines for early and late lay date. Genomic selection resulted in differences at both the genetic and epigenetic level. Genetic variants that showed signatures of selection were located within genes mostly linked to brain development and functioning, including LOC107203824 (SOX3-like). SOX3 is a transcription factor that is required for normal hypothalamo-pituitary axis development and functioning, an essential part of the reproductive axis. As for epigenetic differentiation, the early selection line showed hypomethylation relative to the late selection line. Sites with differential DNA methylation were located in genes important for various biological processes, including gonadal functioning (e.g., MSTN and PIK3CB). Overall, genomic selection for avian lay date provided insights into where within the genome the heritable genetic variation for lay date, on which selection can operate, resides and indicates that some of this variation might be reflected by epigenetic variants.

AB  - Climate changes may lead to tipping points where the epidemiological characteristics of infectious wildlife diseases suddenly change, leading to outbreaks. However, empirically documented cases of the extent to which emerging infectious diseases (EIDs) affect populations of large vertebrates are few, partly because of the limited surveillance of remote wildlife populations. EIDs may potentially lead to higher mortality than mean mortality levels. Here, we quantified the likely impact of digital necrobacillosis on the survival and population dynamics of wild alpine reindeer (Rangifer tarandus) in Hardangervidda National Park (NP), Norway. The outbreak of digital necrobacillosis in 2019 contributed to a decrease in the summer survival rate of juveniles to 51% compared to an average of 88% in 2005-2018 and 77% in 2020. However, since the outbreak mainly reduced juvenile survival, the impact on short-term population dynamics was moderate, lowering the population growth rate (lambda) before harvest from an average value of 1.18 (2005-2018) to 1.08 (2019) before harvest. In 2019, anomalous climate conditions with a high daily mean temperature combined with the highest recorded daily precipitation in late summer were observed. Further studies are required to document the pathological development of digital necrobacillosis across demographic groups and proximate and ultimate causes of mortality.

AB  - With the continuous improvement in living standards, people's demand for high-quality meat is increasing. Ningxiang pig has delicious meat of high nutritional value, and is loved by consumers. However, its slow growth and low meat yield seriously restrict its efficient utilization. Gene expression is the internal driving force of life activities, so in order to fundamentally improve its growth rate, it is key to explore the molecular mechanism of skeletal muscle development in Ningxiang pigs. In this paper, Ningxiang boars were selected in four growth stages (30 days: weaning period, 90 days: nursing period, 150 days: early fattening period, and 210 days: late fattening period), and the longissimus dorsi (LD) muscle was taken from three boars in each stage. The fatty acid content, amino acid content, muscle fiber diameter density and type of LD were detected by gas chromatography, acidolysis, hematoxylin eosin (HE) staining and immunofluorescence (IF) staining. After transcription sequencing, weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) combined with the phenotype of the LD was used to explore the key genes and signaling pathways affecting muscle development. The results showed that 10 modules were identified by WGCNA, including 5 modules related to muscle development stage, module characteristics of muscle fiber density, 5 modules characteristic of muscle fiber diameter, and a module characteristic of palmitoleic acid (C16:1) and linoleic acid (C18:2n6C). Gene ontology (GO) enrichment analysis found that 52 transcripts relating to muscle development were enriched in these modules, including 44 known genes and 8 novel genes. The Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) enrichment analysis showed that these genes were enriched in the auxin, estrogen and cyclic guanosine monophosphate-protein kinase G (cGMP-PKG) pathways. Twelve of these genes were transcription factors, there were interactions among 20 genes, and the interactions among 11 proteins in human, pig and mouse were stable. To sum up, through the integrated analysis of phenotype and transcriptome, this paper analyzed the key genes and possible regulatory networks of skeletal muscle development in Ningxiang pigs at various stages, to provide a reference for the in-depth study of skeletal muscle development.

AB  - Objectives: We undertook a more comprehensive analyses than our previous study (Yi et al., International Journal of Osteoarchaeology, 2018, 28, 636-644) at the Gaoshan site (similar to 2500-2000 cal. BC) to expand our understanding of the different roles of rice and millets to human subsistence strategies, diachronic shift of human diets, diversity of human life histories and cultural influence (dental ablation) to human population.
   Materials and Methods: Carbon and nitrogen isotopic analyses of human (ribs and long bones, n = 68) and animal (n = 15) bones as well as carbonized seeds from rice and millets (n = 8) were undertaken. Human bones were directly AMS-C-14 dated. In addition, sequential sampling of 16 individuals with varied age and sex and cultural contexts for isotopic analysis was also conducted.
   Results: The calibrated dating results (n = 27) indicate that there existed two periods of occupation at the site, similar to 2500-2200 BC and similar to 2200-1900 BC. Moderate high delta N-15 values were found in the crops. Isotopic data from bone collagen suggest that the humans mainly relied on C-3-based animal protein and were supplemented by C-4-based foods. This isotopic pattern is also seen in pigs. Significant difference of human delta C-13 values (Mann-Whitney U test, p < 0.05) between the two periods was observed. Compared to the bones, the isotopic data of human dentine serial sections show a much wider variability and higher delta C-13 values.
   Discussion: The crops (millets and rice) were probably manured. Human individuals subsisted on rice/millet agriculture and pigs in general. In combination with the radiocarbon dates, the increase of C-3 (rice) consumption by the humans was found from the early (2500-2200 cal. BC) to late (2200-2000 cal. BC) periods, indicating the intensification of rice agriculture through time. However, four categories of human life histories during childhood are identified given different isotopic profiles of dentine sections, demonstrating that C-3 (rice) and C-4 (millets)-based foods played different roles in human lives. Even though, there were similar weaning practices among the human populations. It is surprising that human individuals with dental ablation, cultural characteristic in the Middle and Lower Yangtze River Valley, consumed more millets during childhood in the early period than those without dental ablation in the late period. Our study here provides novel insights into cultural dynamics and the interplay between rice and millets in rice-millet agricultural system during the Late Neolithic in Southwest China.

AB  - The Endangered dhole Cuon alpinus is a medium-sized canid that was historically distributed widely across East, Central, South and Southeast Asia. In Nepal, following heavy persecution during the 1970s and 1980s, the species was locally extirpated across large parts of the country. After decades of near absence, the dhole is reportedly showing signs of recovery in various areas of Nepal. We carried out three surveys using camera traps (resulting in a total of 6,550 camera-trap days), reviewed literature and interviewed herders and conservation practitioners (40 interviews) to determine the historical and current distribution of dholes in the country, and the species' current status. Our camera traps recorded five images of dholes, and the literature review and interview survey provided further insights into the historical and current presence of dholes in Nepal. The combined findings suggest dholes have recolonized many areas where they had been locally extirpated, such as the Annapurna Conservation Area in central Nepal and the Tinjure-Milke-Jaljale forests in the eastern part of the country. Although these returns are encouraging, challenges remain for dhole recolonization, including conflict with livestock herders, human hunting of wild ungulates affecting the species' prey base, increasing infrastructure development in forested areas, and diseases.

AB  - While isolated patches of water hyacinth have persisted in most parts of Lake Victoria since the rapid decline in biomass beginning in 1999/2000, Nyanza Gulf has maintained extensive but cyclical coverage over the years. High water hyacinth productivities were found to coincide with the western region associated with upwelling and regenerated nutrients, and also with periods of complete lake turnover. River discharge sites, which are numerous in the eastern region, expressed relatively low water hyacinth productivities. High productivity meant better nutritional quality, a state preferred by the Neochetina weevils. Although the difference in productivities between the eastern and western regions were statistically insignificant, the feeding scars were notably different. This implies that any slight change in water hyacinth's nutritional quality as a result of change in resource water quality, significantly affects the weevil's productivities. During complete lake turnover, water hyacinth productivity is highly enhanced, likely due to upwelling of hypolimnetic nutrient enriched waters with subsequent spontaneous weevil invasion. During times of such high nutrient quality, the rates of leaf turnover outstrips the herbivory by the weevils. The nutrient dynamics from primary sources coupled with secondary regenerated loads through lake turnovers influences the water hyacinth's varying nutritional quality and weevil population, which ultimately determines the water hyacinth phenology within the semi-enclosed Nyanza Gulf. The objectives of this study were to study the spatial influence of resource water quality to the consumer water hyacinth productivity and how temporal hydrologic dynamics drives its cyclicity.

AB  - Marine mesograzers use macroalgae as food and habitat and may have strong top-down effects on plants and macroalgae. Sympatric mesograzer species often differ regarding host use and feeding behavior, which may lead to distinct impacts by these consumers on primary producers. The amphipods Hyale niger and Ampithoe marcuzzii are mesograzers abundant that co-occur in Brazilian waters and, although they use several macroalgae as habitat, it is unknown how much the food value of these hosts explains the host use pattern by the two mesograzers. Herein, we investigated the abundance and feeding behavior of the sympatric amphipods H. niger and A. marcuzzii. For that, their abundance on the macroalgal hosts Sargassum filipendula, Padina gymnospora, and Dichotomaria marginata was evaluated seasonally in a rocky shore at Fortaleza Beach, state of Sao Paulo, Brazil. Also, multiple-choice and no-choice feeding experiments were carried out at laboratory to evaluate the feeding behavior of these mesograzers. The abundance of H. niger was similar among the three macroalgal hosts (except during winter), while A. marcuzzii was more abundant on Dichotomaria and Padina than Sargassum in all seasons. Moreover, H. niger consumed more Padina than Dichotomaria and Sargassum in both feeding experiments. In turn, A. marcuzzii preferred to feed on Padina when it had a choice and consumed the three macroalgal hosts at similar levels in the no-choice feeding experiment. Overall, H. niger and A. marcuzzii differ from each other regarding their feeding behavior and host use pattern. In particular, the food value of macroalgae seems to partially explain the host use by A. marcuzzi, but not by H. niger. The differences between H. niger and A. marcuzzii may result in varying impacts on primary producers.

AB  - Simple Summary Analysis of 474 human casualties in wildlife-vehicle accidents (WVAs) in Lithuania between 2002 and 2022 revealed that their numbers have been escalating since 2018. Moose were the primary contributors to fatalities and injuries despite their much lower abundance in the country compared to that of roe deer. Temporal patterns showed that most casualties occurred during dusk or dawn in May and September, on weekends, and between 20:00 and 22:00. Spatially, main roads with high traffic density had the highest casualties per unit length. Most casualties occurred after vehicles directly hit an animal with cars and motorcycles being the most vulnerable. The effectiveness of WVA prevention measures was inconclusive with a small percentage of casualties occurring in areas with warning signs or fenced road segments. These findings highlight the need for a critical evaluation of current prevention strategies to reduce human casualties in WVAs.Abstract We analyzed 474 human casualties in wildlife-vehicle accidents (WVAs) that occurred between 2002 and 2022 in Lithuania, which is a small northern European country. The study revealed the escalating trend of WVAs, since 2018 surpassing other transport accidents, although the number of casualties per WVA was ca. 100 times lower compared to other transport accidents. Moose was the primary contributor, responsible for 66.7% of fatalities and 47.2% of injuries, despite much lower species abundance compared to roe deer, which is the main species involved in WVAs without human casualties. Temporal patterns highlighted seasonal, daily, and hourly variations, with the majority of casualties occurring during dusk or dawn in May and September, on weekends, and between 20:00 and 22:00. Spatially, main roads with high traffic density exhibited the highest casualties per unit length. Most casualties occurred after hitting an animal directly with cars and motorcycles being most vulnerable vehicles. The effectiveness of WVA prevention measures was inconclusive: 9.5% of fatalities and 1.4% of injuries were registered in the area of the warning sign, and 10.4% of all casualties occurred on fenced road segments. These findings suggest the need for a critical evaluation of the current prevention strategies in reducing human casualties associated with WVAs.

AB  - Yak has strong adaptability to plateau hypoxia environment. However, the endothelin-1 (ET-1) and endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) are important regulators in blood oxygen transportation. Yak testes: newborn (3 days), young (1 years), adult (4 years) and old (9 years) were collected for microscopic analyses using haematoxylin and eosin staining (H & E), immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence, as well as Western blot to compare the expression of ET-1 and eNOS. Furthermore, the levels of ET-1 mRNA and eNOS mRNA was detected by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR). The results showed that ET-1 mRNA and eNOS mRNA in old yaks were higher than other developmental stages (p < .01). And the levels of ET-1 and eNOS protein increased with age. Immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence showed that ET-1 and eNOS were mainly localized in gonocytes and spermatogenic membrane of newborn yaks. These two factors were expressed in both Leydig cells of young yaks and endothelial cells of adult yaks. In old yaks, ET-1 was mainly expressed in Sertoli cells, while eNOS was obviously positive in capillaries and Leydig cells. Therefore, the positive results of ET-1 and eNOS in gonocyte and spermatogenic basement were closely related to the development of testes. The expression of Leydig and Sertoli cells indicated that they played an important role in testes function. The expression in endothelial cells or interstitial capillaries, suggesting that they are involved in the regulation of microcirculation in yak testes. This study could provide clues for further revealing the regulation of yak testicular blood vessels in alpine cold and hypoxic environments.

AB  - Pollutants produced by pig breeding are among the important pollutions. It is necessary to explore the factors influencing the emission intensity of pollutants from pig breeding and find ways to decrease them. Using the provincial panel data of China from 2001 to 2017, this paper analyzed the mechanism impact of environmental decentralization on pollution emission from pig farming. The results showed that environmental decentralization could significantly reduce the emission intensity of pollutants from pig farming. Decentralization of environmental monitoring had a certain effect on reducing such emission intensity, while decentralization of environmental administration has not played this role. In addition, the scale of pig farming can effectively strengthen the effect of environmental decentralization on pollution reduction in pig farming. From the perspective of regional heterogeneity, environmental decentralization can reduce such emission intensity in restricted development areas, potential growth areas, and moderate development areas. Also, decentralization of environmental monitoring can also, obviously, reduce pollutant emissions in potential growth areas. The research results have reference value for determining the reasonable level of environmental decentralization between regions and improving environmental regulation policies.

AB  - This study investigates the effects of hydrolyzed keratin (HK) on the growth and Ca and Mg uptake of lettuce plants under natural and light-emitting diode (LED) lighting conditions in cocopeat and soil environments. Lettuce plants were grown under natural light in cocopeat and soil, and simultaneously under blue (B), blue + far-red (B + FR), red (R), R + B, R + FR, R + B + FR, and white (W) light conditions. The fertilizer treatments consisted of control, HK, Ca + Mg, and HK + Ca + Mg. The highest fresh and dry weights of lettuce plants were observed with HK treatment in cocopeat, and HK + Ca + Mg treatment in soil. Among different LED light sources, the highest fresh and dry weights were recorded under the R light, followed by R + B + FR, R + B, and W, with the weakest growth observed under B + FR, R + FR, and B. Regardless of light source, HK and Ca + Mg treatments improved fresh and dry weights compared to the control. All treatments increased Ca and Mg concentrations compared to the control, with the highest Mg concentration observed under HK + Ca + Mg treatment and the highest Ca concentration is found with HK + Ca + Mg and Ca + Mg treatments. The highest N concentrations were observed in cocopeat with HK treatments and in soil with HK + Ca + Mg, compared to the control. The Ca concentration was higher under B + FR and R + FR, and Mg concentration was highest under R and R + B. HK, Ca + Mg, and HK + Ca + Mg treatments consistently improved the nutritional status of lettuce plants, making HK a promising organic amendment for enhancing plant growth and nutrient uptake in both soil and soilless cultivation systems.

AB  - Leopards exhibit adaptability and thrive in human-dominant landscapes by incorporating livestock into their diet. The present study was conducted to assess the prey availability and selection patterns of leopards (Panthera pardus fusca) in two urban landscapes i.e., Indore and Jabalpur, in India. The research aimed to understand the prey population dynamics and evaluate the impact of human activities on leopard behaviour. This study employed transect surveys to estimate prey density and biomass, scat analysis to identify consumed prey species, and analysis of the secondary data from Forest Department local administration for livestock depredation incidents. Prey selection was evaluated using the Jacobs' selectivity index. Results revealed diverse prey preferences, with chital (Axis axis) and domestic dogs (Canis familiaris) being prominent diet components in both study areas. Livestock, particularly cattle, constituted a significant portion of available biomass. This study identified human-leopard negative interaction zones within the study areas prone to conflict. These findings emphasize the need for effective management strategies to mitigate human-leopard negative interactions and promote coexistence. The study contributes valuable insights into the dietary habits and prey dynamics of leopards in urban landscapes, which are crucial for their conservation and management initiatives.

AB  - Anthropogenic noise is a recognized global pollutant with well-documented effects on the behaviour, physiology and survival of many marine species. However, there is a gap in our understanding of how noise impacts reef fishes under natural conditions without direct manipulation. To address this, we conducted field experiments to examine how two types of sound sources affect the behaviour of an endemic southwestern Atlantic reef fish, Stegastes fuscus. Both motorboat noise playback (0.2e1 kHz) and pure tone (0.4 kHz) influenced behavioural traits of the species. Specifically, individuals reduced their foraging rates when exposed to either sound and spent more time refuging during pure tone exposure. Despite these changes, fish did not exhibit increased agonistic interactions during any of the sound exposures. Our findings indicate that both motorboat playback and pure tone negatively affect damselfishes by increasing antipredator behaviour, seen through increasing refuge time and decreasing foraging rates, which could potentially impact their fitness and population dynamics.

AB  - Background Cultivated tea is one of the most important economic and ecological trees distributed worldwide. Cultivated tea suffer from long-term targeted selection of traits and overexploitation of habitats by human beings, which may have changed its genetic structure. The chloroplast is an organelle with a conserved cyclic genomic structure, and it can help us better understand the evolutionary relationship of Camellia plants. Results We conducted comparative and evolutionary analyses on cultivated tea and wild tea, and we detected the evolutionary characteristics of cultivated tea. The chloroplast genome sizes of cultivated tea were slightly different, ranging from 157,025 to 157,100 bp. In addition, the cultivated species were more conserved than the wild species, in terms of the genome length, gene number, gene arrangement and GC content. However, comparing Camellia sinensis var. sinensis and Camellia sinensis var. assamica with their cultivars, the IR length variation was approximately 20 bp and 30 bp, respectively. The nucleotide diversity of 14 sequences in cultivated tea was higher than that in wild tea. Detailed analysis on the genomic variation and evolution of Camellia sinensis var. sinensis cultivars revealed 67 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), 46 insertions/deletions (indels), and 16 protein coding genes with nucleotide substitutions, while Camellia sinensis var. assamica cultivars revealed 4 indels. In cultivated tea, the most variable gene was ycf1. The largest number of nucleotide substitutions, five amino acids exhibited site-specific selection, and a 9 bp sequence insertion were found in the Camellia sinensis var. sinensis cultivars. In addition, phylogenetic relationship in the ycf1 tree suggested that the ycf1 gene has diverged in cultivated tea. Because C. sinensis var. sinensis and its cultivated species were not tightly clustered. Conclusions The cultivated species were more conserved than the wild species in terms of architecture and linear sequence order. The variation of the chloroplast genome in cultivated tea was mainly manifested in the nucleotide polymorphisms and sequence insertions. These results provided evidence regarding the influence of human activities on tea.

AB  - Northwest Atlantic harbor (Phoca vitulina vitulina) and gray (Halichoerus grypus atlantica) seal populations are recovering from early to mid-20th century exploitation, increasing their biological interactions and bycatch in Northeastern US commercial fisheries. We evaluated the seals' diet composition and compared their prey to commercial catches to assess trophic overlap and potential competition with commercial fisherman target catches. We obtained 148 harbor and 178 gray seal stomach samples from bycatch events that occurred between 2004 and 2018. We learned from the hard part remains that the majority of seals bycaught are young-of-the-year (<= 12 months old) that consume a wide breadth of prey across three trophic groups. There was a general dichotomy in extrinsic factors associated with seal diet in which 45% trophic niche separation was explained by non-overlapping harbor and gray seal phenology and pup haul-out locations that are adjacent to active fishing areas. Prey size estimated from fish otoliths and squid beaks recovered from stomach contents showed that gray seals consumed larger prey than harbor seals and prey sizes from both seals showed limited overlap with prey sizes caught by commercial gillnet fishermen. The most important prey to both seals included large (>20 cm) and small (<= 20 cm) silver hake (Merluccius bilinearis), (<= 40 cm) red hake (Urophycis chuss), gulf stream flounder (Citharichthys arctifrons), medium (21-40 cm) white hake (Urophycis tenuis), and (<50 cm) Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua). Important prey to harbor seals that did not overlap with gray seals were Acadian redfish (Sebastes fasciatus), Atlantic herring (Clupea harengus), longfin (Doryteuthis pealeii), and shortfin squid (Illex illecebrosus). They contrasted with prey important to gray seals that did not overlap with harbor seals: yellowtail flounder (Limanda ferruginea), sand lance (Ammodytes spp.), Urophycis spp., and fourspot flounder (Hippoglossina oblonga). Despite the potential bias associated with opportunistic bycatch sampling, this study demonstrates the importance and value of utilizing carcasses retained from bycatch events, is complimentary to newer methodologies (i.e., DNA meta-barcoding), and fills data gaps in our understanding of the role recovering harbor and gray seal populations have on Northeastern US regional food webs.

AB  - Natural selection and domestication have shaped modern sheep populations into a vast range of phenotypically diverse breeds. Among these breeds, dairy sheep have a smaller population than meat sheep and wool sheep, and less research is performed on them, but the lactation mechanism in dairy sheep is critically important for improving animal-production methods. In this study, whole-genome sequences were generated from 10 sheep breeds, including 57 high-milkyield sheep and 44 low-milk-yield sheep, to investigate the genetic signatures of milk production in dairy sheep, and 59,864,820 valid SNPs (Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms) were kept after quality control to perform population-genetic-structure analyses, gene-detection analyses, and gene-function-validation analyses. For the population-genetic-structure analyses, we carried out PCA (Principal Component Analysis), as well as neighbor-joining tree and structure analyses to classify different sheep populations. The sheep used in our study were well distributed in ten groups, with the high-milk-yield-group populations close to each other and the low-milk-yield-group populations showing similar classifications. To perform an exact signal-selection analysis, we used three different methods to find SNPs to perform gene-annotation analyses within the 995 common regions derived from the fixation index (F-ST), nucleotide diversity (theta pi), and heterozygosity rate (ZHp) results. In total, we found 553 genes that were located in these regions. These genes mainly participate in the protein-binding pathway and the nucleoplasm-interaction pathway, as revealed by the GO- and KEGG-function-enrichment analyses. After the gene selection and function analyses, we found that FCGR3A, CTSK, CTSS, ARNT, GHR, SLC29A4, ROR1, and TNRC18 were potentially related to sheep-milk-production traits. We chose the strongly selected genes, FCGR3A, CTSK, CTSS, and ARNT during the signal-selection analysis to perform a RT-qPCR (Reale time Quantitative Polymerase Chain Reaction) experiment to validate their expression-level relationship with milk production, and the results showed that FCGR3A has a significant negative relationship with sheep-milk production, while other three genes did not show any positive or negative relations. In this study, it was discovered and proven that the candidate gene FCGR3A potentially contributes to the milk production of dairy sheep and a basis was laid for the further study of the genetic mechanism underlying the strong milk-production traits of sheep.

AB  - Informative species abundance estimates are critical for guiding decisions around the conservation and management of ecological systems. There exist many methods for estimating abundance of frequently encountered species and populations with uniquely identifiable individuals. However, for wildlife populations with unmarked individuals that occur at low densities, there exist a variety of behaviors and characteristics that make effectively surveying and sampling challenging or uninformative. Examples of challenging characteristics include the elusive behaviors of low-density species that occur in complex and rugged terrain. Such characteristics make detection difficult and surveys expensive, dangerous, and potentially biased. To address these challenges, we used a common, non-invasive field survey method combined with a probability-based study design and frequently utilized statistical model to estimate abundance of an unmarked mountain goat population in eastern Idaho. We developed a novel data analysis approach using an N-mixture model that, together with spatially balanced random sampling and a double-observer field data collection method, directly solves the problem of approximating statistical assumptions, including population closure. We demonstrate that a probability-based sampling design not only is feasible, but also is important for estimating population parameters for unmarked and low-density species. With this approach, we present a procedure that offers unbiased abundance estimates, empowering managers to track low-density species' population trends across time.

AB  - The Coyote (Canis latrans) is one of the most studied species in North America with at least 445 papers on its diet alone. While this research has yielded excellent reviews of what coyotes eat, it has been inadequate to draw deeper conclusions because no synthesis to date has considered prey availability. We accounted for prey availability by investigating the prey selection of coyotes across its distribution using the traditional Jacobs' index method, as well as the new iterative preference averaging (IPA) method on scats and biomass. We found that coyotes selected for Dall's Sheep (Ovis dalli), White-tailed Deer (Odocoileus virginianus), Eastern Cottontail Rabbit (Sylvilagus floridanus), and California Vole (Microtus californicus), which yielded a predator-to-preferred prey mass ratio of 1:2. We also found that coyotes avoided preying on other small mammals, including carnivorans and arboreal species. There was strong concordance between the traditional and IPA method on scats, but this pattern was weakened when biomass was considered. General linear models revealed that coyotes preferred to prey upon larger species that were riskier to hunt, reflecting their ability to hunt in groups, and were least likely to hunt solitary species. Coyotes increasingly selected Mule Deer (O. hemionus) and Snowshoe Hare (Lepus americanus) at higher latitudes, whereas Black-tailed Jackrabbit (L. californicus) were increasingly selected toward the tropics. Mule Deer were increasingly selected at higher coyote densities, while Black-tailed Jackrabbit were increasingly avoided at higher coyote densities. Coyote predation could constrain the realized niche of prey species at the distributional limits of the predator through their increased efficiency of predation reflected in increased prey selection values. These results are integral to improved understandings of Coyote ecology and can inform predictive analyses allowing for spatial variation, which ultimately will lead to better understandings about the ecological role of the coyote across different ecosystems.
   Coyotes preferentially prey on Dall's Sheep, White-tailed Deer, Eastern Cottontail Rabbit, and California Vole, while they avoid depredating small mammals, carnivorans, and arboreal species. These prey preferences reflect their predatory behavioral flexibility in being able to hunt alone or in groups. Understanding predator-prey preferences enables us to begin predicting their responses to variation in bottom-up dietary resources.
   El coyote (Canis latrans) es una de las especies mas estudiadas en America del Norte con al menos 445 articulos solo sobre su dieta. Si bien esta investigacion ha producido excelentes revisiones de lo que comen los coyotes, no ha sido adecuada para sacar conclusiones mas profundas porque ninguna sintesis hasta la fecha ha considerado la disponibilidad de presas. Tomamos en cuenta la disponibilidad de presas al investigar la seleccion de presas de los coyotes a lo largo de la distribucion de la especie utilizando el metodo tradicional del indice de Jacobs, asi como el nuevo metodo iterativo de promedio de preferencia sobre excrementos y biomasa. Descubrimos que los coyotes seleccionados para la oveja de Dall (Ovis dalli), el venado de cola blanca (Odocoileus virginianus), los conejos de rabo blanco del este (Sylvilagus floridanus) y los campanoles de California (Microtus californicus), produjeron una proporcion de masa de depredador a presa preferida de 1:2. Tambien encontramos que los coyotes evitaban depredar a otros mamiferos pequenos, incluidos los carnivoros y las especies arboreas. Hubo una fuerte concordancia entre el metodo de promedio de preferencia tradicional e iterativo en los excrementos, pero este patron se debilito cuando se considero la biomasa. Los modelos lineales generales revelaron que los coyotes preferian cazar especies mas grandes que eran mas riesgosas de cazar, lo que reflejaba su capacidad para cazar en grupos, y era menos probable que cazaran especies solitarias. Los coyotes seleccionaron cada vez mas al venado bura (O. hemionus) y la liebre con raquetas de nieve (Lepus americanus) en latitudes mas altas, mientras que la liebre de cola negra (L. californicus) fue seleccionada cada vez mas hacia los tropicos. El venado bura se seleccionaba cada vez mas en densidades mas altas de coyotes, mientras que la liebre de cola negra se evitaba cada vez mas en densidades mas altas de coyotes. La depredacion de los coyotes podria restringir el nicho realizado de las especies de presa en los limites de distribucion de las especies de depredadores a traves de su mayor eficiencia de depredacion reflejada en mayores valores de seleccion de presas. Estos resultados son parte integral de una mejor comprension de la ecologia del coyote y pueden informar analisis predictivos que permitan la variacion espacial, lo que en ultima instancia conducira a una mejor comprension sobre el papel ecologico del coyote en diferentes ecosistemas.

AB  - The present range of Massoutiera mzabi is restricted to deserts and semi-deserts of the northern and Central Sahara, and discontinuously to Air Massif and Adrar of Ifoghas. Vegetation seems to be the second main driver of occurrence of this herbivorous rodent, so we investigated its diet selection by comparing the contents of faeces collected from two stations of the national parks of Ahaggar (Chaabet Tidekatine) and Tassili n'Ajjers (Oued Izarwaz) to the availability of plants nearby. The diet included a total of 25 plant species, 14 from Chaabet Tidekatine and 20 from Oued Izarwaz. In Chaabet Tidekatine, Zygophyllaceae (mainly Fagonia glutinosa and Fagonia bruguieri) over Asteraceae (Pulicaria incisa) and Poaceae (Stipagrostis). In Oued Izarwaz, the most consumed plant species were Asteraceae (Pulicaria crispa and P. incisa), Poaceae (Stipagrostis pungens) and Capparidaceae (Cleome amblyocarpa). Overall, M. mzabi diet appeared to be influenced more by the diversity than by the availability of vegetation. Seasonal variations in diet indicate that this rodent eats perennial and ambivalent vegetation throughout the year and opportunistically consumes annual plants mainly in the spring, with the exception of P. incisa and P. crispa which were eaten throughout the year.

AB  - This study aimed to investigate effects of continuous low-speed biogas agitation on the anaerobic digestion (AD) performance and microbial community of high-solids pig manure (total solids content of 10%). Our results reveal that at a biogas agitation intensity of 1.10 L/g feed VS/d, CH4 production increased by 16.67% compared to the non-agitated condition, the removal efficiency of H2S reached 63.18%, and the abundance of Methanosarcina was the highest. The presence of Hungateiclostridiaceae was associated with H2S concentrations. An increasing biogas agitation intensity led to an elevated pH and a decreased oxidation-reduction potential (ORP). Acetate concentrations, pH, and ORP values indicated changes in H2S concentrations. Sedimentibacter demonstrates the potential to indicate biogas agitation intensity and pH. We demonstrate that continuous low-speed biogas agitation effectively increases CH4 production and reduces H2S concentrations in AD of high-solids pig manure, offering a potential technical pathway for developing AD processes for high-solids pig manure, it also demonstrates that AD process can reduce the risk of pathogen and parasite transmission.

AB  - Muskoxen (Ovibos moschatus) are increasingly exposed to a broad diversity of stressors in their rapidly changing Arctic environment. There is an urgent need to develop validated tools to monitor the impact of these stressors on the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis activity of muskoxen to help inform conservation actions. Here, we evaluated whether muskox qiviut (dense wooly undercoat) cortisol accurately reflects changes in HPA axis activity. Two repeated pharmacological challenges, involving weekly administrations of saline (control group) or adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) during five consecutive weeks, were done on captive muskoxen, in winter (no hair growth) and summer (maximum hair growth). Pre-challenge qiviut cortisol levels were significantly higher in the shoulder than in the neck, but neither differed from rump concentrations. Qiviut cortisol levels significantly increased (p < 0.001) in response to the administration of ACTH during the hair growth phase, but not in the absence of growth (p = 0.84). Cortisol levels in the qiviut segment grown during the summer challenge increased significantly over a six-month period in the ACTH-injected muskoxen with a similar trend occurring in the control animals. Finally, cortisol levels in shed qiviut were significantly higher and not correlated to those of fully grown qiviut shaved three months earlier. Our results show that cortisol is deposited in qiviut during its growth and that qiviut cortisol can thus be used as an integrated measure of HPA axis activity over the period of the hair's growth. Differences in qiviut cortisol across body regions, significant differences in qiviut segments over time, and differences between shed qiviut versus unshed qiviut, highlight the importance of consistent design and methodology for sample collection and analyses in order to account for sources of variation when using qiviut cortisol as a biomarker of HPA axis activity in muskoxen.

AB  - The larval period is a critical stage for many aquatic organisms, because larvae are small, fragile, and have high mortality rates. Amphidromous fish spend their larval stages in the sea, and larval durations vary, possibly reflecting their dispersal tendencies. The genus Rhinogobius (suborder Gobioidei) is widely distributed throughout Asia and exhibits a variety of migratory patterns. Despite some studies of their migratory histories, larval durations of Rhinogobius species are uncertain. This study used analyses of otolith microstructure and trace-elemental chemistry to investigate habitat use throughout the life history of R. nagoyae. Twenty-six adult gobies were collected from seven rivers on Sado Island, in northern Japan, and otolith Sr : Ca ratios were quantified using electron microprobe analysis to infer amphidromous movement. All individuals showed shifts in Sr : Ca ratio across the otolith transect, which indicated movement between freshwater and saltwater. Marine larval duration was estimated by otolith increment counting, combined with Sr : Ca ratio. Larval duration ranged from 29 to 45 days (mean, 35.3), and there were no significant differences among rivers on the island. The relatively short larval duration of R. nagoyae, compared with other amphidromous fish such as ayu and galaxids, may reflect environmental factors such as island size, cool weather or species characteristics.

AB  - The accumulation in the leaves and young stems of phenolic compounds, such as hydrolyzable and condensed tannins, constitutes a defense mechanism of plants against herbivores. Among other stressing factors, chronic herbivory endangers Quercus ilex, a tree playing a central role in Mediterranean forests. This work addressed the connections between the chemical defenses of Q. ilex leaves and their susceptibility to herbivory, quantitative traits whose relationships are modulated by environmental and genetic factors that could be useful as molecular markers for the selection of plants with improved fitness. A search for natural variants detected the polymorphism D165H in the effector domain of QiMYB-like-1, a TT2-like transcription factor whose family includes members that control the late steps of condensed tannins biosynthesis in different plant species. QiMYB-like-1 D165H polymorphism was screened by PCR-RFLP in trees from six national parks in Spain where Q. ilex has a relevant presence, revealing that, unlike most regions that match the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, homozygous plants are over-represented in "Monfrague" and "Cabaneros", among the best examples to represent the continental Mediterranean (cM) ecosystem. Accordingly, the averages of two stress-related quantitative traits measured in leaves, herbivory index and accumulation of condensed tannins, showed asymmetric distributions depending on the clustering of trees based on ecological and genetic factors. Thus, the impact of herbivory was greater in managed forests with a low density of trees from the cM region, among which QiMYB-like-1 D165 homozygotes stand out, whereas condensed tannins accumulation was higher in leaves of QiMYB-like-1 H165 homozygotes from low-density forests, mainly in the Pyrenean (Py) region. Besides, the correlation between the contents of condensed tannins and total tannins vanished after clustering by the same factors: the cM region singularity, forest tree density, and QiMYB-like-1 genotype, among which homozygous shared the lowest link. The biogeographical and genetic constraints that modulate the contribution of condensed tannins to chemical defenses also mediated their interactions with the herbivory index, which was found positively correlated with total phenolics or tannins, suggesting an induction signal by this biotic stress. In contrast, a negative correlation was observed with condensed tannins after tree clustering by genetics factors where associations between tannins were lost. Therefore, condensed tannins might protect Q. ilex from defoliation in parks belonging to the cM ecosystem and carrying genetic factor(s) linked to the QiMYB-like-1 D165H polymorphism.

AB  - Biotic interactions can affect a plant's ability to withstand drought. Such an effect may impact the restoration of the imperiled western North American sagebrush steppe, where seedlings are exposed to summer drought. This study investigated the impact of herbivory on seedlings' drought tolerance for a keystone species in this steppe, the shrub Artemisia tridentata. Herbivory effects were investigated in two field experiments where seedlings were without tree protectors or within plastic or metal-mesh tree protectors. Treatment effects were statistically evaluated on herbivory, survival, leaf water potential, and inflorescence development. Herbivory occurrence was 80% higher in seedlings without protectors. This damage occurred in early spring and was likely caused by ground squirrels. Most plants recovered, but herbivory was associated with higher mortality during the summer when seedlings experienced water potentials between -2.5 and -7 MPa. However, there were no differences in water potential between treatments, suggesting that the browsed plants were less tolerant of the low water potentials experienced. Twenty months after outplanting, the survival of plants without protectors was 40 to 60% lower than those with protectors. The percentage of live plants developing inflorescences was approximately threefold higher in plants with protectors. Overall, spring herbivory amplified susceptibility to drought and delayed reproductive development.

AB  - In mite communities, behavioral and foraging decisions of individuals rely on semiochemicals that they gather from the environment, which contain odors from plants, herbivores, and predators. Because herbivorous mites commonly co-occur with several species of phytoseiid predatory mites, which may engage in intraguild predation (IGP), predator mite decision-making relies on their ability to recognize odors signaling the presence of the herbivore but also that of potential competitors/predators. Here the odor-related foraging decisions of three predatory mites, Euseius stipulatus (Athias-Henriot), Neoseiulus californicus (McGregor) and Phytoseiulus persimilis (Athias-Henriot) (Mesostigmata: Phytoseiidae), which co-occur in citrus, compete for the herbivore Tetranychus urticae Koch (Prostigmata: Tetranychidae), and can engage in IGP were investigated. The composition of the volatile blends associated with the three predators was character-ized. Moreover, the effect of these odors on the predators foraging decisions was measured. Results revealed that (1) the volatile signature of the three predatory mites is species specific, (2) the predators' foraging behavior is affected by hetero-specific predator odors, and (3) predator responses strongly depend on the host plant: mutual attraction and mutual repel-lence occurred in Cleopatra mandarin and sour orange, respectively. These findings have important consequences for the management of systems where these species occur. The odor blends that make predators that share pest species as prey avoid each other could be used to improve pest control by minimizing undesired negative interactions among predator spe-cies, and by locally increasing predation risk on herbivore pest species.

AB  - Tail docking is a husbandry practice widely incorporated in sheep farms around the world. It is an irreversible mutilation that impairs animal welfare, both immediately and in the longer term. The defence of tail docking as a practice is centred around the perception that doing so contributes to the promotion of local hygiene, allowing the use of the wool, facilitating reproductive management and reducing the chances of myiasis, a disease caused by the invasion of blowfly larvae in the tissues of warm-blooded animals. However, current understanding of farm animal welfare questions the need to maintain practices such as tail docking. Thus, the aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of tail docking on the incidence of Cochliomyia hominivorax myiasis in sheep in an experimental flock in Brazil during a six-year retrospective cohort study. Relative risk, odds ratio and incidence rate ratio were the association measures adopted. A total of 4,318 data-points were collected and supplied the analytical model. Tail docking did not decrease the risk and, on the contrary, was found to increase the chances of sheep being affected by myiasis. The results support the hypothesis that tail docking is not a protective factor against the occurrence of myiasis and further fuel calls for a rethink of tail docking being deployed as a blanket measure in the prevention of myiasis in sheep.

AB  - The present study aims to identify and assess the prevalence of cestodes parasitizing the intestines of small ruminants and to evaluate the factors affecting their occurrence in Algeria. The methods employed included autopsy and staining. The results revealed the presence of six tapeworm species belonging to four genera: Moniezia expansa (Rudolphi, 1810), Moniezia benedeni (Moniez, 1879), Stilesia globipunctata (Rivolta, 1874), Stilesia sp. (Railliet, 1893), Avitellina centripunctata (Rivolta, 1874) and Thysaniezia ovilla (Rivolta, 1878), with varying infestation rates. Among the 316 samples analyzed, 36 were found to contain at least one cestode species, resulting in an overall prevalence of 11.39%. Moniezia expansa was the dominant species, with high prevalence rates in both goats and sheep. An analysis of factors influencing cestode occurrence showed that females were more affected than males in both host species. Similarly, younger animals were more parasitized than adults, and the Berber breed exhibited the highest infestation levels. Statistical analysis revealed a significant association between cestode prevalence and the variable "season," with higher infestation rates recorded during spring and summer, making season a notable risk factor. Additionally, several parasitic co-occurrences were observed, with the most frequent being the association of M. expansa and S. globipunctata (50%). In conclusion, given the presence of intestinal cestodes in all slaughtered animals throughout the study period and across all regions of the country, it is imperative that authorities, particularly livestock breeders, prioritize the health of their animals. Improved management practices could enhance Algerian livestock productivity and contribute to the country's economy.

AB  - We conducted a nonlethal feeding experiment to measure diet/hair and diet/faeces trophic discrimination factors (TDFs) in two rodent species fed two diet types. The mean TDFs between diet and hair (expressed as delta C-13/delta N-15) were 2.14 parts per thousand/3.44 parts per thousand for C3 plant-based fodder and 2.65 parts per thousand/3.25 parts per thousand for fodder with 30% animal (insect) matter in yellow-necked mice (Apodemus flavicollis) and 1.66 parts per thousand/4.67 parts per thousand for C3 plant-based fodder and 1.94 parts per thousand/4.49 parts per thousand for fodder with 30% animal (insect) matter in bank voles (Myodes glareolus). As compared with the diet, faeces were depleted in C-13 by about 0.75 parts per thousand and enriched in N-15 by about 2 parts per thousand. All bank voles and only half of yellow-necked mice had regrown hair at the end of the study (day 95). We analysed archived skins of those species and confirmed, that moult in bank voles is more intensive. Our results can be used for trophic studies of temperate-forest rodents and for meta-analyses on trophic discrimination.

AB  - Legume intercropping by biological nitrogen (N) fixation is supposed as a more sustainable way than chemical N addition to enhance soil N availability in agronomy, however, the effects of the two types of N input on soil food web are scarcely determined. To fill the knowledge gap, we conducted a field experiment with randomized block design in an oil-tea (Camellia oleifera) plantation, which included five N manipulation treatment: legume intercropping (Arachis hypogaea and Cassia tora), chemical N fertilizer application (84 and 168 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1)), and the control (no N addition). The soil nematode communities and physicochemical properties were monitored in the seedling, heading, and mature stages of the legumes respectively. The results showed that the legume intercropping significantly increased the abundances of bacterivores and omnivore-predators compared with the N fertilizations. Weighted nematode fauna analysis showed that N fertilization treatments were mainly located in the degraded plot (quadrat IV), and legume treatments were located in the structure plot (quadrat III). Structural equation model revealed that the legume intercropping positively correlated with the abundance of bacterivores and omnivore-predators while N fertilization rate negatively correlated with the abundance of bacterivores and fungivores. Our results suggest that the legume biological N fixation was more conducive to providing N sources to soil organisms than the chemical N fertilizer, which resulted in an enhanced and a degraded soil food web respectively. Thus, legume intercropping is a more sustainable N management practice for the cultivation of C. oleifera plantations.

AB  - Studies of wild boar, Sus scrofa Linnaeus 1758, in urban and suburban areas of Budapest, Hungary, have indicated that these populations do not have continuous contact. Based on the assumption that the city has a discrete population, we hypothesized that the urban wild boar would differ genetically from those in suburban areas. Analysis of single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) data using the GeneSeek Genomic Profiler (GGP) Porcine 50 K system (Neogen, Scotland, UK) differentiated three populations: Buda (B) from the Western bank of the Danube; Buda Surrounding (BS); and Valko (V) from the Eastern bank of the Danube. The coefficient of genetic differentiation (F-ST) for the B and BS populations was low. The inbreeding coefficients of the populations BS and V were close to zero, while population B had a high positive value reflecting the influence of founders and the inbreeding of the continuous urban population. The genome regions that were most differentiated between the B and BS populations were analyzed based on the F-ST values of the SNP markers using a mixed linear multi-locus model and BayeScan software. The most differentiated marker, WU_10.2_18_56278226, was found on chromosome 18. The surrounding region contained several candidate genes that could play important roles in adaptations related to human-induced stress. Two of these, encoding the adenylate cyclase 1 (ADCY1) and inhibin beta A chain precursor (INHBA) genes, were sequenced. While IHBA gene did not display variation, the allele distribution of the ADCY1 gene in the B population was significantly different from that of the BS population supporting the parapatric differentiation of wild boar.

AB  - When pigs cannot perform innate species-specific behaviours (e.g. rooting or chewing), behavioural disorders, like tail biting, can occur. However, it seems that various enrichment materials enhance the pigs to perform exploration behaviour and therefore can help to reduce and prevent tail biting. The aim of this study was to identify such highly explored plant-based enrichment material for undocked pigs during rearing and fattening. Furthermore, we evaluated the impact of the offered enrichment materials on tail length and injuries. Therefore, we continuously recorded the individuals? exploration durations in 20 groups by using an ultra-high-frequency radio-frequency identification system, installed at material dispensers. Lucerne pellets (LP), straw pellets (SP), chopped hay (CH) and chopped straw (CS) were offered in a systematically alternating order for two-week sections, respectively. At weaning and at days of material change (i.e. eight times in total), animals were weighed and scored for tail length losses and tail injuries. For analysis, the changes in tail length compared to the previous section were calculated as ?-tail-length losses. Our study revealed that the different offered plant-based enrichment materials affected the duration of exploration behaviour (e.g. rooting, nosing or chewing) during rearing (4 groups, LME, p < 0.0001) and fattening (16 groups, LME, p < 0.0001). In piglets, exploration duration was higher for pelletized materials (LP, SP) than for chopped materials. Fattening pigs explored materials of hay (CH) more often compared to straw-based materials (CS, SP). Daily weight gains of rearing pigs were affected by the type of enrichment material offered in the respective section (LME, p < 0.0001). The highest daily weight gains were achieved when CH was offered. Exploration duration during rearing and fattening was affected by section (LME, both p < 0.0001 for rearing and fattening). Exploration duration during rearing was highest in section 4 and continuously increased from the first section to the last section during fattening. During rearing, the plant-based enrichment materials affected tail injuries (GLMM, p < 0.0001) and ?-tail-length losses tended to be affected (GLMM, p = 0.057). Fewest tail injuries and ?-tail-length losses occurred when SP was offered. During fattening, section affected tail injuries (GLMM, p = 0.01). Most injuries occurred during sections 1 and 2. Our results show that pigs of different ages seem to prefer different plant-based enrichment materials. High exploration durations do not necessarily maintain intact tails if material is changed biweekly. However, exploration durations can be maintained at high levels from rearing through fattening period by regularly alternating the provided plant-based enrichment materials.

AB  - Human islet amyloid polypeptide (hIAPP) plays a role in glucose regulation but forms pancreatic amyloid deposits in type 2 diabetes, and that process contributes to beta-cell dysfunction. Not all species develop diabetes, and not all secrete an IAPP that is amyloidogenic in vitro under normal conditions, a perfect correlation currently exists between both. Studies of IAPPs from such organisms can provide clues about the high amyloidogenicity of hIAPP and can inform the design of soluble analogues of hIAPP. Sheep and goat IAPP are among the most divergent from hIAPP, with 13 and 11 substitutions, respectively, including an unusual Tyr to His substitution at the C-terminus. The properties of sheep and goat IAPP were examined in solution and in the presence of anionic vesicles, resulting in no observed amyloid formation, even at increased concentrations. Furthermore, both peptides are considerably less toxic to cultured beta-cells than hIAPP. The effect of the Y37H replacements was studied in the context of hIAPP, as was a Y37R substitution. Buffer-and salt-dependent effects were observed. There was little impact on the time to form amyloid in phosphate-buffered saline; however, a significant deceleration was observed in Tris buffer, and amyloid formation was slower in the absence of added salt. The Y37H substitution had little impact on toxicity, while the Y37R replacement led to a 30% decrease in toxicity compared with that of hIAPP. The implications for the amyloidogenicity of hIAPP and the design of soluble analogues of the human peptide are discussed.

AB  - When species are continuously distributed across environmental gradients, the relative strength of selection and gene flow shape spatial patterns of genetic variation, potentially leading to variable levels of differentiation across loci. Determining whether adaptive genetic variation tends to be structured differently than neutral variation along environmental gradients is an open and important question in evolutionary genetics. We performed exome-wide population genomic analysis on deer mice sampled along an elevational gradient of nearly 4,000m of vertical relief. Using a combination of selection scans, genotype-environment associations, and geographic cline analyses, we found that a large proportion of the exome has experienced a history of altitude-related selection. Elevational clines for nearly 30% of these putatively adaptive loci were shifted significantly up- or downslope of clines for loci that did not bear similar signatures of selection. Many of these selection targets can be plausibly linked to known phenotypic differences between highland and lowland deer mice, although the vast majority of these candidates have not been reported in other studies of highland taxa. Together, these results suggest new hypotheses about the genetic basis of physiological adaptation to high altitude, and the spatial distribution of adaptive genetic variation along environmental gradients.

AB  - Most of the forested wetlands of coastal Louisiana are in decline, primarily due to impoundment and increased flood duration. The Lac des Allemands swamp of Barataria Basin was a prime example of prolonged inundation prior to hydrologic restoration completed in February of 2018; the swamp had been impounded for over 60 years. To characterize restoration benefits, eight paired 625 m(2) permanent sites were established close to and halfway between eight 30 m x 122 m gaps cut into the spoil bank of Bayou Chevreuil. During 2018, canopy closure increased by 20%. In addition, aboveground production of wood and leaves increased over 2017 from 2018-2020. Furthermore, natural regeneration has occurred annually and many of the seedlings are now approximately 1 m tall. In conclusion, hydrologic restoration of impounded wetlands in coastal Louisiana is an extremely cost-effective landscape restoration method.

AB  - Pb-210 and Cs-137 dating of bulk sediments obtained from the alpine Blue Lake, located in the Snowy Mountains of southeastern Australia, was applied here to date recent lacustrine sediments. In addition, the presence of Pinus pollen (a taxon introduced in Australia about 150 years ago) down to a sediment depth of 56 cm in the core is used to obtain a chronology for the upper part of the core. Accelerated Mass Spectrometry radiocarbon dates obtained from organic muds from the same core do not agree with the chronology constructed using the three other dating techniques. In addition, optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) dating of single quartz grains, from sediment-core samples collected from the same lake, was applied to date recent lacustrine sediments. The optical age of 185 +/- 20 years for a sample at 60-62 cm depth, and 470 +/- 50 years at 116-118 cm depth are well over 1000 years younger than the ages inferred from radiocarbon dates. We therefore infer that the 'old' radiocarbon ages result from carbon stored for considerable time within the catchment prior to its transport and deposition on the lake floor. As plant decomposition occurs at much slower rates in high altitude environments, these results bring into question the veracity of previously published radiocarbon dates from Blue Lake and alpine lake sediments in general. The deposition ages inferred from the Pb-210-Cs-137 and OSL dating, and the first appearance of Pinus pollen, indicate that for the 100-year period after European settlement (from the mid 1800s to early 1900s) the sediment-accumulation rate increased by a factor of about 2, from 0.19 +/- 0.01 cm yr(-1) to 0.35 +/- 0.02 cm yr(-1). In the 1900s the accumulation rate increased further to 0.60 cm yr(-1). The accumulation rate was particularly rapid in the 20-year period from 1940-1960, reaching a rate 18 times higher than the pre-European rate in the mid-1950s. The increase in sedimentation rate is attributed to changes in land use resulting from European activities in the lake catchment, primarily through sheep and cattle grazing in the Blue Lake catchment.

AB  - Simple Summary Calcium-ammonium nitrate (CAN) has been extensively used as a potential methane inhibitor for ruminants; however, there is still a need for studies focused on investigating its effects on the fatty acid profile and antioxidant capacity of milk, especially from dairy goats. Therefore, we evaluated the effects of CAN on nutrient digestibility, ruminal fermentation, and milk quality of lactating Saanen goats. Treatments consisted of a control diet (without CAN), 10 g of CAN per kg of dry matter, and 20 g of CAN per kg of dry matter. Supplemental CAN did not affect feed intake, digestibility of nutrients, and most ruminal fermentation parameters. Yields and composition of milk were not affected, and minor treatment effects were observed on the milk fatty acid profile. Milk antioxidant capacity was altered by increased conjugated dienes and reduced thiobarbituric acid reactive substances, along with greater concentrations of nitrate and nitrite residues in milk. Calcium-ammonium nitrate can be fed to lactating dairy goats up to 20 g per kg of dry matter without negative effects on nutrient digestibility and milk composition; however, it increased the concentration of conjugated dienes in milk, which may induce its faster lipid oxidation. We aimed to investigate the effects of calcium-ammonium nitrate (CAN) fed to lactating dairy goats on dry matter (DM) intake, digestibility of nutrients, milk properties (composition, antioxidant capacity, fatty acid profile, and nitrate residues), and ruminal fermentation parameters. Twelve lactating Saanen goats averaging 98.5 +/- 13.1 days in milk, 53.5 +/- 3.3 kg of body weight, and 2.53 +/- 0.34 kg of milk/day were randomly assigned in four 3 x 3 Latin squares to receive the following diets: a control group (without CAN) with 7.3 g/kg DM of urea (URE), 10 g/kg DM of CAN (CAN10), and 20 g/kg DM of CAN (CAN20). Each period lasted 21 days, with 14 days for diet adaptation and seven days for data and sample collection. The DM intake, digestibility of nutrients, yields of milk, 3.5% fat-corrected milk, and energy-corrected milk were not affected by treatments. Similarly, there were no treatment effects on the yields and concentrations of milk fat, true protein, and lactose, along with minor effects on milk fatty acid profile. Total antioxidant capacity in milk was unaffected by treatments; however, concentration of conjugated dienes increased, while thiobarbituric acid reactive substances in milk decreased linearly. Nitrate and nitrite residues in milk were elevated by treatments, while the total of volatile fatty acids and ammonia-N concentration in the rumen were unaffected. Collectively, feeding CAN (up to 20 g/kg of DM) to lactating dairy goats did not affect feed intake, nutrient digestibility, and milk composition; however, it may increase milk lipid oxidation, as evidenced by increased conjugated diene concentration.

AB  - Based on genetic studies, a Pleistocene Kalahari "palaeo-wetland", which spanned the region of the Okavango Delta and the Makgadikgadi Basin, was recently considered the geographic origin of evolutionary modern humans. It was proposed that subsequent out-of-homeland migration was induced by climate shifts. The Tsodilo Hills, which are in relative proximity to the Okavango Delta, represent a site of ancient human occupation since at least 100 ka. Local hydrological dynamics were predominately controlled by climate variability and are archived in the sediments of Palaeolake Tsodilo. This study seeks to better understand the Late Pleistocene environments of the ancient Tsodilo people with a focus on palaeo-hydrological settings, which played a major role for their livelihoods.
   Our multidisciplinary approach included different remote sensing and geophysical methods, comprehensive application of differential GPS, and sedimentological analyses concentrating on the lake beds. Four palaeo-shorelines could be identified, three of which indicate highstands during which the Tamacha palaeo-river drained Palaeolake Tsodilo towards the Okavango Panhandle. Two highstands during MIS 3b and LGM are related to periods of largely increased fish consumption by humans as has been documented by archaeologists. The palaeolake was likely most extended about 100 ka ago or earlier, when it covered ca. 70 km(2) and was 16 m deep. A single (neo-)tectonic fault could be detected.
   We assume that the Tamacha palaeo-river was a gateway for ancient humans to reach the Tsodilo Hills from these palaeo-wetlands. The people took advantage of the Tsodilo Hills as shelter from weather hazards and as a natural fortress against predators and elephants. Geologically, the Tsodilo Hills were comparatively calm. They represented a relatively safe haven where the social behaviour of early modern humans could evolve to a higher complexity, which relates to the fundamental question when and where modern human behaviour began.

AB  - Pteridium is a cosmopolitan genus of ferns that possess nectaries on its fronds (fern leaves), thereby attracting ants. Foliar (or extrafloral) nectaries are nectar-producing glands that are not related to pollination, but rather attract ants and other arthropods. Foliar nectaries are found in 101 fern species, belonging to 11 genera and six families. The aim of the study is to characterize the community of ants that visit the fronds of Pteridium esculentum subsp. arachnoideum, as well as daily and seasonal ant abundance in different frond development stages. The study was conducted in the Atlantic Forest of Rio de Janeiro state, Brazil. Bimonthly collections were established, where 30 expanding fronds and 30 fully expanded fronds were randomly marked. In each 1-hour shift starting at 8:30 am and ending at 5:30 pm, the fronds were observed for the presence of ants. Thirty three ant species were recorded on the Pteridium esculentum subsp. arachnoideum fronds, distributed into six subfamilies and 13 genera. The most abundant species were Solenopsis sp.1 and Ectatomma tuberculatum. Eight ant species were observed foraging the nectaries of tropical bracken fern fronds. Ectatomma tuberculatum has been observed feeding on the nectaries and patrolling the fronds. Ant activity peak was on mid-day during the rainy season. The tropical bracken fern Pteridium esculentum subsp. arachnoideum has a rich (the highest recorded until now on Pteridium species) and diverse ant community on its fronds, mainly on the expanding fronds. The presence of generalist predatory ants (Ectatomma tuberculatum and Solenopsis sp.1) during the entire study period suggests a positive interaction between ants and Pteridium esculentum subsp. arachnoideum.

AB  - The nutritional variations of food plants play a significant role in the health and population dynamics of wildlife. The body conditions of vulnerable greater one-horned (GOH) rhinoceros ( Rhinoceros unicornis) in Manas National Park (MNP), Assam, India deteriorate noticeably during the late monsoon to winter, and improve after routine grassland burning, when rhinos feed on the newly emerged leaves and young shoots of grasses. To investigate this, we analysed the nutritional parameters of the leaves of five grass species preferred by rhinos, including three tall grasses ( Saccharum spontaneum, S.narenga and Imperata cylindrica) and two short grasses ( Cynodon dactylon and Axonopus compressus), before and after grassland burning. Leaf samples were collected in triplicate from five different sites in MNP before (September) and after (March) grassland burning. Biochemical analyses showed the highest crude protein content in S. narenga before and after grassland burning. S. spontaneum and S. narenga had the highest and second highest fat contents, respectively, after grassland burning. Crude fibre content in S. narenga increased significantly (p < 0.05) after grassland burning, but not in the other two tall grasses. The total ash content and the acid-insoluble ash content increased significantly (p < 0.05) in post-burning samples of all five grasses. The short grasses A. compressus and C. dactylon showed the highest calcium and phosphorus contents, respectively, after grassland burning, highlighting their significance in the diets of GOH rhinos along with tall grasses with higher proximate nutrient contents, and their contribution to the improved health status of rhinos after grassland burning. This study will be helpful for improved management of rhino health and their habitats, essential to maintaining the progress made in MNP since the 2008 to 2022 GOH rhino reintroductions under the Rhino Vision 2020 initiative.

AB  - Structural variations have emerged as an important driving force for genome evolution and phenotypic variation in various organisms, yet their contributions to genetic diversity and adaptation in domesticated animals remain largely unknown. Here we constructed a pangenome based on 250 sequenced individuals from 32 pig breeds in Eurasia and systematically characterized coding sequence presence/absence variations (PAVs) within pigs. We identified 308.3-Mb nonreference sequences and 3438 novel genes absent from the current reference genome. Gene PAV analysis showed that 16.8% of the genes in the pangene catalog undergo PAV. A number of newly identified dispensable genes showed close associations with adaptation. For instance, several novel swine leukocyte antigen (SLA) genes discovered in nonreference sequences potentially participate in immune responses to productive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) infection. We delineated previously unidentified features of the pig mobilome that contained 490,480 transposable element insertion polymorphisms (TIPs) resulting from recent mobilization of 970 TE families, and investigated their population dynamics along with influences on population differentiation and gene expression. In addition, several candidate adaptive TE insertions were detected to be co-opted into genes responsible for responses to hypoxia, skeletal development, regulation of heart contraction, and neuronal cell development, likely contributing to local adaptation of Tibetan wild boars. These findings enhance our understanding on hidden layers of the genetic diversity in pigs and provide novel insights into the role of SVs in the evolutionary adaptation of mammals.

AB  - Moringa oleifera (moringa) stands out as a promising plant in several segments, being produced worldwide. However, its co-products, particularly valves and seed husks, which represent more than 70% of its fruit, remain underutilized. Therefore, this work aimed to assess the use of parts of the moringa fruit in conjunction with sediment from an artificial pond in a zoo enclosure inhabited by Tapirus terrestris (tapir), exploring the potential treatment of these wastes, using Eisenia foetida earthworms. Five experimental conditions were analyzed, whose waste proportions were varied. The vermicomposts were not phytotoxic and differed regarding the C/N ratio; those that received parts of the moringa fruit had a higher C/N ratio. As commonly observed in stabilization processes, the contents of P, K, Ca, and electrical conductivity increased, while carbon and pH decreased during stabilization. Plant development of Catharanthus roseus was evaluated using, in addition to the vermicomposts, two commercial composts. The vermicomposts provided better development of C. roseus than the commercial composts, with T2 (65% sediment+35% fruit valves) and T3 (50% sediment+35% valves+15% seed husks) standing out as the best treatments. Vermicomposting associated with moringa co-products and zoo waste is a viable alternative via aerobic treatment, favoring waste management and the search for sustainability.

AB  - Forest road use by mammals can vary in response to both the management intensity of the forest roads and the seasonal changes in their environments. We investigated the effects of seasonal changes in heavy snowfall areas on road use by mammals in forest environments with different management intensities. The field survey was conducted in north-eastern Japan from August 2022 to July 2023. Using camera traps, we observed the frequency of occurrence of each species on forest roads, decommissioned roads, and forest interior sites. We employed a generalized linear mixed model to analyse the relationship between the occurrence events of each species and site types and seasons. Red foxes occurred significantly more frequently on forest roads than in forest interiors during all seasons. Raccoon dogs selectively used forest roads in spring and winter. However, Japanese martens, Japanese hares, and wild boar only occasionally occurred on forest roads. These findings suggest that selectivity in the use of forest roads varies among species, and selectivity for forest roads and decommissioned roads varies seasonally.

AB  - Gene family evolution plays a key role in shaping patterns of biodiversity across the tree of life. In Insecta, adaptive gene family turnover has broadly been tied to vision, diet, pesticide resistance, immune response, and survival in extreme environments. Patterns of gene family evolution are of particular interest in Odonata (dragonflies and damselflies), which represents the first lineage to fly, and one of the most exceptional groups of predators. Previous work in Odonata found expansions of opsin genes are correlated with the diversification of the herbivorous insects that Odonata prey upon, but general trends in gene family turnover have not been studied in this order. Here, we show that two families of suborder Anisoptera (dragonflies), Libellulidae and Petaluridae, have expanded gene repertoire related to their unique life history and diversification patterns. These results are an important step towards understanding why Libellulidae is, generally, a species-rich family of short-lived species that are highly tolerant to poor water quality, while Petaluridae is a species-poor family of habitat and behavioral specialists. Specifically, Libellulidae share expanded gene families related to immune response, desiccation response, and processing of free radicals, which all potentially enable many Libellulidae to inhabit low-quality water bodies. Likewise, Petaluridae show unique patterns of gene turnover in gene families implicated in sensory perception, which could be tied to the unique semi-terrestrial lifestyle of the nymphs of this family. Furthermore, Odonata as a whole has a gene turnover rate that is an order of magnitude smaller than other studied insect orders, potentially contributing to the relatively low species diversity in the order Odonata compared to other insects. These results offer important hypotheses for the consideration of evolutionary drivers across Insecta.

AB  - This study evaluated the influence of environmental degradation on the nutritional value of the main marine macrophytes consumed by green sea turtles (Chelonia mydas) in areas with different degrees of urbanization. Macrophyte assemblages in the highly urbanized area (HUa) showed lower richness compared to the lightly urbanized area (LUa) (Mann-Whitney U test: 10.0 +/- 3.6 SD genera and 11.9 +/- 4.2 taxa per transect vs. 20.1 +/- 7.0 genera and 23.5 +/- 9.2 taxa per transect) respectively. Also, diet was poorer with 4.0 +/- 1.6 genera per turtle (vs. 8.5 +/- 4.0 in HUa) and less diverse with Shannon index of diversity = 0.45 +/- 0.29 (vs. 0.64 +/- 0.46 in LUa). Body condition was similar in both areas. About half of individuals were classified as having normal body condition, 14-15% as underweight and 23-34% as being emaciated. Fibropapillomatosis prevalence (chi(2) = 8.720; n = 222; df = 1; p = 0.003) was higher in the HUa but, in affected animals, severity was marginally non-significant (chi(2) = 5.721; n = 82; df = 2; p = 0.057). Significant differences in energy content (kcal) were detected between areas in both summer (S) and winter (W). All ANOVAs on total lipids (F = 22.15 [S] and 30.39 [W]), total water-soluble proteins (F = 327.65 [S] and 64.42 [W]) and total carbohydrates (F = 70.90 [S] and 27.62 [W]) showed high significance (p < 0.001). Carotenoids concentration yielded significant results for Halodule in summer and Hypnea in winter (ANOVAs, F = 39.42 and 13.07, respectively). For both, tests revealed that concentration was higher in LUa than HUa. High levels of phycobiliproteins and proteins in this area probably reflect nitrogen accumulation. Frequency and severity of fibropapillomatosis suggest that urbanization-caused alterations in species diversity and in chemical composition of marine plants affect green turtles' health.
   Light abstract: The use of coastal areas by humanity is widespread and increasing. The impacts caused to the coastal environment, be it terrestrial, estuarine or marine, are important and affect numerous species. Our study evaluated the influence of environmental degradation on the nutritional value of the main algae eaten by the green turtle, one of the very few marine megaherbivores (those herbivores with body mass above 10 kg). Diet in the highly urbanized area was richer in proteins, lipids and carbohydrates (sugars) and lower in carotenoids (photosynthetic and photoprotectant pigments in algae and plants; precursors of vitamin A involved in oxygen transport in animals-animals do not synthetize such molecules). High levels in phycobiliproteins (photosynthetic pigments present in some algae) and proteins in the highly urbanized area probably result from organic pollution and nitrogen accumulation in coastal waters. Nitrogen compounds dissolved in water are a threat to vertebrates due to its toxicity and negative effects on the immune system. Our results suggest that algae chemical composition and severity of fibropapillomatosis (tumors caused by a herpesvirus in green sea turtles) are directly related through environmental alterations caused by urbanization.

AB  - Mitigating the poaching pressure on food webs under multiple constraints (including financial and ecological ones) remains an open problem within conservation. Within this field, mathematically modeling the effects of poaching threats on managerial decision-making is a novel approach. To fill this scientific gap, the present paper uses a security game approach to model the interactions between an environmental manager (defender) and a group of profit-seeking pursuit poachers (attackers) who target species which are nodes of the food web. Based upon the non-cooperative Stackelberg game, the objective of the defender (as leader) is to keep the food web at or near equilibrium through optimally manipulating the populations of an optimal subset of species. In contrast, each attacker strives to maximize monetary profit by hunting an optimal population size of the selected species. The model is validated by a numerical example examining the food web of the endangered Persian leopard (Panthera pardus saxicolor), which lives in Golestan National Park (GNP), Iran. The model provides an overarching biotic intervention strategy to keep the (1 predator-4 prey) food web near equilibrium, while only 2 prey species (the urial (Ovis vignei) and the red deer (Cervus elaphus)) are directly threatened by poachers. The examination revealed that both species population data and poaching data should be taken into account to set effective multi-species conservation prioritization levels. In a sensitivity analysis approach, it was found that, despite the fact that red deer is endangered and preferred by poachers, the deterrent penalty measure should be 1.5 times greater for poaching urial than red deer. The output analysis illustrated that, in order to bring the urial deterrent penalty measure closer to the red deer one, enforcement measures should be about 2.5 times stricter for poaching urial than red deer. The results specifically yield insight into how to optimally conserve a food web equilibrium under poaching pressure and within several constraints.

AB  - For migratory waterbirds, the quality of wintering habitat is related to spring migration and successful breeding in the next year. The availability of food resources in the habitat is critical and varies within water levels. Although the water-level fluctuations in Poyang Lake have been extremely variable interannually in recent years, the wintering waterbird populations have remained relatively stable. Hence, the mechanism of maintaining the stability is worth exploring. This study aimed to compare the distribution of vegetation and herbivorous waterbirds in 2015 - 2016 and 2016 - 2017, focusing on three shallow sub -lakes and one main lake are. The results showed that the emergence of tubers and the growth of Carex spp. provided a continuous food supply and habitat for wintering waterbirds with a gradual decline in the water level. Shallow sub -lakes supported almost all of the tuber-eating waterbirds (1.42 - 1.62 x 10 5 ) and most geese (1.34 - 1.53 x 10 6 ). However, the main lake area, covered with Persicaria hydropiper , did not provide adequate and accessible food. This resulted in almost no distribution of tuber-eating waterbirds, with only a few geese congregating in early winter. Our results demonstrated that the shallow sub -lakes under human control provided a different environment from the main lake and are key to sustaining the successful wintering of hundreds of thousands of migratory waterbirds in Poyang Lake. Therefore, we recommend refining the anthropogenic management of the shallow sub -lakes to regulate the water level to ensure the carrying capacity of Poyang Lake.

AB  - Plant and soil animal communities interact through plant-associated processes. How the interactions between the aboveground and belowground herbivores communities affect plant development remains unclear? In this study, Holotrichia diomphalia Bates, the belowground herbivore grub that feed on the roots, and Rhopalosiphum maidis, the aboveground herbivore aphid that feed on the leaf were chosen as research objects. Four groups were set based on field investigation, including aphid with grub (A & G), aphid (A), grub (G) and blank control (C) groups, and the effects on the host plant corn (Zea mays L.) was investigated. One-way ANOVA and Pearson analysis was performed to process the data. The results showed that, the interactions between above- and below-ground herbivores had a negative effect on corn. Belowground herbivore grubs inhibited the aboveground herbivores of aphids, and aboveground herbivores prevented the increase of grubs, whereas plants regulated population change through interaction with above- and below-ground herbivores, thus reducing the survival rate of above- and below-ground insect herbivores. In naturally occurring populations, behavior of leaf-feeding were influenced by rootfeeders, causing multitude interactions at the same time. In conclusion, it is suggested that there may be a mutual inhibition between different aboveground and below-ground herbivores when the development of corn declined. These findings will contribute to a better understanding on the interaction mechanism between above-ground and below-ground herbivore on the host plants, and have guiding significance for agricultural pest control.

AB  - Arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi are ubiquitous symbionts of most terrestrial plants that can augment plant defences against insect herbivores. A clearer understanding of the mechanisms underpinning community-specific effects of AM fungi on plant resistance to herbivores is needed. Here, we report how plant (Triticum aestivum) phenolic-based resistance to an insect herbivore is differentially affected by inoculation with different AM fungal communities. Plants inoculated with four AM fungal species or with a field-sourced AM fungal community had significantly greater foliar phenolics than plants inoculated with a single AM fungal species (Rhizophagus irregularis) or with no AM fungi. Correspondingly, herbivore performance (relative growth rate) was lowest when feeding on those plants with greater phenolic concentrations. Furthermore, there was a negative correlation between foliar phenolics and herbivore growth. We propose that AM fungal community assembly can drive insect herbivore performance by affecting phenolic-based resistance mechanisms.

AB  - Ninu (greater bilby, Macrotis lagotis) are desert-dwelling, culturally and ecologically important marsupials. In collaboration with Indigenous rangers and conservation managers, we generated the Ninu chromosome-level genome assembly (3.66 Gbp) and genome sequences for the extinct Yallara (lesser bilby, Macrotis leucura). We developed and tested a scat single-nucleotide polymorphism panel to inform current and future conservation actions, undertake ecological assessments and improve our understanding of Ninu genetic diversity in managed and wild populations. We also assessed the beneficial impact of translocations in the metapopulation (N = 363 Ninu). Resequenced genomes (temperate Ninu, 6; semi-arid Ninu, 6; and Yallara, 4) revealed two major population crashes during global cooling events for both species and differences in Ninu genes involved in anatomical and metabolic pathways. Despite their 45-year captive history, Ninu have fewer long runs of homozygosity than other larger mammals, which may be attributable to their boom-bust life history. Here we investigated the unique Ninu biology using 12 tissue transcriptomes revealing expression of all 115 conserved eutherian chorioallantoic placentation genes in the uterus, an XY1Y2 sex chromosome system and olfactory receptor gene expansions. Together, we demonstrate the holistic value of genomics in improving key conservation actions, understanding unique biological traits and developing tools for Indigenous rangers to monitor remote wild populations.
   A chromosome-level genome assembly for the Ninu (greater bilby) and genome sequences for the extinct Yallara (lesser bilby), together with resequenced genomes, shed light on the demographic history of Ninu and inform conservation plans for this culturally and ecologically important marsupial.

AB  - Karst rocky desertification is a process of land degradation that involves serious soil erosion, severe decrease in soil productivity, extensive exposure of basement rocks, and the appearance of a desert-like landscape. Rocky desertification is caused by various factors and is considered a major socio-environmental problem. Furthermore, it triggers a serious threat to the ecological security and downgrades sustainable economic and social development. Unfortunately, in China karst rocky desertification is occurring in tropical and subtropical terrains of South China, especially in the Southwestern regions. Which severely limits local socio-economic development. In this paper, the natural and anthropogenic factors that cause karst rocky desertification are analyzed. To mitigate the severity of rocky desertification, the Chinese government has implemented many ecological projects in degraded regions during the past 40 years; indeed, encouraging results were achieved. In these thorough studies, the "Qing-Long Model" was proven to be a successful model for the restoration and treatment of rocky karst desertification in Southwestern China. This was reached by planting grass suitable for local growth and raising Qing-long goat (capra hircus), a local famous hybrid goat brand, which enhanced the ecological livestock husbandry in the karst mountains. Qing-long model is not only applicable for China, but also to other countries that face similar karst environmental problems as well. Through Qing-long model, China provides a solution to the karst rocky desertification challenge, consequently, environmental problems will be mitigated and social, ecological, and economic development will flourish again.

KW  - DEFINITION
AB  - The blackchin guitarfish Glaucostegus cemiculus has suffered severe declines and regional extirpation throughout its known distributions. While this species and its relative, the common guitarfish Rhinobatos rhinobatos, have been described in the Mediterranean Sea with co-occurring habitat ranges, no research has recorded the existence or extent of these two separate populations along the Israeli coastal waters. Along a particular coast in Israel, Ma'agan Michael, fishermen have reported annual observations of juvenile guitarfish between June to November for the last forty years. Based on these citizen-based observations the main research objective is to establish whether Ma'agan Michael fulfils all three criteria from the literature by Dr Michelle Heupel, allowing it to be acknowledged as a nursery ground for G. cemiculus. The methodology built for this objective integrates biological characteristics data with the identification of a recurrent seasonal distribution. Visual surveys exhibited a significantly higher abundance in Ma'agan Michael when compared to an adjacent area (Caesarea), with 2,096 recorded observations overall. Additionally, using a species-specific modified Catch and Release protocol, a total of 492 juveniles were captured with a beach seine net. During these capturing events, individuals were morphometrically measured and sampled for future genetic analyses. Out of these, 327 specimens were also fitted for PIT tags to track recaptures in subsequent captures. The highest abundance of neonates was caught from August to September each year (2017-2019), and all individuals captured during this study were identified in the field as G. cemiculus, ranging from 20-35 cm in length (85% of captures). Many specimens had an umbilical cord scar (n = 88), with a large percentage possessing visual remains of the yolk sac. For the first time, this study provides an inter-year description of the species Glaucostegus cemiculus present along the Israeli shoreline.

AB  - Bats are highly social animals, and the interactions between individuals are likely to be important to their ecology and conservation. Social structures are affected by the physical environment (spatial factors), as well as varying over time and seasons (temporal factors). Compared with many other taxa, individual bats are capable of moving large distances, so experience a range of spatial locations. They have long life spans, providing opportunities to interact with others over a long period, and are often highly gregarious. Using a long-term data set, we examined the social behaviour, along with spatial and temporal influences, of greater horseshoe bats, Rhinolophus ferrumequinum, during hibernation using social network approaches. Across 17 years, 2808 individuals were monitored, yielding a total of 5952 records at 21 roost locations. We investigated how individuals' life history traits (sex, age and breeding status of females) and the frequency of observation affected social associations and identified factors that influenced the movement of individuals between locations. Older and male animals were significantly more central in the social network, and adult males may act as a link between socially separate individuals within the society. The social network had high nonrandom dyadic structuring, with assortment by age stronger in females than males, and this was likely to be influenced by spatiotemporal factors. In general, higher weighted betweenness scores were recorded in a noncore hibernaculum, suggesting that these sites, despite low numbers of bats being present, may act as locations to connect less-connected individuals, as well as communities. Finally, movements between hibernacula were only associated with the frequency of observation rather than any life history trait. These results illustrate the interconnectivity across sites, stressing the need for appropriate cross-jurisdiction species management plans to be created for species that utilize and move between multiple sites within the landscape.

AB  - Simple Summary: Pneumonia, which represents a leading cause of mortality among sheep, presents a formidable peril to the sheep industry. In this study, we combine high-throughput 16SrRNA gene sequencing and bacterial culturing to meticulously examine the bacterial community present in lung samples obtained from healthy sheep, those with moderate pneumonia, and those suffering from severe pneumonia. The results demonstrate a significant decrease in pulmonary microbial diversity and alterations in taxonomic composition following the onset of pneumonia. Our results suggest that M. haemolytica and Fusobacterium are the crucial pathogens in the sheep pneumonia. In addition, the occurrence of sepsis in severe pneumonia sheep could contribute to the eventual mortality outcome. Taken together, the results of this study contribute to guiding preventive and therapeutic measures for pneumonia of different severities.
   Hu sheep, a locally bred species in China known for its high productivity, is currently suffering from pneumonia. Here, we combine high-throughput 16SrRNA gene sequencing and bacterial culturing to examine the bacterial community in pneumonic Hu Sheep lungs (p < 0.05). The results showed that the abundance and diversity of lung bacteria in healthy sheep were significantly higher than those in pneumonia sheep (p = 0.139), while there was no significant difference between moderate and severe pneumonia. Furthermore, the composition of the lung microbiota community underwent significant alterations between different levels of pneumonia severity. The application of LEfSe analysis revealed a notable enrichment of Mannheimiae within the lungs of sheep afflicted with moderate pneumonia (p < 0.01), surpassing the levels observed in their healthy counterparts. Additionally, Fusobacterium emerged as the prevailing bacterial group within the lungs of sheep suffering from severe pneumonia. Integrating the results of bacterial isolation and identification, we conclusively determined that Mannheimia haemolytica was the primary pathogenic bacterium within the lungs of sheep afflicted with moderate pneumonia. Furthermore, the exacerbation of pneumonia may be attributed to the synergistic interplay between Fusobacterium spp. and other bacterial species. Our results provide new insights for guiding preventive and therapeutic measures for pneumonia of different severities in sheep.

AB  - Novel host plant-insect interactions often arise from human-mediated introductions of potential hosts to areas inhabited by native insects, or invasive insects to regions with suitable hosts. These novel interactions may drive ecological and evolutionary change in native species. Here we investigate the role of the introduction of the prickly pear Opuntia ficus-indica on the demographic history of the native moth Cactoblastis cactorum. The latter became a pest in its native range after the introduction of the economically cultivated prickly pear. We evaluated potential scenarios of long-term population size changes by applying a demographic simulation framework to a large set of high-throughput sequence data. We sampled populations of the cactus moth from regions of historical incidence of prickly pear crop, in central and northwestern Argentina. To shed insight into the shared history of the exotic cactus/native moth system we integrated the historical records of the introduction of O. ficus-indica in South America into the demographic simulation. We also included a null hypothesis of stable population and/or ancient population changes. Our results reveal population size changes in both Quaternary and contemporary C. cactorum populations. Simulations pointed to a recent population expansion that coincided with the hypothesis of the introduction of the prickly pear after the arrival of Europeans in South America. The presence of the new host during the last centuries apparently prompted the expansion of C. cactorum. Overall, our results are of interest to understand the ongoing impact of introduced species and the complex ecological adjustments of native insects that occur with the introduction of new hosts.

AB  - Literature often assumed that prosocial behaviours (behaviours that benefit others with or without a cost for the actor) would have evolved many species to improve the effectiveness of parental care (Decety and Cowell 2014). While this hypothesis is rarely questioned at a phylogenetic scale, it was never tested at an individual scale to the best of our knowledge. Therefore, we chose to study the impact of effective parental care on prosociality by comparing the prosocial tendencies of Guinea pigs before mating, during mating and after parturition. We conducted Prosocial Choice Tests on three groups of Guinea pigs (males, multiparous females, and nulliparous females). Subjects had to choose between three options: a prosocial option (subject and recipient being rewarded), a selfish option (only subject was rewarded), and a null option (no reward). Our results showed high prosociality towards their mating partner and their young both in male and in female subjects. Males became selfish towards other males after parturition. Among other interesting results, we found a direct reciprocity phenomenon. We also highlighted an ability in our subjects to consider both the identity and relationship shared with the recipient, such as tolerance (enhancing prosociality), dominance rank (being tested with a dominant recipient increasing selfish responses), and its behaviour (begging calls eliciting prosociality, while threatening ones decreasing it), to choose an option. These findings suggested that prosociality could be modulated by many factors and that the constraints and stakes induced by breeding would highly influence prosocial strategies.

AB  - Simple Summary Capybaras are the largest rodents cohabiting with humans within urban and peri-urban green areas. Surgical contraception has been recommended as a method of population control in cases of overpopulation and/or zoonotic disease transmission; however, scant data are available on sterilization procedures and relevant surgical anatomy. For surgical anatomic description, eight female capybara cadavers were dissected; the layers of the abdominal wall are described as well as the access to the uterine tubes and uterine horns by a lateral or ventral midline approach. For better description of the abdominal wall, ultrasonography was performed in one (1) living female. The uterine tubes were easily accessed by the bilateral flank approach, whereas the uterine horns were more easily exposed by the ventral midline approach. Given the lack of data regarding surgical anatomy for contraceptive surgeries in female capybaras, this study helps achieve more efficient contraceptive surgeries, both reducing the total surgical time and enhancing animal welfare. Capybaras are the largest rodents cohabiting with humans within urban and peri-urban green areas and are known by their prolificity. Surgical contraception has been recommended by official organizations as a way to control capybara populations in areas of zoonotic disease transmission, but little data are available concerning surgical anatomy. To obtain objective anatomical descriptions related to reproductive organs, eight female capybaras cadavers were dissected. The stratigraphy of the lateral (flank) and ventral, post-umbilical (on the linea alba) abdominal wall is described as well as the vascular anatomy of reproductive organs and their syntopy with the abdominal viscera. We commented on the access to the uterine tubes and uterine horns for each approach, and for better description of abdominal wall stratigraphy, abdominal ultrasonography was performed in one live female. All of the animals were provenient from "in situ" population management projects that were properly authorized. Similar abdominal wall stratigraphy was found in comparison to domestic mammals, with emphasis on a thick cutaneous muscle, a thin linea alba, and a large, loose cecum. The uterine tubes were easily accessed by bilateral laparotomy, allowing tubal removal/ligation procedures, while uterine horn exposure was more readily reached by a midline post umbilical celiotomy, favoring horn ligature and hysterotomy techniques. This study can help achieve more efficient contraceptive surgeries in capybaras, reducing the total surgical time and enhancing animal welfare.

AB  - Dietary preferences of extant reptiles can be directly observed, whereas diet reconstruction of extinct species typically relies on morphological or dental features. More specific information about the ingested diet is contained in the chemistry of hard tissues. Stable isotopes of calcium and strontium show systematic fractionations between diet and skeletal bioapatite, which is applied for diet and trophic-level reconstructions of extant and extinct vertebrate species. Here, we present the first comprehensive analysis of stable calcium and strontium isotopes of bones and teeth from 28 extant reptiles, including lepidosaurs and archosaurs (crocodilians) with distinct herbivorous to faunivorous feeding behaviour, establishing a dietary reference frame. Both calcium and strontium isotopes exhibit systematic offsets between dietary groups, with insectivores having the highest, herbivores intermediate and carnivores the lowest calcium and strontium isotope values. Although the isotopic trophic-level effect is similar to mammals, the absolute calcium isotope values in reptiles are more positive in each diet category. Combining isotopic data with dental microwear texture analysis enables a refined understanding of reptile feeding ecology and the identification of durophagous diets. This toolbox opens new possibilities for improved dietary reconstructions of extinct taxa, such as dinosaurs and other non-mammalian species in the fossil record.

AB  - Grasslands in northern China serve the country as both an ecological barrier and a livestock production base. There, installing enclosures has been becoming the major grassland restoration measure adopted by many local governments. However, the effects of restoration on both ecological and production benefits of grassland remain unclear for implemented grassland restoration policies. Therefore, a representative rangeland in northern China, the Maodeng pasture in Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region was selected as the study area, and remote sensing monitoring analyses were carried out to quantify the ecological benefits and economic benefits from 2015 to 2021. The results showed that: 1) in terms of ecological benefits, the grassland area with a grassland coverage rate of more than 60% accounts for 32.3% of the regional area, and 86.4% of its grassland grew significantly better than the same period in 2015, showing a significant improvement in grassland growth. Using the average amount of carbon per unit area as the ecological benefit evaluation index, it increased by 27.1% to 32.48Tg C/yr from 2015 to 2021. 2) In terms of economic benefits, both theoretical grass production and livestock carrying capacity increased from 2015 to 2021. Compared to 2015, the theoretical grass production in 2021 increased by 24.8% to 71 900 t. The livestock carrying capacity reached 52 100 sheep units in 2021, nearly 11 000 sheep units more than that in 2015. During the study period, multiple economic indicators (on a per capita basis of permanent residents) for the pastoral area of Xilin Hot City to which the Maodeng pasture belongs, have grown steadily. Per capita total income rose from 29 630 yuan (RMB) in 2015 to 62 859 yuan (RMB) in 2021. Relying on grassland resources to develop the pastoral ecology also broadens the potential economic development space. Overall, the establishment of the reserve and the experiment of implanting an enclosure policy have had a significant and positive impact on Maodeng pasture's development from both an ecological and economic perspective. With the support of scientific evidence, enclosure policy can be extended to more than 110 000 km2 of grasslands in northern China with similar precipitation and temperature conditions, enhancing the productive and ecological potential of grasslands. The above research results will contribute to the scientific formulation of grassland pasture quality improvement plans in northern China.

AB  - Aquatic pollution is known to reduce biodiversity and disrupt wildlife populations. Mercury (Hg) pollution is pervasive worldwide, contributing to the degradation of ecosystems, and causing deleterious effects to exposed organisms and populations. Batoids have a life history linked to the benthic substrate of coastal areas and occupy upper trophic levels. These combined with large bodies, long lifespan, and slow growth rates contributes to increased uptake and accumulation of Hg. However, mechanisms governing these associations are not well understood. Using multiple biogeochemical tracers (813C, 815N and total Hg), we describe trophic interactions of three sympatric batoid species inhabiting an urbanized estuary and identify diet sources that contribute to Hg accumulation and trophic position among these mesopredators. We also use the Bat-ray (Myliobatis californica) as a model species, to compare diet composition, trophic position, and isotopic niche between two populations in two Californian bays. Trophic plasticity in M. californica was characterized by isotopic niche, diet proportions, and trophic position estimates using Bayesian statistics. We found diet and local contamination background strongly associated with Hg accumulation, and Hg levels that exceed EPA water quality criterion (<0.3 mu g.g- 1 w. w.) in all studied species.

AB  - Background Preingestive behavioral modulations of herbivorous insects on the host plant are abundant over insect taxa. Those behaviors are suspected to have functions such as deactivation of host plant defenses, nutrient accumulation, or modulating plant-mediated herbivore interactions. To understand the functional consequence of behavioral modulation of insect herbivore, we studied the girdling behavior of Phytoecia rufiventris Gautier (Lamiinae; Cerambycidae) on its host plant Erigeron annuus L. (Asteraceae) that is performed before endophytic oviposition in the stem.Results The girdling behavior significantly increased the larval performance in both field monitoring and lab experiment. The upper part of the girdled stem exhibited lack of jasmonic acid induction upon larval attack, lowered protease inhibitor activity, and accumulated sugars and amino acids in compared to non-girdled stem. The girdling behavior had no effect on the larval performance of a non-girdling longhorn beetle Agapanthia amurensis, which also feeds on the stem of E. annuus during larval phase. However, the girdling behavior decreased the preference of A. amurensis females for oviposition, which enabled P. rufiventris larvae to avoid competition with A. amurensis larvae.Conclusions In conclusion, the girdling behavior modulates plant physiology and morphology to provide a modulated food source for larva and hide it from the competitor. Our study implies that the insect behavior modulations can have multiple functions, providing insights into adaptation of insect behavior in context of plant-herbivore interaction.

AB  - Grain yield is a quantitatively inherited complex trait that is strongly influenced by interacting genetic and environmental factors. The identification of major quantitative trait loci (QTL) for plant height (PH) and yield component traits (YCT) is important for improving yield potential through wheat breeding. We performed a QTL analysis for PH and YCT in the Tugela-DN x Elands doubled haploid (DH) population using a genotype-by-sequence single nucleotide polymorphism and a silicoDArT-based genetic map. Field trials were conducted under rain-fed conditions across five environments in the Free State Province of South Africa during the 2017-2018 and 2018-2019 cropping seasons. Analysis of variance revealed significant differences (p < 0.001) among DH lines and the environments. However, for G x E interactions, significant differences (p < 0.05) were only observed for spikelet number per spike. Broad-sense heritability estimates of all traits ranged between 0.44 and 0.81. Nine QTL, viz. QPh.sgi-6A.2 and QPh.sgi-4D for PH, QSl.sgi-6A.2 and QSl.sgi-7A for spike length, QGns.sgi-3B for grain number per spike (GNS), QGwps.sgi-7B for grain weight per spike (GWPS), QGw.sgi-2A and QGw.sgi-7A for grain width, and QGl.sgi-3B for grain length (GL), were identified on chromosomes 2A, 3B, 4D, 6A, 7A, and 7B, in two or more environments. Some of these QTL exhibited pleiotropic effects. The QPh.sgi-6A.2 QTL for PH and QGwps.sgi-7B for GWPS appear to be novel QTL, while the rest of the reported QTL validated previously identified QTL for PH and YCT. The study also reported a trade-off between GL and GNS. The findings of this study will be useful in elucidating the genetic architecture of yield component traits contributing to the development of new dryland wheat varieties with high and stable yield.

AB  - Simple Summary Low space allowance and mixing may affect productive performance in pigs, but it is not clear whether space allowance and mixing interact with each other during the grower-finisher period. In addition, phase feeding is a good strategy used to reduce feed costs and improve feed efficiency, but it may result in nutrient limitations in suboptimal production conditions, e.g., high stress. This study investigated the effect of space allowance, mixing and phase feeding on productive performance of grower-finisher pigs. Three trials were conducted. Space allowance did not affect productive performance in any of the trials. Non-mixed pigs were 5.40 and 5.25 kg heavier than mixed pigs at 21 weeks of age in trial 1 and trial 2. Introducing a second diet with lower lysine/energy ratio from 0.95 to 0.82 g/MJ at 15-16 weeks of age reduced productive performance of pigs by 3.45 and 4.05 kg at 21 weeks of age in trial 1 and trial 2, but not in trial 3 where all pigs were mixed. In conclusion, mixing and reducing lysine/energy ratio from 0.95 to 0.82 g/MJ at 15-16 weeks of age, had a more marked impact on productive performance than a reduction in space allowance from 0.96 to 0.78 m(2)/pig. This study investigates the effects of space allowance (SA), mixing and phase feeding (PF) on performance of grower-finisher pigs. Three trials (T) were conducted. In T1 and T2, 345 pigs/trial were moved to finisher stage at 11 weeks of age and assigned to two SAs: 0.96 (n = 15 pens; 10 pigs/pen) and 0.78 (n = 15; 13 pigs/pen) m(2)/pig. Mixing was applied to 5 pens of each SA leading to a 2 x 2 factorial arrangement (SA x Mixing). For PF, 2 diets with 0.95 and 0.82 g SID Lys/MJ NE were applied to 5 pens of each SA (not mixed) leading to another 2 x 2 factorial arrangement (SA x PF). In T3, 230 pigs were moved to the grower-finisher stage at 11 weeks of age, mixed, and assigned to 4 treatments (SA x PF; n = 5 pens). Data were analyzed using general linear mixed models. SA did not affect performance (p > 0.05). Non-mixed pigs were 5.40 (T1) and 5.25 (T2) kg heavier than mixed pigs at 21 weeks of age (p < 0.001). PF reduced performance of pigs by 3.45 (T1) and 4.05 (T2) kg at 21 weeks of age (p < 0.001). In conclusion, mixing and reducing SID Lys:NE ratio from 0.95 to 0.82 g/MJ at 15-16 weeks of age, have a more marked impact on performance than reducing SA from 0.96 to 0.78 m(2)/pig.

AB  - Anurans play vital roles within their ecosystems, acting as both predators and prey, and as such they are key food web components in many regions. The La Loma Robber Frog, Pristimantis caryophyllaceus, is found in Costa Rica and Panama, from sea level to 1,900 m elevation. We found one of these frogs being preyed upon by a Rhinoceros Spear Bearer, Copiphora rhinoceros, a cone-headed katydid known from Nicaragua to Panama. It is a large (up to 73 mm long body and wings), yellow-green, heavily spined insect. It is an omnivore, having sharp and powerful mandibles. There are plenty of cases of arthropods predating amphibians, mainly in freshwater systems, however there are very few reports of insects feeding on adult amphibians. This is the first reported case that we know of in which an orthopteran insect is predating and feeding on a frog.

AB  - Simple Summary Coat color is an important phenotypic trait of pig breeds, and a few genes are involved in its regulation. After long-term selection, pig breeds have formed diversified coat color phenotypes (e.g., black, red, white, spotted, brown, belted, two-end black, etc.). To date, several major genes affecting pig coat color phenotypes have been identified. In this view, recent studies suggested a new type of molecular marker known as retrotransposon insertion polymorphisms (RIPs). This marker is considered an ideal molecular marker, showing the potential to be used for population genetic analysis in pigs, with the possibility to be extended to other livestock animals as well. Here, we revealed 42 RIPs in 20 coat color genes in pigs, and some RIPs may be useful in distinguishing different breeds. The diversity of livestock coat color results from human positive selection and represents an indispensable part of breed identity. As an important biodiversity resource, pigs have many special characteristics, including the most visualized feature, coat color, and excellent adaptation, and the coat color represents an important phenotypic characteristic of the pig breed. Exploring the genetic mechanisms of phenotypic characteristics and the melanocortin system is of considerable interest in domestic animals because their energy metabolism and pigmentation have been under strong selection. In this study, 20 genes related to coat color in mammals were selected, and the structural variations (SVs) in these genic regions were identified by sequence alignment across 17 assembled pig genomes, from representing different types of pigs (miniature, lean, and fat type). A total of 167 large structural variations (>50 bp) of coat-color genes, which overlap with retrotransposon insertions (>50 bp), were obtained and designated as putative RIPs. Finally, 42 RIPs were confirmed by PCR detection. Additionally, eleven RIP sites were further evaluated for their genotypic distributions by PCR in more individuals of eleven domesticated breeds representing different coat color groups. Differential distributions of these RIPs were observed across populations, and some RIPs may be associated with breed differences.

AB  - The emergence and dissemination of antibiotic-resistant bacteria (ARB) and antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) are global public health concerns. Hence, measures should be implemented to reduce the abundance of ARB and prevent the spread of ARGs from livestock to the environment. In this study, to clarify the potential of reducing ARB abundance in livestock waste during aerobic composting, the effects of adding heated scallop-shell powder (HSSP) and lime nitrogen (LN) to manure compost on the abundance of several bacterial species were investigated. Several bacterial species (Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella enterica, Staphylococcus aureus, and Enterococcus faecalis), spores of Clostridioides difficile, and various concentrations of HSSP/LN were added to livestock manure. After 24 h, the tested bacteria and spores were eliminated using 2% (w/w) and 4% (w/w) HSSP/LN, respectively. Subsequently, field trials were conducted on a pig farm to investigate the effect of adding HSSP/LN to manure composts. Swine manure and rice husk were mixed with or without 4% (w/w) HSSP/LN, and aerobic composting was continued for 13 days. The results showed that all the tested bacteria were eliminated after adding HSSP/LN, but the abundance of antibiotic resistance genes was not significantly altered. Adding HSSP/LN significantly affected the bacterial diversity in the compost. In conclusion, using HSSP/LN as an additive in aerobic composting effectively reduced the abundance of ARB, including sporeforming bacteria.

AB  - The extent to which species can adapt to spatiotemporal climatic variation in their native and introduced ranges remains unresolved. To address this, we examined how clines in cyanogenesis (hydrogen cyanide [HCN] production-an antiherbivore defense associated with decreased tolerance to freezing) have shifted in response to climatic variation in space and time over a 60-year period in both the native and introduced ranges of Trifolium repens. HCN production is a polymorphic trait controlled by variation at two Mendelian loci (Ac and Li). Using phenotypic assays, we estimated within-population frequencies of HCN production and dominant alleles at both loci (i.e., Ac and Li) from 10,575 plants sampled from 131 populations on five continents, and then compared these frequencies to those from historical data collected in the 1950s. There were no clear relationships between changes in the frequency of HCN production, Ac, or Li and changes in temperature between contemporary and historical samples. We did detect evidence of continued evolution to temperature gradients in the introduced range, whereby the slope of contemporary clines for HCN and Ac in relation to winter temperature became steeper than historical clines and more similar to native clines. These results suggest that cyanogenesis clines show no clear changes through time in response to global warming, but introduced populations continue to adapt to their contemporary environments.

AB  - Simple Summary The cotton aphid Aphis gossypii is a serious agricultural pest. Microbes associated with plants can affect the behavior and performance of insect herbivores and their natural enemies. Phialemonium inflatum and Chaetomium globosum fungi can reduce cotton aphid reproduction when applied as a seed treatment to cotton. We evaluated whether these fungi might affect the interaction between cotton aphids and a natural enemy, the convergent lady beetle Hippodamia convergens. We used dual-choice olfactometer experiments to assess lady beetle behavioral responses to cues from fungal-treated cotton plants in the presence or absence of aphid infestations. In the absence of fungal treatments, males preferred odors from aphid-infested relative to non-infested plants, and females spent more time associated with olfactory stimuli from aphid-infested versus non-infested plants. When cues from fungal-treated plants infested with aphids were assessed, there were no differences in lady beetle responses. The only fungal treatment-related effects involved plants without aphids. In the absence of aphids, males responded slower to P. inflatum-treated plants compared to control, and females preferred P. inflatum-treated plants. Treating cotton with these potentially beneficial fungi had minor effects on lady beetle behavioral responses and would not be expected to disrupt this predator-prey-plant interaction as part of an integrated pest management strategy. Microbes have the potential to affect multitrophic plant-insect-predator interactions. We examined whether cotton plants treated with potentially beneficial fungi affect interactions between cotton aphids Aphis gossypii and predatory lady beetles Hippodamia convergens. We used Y-tube olfactometer assays to test lady beetle behavioral responses to stimuli emitted by aphid-infested and non-infested cotton plants grown from seeds treated with either Phialemonium inflatum (TAMU490) or Chaetomium globosum (TAMU520) versus untreated control plants. We tested a total of 960 lady beetles (480 males and 480 females) that had been deprived of food for approximately 24 h. In the absence of any fungal treatments, males preferred stimuli from aphid-infested plants, and females spent more time associated with stimuli from aphid-infested versus non-infested plants. When fungal treatments were added, we observed that lady beetles preferred non-aphid-infested P. inflatum plants, and males responded slower to plants treated with P. inflatum in the absence of aphids. We found some evidence to suggest that lady beetle behavioral responses to plants might vary according to the fungal treatment but not strongly impact their use as part of an insect pest management strategy.

TI  - Who's Who & Whereabouts: an integrated system for reidentifying and monitoring African elephants
T2  - PACHYDERM
LA  - English
AB  - Monitoring populations of endangered species is critical to understanding the threats they face and to managing interventions to ensure their long-term survival. Individual recognition further allows for essential studies of life history, home range, population dynamics, social behaviour, and photographic capture-recapture, all of which can make conservation interventions more effective. African elephants (Loxodonta africana, L. cyclotis), endangered keystone species, have been subjects of several long-term studies involving individual recognition, yielding critical knowledge for their conservation. Ongoing concern for elephant survival has also led to increased interest in engaging non-scientists in monitoring populations. Tools are therefore needed to easily reidentify individual elephants and to provide user-friendly collection, upload, analysis and sharing of data. We describe the development of the Elephant Who's Who & Whereabouts, a relational web-based database (DB) system, for registering, reidentifying and monitoring elephants. We tailored the DB for studying elephants in two populations: Maasai Mara ecosystem, Kenya, and Gorongosa National Park, Mozambique. The main components of the system are: a searchable database (Who's Who) of registered adult elephants with administration and user interfaces; a searchable database of observations (Whereabouts) including elephant sightings, signs, sick and wounded individuals, and mortalities, with admin and user interfaces; a user interface (My Observations) for entering and editing of data; a Smartphone application (EleApp) permitting collection and upload of data; a searchable Google-Earth-based Mapping interface with export functionality; a Features Guide (photographs and text describing how to identify elephants); a User Info. We describe the system's structure, functionality, and ease of use.

AB  - Childhood obesity is a multifactorial disease affecting >160 million adolescents worldwide. Adolescent exposure to obesogenic environments, characterized by access to high-fat diets and stress, precipitates maladaptive eating habits in adulthood such as binge eating. Evidence suggests a strong association between Western-like high-saturated fat (WD) food consumption and dysregulated hormone fluctuations. However, few studies have explored the long-term impact of adolescent WD and psychosocial stress on brain and behavior. This longitudinal study aimed to investigate the impact of adolescent exposure to an obesogenic diet on stress resiliency and increased susceptibility for binge-like eating behaviors. Adolescent male Lewis rats were given WD (41% fat; n = 40) or control diet (CD, 16% fat; n = 38) for 4 weeks before undergoing a stress protocol of predator exposure and social instability (CDE, WDE, CDU, WDU; n = 16/group). Subjects were provided intermittent WD access (24 h/week) to evaluate binge-like eating behavior in adulthood. Fecal corticosterone and testosterone were measured at four timepoints throughout adolescence and adulthood. WD rats exhibited increased body weight (p = 0.0217) and elevated testosterone in mid-adolescence (p = 0.0312) and blunted stress-induced corticosterone response in mid-late adolescence (CDE:WDE, p = 0.028). Adolescent hormone levels were negatively correlated with binging and explained the variability between adult rats expressing hyperphagic and hypophagic behaviors. These results demonstrate that exposure to WD in adolescence disrupts hormone fluctuations and stress responsivity, with effects persisting into adulthood. This underscores the importance of addressing obesogenic environments early to mitigate their lasting impact on hormone regulation and stress responsiveness.

AB  - Behavioural reactivity is an expression of temperament that may influence an animal's response to stressful situations and impact on handleability and the human-animal relationship. Shortcomings of previously described tests led to the development of a standardized startle protocol in sheep using a tactile stimulus (airblast to the face) and the presence of conspecifics to minimize the effects of social isolation. Here we tested the repeatability of the protocol, the consistency of the response and habituation to the protocol. Twenty sheep were tested across four startle interval test phases. Phases were applied consecutively such that each sheep received up to 17 startles across a six-week period with two to six days between test phases. Phases were; within - up to 5 startles over a 7 min test, Bi-hourly - four repetitions of a single 4-minute startle test 2 hours apart on one day, daily - a single 4minute startle test repeated over four consecutive days and, weekly - a single 4-minute startle test repeated once per week over four consecutive weeks. Three measures of startle magnitude, retreat distance (zone 1-6) and startle duration (s), startle force (gs), were recorded for each startle. A reduction in response to the startle stimulus over time was identified; however, consistent responses of sheep for the measures of startle magnitude were generally observed across test phases. Repeatability of retreat distance and startle force were moderate to high within test phases (0.56-0.82), whereas startle duration had low to moderate repeatability (0.26-0.50). Strong consistency in individual responses, good repeatability, and the presence of a distinct startle response after repeated applications of the stimulus indicate that the startle test shows promise as a measure of reactive temperament in sheep. Further development to improve the tests access in commercial environments may also facilitate producers use of startle magnitude for the selection of less reactive temperaments to improve handleability, safety and welfare on farm.

AB  - The diurnal bees, lepidopterans, and other pollinators are among the most studied flower-visiting insect taxa. They mostly play distinct functions in temperate grasslands and ecotones of grassland-forest mosaics (such as in forest steppes). Although orthopterans are widely distributed in these habitats, however, their flower visitation is nearly unknown, especially in the temperate zone. During the development of traps with chemical lures to catch Lepidoptera pests, large numbers of Orthoptera were caught that provide a chance for studying the flower visitation and odor and indirectly the host plant preference of seven temperate zone Tettigoniidae species. Data on the attractivity of isoamyl alcohol-based semisynthetic lures for Meconema thalassinum and efficiency of phenylacetaldehyde-based lures on Leptophyes albovittata and Phaneroptera falcata were reported for the first time. Additionally, analysis of nature photos collected from internet sources, as part of a passive citizen science also supports the revealed preference of these species. Based on photos, the studied orthopterans mainly visit Asteraceae species including the most preferred Tanacetum vulgare, Pulicaria dysenterica, Achillea millefolium, Solidago canadensis, and Centaurea scabiosa. Based on catches of volatile traps, the first data were recorded on the attractivity of phenylacetaldehyde- and isoamyl alcohol-based lures on three temperate zone Orthoptera species. Results of a passive citizen science study strengthen these results that may increase the knowledge on the host plant and habitat preference of Orthoptera species.

AB  - Nurturing goat is a traditional profession of marginal farmers and landless workers in different regions of under-developed countries. The present study was conducted to determine the effect of vitamin E and selenium (Se) on physiological and hormonal status of Damani goat in Dera Ismail Khan, under high ambient temperature. Forty Damani healthy, non-pregnant goats having similar initial body weight were selected. The diets of goats in the treated groups were supplemented with Se (0.3 mg/Kg) and vitamin E (50 mg/Kg) for 4 weeks. Twenty non-Damani local goats were as control and were not supplemented with Se and vitamin E in diet. It was observed that the mean values of TSH, T3 and T4 were significantly higher in control than experimental Damani breed. Similarly, the mean values of cortisol were comparatively higher in control breed than Damani experimental group, showing that Damani breed was more prone to heat stress conditions than control group and that oxidative stress, induced by heat stress, may have a negative effect on the availability of Se, which accordingly resulted in reduced synthesis of thyroid hormones. Beside that the concentrations of total protein, cholesterol, albumin and glucose were found significantly higher in Damani breed than control group, indicating that Damani breed had comparatively better adaptive capabilities in preparing the internal physiology and metabolic processes in response to heat-stress environmental conditions. Hence, vitamin E, in combination with Se improved the physiological and biochemical profile of blood in Damani goat.

AB  - Nesting is a normal, evolutionary conserved rodent behavioural phenotype that is expressed for purposes of breeding, safety, and thermal regulation. Further, nesting is commonly assessed as marker of overall rodent health and wellbeing, with poorer nesting performance generally proposed to resemble a worse state of health. Deer mice can be bidirectionally separated with 30 % of mice presenting with excessively large nesting behaviour (LNB). All laboratory-housed deer mice are exposed to identical environmental conditions. Thus, the functional purpose of LNB remains unknown. Considering the evolutionary functions of nesting, we hypothesized that LNB will be related to an inflated drive to breed and nurse offspring. After breeding two generations of offspring from six 'normal' nesting (NNB) and seven LNB expressing pairs, our data showed that while as fertile as NNB expressing pairs, offspring survival of LNB mice were notably worse (67.9 % vs. 98.3 %). In conclusion, variance in nesting behaviour should be considered when animal health and wellbeing is considered, since it may point to underlying biobehavioural perturbations.

AB  - Alcohol use during adolescence coincides with elevated risks of stress-related impairment in adults, particularly via disrupted developmental trajectories of vulnerable corticolimbic and mesolimbic systems involved in fear processing. Prior work has investigated the impact of binge-like alcohol consumption on adult fear and stress, but less is known about whether voluntarily consumed alcohol imparts differential effects based on adolescence phases and biological sex. Here, adolescent male and female Long Evans rats were granted daily access to alcohol (15%) during either early (Early-EtOH; P25-45) or late adolescence (Late-EtOH; P45-55) using a modified drinking-in-the-dark design. Upon adulthood (P75-80), rats were exposed to a three-context (ABC) fear renewal procedure. We found that male and female Early-EtOH rats showed faster acquisition of fear but less freezing during early phases of extinction and throughout fear renewal. In the extinction period specifically, Early-EtOH rats showed normal levels of freezing in the presence of fear-associated cues, but abnormally low freezing immediately after cue offset, suggesting a key disruption in contextual processing and/or novelty seeking brought by early adolescent binge consumption. While the effects of alcohol were most pronounced in the Early-EtOH rats (particularly in females), Late-EtOH rats displayed some changes in fear behavior including slower fear acquisition, faster extinction, and reduced renewal compared with controls, but primarily in males. Our results suggest that early adolescence in males and females and, to a lesser extent, late adolescence in males is a particularly vulnerable period wherein alcohol use can promote stress-related dysfunction in adulthood. Furthermore, our results provide multiple bases for future research focused on developmental correlates of alcohol mediated disruption in the brain.

AB  - The sustainability of all productive activities, including livestock farming, becomes a fundamental challenge in the current scenario. Livestock production faces both old and new challenges related to climate change, food safety, and feed-food competition. The latter aspect has recently become a hot topic, and many researchers are turning their attention to this issue. According to circular economy principles, former foodstuffs have characteristics that make them a promising source of raw material for animal feed. The main objective of the present review is to provide a brief overview of the most recent studies (published between 2016 and 2022) addressing the dietary inclusion of former foodstuffs for livestock. The articles analyzed cover key findings from both in vitro and in vivo studies of former foodstuffs included in the diets for pigs, cows, and broilers, and assess the associated safety aspects. The articles provide information on livestock performances and product quality, as well as feed digestibility, fecal microbiota, and blood analysis. Although the evidence supports the inclusion of former foodstuffs in livestock diets as a safe, effective, and sustainable ingredient, this analysis of the most recent literature also highlights gaps in our knowledge that need to be filled. The present overview will help researchers plan future research and standardize and promote the inclusion of former food products in livestock diets.

AB  - Rickettsia rickettsii is the etiological agent of Rocky Mountain spotted fever, which is an important tick-borne zoonosis and, in Brazil, it causes Brazilian spotted fever, which has high lethality rate. This study aimed to evaluate a synthetic peptide corresponding to a segment of the outer membrane protein A (OmpA) as an antigen in a serological test for the diagnosis of rickettsial infections. The amino acid sequence of the peptide was selected by predicting B cell epitopes using B Cell Epitope Prediction (Immune Epitope Database and Analysis Resource) and Epitopia and OmpA sequences of Rickettsia rickettsii strain 'Brazil' and Rickettsia parkeri strains 'Maculatum 20' and 'Portsmouth'. A peptide with amino acid sequence common to both Rickettsia species was synthesized and arbitrarily named OmpA-pLMC. To evaluate this peptide in enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), serum samples of capybara (Hydrochoerus hydrochaeris), horse (Equus caballus), and opossum (Didelphis albiventris) that had been previously tested by indirect immunofluorescence assay (IFA) for rickettsial infection were separated into IFA-positive and IFA-negative groups and used in the assay. There were no significant differences in ELISA optical density (OD) values between IFA-positive and IFA-negative groups with horse samples. The mean OD values were significantly higher in the IFA-positive capybara serum samples (IFA-pos vs. IFA-neg = 2.389 +/- 0.761 vs. 1.760 +/- 0.840). However, receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis did not show significant diagnostic parameters. On the other hand, 12 out of 14 (85.7%) opossum samples of the IFA-positive group showed reactivity in ELISA, and this was significantly higher than of the IFA-negative group (0.7196 +/- 0.440 vs. 0.2318 +/- 0.098, respectively; 85.7% sensitivity, 100% specificity). Therefore, our results show that OmpA-pLMC has a potential to be used in immunodiagnostic assays to detect spotted fever group rickettsial infections.

AB  - Semi-captive elephants have been extensively used in the tourism sector in Myanmar. However, these elephants have not been provided with the range of habitats they require, resulting in increased Human-Elephant Conflict (HEC) within the local community. In addition, there are very limited studies on the assessment of their home ranges, habitat preferences, and preferred food plants. We aimed to address three research questions: (1) What is the size of semi-captive elephants' daily home range? (2) In which habitat types do they prefer to stay? (3) What are their preferred food plants? We fitted GPS devices on the six semi-captive elephants 3-4 times a month in three study sites over seven months. The sample collection of food plants was carried out at each site. The results indicated that the mean average size of the daily home range for semi-captive elephants was 0.90 km2 (95% KDE), with a range of 0.38 to 2.38 km2. We found that the habitat provided for semi-captive elephants was not large enough to be inhabited. The analysis of habitat selection showed that elephants prefer to use secondary forests. The Poaceae family was found to be the main food taxon. We suggest that more areas be provided around elephant camps and that the currently permitted habitats be protected from land use that overlaps with other forestry operations.

AB  - Molecular analyses of rapidly radiating groups often reveal incongruence between gene trees. This mainly results from incomplete lineage sorting, introgression, and gene tree estimation error, which complicate the estimation of phylogenetic relationships. In this study, we reconstruct the phylogeny of Theaceae using 348 nuclear loci from 68 individuals and two outgroup taxa. Sequence data were obtained by target enrichment using the recently released Angiosperm 353 universal probe set applied to herbarium specimens. The robustness of the topologies to variation in data quality was established under a range of different filtering schemes, using both coalescent and concatenation approaches. Our results confirmed most of the previously hypothesized relationships among tribes and genera, while clarifying additional interspecific relationships within the rapidly radiating genus Camellia. We recovered a remarkably high degree of gene tree heterogeneity indicative of rapid radiation in the group and observed cytonuclear conflicts, especially within Camellia. This was especially pronounced around short branches, which we primarily associate with gene tree estimation error. Our analysis also indicates that incomplete lineage sorting (ILS) contributed to gene-tree conflicts and accounted for approximately 14 % of the explained variation, whereas inferred introgression levels were low. Our study advances the understanding of the evolution of this important plant family and provides guidance on the application of target capture methods and the evaluation of key processes that influence phylogenetic discordances.

AB  - To determine the pivotal microorganisms affecting intramuscular fat (IMF) accumulation in Min pigs and to discern the extent of the influence exerted by various intestinal segments on IMF-related traits, we sequenced 16S rRNA from the contents of six intestinal segments from a high IMF group (Group H) and a low IMF group (Group L) of Min pigs weighing 90 +/- 1 kg. We then compared their diversity and disparities in bacterial genera. Group H exhibited considerably higher alpha diversity in the jejunum and colon than Group L (p < 0.05). When 95% confidence levels were considered, the main beta diversity components for the ileum, caecum, and colon within Groups H and L exhibited absolute segregation. Accordingly, 31 differentially abundant genera across Group H were pinpointed via LEfSe and the Wilcoxon test (p < 0.05) and subsequently scrutinised based on their distribution and abundance across distinct intestinal segments and their correlation with IMF phenotypes. The abundances of Terrisporobacter, Acetitomaculum, Bacteroides, Fibrobacter, Treponema, Akkermansia, Blautia, Clostridium sensu stricto 1, Turicibacter, Subdoligranulum, the [Eubacterium] siraeum group, and dgA 11 gut groups were positively correlated with IMF content (p < 0.05), whereas those of Bacillus, the Lachnospiraceae NK4A136 group, Streptococcus, Roseburia, Solobacterium, Veillonella, Lactobacillus, the Rikenellaceae RC9 gut group, Anaerovibrio, and the Lachnospiraceae AC2044 group were negatively associated with IMF content (p < 0.05). Employing PICRUSt2 for predicting intergenic metabolic pathways that differ among intestinal microbial communities revealed that within the 95% confidence interval the colonic microbiome was enriched with the most metabolic pathways, including those related to lipid metabolism. The diversity results, bacterial genus distributions, and metabolic pathway disparities revealed the colonic segment as an influential region for IMF deposition.

AB  - Brushtail possums (Trichosurus vulpecula) are becoming increasingly recognized as key members of local scavenger guilds in Australia. Yet, our understanding of the spatiotemporal scavenging dynamics of this mainly herbivorous marsupial species remains limited. We investigated abiotic and biotic factors influencing possum carcass use across an alpine and temperate bioregion in Australia. Using camera traps set on experimentally placed kangaroo carcasses, we first examined the influence of both open and closed canopy habitats and warm and cool seasons on possum scavenging behaviour across both bioregions. While scavenging was minimal in open habitats across both bioregions-likely a reflection of possums being an arboreal species-seasonality did significantly influence possum activity. Possums scavenged on carcasses in temperate regions entirely during cooler months. Scavenging was recorded year-round in the alpine region, but with total possum feeding time on carcasses 5.9 times higher in cooler months. A more detailed 12-month study in the alpine region confirmed this strong seasonal influence on possum scavenging, with possums up to 5.4 times more likely to discover carcasses in winter and spend up to 6.7 times longer feeding on carcasses during this season. The variability in possum scavenging behaviour between bioregions and seasons highlights the spatiotemporal complexity of possum scavenging behaviour and the importance of considering abiotic and biotic factors to understand the behaviours of scavengers more broadly. Recognizing primarily herbivorous animals as important yet often overlooked members of local scavenger guilds can help advance our understanding of complex scavenging networks and the intricate pathways through which energy flows in ecosystems, both in Australia and in other systems. Improving our understanding of the spatiotemporal scavenging dynamics of typically herbivorous species may also help to inform more nuanced and effective wildlife management strategies, where supplementary foraging on atypical food resources poses conservation concerns.
   Although considered primarily herbivorous, brushtail possums (Trichosurus vulpecula) are increasingly becoming recognised as key members of local scavenger guilds in Australia. However, our understanding of the spatiotemporal scavenging dynamics of this mainly herbivorous marsupial species remains limited. In investigated abiotic and biotic factors influencing possum carcass use across an alpine and temperate bioregion in Australia we demonstrate that possum scavenging is not only widespread, but varies based on location, habitat, and season.image

AB  - Among ungulates, capital breeding males, especially in highly dimorphic species, support higher reproductive costs than females. Roe deer, a relatively monomorphic species, is defined as an 'income breeder', using a concurrent intake of energy from forage to pay for a reproductive attempt. In a Northern Apennines (Arezzo province, Tuscany, Central Italy) population, we detected sexual dimorphism in adult roe deer according to average body mass (males 11% heavier than females), mandible size (male mandibles are 2% longer than female ones), and tooth measurements (first lower molar 10% higher and mandible cheek teeth row 4% longer in males than in females, providing males with a larger surface for chewing). In our study, body mass and body condition of roe deer males decreased with increasing tooth wear as in females. However, males started losing weight at a lower tooth wear level than females; after losing about 15% (similar to 3.2 kg) of body mass they had greater probability of death than females. For low-dimorphic species like roe deer, these findings raise new considerations about the role of sexual dimorphism in feed intake efficiency.

AB  - "Boar taint" compounds influence the sexual behavioral responses of sows and stimulate their reproduction. This paper reports a fast, easier, and a non-invasive analytical method for the analysis of three "boar taint" compounds in boar' saliva samples: androstenone, androsten-3 alpha-ol, and androsten-38-ol. This method was developed and validated based on solid-phase extraction (SPE) and multidimensional gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (MDGC-MS). All the compounds were detected without derivatization. This method affords good reproducibility (4%-8%), accuracy (80%-105%), precision (5.5%-9.1%), linearity (R2 = 0.98-0.99), and lower limits of quantitation (LLOQ) (0.1-0.2 mu g/L). Although the presence of these compounds in saliva has been known for a long time, no simple and easy analytical method has been developed.

AB  - The invasive weed Ageratina adenophora can form a positive symbiotic relationship with native arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) to promote its invasion ability. However, the function of AMF during the feeding of Aphis gossypii in A. adenophora was poorly understand. This study aimed to investigate the effects of two dominant AMF (Claroideoglomus etunicatum and Septoglomus constrictum) on A. adenophora in response to the feeding of the generalist herbivore A. gossypii. The results showed that A. gossypii infestation could significantly reduce the biomass, nutrient and proline contents of A. adenophora, and increase the antioxidant enzyme activities, defense hormone and secondary metabolite contents of the weed. Compared with the A. gossypii infested A. adenophora, inoculation C. etunicatum and S. constrictum could significantly promote the growth ability and enhanced the resistance of A. adenophora to A. gossypii infestation, and the aboveground biomass of A. adenophora increased by 317.21% and 114.73%, the root biomass increased by 347.33% and 120.58%, the polyphenol oxidase activity heightened by 57.85% and 12.62%, the jasmonic acid content raised by 13.49% and 4.92%, the flavonoid content increased by 27.29% and 11.92%, respectively. The survival rate of A. gossypii and density of nymphs were significantly inhibited by AMF inoculation, and the effect of C. etunicatum was significantly greater than that of S. constrictum. This study provides clarified evidence that AMF in the rhizosphere of A. adenophora are effective in the development of tolerance and chemical defense under the feeding pressure of insect herbivory, and offer references for the management of the A. adenophora from the perspective of soil microorganisms.

AB  - Parasitic plants may indirectly modify arthropod community structure by inducing resistance/susceptibility in host plants. In the Atacama Desert, the mistletoe Tristerix aphyllus initiates cascading effects on its cactus host, Echinopsis chiloensis, inducing susceptibility to stem-borer beetles, whose brood chambers are colonized by a diverse arthropod community. We evaluated whether those cascading effects initiated by Tristerix generate a positive or negative feedback loop on this parasitic plant. A positive or negative feedback loop would occur if the mistletoe-elicited indirect effects on arthropod community result in increased or decreased mistletoe fitness, respectively. Specifically, by way of field sampling, experimental manipulation of number of brood chambers, and structural equation modelling, we assessed the indirect impact of number of brood chambers on Tristerix fitness mediated by its influence on the abundance of arthropod trophic guilds (omnivores, nectarivores, herbivores and predators). We found that the number of brood chambers had a positive indirect effect on mistletoe fitness, likely mediated by the increased abundance of nectarivores. The number of brood chambers was positively associated with the abundance of predators, nectarivores and herbivores. However, nectarivores were the only trophic guild showing a positive association with both number of brood chambers and Tristerix fitness. This positive feedback loop, together with the known pattern of specific disperser-mediated cyclic reinfection of cacti by Tristerix, would indicate that mistletoe infection may ultimately threaten cactus survival.

AB  - One of the main obstacles of classical biological control is that biological control organisms cannot be recalled once they are released in nature. It is particularly true for the flowerhead weevil, Rhinocyllus conicus Frolich, which was released as a biological control organism for the invasive musk thistle, Carduus nutans L. (MT). While weevils successfully suppressed introduced populations of musk thistles and other invasive thistle species, non-target attacks have been reported on multiple native thistles including federally listed threatened and endangered (T&E) thistle species. To investigate the foraging behavior of female weevils on invasive and native thistles, we examined volatile organic compounds (VOCs) emitted from MT and a T&E plant species, Sacramento Mountains thistle, Cirsium vinaceum Wooton & Standley (SMT) in the Lincoln National Forest, New Mexico. We used a dynamic headspace volatile collection system and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry to compare volatile profiles between MT and SMT. Female weevils reacted to 7 electrophysiologically active chemical compounds in the blends based on gas chromatography-electroantennography. The behavioral response of female weevils was indifferent when VOCs from both thistles were offered in y-tube olfactometry experiments. Yet, they preferred VOCs collected from MT to purified air. The searching time of female weevils was longer to VOCs collected from SMT over controls. Investigating signals during the initial host recognition of released biological control organisms may open new opportunities to reduce non-target attacks on T&E plant species.

AB  - Testing and documenting effects of wind farm (WF) infrastructure on wildlife are crucial considering increasing development throughout Scandinavia, especially for reindeer, which require large areas for grazing and are vulnerable to disturbances. We present results from 2011 to 2019 for semidomesticated reindeer tracked with Global Positioning System (GPS) transmitters, along with herders' knowledge about reindeers' habitat use and changes following WF development within the Raggonjarga reindeer district summer range in Finnmark, Norway. We tracked up to 36 females (ranging from 19 to 36 individuals per year), from their arrival in the study area in April to their departure in the end of October. We evaluated habitat use before, during, and after WF development at the home range and landscape scales. We also evaluated reindeer habitat use qualitatively based on semistructured interviews with local herders. The herders' reported negative effects of the WF on reindeer, both on general habitat use and intrarange movements, resulting in less use of grazing areas surrounding the WF and increased workload for the herders. The GPS results partly support the herders' experiences. We found negative effects of the WF at the landscape scale, except during summer, where the effect was positive. Results at the home range scale showed negative effects of the WF in spring and summer, but not autumn. Different results at different scales make identifying causality challenging, especially as yearly variation was also large. Different results for summer and autumn may relate to changes in herding activities and larger movement patterns, respectively. Similar and contrasting results from the two methods suggest a need for both sources of data in combination to understand and improve land management. Including herders' knowledge to understand results from GPS data is thus crucial. We also suggest future studies focus on mechanisms behind behavioral changes to better understand cause-and-effect relationships and how effects can be mitigated. (c) 2022 The Authors.

AB  - Orthopterans are an important component of the food chain. The species belonging to the order Orthoptera are herbivores or predators, and several behave as opportunistic predators. However, their predatory habits are not well understood. Here we report the predation of a Chactopsis sp. scorpion by a Hyperomerus sp. katydid in a fragment of terra firme forest in the western Brazilian Amazon. The specimens were found on a 60-cm tall bush. The scorpion showed spasmodic motions of the metasoma while it was being devoured by the katydid. This is the first report of a predator-prey interaction between an orthopteran and a scorpion in the Amazon biome. We believe that records of this type are important to allow a better understanding of predator-prey interactions in tropical invertebrate communities.

AB  - Biological control is an attractive option for controlling invasive plant species that are difficult to manage otherwise. However, the release of a non-native species as a biological control agent carries risks. The most obvious risk relates to impacts on plant species other than the plant species targeted for control. There are, however, also other risks. We report on a potential unintended impact of Dasineura dielsi, a gall-forming biological control agent that was released against Acacia cyclops in South Africa in 2003. We confirmed that the galls formed by D. dielsi on A. cyclops harbor mites in the genus Pyemotes (P. cf. ventricosus) within their gall structures, which are parasites of various insect species, but are also known to cause dermatitis in humans. Sporadic biting incidences have been reported in at least two locations in South Africa. The implications are that manual clearing of A. cyclops may expose humans to itch mites and to risks of bites. Gall-forming insects and fungi are known to create niches for herbivores and other gall-associated fauna. Although every possible food web interaction cannot be predicted, enough evidence exists to require that agent screening to include non-target risks other than those pertaining to non-host plants. Testing only whether agents are compromised by interactions with non-target plant species is not sufficient during agent evaluation. If such associations are known from the native range and therefore can form in the introduced range, then any known risk to health and socio-economic activities should be disclosed. We argue for the general development of objective assessment of such risks compared with the benefits potentially accruing from successful biological control of the target plant.

AB  - As the world's largest pork producer, China is facing substantial environmental pressures caused by pig production and the relevant feed production. The net energy (NE) system is promoted as a new evaluation method to evaluate energy content in feed and energy requirements of pigs, but its application lacks of comprehensive and comparative evalua-tion from the environmental perspective. To identify influence factors and to develop mitigation strategies, the carbon and nitrogen footprints and land use (LU) of pigs (25-120 kg) in China were explored through scenario analysis and cradle-to-farm gate life cycle assessment (LCA). Functional unit (FU) was defined as 1 kg of live weight increase in pig. Among all the procedures of pig production, feed crop production and manure management were the principal contributors to the greenhouse gas (GHG) and nitrogen emissions. As for the carbon footprint, the GHG emissions ranged from 2.37 to 2.55 kg CO2-eq. FU-1 for scenarios using the NE system, 2 % lower than that of the metabolizable energy (ME) system. Cottonseed meal-based scenario generated the lowest GHG emissions, and anaerobic digestion achieved the same effects as other manure management methods. As for the nitrogen footprint, reactive nitrogen (Nr) emissions ranged from 53.4 to 66.2 g Nr FU-1 for scenarios using the NE system, 4 % lower than that of the ME system. Peanut-based scenario won the lowest Nr losses. Moreover, arable LU ranged from 4.63 to 5.85 m2 FU-1 for scenarios using the NE system, 4 % lower than that of the ME system, and economic advantage by using the NE system was also proved. Sensitivity analysis and data quality assessment were conducted to quantify the uncer-tainties of the above models. In conclusion, the application of the NE system in feed formulation was an effective strat-egy to improve the environmental sustainability of China's pig production.

AB  - Species distribution models are valuable tools for conservation management. However, there remain challenges in developing and interpreting these models in the marine environment, such as the nature of the species used for the modelling process. When working with mobile species in dynamic environments, lack of observation is usually interpreted as an observation of absence, which can result in the introduction of biases by methodological (false) absences. Here, we explore the role of absences when modelling marine megafauna distributions. To better understand how the use of absences (or equivalent) affects the niche modelling algorithms, we used a set of 20 virtual species with different relations to the habitat (generalist static, specialist static, generalist dynamic and specialist dynamic) with different encounter rates. We tested six different modelling techniques divided into three distinct groups: presence-only, presence-background and presence-absence. We compared the outputs of the models using traditional validation metrics and overlap metrics in the geographical and environmental spaces. Algorithms characterized the ecological niche for the simulated species differently. Approaches using background data generally outperformed the other methods, suggesting that the non-observation of a species in a given location and time should not be considered as an absence. A very intense (practically unrealistic) sampling schema would be required to obtain a genuine unbiased absence when working with these species and habitats. For highly mobile species, a precautionary approach would be to consider the non-observation of a species as part of the background (a sample of the conditions available in the study area) rather than an absence. A good starting point would be to use presence-background models, complemented with presence-absence and/or presence-only models, comparing outputs from the different algorithms tested in the geographic and environmental space. Improving model performance for highly mobile marine species should lead to better-informed decision making for conservation.

AB  - 1. Plants live in environments where they are constantly, and often simultaneously, exposed to different types of biotic and abiotic stress, such as insect herbivory and water availability. How plants are adapted to abiotic conditions may determine how a surplus or shortage of water affects plant resistance to insect herbivory. More-over, this effect may vary depending on the feeding mode of the herbivore.2. We explored how three closely related Rorippa plant species that vary in adaptations to different water levels, resist herbivory by four different insects (aphids: Myzus persicae, Lipaphis erysimi, and caterpillars: Pieris brassicae, Plutella xylostella) under waterlogging or drought conditions. We hypothesized that plants that are differently adapted to water availability will be disparately affected by water avail-ability in their resistance to insect herbivory.3. On the semi-aquatic plant species Rorippa amphibia, both aphid species reached a larger colony size under drought conditions. This indicates that R. amphibia was com-promised in resistance to aphid feeding when under drought conditions, to which it is less well adapted. Water conditions did not affect aphid performance on the flood-plain species Rorippa palustris. On the terrestrial plant species Rorippa sylvestris, aphids performed worse on waterlogged than drought-treated plants. Neither caterpillar spe-cies was significantly affected by the water availability of their food plant.4. Our findings suggest that water availability can have distinct effects on plant-insect interactions. We propose that plant adaptations to water conditions can be a major predictor towards explaining the variation of effects that water availability can have on plant-insect interactions.

AB  - (1) Estimation of grazing livestock intake is the basis for studying animal-plant relationships and the nutritional status of grazing livestock and has important implications for grassland composition and productivity. (2) We used the saturated alkanes method to determine the feed intake and vegetation nutrient digestibility of livestock at different grazing intensities and in different months. (3) We found that C-31 had the highest concentration in both pasture and fecal output, and the average recovery of C-31 was 77.99%. The different grazing intensities significantly affected livestock intake. As the grazing intensity increased, there was a decreasing trend of livestock intake and the highest livestock feed intake was 6.11 kg DM/day in light grazing. With the increase in grazing season months, the highest livestock intake was 6.67 kg DM/day in the cold period in September. The month also had a significant effect on the digestibility of livestock for all nutrient variables when compared to the grazing intensity. Livestock weight and medium palatability species are more important for livestock intake. (4) Our study provides a more accurate measurement of grazing livestock intake, which can be used as a reference for the scientific management of grazing livestock and the rational use of grazing pastures.

AB  - A comprehensive understanding of the consequences of human interactions with mammals is a critical factor in supporting and conserving species in landscapes dominated by humans, which are increasingly threatened. This study aimed to identify the spatial and temporal interactions between humans and mammals. A non-parametric statistical approach with kernel density was used to detect human-mammal temporal interactions. The species interaction factor (SIF) was applied to calculate the spatial overlap based on the two-species occupancy detection model. The activity patterns of medium mammals were nocturnal, diurnal, and cathemeral. The human-medium mammal pairs with SIF values that were <1 and statistically significant included the human-long-tailed macaque (Macaca fascicularis) pair, the human-leopard cat (Prionailurus bengalensis) pair, and the human-barking deer (Muntiacus muntjac) pair. Based on their SIF values and the high overlap in their activity times, the human-macaque pairings had a high risk of conflict. Barking deer and leopard cats displayed a coexistence with humans via time-sharing activities. Due to temporal niche variations with human activities, the existence of nocturnal mammals was relatively uninterrupted. This study showed that most mammals are able to adapt spatially and temporally to various human activities. Nonetheless, efforts to mitigate human-wildlife conflict must be maintained, particularly in the case of severely endangered species, such as the Sunda pangolin.

AB  - Herbivore dung quality (physical and chemical parameters) varies between animal species and animal diet which is influenced by seasonal fluctuations and farm management practices. Subsequently, this influences the reproductive success of dung beetles. In Australian pasture systems, how the introduced dung beetle assemblage interacts in the field with cattle dung derived from different resources is unknown. This study quantifies the colonization by dung beetles (abundance, species richness and evenness) and removal of cattle dung derived from three common temperate pasture systems (improved native, forage oat and rye/clover pasture, henceforth dung type) over 24 h for 12 months. From the three dung types, 13 species of dung beetle were captured. Abundance and species richness were influenced by month and transect, with weak evidence for differences between dung types influencing overall abundance: Onthophagus binodis (49.7%), Aphodius fimetarius (24.4%) and Labarrus lividus (17.1%) were the most abundant species. Dung removal (organic matter) was influenced by month and dung type, with more dung buried in improved native (23.9 g) and rye/clover (24.7 g) derived dung compared with forage oat (12.3 g) dung. Dung beetle abundance was positively correlated with removal of all dung types, with O. binodis biomass significantly influencing dung removal. This study showed that diet of bovine animals weakly influences the abundance of a local dung beetle assemblage, warranting further investigation on the influence of other dung types in different regions. Improvements to reporting of pasture species and growth stage is recommended for comparisons between dung derived sources.

AB  - A recent review of the management of hyperabundant macropods in Australia proposed that expanded professional shooting is likely to lead to better biodiversity and animal welfare outcomes. While the tenets of this general argument are sound, it overlooks one important issue for biodiversity and animal health and welfare: reliance on toxic lead-based ammunition. Lead poisoning poses a major threat to Australia's wildlife scavengers. Current proposals to expand professional macropod shooting would see tonnes of an extremely toxic and persistent heavy metal continue to be introduced into Australian environments. This contrasts with trends in many other countries, where lead ammunition is, through legislation or voluntary programs, being phased out. Fortunately, there are alternatives to lead ammunition that could be investigated and adopted for improved macropod management. A transition to lead-free ammunition would allow the broad environmental and animal welfare goals desired from macropod management to be pursued without secondarily and unintentionally poisoning scavengers. Through this article, we hope to increase awareness of this issue and encourage discussion of this potential change.

AB  - Background: Livestock production is an economically significant activity in grassland-based production systems with herbivory, a critical process in modifying plant structure and regulating biomass dynamics in these areas.
   Methods: A grazing simulation experiment was undertaken in a semi-arid environment in Kenya to determine the effects of clipping frequency and intensity on the morphology and productivity of Cenchrus ciliaris and Panicum maximum grass ecotypes. The ecotypes were clipped at different frequencies (every 2, 4, and 12 weeks) and different intensities (5, 10, and 15cm clipping heights). The morphological responses of the grass ecotypes and biomass yields were determined.
   Results: The grass ecotypes showed significantly (p<0.05) varied responses to cutting frequency and intensity. Morphological parameters, tillering, and biomass production were all affected by clipping frequency and intensity. The highest dry matter (DM) yields were recorded under low frequency (LF) clipping, followed by moderate frequency (MF) clipping and high frequency (HF) clipping. LF clipping in C. ciliaris ecotype Kilifi was 20% and 31% more compared to MF and HF clipping. No significant difference in yields was found by cutting the C. ciliaris ecotype Magadi at 4- and 12-week intervals, even though clipping at 2-week intervals cumulatively yielded less biomass. There was a biomass yield reduction in P. maximum ecotype Taveta of 23% and 25% for MF and HF clipping, respectively, while for ecotype Isinya, the reduction was 13% and 15% for MF and HF, respectively. Clipping intensity had a significant (p<0.05) effect on cumulative yields in C. ciliaris ecotypes, but not P. maximum. Ecotypic differences were apparent in both C. ciliaris and P. maximum ecotype DM yields.
   Conclusions: The results in this study suggest that clipping range grass ecotypes less frequently (4- and 12-week intervals) and at 10 and 15cm stubble heights results in higher biomass yields. Generally, LF and MF grazing and cutting strategies are advantageous for semi-arid lands. Combinations of frequent and high-intensity utilization grazing strategies should be discouraged as they are likely to lead to reduced biomass yields and negative effects both on grasses and on the environment.

AB  - Parasite species lacking a free-living stage rely on their hosts for dispersal. Their population genetic structure depends on the host's vagility and dispersal rate. To gain more insight into the drivers responsible for shaping the spatio-temporal population structure in host-parasite systems, we used mitochondrial DNA sequences to compare patterns of genetic diversity in two closely related and contact-transmitted parasitic wing mites Spinturnix psi and S. myoti with their bat hosts Miniopterus pallidus and Myotis blythii, respectively, across vast distances in Iran. We observed almost no genetic differentiation between mites living on bats in different colonies even from distant locations, whereas we found some level of genetic differentiation and isolation by distance in each host species, particularly in the less vagrant M. blythii. Despite Iran's high spatial divergence and long distance between the sampled locations, local genetic diversity and inter-population gene flow in the parasites were high, even between different sides of the Zagros and Alborz Mountains. The genetic similarity that was observed among mite populations likely reflects genetic exchanges between colonies at swarming places of bats, as well as the possible occupation of other host species, resulting in a higher effective population size and more dispersal opportunities for the mites.

AB  - Hard ticks (Ixodidae family) are primary vectors of zoonotic diseases, including severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome (SFTSV), anaplasmosis, babesiosis, Lyme borreliosis, and ehrlichiosis. The roe deer (Capreolus pygargus tianschanicus), a key host for tick-borne diseases, is widely distributed on Jeju Island, Republic of Korea (ROK). Although the increased interactions between deer, livestock, and humans have raised concerns about zoonotic disease transmission, this area has remained understudied. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the species diversity of ticks infesting roe deer and the prevalence of major tick-borne diseases in this region. From 2018 to 2020, 1832 ticks were collected from 154 roe deer. Four tick species were identified: Haemaphysalis longicornis (50.1 %), H. flava (47.9 %), Ixodes nipponensis (1.7 %), and H. megaspinosa (0.3 %). This study reports the first detection of H. megaspinosa in the ROK. Pathogen screening detected Anaplasma spp. (minimum infection rate, MIR: 0.38 %), Babesia spp. (0.05 %), and Ehrlichia spp. (0.44 %); however, sequencing was only successful for Anaplasma spp. These findings highlight the importance of continued tick surveillance and research on the zoonotic risks associated with emerging tick species in the ROK.

AB  - The present study was conducted to evaluate the comparative predictive performances of Classification and Regression trees (CART), Chi Squared Automatic Interaction Detector (CHAID) and Exhausted CHAID algorithms used to predict body weights of Awassi lambs at 60-d (W60) and 90-d (W90) of age. For this purpose, 730 Awassi lamb records were collected from 3 base flocks in Turkey in 2014-2016. The potential predictors included in this study were dam age, sex, birth type, flock, lambing season and birth year. In order to determine the best one among these decision tree algorithms, model evaluation criteria i.e RMSE, MAPE, RAE, SDratio, MAD, Pearson coefficient, Coefficient of determination (R-2) and adjusted coefficient of variation (R-Adj(2)) values were calculated. For the prediction of W60 and W90, the best decision tree algorithm was found to be the CART algorithm. R-2 for W60 and W90 were 0.614 and 0.978 and RMSE estimates for W60 and W90 were 0.94 and 0.321, respectively. The influential predictors affecting W90 were flock and W60. However, flock, birth weight (BW), birth type and birth year were found as significant factors for W60. In conclusion, CART algorithm may be a useful tool in describing breed standards of the Awassi for selection purposes in animal breeding. Also, outperformed Exhausted CHAID and CHAID decision tree algorithms in predictive performance to predict W60 and W90 of Awassi lambs.

AB  - Little is known about the bioaccumulation and trophic transfer of total mercury (THg) and methyl-mercury (MeHg) via food webs in terrestrial ecosystems, especially in subtropical forest ecosystems. In the present study, THg and MeHg were determined as well as the carbon (delta C-13) and nitrogen (delta N-15) isotope composition in samples of soils, plants, invertebrates, and songbird feathers to construct food webs in a remote subtropical montane forest in Mt. Ailao, southwest China and assess the bioaccumulation, biomagnification, and trophic transfer of Hg. Results showed that the trophic levels (TLs) of all consumers ranged from 0.8 to 3.3 and followed the order of songbirds > spiders > omnivorous insects > herbivorous insects > plants, and THg and MeHg exhibited a clear biomagnification up the food chain from plants-herbivorous/omnivorous insects-spiders-songbirds. The lowest MeHg concentration was observed in pine needles ranged from 0.104 to 0.949 ng g(-1) with only a 1.6% ratio of MeHg to THg (MeHg%), while the highest MeHg concentrations ranged from 425 to 5272 ng g(-1) in songbirds with MeHg% values of up to 96%. High values of trophic magnification slope (TMS) for THg (0.22) and MeHg (0.38) were observed in plant-invertebrate-songbird food chain, verifying the significant bioaccumulation of Hg, particularly MeHg, in the remote subtropical forest ecosystem. This study confirmed the production and efficient biomagnification of MeHg in remote subtropical montane forest and the significant bioaccumulation of MeHg in terrestrial top predators.

AB  - Graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) has promising prospects in environmental applications. However, g-C3N4 still suffers from its low adsorption performance and photocatalytic degradation activity for pollutants. Meanwhile, pig manure solid is harmful to the environment if it is not properly handled and a huge amount of pig manure solid needs to be processed. In this study, effective pig manure solid/g-C3N4 hybrid photocatalyst was developed through a simple ultrasonic dispersion mixing approach. The characterization results indicated that cationic dye methylene blue (MB) could be quickly adsorbed on the surface of the hybrid photocatalyst because pig manure solid possessed various negatively charged functional groups and larger specific surface area. Due to the tight binding or reaction between the surface groups on g-C3N4 and the organic matter in pig manure solid, pig manure solid could be closely integrated with g-C3N4 after ultrasonic dispersion mixing. Z-scheme heterojunctions could be formed between g-C3N4 and inorganic semiconductors (SiO2, etc.) in pig manure solid, which could facilitate photocatalytic performance. Thus, the hybrid photocatalyst showed excellent performance in MB wastewater treatment. This work not only provides a new strategy for designing effective hybrid photocatalyst applied in wastewater treatment, but also can realize the resource utilization of pig manure solid waste.

AB  - Pollen limitation is widespread, despite predictions that it should not be. We propose a novel mechanism generating pollen limitation: conflicting selection by pollinators and antagonists on pollinator attraction traits. We introduce a heuristic model demonstrating antagonist-induced adaptive pollen limitation and present a field study illustrating its occurrence in a wild population. For antagonist-induced adaptive pollen limitation to occur, four criteria must be met: (1) correlated attraction of pollinators and antagonists; (2) greater response by antagonists than pollinators to altered investment in attraction traits; (3) reduced investment in pollinator attraction, leading to pollen limitation; and (4) higher fitness for plants with reduced investment in pollinator attraction. We surveyed nectar robbery and reproductive output for 109 Odontonema cuspidatum (Acanthaceae) plants in a pollen-limited population over 2 years and used experimental floral arrays to evaluate how flower number affects pollination and nectar robbery. Both pollinators and nectar robbers preferred larger floral displays and nectar robbery reduced reproductive output, suggesting conflicting selection. Survey and experimental data agreed closely on the optimum flower number under antagonist-induced pollen limitation; this number was substantially overrepresented in the population. While criteria for antagonist-induced adaptive pollen limitation are restrictive, the necessary conditions may often be realized. Considering interactions beyond the plant-pollinator dyad illuminates previously overlooked mechanisms generating pollen limitation.

AB  - The study of phenotypic variation within species in response to different environments is a central issue in evolutionary and ecological physiology. Particularly, ambient temperature is one of the most important factors modulating interactions between animals and their environment. Phyllotis xanthopygus, a small Andean rodent, exhibits intraspecific differences along an altitudinal gradient in traits relevant to energy balance that persist after acclimation to common experimental temperatures. Therefore, we aim to explore geographic variations in energetic traits of P. xanthopygus and to assess the contribution of phenotypic plasticity to population differences. We compared metabolic rate and thermal conductance in response to different acclimation temperatures in animals collected at distinct altitudes (F0 generation) and in their offspring, born and raised under common-garden conditions (F1 generation). We found intraspecific differences in resting metabolic rate (RMR) of animals collected at different altitudes that were no longer evident in the F1 generation. Furthermore, although both generations showed the same pattern of RMR flexibility in response to acclimation temperature, its magnitude was lower for the F1 individuals. This suggests that developmental conditions affect the short-term acclimation capacity of this trait during adulthood. On the other hand, thermal conductance (C) showed irreversible plasticity, as animals raised in the laboratory at stable warm conditions had a relatively higher C than the animals from the field, showing no adjustments to thermal acclimation during adulthood in either group. In sum, our results support the hypothesis that the developmental environment shapes energetic traits, emphasizing the relevance of incorporating ontogeny in physiological studies.

AB  - Several mutualistic interactions occur in natural communities that, in some cases, present antagonistic functions happening simultaneously and even within the same interaction, so both mutualistic and antagonistic partners present direct and indirect interactions reflecting the system's whole structure. The mutualistic interaction some ants have with plants - based on which defense is offered in exchange for another benefit (such as food and/or shelter) - raises doubts about its likely effect on floral visitors that account for pollination processes. The current study uses the complex network approach to assess whether these divergent interactions affect each other at the community level. We adopted interactions' connectedness as a response metric to highlight the strength of interactions within a given community. We tested the hypothesis that ants' presence in flowers interferes with floral visitation by other animal species, influences floral visitors' network structure, and, consequently, reduces networks' connectedness. According to the current results, ants' presence in flowers did not change floral visitors' network structure. Although it had some impact on certain floral visitors, such as bees, as also evidenced in studies conducted at the population level, it was not significant enough to change the community's structure. The findings in the present study maintained the concept of mutualism, according to which benefits outweigh the losses. Yet, they did not show antagonism in the ants/plants association.

AB  - When left unmanaged, the invasive aquatic weed hydrilla [Hydrilla verticillata (L. f.) Royle; Hydrocharitaceae] causes serious environmental and economic impacts by choking out native plants and impeding flood control, navigation, and recreation. In Florida, millions of dollars are spent annually to control infestations of hydrilla, primarily with herbicides. However, during the past 15 yr, some hydrilla populations developed resistance to two of the most used aquatic herbicides. Since 2010, we have been testing a novel integrated weed management (IWM) system for hydrilla control that integrates selective insect herbivory by the hydrilla tip miner Cricotopus lebetis Sublette (Diptera: Chironomidae) with a disease-causing fungal pathogen [Mycoleptodiscus terrestris (Gerd.) Ostaz.] (Mt), and the reduced-risk aquatic herbicide imazamox. Over a period of 2 yr, field testing of the two biological control agents and imazamox was performed in four limnocorrals (1 m diam. by 1 m depth) installed in man-made ponds naturally infested with hydrilla to determine the most effective combination for use in hydrilla management. Establishment of the biological control agents and hydrilla damage were measured by collecting apical meristem samples and harvesting the hydrilla to count turions and calculate biomass. Cricotopus lebetis and Mt together and the two biological control agents in combination with imazamox caused the most damage to hydrilla, both in terms of short-term damage to apical meristems and long-term damage through reduced turion production and biomass. Overall, these findings indicate that a combination of different biological and chemical tactics can be used for integrated management of hydrilla.

AB  - A laboratory experiment studied the effects of the green tea (Camellia sinensis L.) aqueous extract at concentrations of 10, 20, and 30 ppm on the germination and growth traits of the mung bean (Vigna radiata L.), carried out in 2021 at the Department of Biology, College of Education for Pure Sciences, Ibn Al-Haitham, University of Baghdad, Iraq. The results showed that Camellia sinensis green tea extracts played a vital role by significantly boosting all the examined characteristics compared with the control treatment. The aqueous extract of Green tea at concentrations of 10 and 20 ppm gave the best performance in increasing germination rates, germination speed, plant promoter indicator, and seedling strength compared with the control treatment. Meanwhile, the concentration of 30 ppm indicated a significant increase in the shoot length, root system, carbohydrates, proteins, proline, superoxide dismutase (SOD), peroxidase (POD), and catalase (CAT) compared with other concentrations used and control treatment.

AB  - Taking into account that in the literature on pork-production Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) there are a few studies about the Iberian pig, the present article evaluates an extensive (growing-fattening) Iberian-pig system in Spain, producing meat for Iberian ham and other quality-labelled products. The study has been based on Cumulative Energy Demand (CED), Global Warming Potential (GWP), ReCiPe (midpoint; endpoint) and USEtox (human toxicity; ecotoxicity). The analysis involves feed (for pigs and piglets), transportation, drinking water, straw usage and building materials (concrete). The impacts have been evaluated per kg of live or carcass weight (two functional units). The results show that the total impacts (per kg of live or carcass weight) range from: 1) 22.05 to 28.19 MJprim (CED), 2) 4.37 to 6.19 kg CO2.eq (GWP 20a, 100a and 500a), 3) 0.86 to 1.08 Pts (ReCiPe endpoint single-score, involving Human health, Ecosystems and Resources), 4) 9.9 x 10-6 to 1.2 x 10-5 DALY (ReCiPe endpoint with characterisation), 5) 2.8 x 10-7 to 3.5 x 10-7 (species.yr) (ReCiPe endpoint with characterisation), 6) 10.12 to 12.66 CTUe (USEtox: ecotoxicity). Overall, the results show that the feed for the pigs is responsible for the major part of the environmental impacts. More analytically, maize and soya are the components with the highest environmental impacts due to factors such as transportation, use of fertilisers and diesel fuel. The discussion about pig-production environmental impacts and the role of extensive pig farming is enriched with comparisons with the literature on pig-production LCA. Critical parameters are identified and discussed, with the aim of proposing solutions to reduce pork-production environmental impacts. Finally, the usefulness of the present study and future prospects are presented.

AB  - The Jiani yak is a nationally renowned species that is known for its meat which is rich in various minerals, amino acids, and proteins. The rumen microbiota plays a critical role in gastrointestinal health and feed degradation, contributing proteins, lipids, and volatile fatty acids (VFAs) essential for milk and meat production. However, there is limited knowledge about the microbiota of free-ranging Jiani yaks, especially those with 15 ribs. Rumen fluid samples were collected from yaks with 14 (PL) ribs and 15 (DL) ribs from a slaughterhouse in Jiani County, China. The total DNA of rumen fluid microorganisms was extracted for microbiota sequencing. Our results revealed 643,713 and 656,346 raw sequences in DL and PL animals, respectively, with 611,934 and 622,814 filtered sequences in these two yak groups. We identified 13,498 Amplicon Sequence Variants (ASVs), with 2623 shared between DL and PL animals. The ratio of Bacteroidota to Firmicutes differed between PL (3.04) and DL (2.35) animals. Additionally, 6 phyla and 21 genera showed significant differences between yaks with 14 and 15 ribs, leading to altered microbiota functions, with 51 and 35 notably different MetaCyc and KEGG pathways, respectively. Hence, the microbiota of yaks with 15 ribs differs from those with 14 ribs. Therefore, these microbiota-related comparative investigations will provide insights into yak husbandry practices and genetic selection strategies for their improved productivity in harsh environments.

AB  - BackgroundCrop-wild hybridization has generated great concerns since gene flow can be an avenue for transgene escape. However, a rather limited number of studies on risk assessment regarding the dispersion of transgenes from GM soybean to populations of its wild relatives have been previously conducted.ResultsThe results of the 3-year experiment demonstrated that hybrids between GM soybeans and wild soybean had lower seed germination and higher seed productivity than GM soybean. Both of these features of hybrid (especially F2 and F3) were similar to those of wild soybean. Furthermore, the foreign protein was stably expressed in hybrid EPSPS positive plants; however, no difference was observed in agronomic measurements between hybrids that are glyphosate sensitive or resistant, homozygous or heterozygous for the transgene, indicating that the presence of the EPSPS transgene does not affect the vigor of hybrid. In contrast, hybridization between GM soybean and wild soybean may have more impact on hybrid growth and fecundity, this increase in biomass and yield confers a potential competition benefit to hybrids.ConclusionsGene flow from GM soybean to wild soybean has the potential to promote the adaptability of hybrids and may increase the possibility of dispersal of transgenes in wild soybean relatives.

AB  - Herbivory can alter plant fitness directly through changing reproductive allocation and indirectly through changing pollinator identity or behavior. Common milkweed is a plant of conservation concern with an inducible chemical defense that is also an important nectar resource. In this study, we aim to understand how herbivory severity and plant traits, including morphology and nectar chemistry, interact to affect insect visitation and pod production in common milkweed. We conducted pollinator watches on plants with experimentally varied herbivory severity and quantified insect frequency and visit length as a response to nectar chemistry, ramet height, number of inflorescences, number of flowers per inflorescence and percent tissue removed. We also quantified pollinator effectiveness and importance. Increased herbivory severity reduced floral displays, including fewer inflorescences and fewer flowers per inflorescence. A reduced floral display was correlated with reduced sucrose, fructose and glucose and resulted in a reduced number and species richness of insect visitors. Fewer flowers per inflorescence reduced the frequency of bumble bee and fly visitors, which were two important pollinators. Although honeybees, flies, small bees, soldier beetles and bumble bees were equally effective pollinators, only bumble bee frequency was positively correlated with pod production. The differences in pollinator visitation have the potential to create diversifying selection on plant floral traits, many of which are also affected by herbivores. This research demonstrates potentially conflicting selection pressures between native and non-native pollinators as well as non-native herbivores.

AB  - In June 2017, deer-horn-like galls covered with a whitish, powdery fungal layer were found on the trunks of Cinnamomum pseudopedunculatum (Lauraceae) in Hahajima, Bonin Islands, Japan. The galls were similar to those of horn gall disease of Ci. tenuifolium caused by Laurobasidium hachijoense (Laurobasidiaceae, Exobasidiales) on Hachijo Island, approximately 700 km north of Hahajima. Based on morphological observation and molecular analyses of ITS and LSU regions, the fungus isolated from the surface of the galls was identified as L. hachijoense. This is the first report of the horn gall disease of Ci. pseudopedunculatum.

AB  - Tick vectors and tick-borne disease are increasingly impacting human populations globally. An important challenge is to understand tick movement patterns, as this information can be used to improve management and predictive modelling of tick population dynamics. Evolutionary analysis of genetic divergence, gene flow and local adaptation provides insight on movement patterns at large spatiotemporal scales. We develop low coverage, whole genome resequencing data for 92 blacklegged ticks, Ixodes scapularis, representing range-wide variation across the United States. Through analysis of population genomic data, we find that tick populations are structured geographically, with gradual isolation by distance separating three population clusters in the northern United States, southeastern United States and a unique cluster represented by a sample from Tennessee. Populations in the northern United States underwent population contractions during the last glacial period and diverged from southern populations at least 50 thousand years ago. Genome scans of selection provide strong evidence of local adaptation at genes responding to host defences, blood-feeding and environmental variation. In addition, we explore the potential of low coverage genome sequencing of whole-tick samples for documenting the diversity of microbial pathogens and recover important tick-borne pathogens such as Borrelia burgdorferi. The combination of isolation by distance and local adaptation in blacklegged ticks demonstrates that gene flow, including recent expansion, is limited to geographical scales of a few hundred kilometres.

AB  - Effective management of urban solid waste is critical for achieving sustainable development goals. One key aspect of this challenge is the recycling of anaerobically digested residues from anaerobic digestion of food waste, which plays a pivotal role in promoting sustainability. However, there is a gap in understanding the feasibility and effectiveness of converting these digested residues into valuable fertilizers through composting. Addressing this gap, the present study explored the potential of composting anaerobically digested residue and evaluated the quality of the co-compost products. In this study, we investigated the composting process using a mixture of rice straw, food waste, sheep manure and mature composted residues (RFM group) alongside the anaerobically digested residues. The results demonstrated that the composting process quickly reached the thermophilic stage, during which NH+4-N concentrations increased and C/N ratio decrease. The RFM group exhibited the highest humic acid content compared to other groups. Additionally, microbial analysis revealed key species such as Clostridium, Moheibacter, Bacillus, Thermobacillus, and Pseudogracilibacillus as major contributors to the composting process. The germination index (GI) test indicated that the co-composted residues were non-toxic to plants, suggesting their suitability as a fertilizer. All these works indicated that the addition of rice straw, food waste, and mature composted residues to anaerobically digested materials significantly enhanced the composting process, resulting in a high-quality co-compost. This approach not only provided a promising method for recycling food waste but also contributed to the broader goal of sustainable solid waste management.

AB  - The yak, a unique inhabitant of low-oxygen environments, exhibits brain adaptability to hypoxic conditions. However, the impact of hypoxia on yak brain proteomics and the expression of the HIF2 alpha/BNIP3L signaling pathway remains unexplored. This study utilized TMT-based proteomics analysis to identify differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) in the cerebral cortexes of 9-month-old yaks at high (n = 3) and low (n = 3) altitudes. Additionally, qRT-PCR, Western blot, immunohistochemistry, and immunofluorescence were used to analyze HIF2 alpha, BNIP3L, Beclin1, LC3-II, and cleaved caspase-3 expression in various brain regions from both altitude groups. KEGG analysis revealed that the DEPs were mainly concentrated in the synthesis and metabolism, DNA replication, and repair pathways. Specifically, the autophagy in KEGG attracted our attention due to its absence in other animals. HIF2 alpha, BNIP3L, Beclin1, and LC3-II in the autophagy pathway increased significantly. Furthermore, the results of qRT-PCR and Western blot analysis showed that, at the same altitude, the mRNA and protein levels of HIF2 alpha, BNIP3L, LC3-II, and Beclin1 in the cerebral cortexes and hippocampi of yaks were significantly higher than those in the thalami, medulla oblongatae, and cerebella (p < 0.05), while the expression of cleaved caspase-3 was not significantly different among the regions (p > 0.05). Additionally, within the same brain region, the expression levels of HIF2 alpha, BNIP3L, Beclin1, and LC3-II in high-altitude yaks were higher than those in low-altitude yaks. Moreover, there was no difference in the cleaved caspase-3 mRNA and protein expression between the high-altitude and low-altitude yaks. Immunohistochemistry revealed that HIF2 alpha-positive signaling was expressed in the nucleus and cytoplasm of neurons, while BNIP3L, LC3-II, Beclin1, and cleaved caspase-3 were concentrated in the cytoplasm. The immunofluorescence results showed that HIF2 alpha, BNIP3L, LC3-II, Beclin1, cleaved caspase-3, and NeuN were co-located in the neurons of the cerebral cortex, hippocampus, thalamus, medulla oblongata, and cerebellum, respectively. This study offers a complete characterization of the yak cerebral cortex proteome at different altitudes. The higher expression of HIF2 alpha, BNIP3L, Beclin1, and LC3-II in the cerebral cortexes and hippocampi of yaks indicates that these brain regions are more resistant to hypoxia. In addition, the increased HIF2 alpha/BNIP3L signaling in the high-altitude yaks may enhance brain tissue adaptation to hypoxic conditions.

AB  - Aim. Polymorphism is the result of evolutionary processes and is inherited, associated with biodiversity and modified by natural selection and functions to preserve various forms of population. It is economically advantageous to find genes that can be used in breeding in such a way as to increase the fertility of animals in different natural geographical zones, since the adaptive abilities of organisms are complicated. In this regard, the purpose of this study was to study the genetic potential of sheep of different breeds bred in various ecological and geographical regions of the North Caucasus with pasture-pasture and pasture-stall conditions of sheep breeding.
   Material and Methods. Genotyping was undertaken of sheep of different breeds contained in various natural and climatic zones of the Republic of Dagestan and the most arid region of Stavropol Territory in the zone of risky agriculture where the climate is sharply continental. Genotyping in the loci of the genes of differential growth factor (GDF9) and bone morphogenetic protein (BMP15) was carried out by PCR-PDRF (polymorphism of the lengths of restriction fragments) by cutting DNA using endonuclease restriction and further analysis of the size of the resulting PCR fragments. The genetic structure of genes has been studied by methods of genetic and statistical analysis of the data obtained.
   Conclusion. The genetic structure of sheep populations of different breeds bred in the foothills of the Republic of Dagestan and the arid region of Stavropol Territory was studied for the first time. Information obtained on the role of the degree of genetic variability of sheep of different breeds provides data which can contribute to the ecological well-being of herds and the status characterising the signs of multiple birth rates is also determined. This will further improve and significantly accelerate breeding work with livestock, since an important task of further increasing the efficiency of the industry is the reproduction of the herd together with a simultaneous increase in the productivity of animals.

AB  - Seahorses are specialized teleosts due to their unique male pregnancy and reproductive physiology. In particular, they have distinct gonad structures and different patterns of gametogenesis development in both sexes. However, the molecular mechanism of germ cell development in seahorses remains unknown. Nanos, which encodes conserved zinc-finger RNA-binding proteins, play essential roles for germline development in both vertebrates and invertebrates. In this study, we characterized the nanos gene family members and their potential roles in germline development in the lined seahorse, Hippocampus erectus. We showed that the nanos family members in the seahorse are the nanos1a, nanos1b, and nanos3 genes, while nanos2, a key germline stem cell (GSC) maintenance factor, is intriguingly absent. More interestingly, nanos3, which is reported to be a female-specific gene, was also highly expressed in male gonads, as well as in the early developmental stages of testes and ovaries. Our results also showed that nanos3 was highly expressed in early meiotic germ cells, and that expression levels of nanos3 were lower in the gonad after TBT exposure. These findings suggest that nanos3 may function during male germ cell development, and in female initial germ cell production - processes which are regulated by nanos2 in other teleosts. This is the first research into how nanos governs germ cell development in an ovoviviparous fish. Our study provides insights into the regulatory mechanisms of germ cells development, as well as the early events during gametogenesis in the family Syngnathidae.

AB  - Common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) is the third most important grain legume globally following soybean and groundnut. Its productivity is constrained by virus diseases and seed transmission (ST) is important in the spread and epidemiology of the diseases, serving as primary source of inoculum for further dissemination by insect vectors. Seed transmission of viruses infecting commercial cultivars of common beans from Kano State (KS) Nigeria was investigated. Seed samples were randomly collected from 20 markets from 10 local government areas in KS. Forty seeds per location making a total of 800 seeds were used for the grow-out assay under an insect-proof greenhouse. Leaf samples were tested for viruses using antigen-coated plate-enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ACP-ELISA) or reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Data were recorded on seed germination, virus incidence, symptom severity, and virus ST rate. Seed germination rate (78-100%) was similar in all locations. Only 720 of the 800 seeds germinated, and 13 of the seedlings (1.8%) were symptomatic at incidence of 0-14.7%. Symptoms observed were mosaic, mild mottling, vein-banding, and puckering, with a severity range of 1-3. Seed transmission of cowpea aphid-borne mosaic virus (CABMV) (6%) and cucumber mosaic virus (CMV) (4%) were observed from Kura, Kumbosto, Bichi, Sumaila, Kiru, and Dawakin Kudu LGAs. All samples were negative for cowpea mottle virus, bean common mosaic virus, and begomoviruses. Double (CABMV + CMV) and latent infections were also observed while some virus symptoms were not verified. CABMV ST was prevalent. These findings are relevant for common bean virus disease management in northern Nigeria.

AB  - Background: The Indian elephant (Elephas maximus indicus), a subspecies of the Asian elephant, is predominantly found in India, supporting nearly 60% of the global population. In West Bengal state, particularly in the northern districts (Darjeeling, Jalpaiguri, and Alipurduar) unremitting habitat destruction, encroachment, and high population densities of both humans and elephants have led to an escalation in human-elephant conflicts (HECs). Among different mitigation measures, electric fences (EFs) are commonly preferred, however, illegal usage of lethal EFs has led to increased cases of electrocution-based elephant mortalities. Aims: A study was conducted at selected HEC-prone sites in elephant habitats of the northern districts to (i) document the physical status of EFs installed, (ii) examine local community perceptions regarding the efficacy of EFs in mitigating elephant raids, and (iii) provide recommendations for the sustainable management of EFs. Methods: Firstly, secondary data (2017-2023) on elephant electrocution incidents were collected from literature, official records, and media sources from the study area. Based on this, EFs were assessed at 33 conflict-prone sites across various land-use types. Subsequently, semi-structured interviews were conducted with 166 randomly selected residents within 5 km of the fence sites to assess their perceptions regarding efficacy of EFs. Statistical analyses were executed to analyse associations between fence characteristics, land-use, and socio-demographic factors. Results: Of the 62 fences assessed, 32 were active and 14 were found to be lethal. The findings revealed non-lethal fences were more prevalent than lethal ones, indicating a growing awareness within local communities about the adverse impacts of lethal EFs. The perception-based survey revealed that 39.8% of respondents considered EFs moderately effective in mitigating conflicts. Implication for Conservation: While mass-awareness has shown promising results, policymakers are recommended to implement stricter regulations and establish region-specific monitoring squads.

AB  - Lead (Pb) is a heavy metal with no clear biological benefit that is toxic to wildlife and humans. Although Pb has been banned from several consumer products, it is not regulated in ammunition for big-game hunting (e.g., cervids) in New York, USA. Wildlife species that scavenge remains of game harvested with Pb ammunition can be exposed to bullet fragments through ingestion and potentially develop toxicosis. To make evidence-based decisions for reducing risk from bullet-derived Pb, we first empirically identified avian and mammalian scavengers of white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) remains in New York through an online survey during July-August 2023, where community members submitted images of scavengers from game cameras. We conducted species vulnerability and utility assessments using published evidence and pre-existing frameworks. Despite inherent limitations, we documented an extensive array of avian (n = 17) and mammalian (n = 14) scavengers. We estimated bald eagles (Haliaeetus leucocephalus) and golden eagles (Aquila chrysaetos) as most vulnerable to Pb toxicosis, followed collectively by American goshawks (Accipiter atricapillus), American crows (Corvus brachyrhynchos), and common ravens (C. corax). We also determined bald eagles to be best-suited as bioindicators of bullet-derived Pb, followed by American goshawks. Red-tailed hawks (Buteo jamaicensis) and great horned owls (Bubo virginianus) equally ranked third. Integrating vulnerability and utility assessments point to bald eagles as the most vulnerable scavengers to Pb toxicosis and best-suited bioindicators of bullet-derived Pb. Because regulation of Pb ammunition for big-game hunting is an ongoing socio-political issue, wildlife managers and conservationists can address health risks through monitoring species vulnerable to toxicosis and instituting surveillance programs using the most effective bioindicators.

AB  - Plastic pollution is becoming a serious environmental concern because of extensive plastic use worldwide. Before being dumped into the marine environment, these anthropogenic polymers also affect freshwater ecosystems. Although extensive research has been done to evaluate the level and distribution of these anthropogenic polymers but the effect of physical structures like barrages has never been accounted so far. This study is the first of its kind to highlight the role of river barrages in determining the distribution of microplastics (MPs) and affecting their ingestion among different fish species. This study was conducted on Balloki Barrage located on Ravi River, receiving sewage water from different populous cities of Pakistan including Lahore and Sheikhupura. Water (n=6), sediment (n=6) and fish (n=28) samples were collected from both the upstream and downstream of the barrages to establish the relationship between MPs ingestion, fish feeding habit and the pollution level in environmental matrices. On the other hand, the relative abundance of fibers in all the fish species was 57% followed by sheets 34% and fragments 8%. Omnivore fish species were found to have more MPs than herbivores and carnivores irrespective of their size and weight. This study proved that the barrages serve an important function in determining the MPs distribution and their consequent ingestion in fish. A proper consideration must be given to the effects of these structures when evaluating plastic pollution in any riverine body.

AB  - The immune system is considered a functional trait in life-history theory and its modulation is predicted to be costly and highly dependent on the host's nutrition. Therefore, the nutritional status of an individual has a great impact on an animal's immune ecology. Herbivorous insects are commonly used as model organisms in eco-immunology studies and the use of an artificial diet is the predominant rearing procedure to test them. However, this diet differs from what herbivores experience in nature and it is unclear to what degree this distinction might impact on the relevance of these studies for the real world. Here, we compared plant-based vs. artificial diet in a set of three experiments to investigate the interaction of both diets with a plastic immune strategy known as Density-Dependent Prophylaxis (DDP). We used as a model organism the velvetbean caterpillar Anticarsia gemmatalis, which is known to adjust its immune defense in line with the DDP hypothesis. Our main results showed that larvae fed with artificial diet had 20.5% more hemocytes circulating in the hemolymph and died 20% more slowly when infected with an obligate (viral) pathogen. Crucially, however, we did not find any indication of fitness costs related to DDP. The use of artificial diet did not interact with that of DDP except in the case of host survival after infection, where the DDP effect was only observable in this diet. Our findings suggest the use of an artificial diet does not mask resource allocation conflicts between immune investment and fitness related traits, but to some extent it might lead to an overestimation of immune parameters and host survival time after infection. We believe that this is the first study to compare an artificial diet and a host plant covering all these aspects: immune parameters, life-history traits, and host survival after infection. Here we provide evidence that, besides the quantitative effects in immune parameters and host survival time, the use of artificial diet interacts only marginally with a density-dependent immune response. This provides support for the use of artificial diets in eco-immunology studies with insects.

AB  - Lentinus edodes (LE) is a nutrient-rich medicinal fungus with potential applications in animal nutrition; however, its effects on dairy goats remain underexplored. This study investigated the impact of dietary LE addition on rumen microbiota, metabolic profiles, serum immunity, and milk quality in lactating dairy goats. Twenty Saanen goats were randomly assigned to a control group (CON, basal diet) or an LE group (basal diet + 25 g Lentinus edodes) for 56 days. Rumen fluid, serum, and milk samples were analyzed using 16S rDNA sequencing, metabolomics, and biochemical assays. The results showed that the addition of LE altered the microbial composition, decreasing the abundance of fibrobacterial flora and Treponema (p < 0.05) while increasing VadinHA49. Metabolomic analysis revealed elevated fumaric acid, lysophospholipids (LysoPE, LysoPG), and D-quinic acid in the rumen (p < 0.05). Serum immunoglobulin A (IgA), immunoglobulin G (IgG), total antioxidant capacity (T-AOC), superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) levels were significantly enhanced (p < 0.05). The milk somatic cell count (SCC) was reduced by 52.8% (p = 0.005) at day 56, and protein, fat, and total solids increased significantly (p < 0.05). Enrichment of functional metabolites such as D-arabitol and D-tryptophan in milk further highlighted LE's role in improving product value. These findings demonstrate that LE optimizes rumen flora, enhances antioxidant and immune functions, and improves milk quality, supporting its use as a functional feed additive for dairy goats.

AB  - Highlands are the most heterogeneous and complex biogeographic regions of Mexico. Species inhabiting these regions have been exposed to geologic events and climatic fluctuations in the past causing limited historical gene flow that resulted in structured genetic variation and high endemism. We examined the genetic variation of the mouse Peromyscus hylocetes throughout its geographic distribution within the Trans-Mexican Volcanic Belt (TVB), to estimate its current environmental suitability, habitat connectivity, and to reconstruct its evolutionary history by inferring the role of past events and abiotic factors. Two main genetic clusters corresponding to the west and east range of the species distribution were detected. Gene flow occurred largely from the west to the east cluster. Peromyscus hylocetes and P. aztecus diverged during the Pliocene-Pleistocene at the central-south region of the TVB. We hypothesized that after this divergence, P. hylocetes colonized the TVB during the Pleistocene and later expanded its distribution to the western TVB. Due to the climatic oscillations in the late Pleistocene, populations were restricted in western TVB during the warmer periods, and displacements occurred during colder periods from the west to the central TVB on several episodes.

AB  - Many interactions of plants with the environment have an acoustic component, including the actions of herbivores and pollinators, wind and rain. Although plants have long been tested for their response to single tones or music, their re-sponse to naturally occurring sources of sound and vibration is barely explored. We argue that progress in understanding the ecology and evolution of plant acoustic sensing requires testing how plants respond to acoustic features of their natural environments, using methods that precisely measure and reproduce the stimulus experienced by the plant.

KW  - ECOLOGY
AB  - Description of some osteological differences in the tarsal joint between the two giraffes possibly belonging to the species: Giraffa camelopardalis antiquitorum and Giraffa reticulata. This is a pilot study until more individuals are studied. Differences are presented in the fibula, calcaneus, and astragalus. Other bones possess differences but are not covered in this study. There is also a difference in the degree of dorsiflexion of the tarsal joint. In G. reticulata, unlike G. camelopardalis, the lateral malleolar process of the astragalus is larger and is used as a support for the plantarflexed tarsal joint during forward propulsion. The lateral malleolar process is larger, the astragalocalcaneal ligament is more expanded, the sustentaculum tali is more developed, and the tarsal joint is more flexible in G. reticulata. The descending process of the fibula is also stronger as an additional support system to stabilize the tarsal joint. Prodremotherium is a model of the ancestral taxon to the entire family of Giraffidae. These two Giraffa species are compared to Okapia and Prodremotherium, and the okapi is not an intermediate between Prodremotherium and Giraffa based on the osteology of the tarsal joint.

AB  - Homing pigeons rely on familiar landscape features in learning a visual map, which is orchestrated by the forebrain visual Wulst and hippocampus. Recent global positioning system tracking studies showed that pigeons with damage to the visual Wulst or hippocampus exhibited a still poorly understood, persistent oscillatory flight behaviour, unlike intact pigeons whose oscillations decrease with experience. To evaluate whether landscape heterogeneity influences the extent of these oscillations, we compared the flight behaviour of both intact and Wulst-lesioned pigeons when flying over the sea versus land. Regardless of treatment, pigeons exhibited less oscillatory flight behaviour over the homogeneous landscape of the sea. Further releases from familiar and unfamiliar sites tested whether oscillatory flight behaviour may be influenced by the level of familiarity with the landscape. Indeed, intact pigeons reduced their oscillatory behaviour as landscape familiarity increased. In contrast, Wulst-damaged pigeons persisted in displaying robust oscillatory flight behaviour regardless of the level of landscape familiarity, suggesting that previously experienced landscapes remained relatively unfamiliar to them. The data support the hypothesis that oscillatory flight behaviour reflects active visual scanning, most pronounced over novel, heterogeneous landscapes, contributing to visual map learning. Further, the data suggest a crucial role of the forebrain Wulst for such learning.

AB  - Understanding predator guild resource use is vital for carnivore species preservation and ecosystem function in high-altitude landscapes. We describe the dietary composition, similarity, and niche overlap for seven carnivore species across three regions of the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau (Qilian Shan, East Burhanbuda Mountain, Yushu) using DNA metabarcoding of 760 scat samples. Analyses found 33 unique prey items representative of the classes Mammalia, Aves, and Actinopterygii. Blue sheep (Pseudois nayaur) and pika (Ochotona sp.) were most frequently detected. Livestock in carnivore diets ranged from 4% to 7% depending on site, but accounted for 21.7% of Tibetan wolf (Canis lupus) diet. Eurasian lynx (Lynx lynx), Tibetan fox (Vulpes ferrilata), Pallas's cat (Otocolobus manul), and snow leopard (Panthera uncia) had highly uneven diets. Intraguild predation of mesocarnivores by apex carnivores was found. Analysis of dietary niche overlap using Pianka's index showed that overlap was significantly greater than expected among all carnivores examined and between apex and mesocarnivores, though significant correlations between carnivore body mass and prey body mass suggested broad separation in consumed prey. Snow leopard and Tibetan wolf diets were consistently the most similar of any two given species pairs. This study provides evidence of high dietary overlap. Protection for species consumed by a wide variety of carnivores will benefit predator guilds in the area and assist in maintaining the relatively low frequency of livestock predation. This work provides insight into the dynamics of carnivore guilds living in an area that has worldwide impacts, and methods herein could be applied on global scales for conservation efforts.

AB  - Domestic sheep and their wild relatives harbor substantial genetic variants that can form the backbone of molecular breeding, but their genome landscapes remain understudied. Here, we present a comprehensive genome resource for wild ovine species, landraces and improved breeds of domestic sheep, comprising high-coverage (similar to 16.10x) whole genomes of 810 samples from 7 wild species and 158 diverse domestic populations. We detected, in total, similar to 121.2 million single nucleotide polymorphisms, similar to 61 million of which are novel. Some display significant (P < 0.001) differences in frequency between wild and domestic species, or are private to continent-wide or individual sheep populations. Retained or introgressed wild gene variants in domestic populations have contributed to local adaptation, such as the variation in the HBB associated with plateau adaptation. We identified novel and previously reported targets of selection on morphological and agronomic traits such as stature, horn, tail configuration, and wool fineness. We explored the genetic basis of wool fineness and unveiled a novel mutation (chr25: T7,068,586C) in the 3 '-UTR of IRF2BP2 as plausible causal variant for fleece fiber diameter. We reconstructed prehistorical migrations from the Near Eastern domestication center to South-and-Southeast Asia and found two main waves of migrations across the Eurasian Steppe and the Iranian Plateau in the Early and Late Bronze Ages. Our findings refine our understanding of genome variation as shaped by continental migrations, introgression, adaptation, and selection of sheep.

AB  - Globally, illegal and unsustainable wildlife trade can drive biodiversity loss. Understanding which product attributes consumers consider when deciding between products of threatened species or alternatives, is key for conservation interventions. Labeled Discrete Choice Experiments (DCEs) are underutilized in wildlife trade literature but can aid this understanding. In labeled DCEs, the alternatives presented to respondents have specific names (e.g., paracetamol) as opposed to being generic bundles (e.g., option A). We used a labeled DCE to assess young adult preferences toward "cooling water" used to treat fever and heatiness (a traditional Chinese medicine state of illness) in Singapore. One popular cooling water contains saiga horn, made from Critically Endangered Saiga tatarica antelope. Data from 639 university-enrolled respondents were analyzed using latent class models. Middle- to high-income Chinese Singaporeans were the respondents most likely to choose saiga horn. Overall, however, respondents significantly preferred lower price products sold in nearby outlets-suggesting that for young adults in Singapore, saiga horn cooling water may be substitutable if its physical and financial availability is reduced.

AB  - We evaluated the relationship between individual and herd GIN infection level, nutrition, production performance and anemia parameters in a tropical farm context. Fifty-four female goats were monitored to assess their body condition score (BCS, nutritional status indicator), live weight (LW) and LW gain (LWG, both used as production level indicators), FAMACHA (c) and hematocrit (HT, both used as anemia indicators). Goats browsed for 4 h in a tropical forest and received balanced feed and chopped grass. The eggs per gram of feces (EPG) indicated the GIN burden, with fecal samples obtained at 7:00 (AM) and 15:00 h (PM.) from each goat at six sampling points during the study. The variables and their relationship with GIN burdens were analyzed using Kruskall-Wallis, ANOVA and Friedman tests and Spearman correlations. The fecal samples obtained in the AM and PM can be equally representative of parasitic burdens (similar and highly correlated). However, the EPG of individual goats from periods of 30 days apart can be considered independent. The BCS and LWG varied between sampling times (p < 0.05), whereas EPG, LW and HT did not (p > 0.05). The GIN burden was negatively correlated with HT and BCS (-0.21, p = 0.01 for each one). The individual pattern of infection demonstrates the true impact of GINs on their hosts. Additionally, feeding and nutritional status may present important variations influencing the performance of the goats more than the impact of GINs under the farm conditions of the present study. However, GIN infection contributed to the variation in goat health and productivity in this tropical farm.

AB  - Wohlfahrtia magnifica is a pest fly species, invading livestock in many European, African and Asian countries, and causing heavy agroeconomic losses. In the life cycle of this obligatory parasite, adult flies infect the host by depositing the first-stage larvae into body cavities or open wounds. The feeding larvae cause severe (skin) tissue damage and potentially fatal infections if untreated. Despite serious health detriments and agroeconomic concerns, genomic resources for understanding the biology of W. magnifica have so far been lacking. Here, we present a complete genome assembly from a single adult female W. magnifica using a Low-DNA Input workflow for PacBio HiFi library preparation. The de novo assembled genome is 753.99 Mb in length, with a scaffold N50 of 5.00 Mb, consisting of 16,718 predicted protein-encoding genes. Comparative genomic analysis revealed that W. magnifica has the closest phylogenetic relationship to Sarcophaga bullata followed by Lucilia cuprina. Evolutionary analysis of gene families showed expansions of 173 gene families in W. magnifica that were enriched for gene ontology (GO) categories related to immunity, insecticide-resistance mechanisms, heat stress response and cuticle development. In addition, 45 positively selected genes displaying various functions were identified. This new genomic resource contributes to the evolutionary and comparative analysis of dipterous flies and an in-depth understanding of many aspects of W. magnifica biology. Furthermore, it will facilitate the development of novel tools for controlling W. magnifica infection in livestock.

AB  - Background: The tiger shark (Galeocerdo cuvier) is a large iconic marine predator inhabiting worldwide tropical and subtropical waters. So far, only mitochondrial markers and microsatellites studies have investigated its worldwide historical demography with inconclusive outcomes. Here, we assessed for the first time the genomic variability of tiger shark based on RAD-seq data for 50 individuals from five sampling sites in the Indo-Pacific (IP) and one in the Atlantic Ocean (AO) to decipher the extent of the species' global connectivity and its demographic history. Results: Clustering algorithms (PCA and NMF), F-ST and an approximate Bayesian computation framework revealed the presence of two clusters corresponding to the two oceanic basins. By modelling the two-dimensional site frequency spectrum, we tested alternative isolation/migration scenarios between these two identified populations. We found the highest support for a divergence time between the two ocean basins of similar to 193,000 years before present (B.P) and an ongoing but limited asymmetric migration similar to 176 times larger from the IP to the AO (Nm similar to 3.9) than vice versa (Nm similar to 0.02). Conclusions: The two oceanic regions are isolated by a strong barrier to dispersal more permeable from the IP to the AO through the Agulhas leakage. We finally emphasized contrasting recent demographic histories for the two regions, with the IP characterized by a recent bottleneck around 2000 years B.P. and the AO by an expansion starting 6000 years B.P. The large differentiation between the two oceanic regions and the absence of population structure within each ocean basin highlight the need for two large management units and call for future conservation programs at the oceanic rather than local scale, particularly in the Indo-Pacific where the population is declining.

AB  - The hyperaccumulating mechanism concerning heavy metal activation or passivation and plant response triggered by fulvic acid (FA) and humic acid (HA) recruitments are investigated herein. We carefully examine the Cd activation effect by various FA and HA, tracing from pig, goat, and duck manure composts to straw compost and commercial materials (i.e., PC, GC, DC, SC, and CM), as well as their roles in plant growth promotion and Cd uptake. Our results indicate that due to the decrease of soil pH and their multiple functional groups, the contents of available Cd (AE-Cd) increased by 4.3-4.8% and 3.6-6.3% when all FA and HA sources were applied for 30 days. A 13.1-19.9% increase in AE-Cd was observed when CFA, DFA, and PFA were applied for five days, and a 9.5% increment was found when PHA was applied for 10 days. In the pot experiment, the Cd accumulation in plants increased by 2.78 and 2.17 folds with PFA and PHA applications, respectively, compared to the blank control group. This result can be attributed to the stimulative effects of the simultaneous Sedum alfredii growth and Cd phytoavailability. Notably, the Cd accumulation increased by 2.26 times with the SFA amendment due to the predominant stimulation effect to the phytoavailable Cd rather than plant growth. However, slight inhibitory effects were observed upon plant growth or Cd uptake, which led to the reduction of the Cd accumulation with DHA, SHA, and CHA employments. Consistently, the corresponding soil Cd removal efficiencies were 43.5% and 34.6% with PFA and PHA, respectively, which hold abundant O- and N-containing groups. Our research aims to gain insights into the ternary interaction in the presence of heavy metal, humic substances, and S. alfredii to simultaneously accelerate Cd activation and hyperaccumulation.

AB  - Goat breeding in Peru is one of the main activities of smallholders. Goats are distributed in different agroecological zones and regions of the country, developing under heterogeneity of production systems, making it difficult to understand goat breeders' socioeconomic, technological, and productive situations. This study aimed to characterize and typify the goat production systems in the highlands of southeast Peru. A survey was conducted with 91 goat farmers from five districts of Ayacucho, Peru, using a structured and individualized questionnaire administered on their farms. The socio-economic, productive, and commercial characteristics of the goat production systems were recorded. A multiple correspondence analysis (MCA) and hierarchical classification analysis (HCA) were performed to establish a typology of the smallholders. The results reveal that the breeding system is extensive, where there is no breeding program, with natural pastures and crop stubble being the source of food for the herds. Only slightly more than half (54%) carry out a deworming program. Farmers were categorized into three different groups, corresponding to three different farming systems: Group 1 farmers raised goats solely for home consumption; Group 2 breeders raised goats for both consumption and marketing of surplus products (cheese, milk, and meat), and Group 3 farmed focused on producing cheese and goat kids and selling to local markets. The study provides valuable insights that will help design effective breeding strategies to develop sustainable goat farming in the region, considering different production systems and their respective socio-economic and trade dynamics. This classification will be essential for tailoring development programs to the specific needs of each group, promoting better use of resources, improving productivity, and enhancing the livelihoods of smallholder goat producers in Peru.

AB  - A study of a wild boar population's vigilance was carried out 50-80 years following the creation of the Sikhote-Alin Nature Reserve, Russian Far East and the cease of hunting. The defensive behavior of the wild boar depends especially strongly on the tiger (Panthera tigris tigris) and the brown bear (Ursus arctos). Based on 298 encounters, the following responses were determined: (a) reactions of wild boars to stimuli associated with danger, (b) parameters of alertness (3.2 hours of measured time, frequency of observed postures and movements). Response features to different signals were also determined using snow-tracking. Nonparametric and, after normalization, parametric criteria were applied. Vigilance towards humans is maintained due to a generalized reaction to real danger (large predators) and probably because the wild boar population of the nature reserve is not isolated from the surrounding areas. In more than 70% encounters, wild boars detected danger by sounds accompanying movements (from almost 0.6- 0.8 km). Visual scanning of movements and the identification by smell are important in detecting the close presence of a predator, which is essential in the tiger's usual hunting methods. The reaction to the smell of human or tiger tracks intensified during the periods of frequent visits by the predator to the wild boar's habitat, as well as after its long absence, depended on the meeting place. The vigilance decreased during the periods of famine. Wild boars showed the ability to quickly extrapolate the direction of the movement of a dangerous object. Guards and boars over 2 years old in maternal groups were seen in 35.7% cases; in 16% cases, there was no obvious guard; in 48.3% the situation was not determined (for small groups in 89.9%). Wild boar guards in a calm situation spent an average of 8-9% of their time on vigilance when resting and 11-12% when grazing. Vigilance rates increased 16.2-41.3 times in different individuals and at different times in the same wild boars with the risk of a predator encounter or extraneous sounds. Only a small percentage (<= 2%) of other individuals, with alternating vigilance in groups, complemented the groups' general vigilance. Individual differences in vigilance at different times in the same wild boars were determined. Small average values of alertness (with frequent reactions) seem to be consistent with the hunting tactics of the tiger, which alternates pursuit of the wild boar with long cessations and hunting in other areas, as well as with the ability of the wild boar to react to an unexpected attack by a predator.

AB  - Background: The swamp buffalo (Bubalus bubalis carabanesis) is an economically important livestock supplying milk, meat, leather, and draft power. Several female buffalo genomes have been available, but the lack of high-quality male genomes hinders studies on chromosome evolution, especially Y, as well as meiotic recombination.
   Results: Here, a chromosome-level genome with a contig N50 of 72.2 Mb and a fine-scale recombination map of male buffalo were reported. We found that transposable elements (TEs) and structural variants (SVs) may contribute to buffalo evolution by influencing adjacent gene expression. We further found that the pseudoautosomal region (PAR) of the Y chromosome is subject to stronger purification selection. The meiotic recombination map showed that there were 2 obvious recombination hotspots on chromosome 8, and the genes around them were mainly related to tooth development, which may have helped to enhance the adaption of buffalo to inferior feed. Among several genomic features, TE density has the strongest correlation with recombination rates. Moreover, the TE subfamily, SINE/tRNA, is likely to play a role in driving recombination into SVs.
   Conclusions: The male genome and sperm sequencing will facilitate the understanding of the buffalo genomic evolution and functional research.

AB  - To conceive an applicable genetic improvement plan for local goat population under arid regions, the study aims to determine the genetic parameters of linear body measurements and their correlation with body weight. Additionally, the study analyses statistical models and barymetric functions to predict body weight on the basis of their morphometric data. A random regression model (RRM) was applied to estimate covariance components and genetic parameters for weights and linear body measurements. The data comprised 13,095 records belonging to 945 local kids (progenies of 22 sires and 285 dams) born between 1998 and 2014. Year x month, sex x type of birth, and age of dam at kidding were classified as fixed effects. Random effects included in the model were the direct/maternal additive genetic effect, direct/maternal permanent environmental effect, and residual effect. Direct and maternal heritability estimates of linear body measurements ranged from 0.16 to 0.34 and 0.12 to 0.21, respectively, in which the total length had the lowest direct and highest maternal heritability estimates at birth among the other age groups. A significant maternal effect was obtained in early stage that decreased as the kids advanced in age. A negative correlation was found between direct and maternal additive genetic traits. Estimates of genetic correlations among linear body measurements were high and positive, with values ranging from 0.11 to 0.97, whereas the phenotypic correlation ranged from 0.05 to 0.83. The coefficient of determination for heart girth (R2 = 0.88) was higher than other body measurements in single trait evaluation, indicating it as the best trait for the predication of body weight; an increase in the coefficient of determination (R2) was observed as more variables were included in the prediction equation, which indicates more precision in the determination of body weight. These traits could be used as a marker for estimating body weight and for sustainable genetic improvement in local goat population.

AB  - Specialized pastoralists inhabited south-central Kenya approximately 3300 BP to 1200 BP, before the entrance of iron-using agriculturalists. The social and ecological context in which these pastoral groups were managing herds differs from anything documented historically in the region. Detailed zooarchaeological analyses of slaughter patterns and dental hypoplasias, in conjunction with stable isotope data, reveal subtle differences in herd management strategies at three pastoralist sites in Kenya's Central Rift Valley and Loita Plains. Isotopic data show that early pastoralists did not herd livestock seasonally to higher altitudes. The relatively low mobility of early herders allows for the examination of differences in livestock management by herders in different ecologies. We show that frequencies of hypoplasias in cattle are relatively low compared to caprines, and that cattle also have lower frequencies of severe hypoplasias. Hypoplasia data also show that livestock in the Central Rift Valley experienced more stress than those in the Loita-Mara plains. Environmental differences between the Central Rift Valley and Loita-Mara Plains likely influenced herd management strategies, as herders in the plains adjusted slaughter patterns to cope with suboptimal grazing conditions.

AB  - Neonicotinoids, systemic insecticides that are distributed into all plant tissues and protect against pests, have become a common part of crop production, but can unintentionally also affect non-target organisms, including pollinators. Such effects can be direct effects from insecticide exposure, but neonicotinoids can affect plant physiology, and effects could therefore also be indirectly mediated by changes in plant phenology, attractiveness and nutritional value. Under controlled greenhouse conditions, we tested if seed treatment with the neonicotinoid clothianidin affected oilseed rape's production of flower resources for bees and the content of the secondary plant products glucosinolates that provide defense against herbivores. Additionally, we tested if seed treatment affected the attractiveness of oilseed rape to flower visiting bumblebees, using outdoor mesocosms. Flowers and leaves of clothianidin-treated plants had different profiles of glucosinolates compared with untreated plants. Bumblebees in mesocosms foraged slightly more on untreated plants. Neither flower timing, flower size nor the production of pollen and nectar differed between treatments, and therefore cannot explain any preference for untreated oilseed rape. We instead propose that this small but significant preference for untreated plants was related to the altered glucosinolate profile caused by clothianidin. Thereby, this study contributes to the understanding of the complex relationships between neonicotinoid-treated crops and pollinator foraging choices, by suggesting a potential mechanistic link by which insecticide treatment can affect insect behavior.

AB  - Soil composition and herbivory are two environmental factors that can affect plant traits including flower traits, thus potentially affecting plant-pollinator interactions. Importantly, soil composition and herbivory may interact in these effects, with consequences for plant fitness. We assessed the main effects of aboveground insect herbivory and soil amendment with exuviae of three different insect species on visual and olfactory traits of Brassica nigra plants, including interactive effects. We combined various methodological approaches including gas chromatography/mass spectrometry, spectroscopy and machine learning to evaluate changes in flower morphology, colour and the emission of volatile organic compounds (VOCs). Soil amended with insect exuviae increased the total number of flowers per plant and VOC emission, whereas herbivory reduced petal area and VOC emission. Soil amendment and herbivory interacted in their effect on the floral reflectance spectrum of the base part of petals and the emission of 10 VOCs. These findings demonstrate the effects of insect exuviae as soil amendment on plant traits involved in reproduction, with a potential for enhanced reproductive success by increasing the strength of signals attracting pollinators and by mitigating the negative effects of herbivory.
   Summary statement Insect exuviae as soil amendment affected plant traits involved in reproduction of Brassica nigra plants, with a potential for enhanced reproductive success by enhancing pollinator attraction and by mitigating the negative effects of herbivory.

AB  - In 1983-1984, an unknown waterborne pathogen caused the mass mortality of long-spined sea urchin (Diadema antillarum) across the Caribbean and western tropical Atlantic. After approximately 15 years, urchin populations began to recover at some locations, yet few have reached pre-mortality densities. To date, no study has documented a recovery in the western tropical Atlantic outside of the Caribbean. Over a 25-year period (1991-2015), we documented an 8-17% population growth rate of D. antillarum in the central Bahamas. However, our mean observed densities, 0.06-0.38 urchins m(-2), remained below pre-pandemic levels. Combined with observations from other locations in the Caribbean, it appears that D. antillarum populations are increasing, yet have not fully recovered from their 1980s mass mortality throughout much of their geographic range.

AB  - The foraging ecology of sympatric mammals within xeric habitats is poorly understood. In this study, we surveyed the diets of two sympatric woodrat species, Neotoma bryanti, N. lepida and their hybrids in a desert shrubland during the dry season using stable isotope analyses of hair and arthropod DNA metabarcoding of feces. We found that woodrats regardless of their ancestry fed on similar plants during the same season across multiple years. However, stable isotope analyses and arthropod metabarcoding were consistent with greater arthropod ingestion by N. bryanti compared to N. lepida or hybrids. These results suggest that while the diets of these sympatric woodrats largely overlap during the dry season in terms of the plant components, they differ in terms of arthropod ingestion. This arthropod feeding may serve to reduce interspecific competition or act as dietary supplementation during nutritionally challenging periods. These results demonstrate that integrating DNA metabarcoding approaches with stable isotope tracers enables a more rigorous evaluation of animal foraging behavior.

AB  - Despite a surge in mercury (Hg) pollution from artisanal and small-scale gold mining (ASGM) in Zimbabwe's drainage basins, little is known about Hg trophodynamics in the country's major reservoirs. We analyzed fish tissues for total mercury (THg) and stable isotopes of nitrogen and carbon (delta N-15 and delta C-13) to compare patterns of biomagnification between two trophic guilds from a protected reservoir (Chivero) and an ASGM-impacted reservoir (Mazowe) and assessed consequences for human and fish health. Mean dry weight THg concentrations were significantly higher for both piscivorous and herbivorous fishes from Mazowe reservoir compared to fishes from similar feeding guilds in Chivero. Trophic magnification slopes (TMS), inferred from linear regressions between log(10)[THg] and delta N-15, revealed significant Hg biomagnification in Mazowe (TMS = 0.28; p < 0.05) and no evidence for Hg biomagnification in Chivero (TMS = - 0.005; p > 0.05). In Mazowe's piscivorous fishes, 32% had wet weight THg concentrations that surpassed 0.2 mu g/g ww, a threshold for susceptible human populations and biochemical and gene expression alterations in fish. In addition, 17% of Mazowe's piscivorous fishes surpassed the UNEP THg toxicity threshold for human consumption (0.5 mu g/g ww). To reduce exposure to Hg toxicity in humans, the maximum fish consumption for piscivorous species from Mazowe reservoir should not exceed 431 g/week for both adult male and female consumers. Our findings demonstrate the importance of creating freshwater-protected areas to prevent direct Hg contamination of aquatic ecosystems and the need for health agencies to provide fish consumption advisories to vulnerable communities.

AB  - To assess the potential effects of future climate change on Undaria pinnatifida cultivation in the Seto Inland Sea, Japan, we developed an individual-based growth model for the U. pinnatifida sporophyte. Initially, we validated the model's performance using field observation data. The simulation results replicated temporal variations in the total lengths of sporophytes at two stations with differing oceanographic conditions. Subsequently, we conducted numerical simulations of sporophyte growth in the Seto Inland Sea during the 1990s and projected outcomes for the 2090s under four emission scenarios of the Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP 2.6, 4.5, 6.0, and 8.5). The majority of areas exhibited decreased sporophyte growth in the 2090s compared to the 1990s, except for the eastern area under the RCP 2.6 scenario. This decline was attributed to delayed cultivation start times associated with ocean warming and reduced dissolved inorganic nitrogen concentrations. Interestingly, the impacts of ocean warming on U. pinnatifida cultivation were not uniformly negative. In addition to adverse effects, there were positive effects that accelerated growth rates in low-temperature winter areas. Sensitivity analyses revealed that the balance between positive and negative impacts varied geographically; moreover, the contrasts were enhanced with higher RCP scenarios. Simulations for climate change adaptation using a high-temperature tolerant cultivar indicated that yield losses could be mitigated, even under the RCP 8.5 scenario. Despite uncertainties in the simulation results, such as future management of nutrient loads and herbivore feeding damages, our projections underscore the potential sustainability and future viability of U. pinnatifida aquaculture in the Seto Inland Sea.

AB  - Bringing ecosystem services back to degraded areas through land restoration is a complex task across countries. For the establishment of vegetation, selecting high-performing plant species using ecological trait-based profiling was conducted to initiate restoration projects. Six-leaf ecological traits of twelve plant species were investigated, including Specific Leaf Area (SLA), Leaf Dry Matter Content (LDMC), Leaf Nitrogen Concentration (LNC), chlorophyll content, stomatal density, and stomata aperture size. The correlation between SLA and LNC, and also SLA and LDMC, indicated plant trade-offs in growth and life history strategy related to herbivory and flammability, respectively. SLA and LDMC are considered two strong predictors of plant performance which serve as the main requirement for selecting plant species in restoration, especially in growth performance (SLA), flammability, and herbivore resistance (LDMC). Moreover, according to the tropical Malesian region, leaf traits of exotic species Swietenia macrophylla and Ficus religiosa indicated a risk of invasiveness to some extent. Among ten native species, Protium javanicum, Syzygium polyantum, Canarium vulgare, and Artocarpus heterophyllus are considered the pioneer species in restoration. The pioneers with intensive weed control are Durio zibethinus and Cinnamomum sintoc. Whilst, the other native species Cynometra schefferi, Dimocarpus longan, Garcinia dulcis, Diospyros celebica are considered inserted species. We demonstrated that plant profiling using eco-physiological traits takes an important role in plant species selection, which serves as a critical stage in successful restoration programs.

AB  - In the present study Nigella sativa (seeds) and Fumaria parviflora (aerial), were used to treat buffaloes naturally infected with fasciolosis and their efficacy (%) was compared. In vivo, pre-and post-treatment (50 mg, 100 mg, and 150 mg/ kg body weight of the two medicinal plants) fecal egg counts were determined following standard fecal egg count reduction in buffaloes (Babulus sp.) of Nili Ravi breed naturally parasitized with Fasciola sp. The infected buffaloes were randomly divided into 3 main groups' i.e. A, B, and C. Animals in groups A and B were further subdivided into three subgroups i.e. A1, A2, A3; B1, B2, B3. Sub-groups A1 and B1 were given dose levels of 50mg/kg body weight, A2, and B2, 100mg while A3 and B3, 150mg/kg body weight of Nigella sativa (seeds) and Fumaria parviflora (aerial), respectively. Group C with infected animals served as a control. 2 medicinal plants has been found significantly (P<0.05) efficient (42-100%) and safe to use against fasciolosis.

AB  - Tolerance and resistance are two modes of defence mechanisms used by hosts when faced with parasites. Here, we assume tolerance reduces infection-induced mortality rate and resistance reduces the susceptibility of getting infected. Importantly, a negative association between these two strategies has often been found experimentally. We study the simultaneous evolution of resistance and tolerance in a host population where they are related by such a trade-off. Using evolutionary invasion theory, we examine the patterns of optimal investment in each defence strategy, under different ecological scenarios. Our focus is on predicting which of the two strategies is favoured under various epidemiological and ecological conditions. Our key findings surround the impact of recovery and sterility of infected hosts. As the rate at which infected hosts recover from the infection, that is the recovery rate increases, the investment in tolerance increases (resistance decreases) when infected hosts are sterile, but this pattern reverses when infected hosts can reproduce. We further found that a change in the parameter determining the intraspecies competition for resources leading to a reduction in birth rate, that is the crowding factor affects investments in tolerance and resistance only when infected hosts can reproduce. These results emphasize the role of fecundity in driving the evolutionary dynamics of a host. We also find that disease prevalence can increase or decrease depending on whether or not the host evolves: prevalence is highest at low recovery rates when the host does not evolve, but the feedback of a change in tolerance and resistance reverses this pattern, leading to lower prevalence at low recovery rates as host evolves.

AB  - Rhinoconjunctivitis and allergic asthma are among the most frequent diseases in the world, and pollen is their main cause. The incidence of respiratory allergic diseases is expected to grow in the coming years as a consequence of ambient pollution, changes in land use and land cover in cities, and climate change. In this context of global change, the environmental information provided by monitoring and warning networks must be as updated as possible in order to be useful to the end users in the cities. The Madrid Autonomous Region (central Spain) has suffered a noticeable change in its land -use configuration in recent decades and a significant upward temperature trend throughout the entire area. We found that the aerobiological stations in the Madrid Region Palynological Network, covering the most populated cities of this region in central Spain, registered a marked shift towards a greater airborne pollen load of the most abundant tree pollen taxa (Cupressaceae, Platanus and Quercus , but also Pinaceae, Olea and others). These temporal changes are very evident in the pollen calendar for two periods, 1994 -2004 (past) and 2012 -2022 (present), pointing to changes in the phenology and intensity of the airborne pollen dynamic in cities in the Madrid Region. Based on these findings, we present a technical proposal to the Madrid Region Palynological Network to generate pollen calendars for each city using the reference period of the last ten years, and to update this information every three years. Finally, we propose the latest pollen calendar for all the aerobiological stations in the Madrid Region Palynological Network for the last ten years (2013-2022), which is considered the reference aerobiological information at present for one of the most populated metropolitan areas in Europe.

AB  - Simple Summary Maintaining energy homeostasis requires numerous processes and interactions between many systems. This study investigated the relationships between leptin, growth hormone (GH), and factors involved in cell signaling, such as suppressors of cytokine signaling-3 (SOCS-3). Exogenous or endogenous factors affecting these relationships may have different origins, and their interactions are determined in this study. The finding that the length of day significantly influenced the concentrations of growth hormone as well as pituitary leptin- and GH-dependent SOCS-3 expressions suggests that photoperiod plays an important role in regulating the physiological processes underlying adaptive phenomena in response to changing seasons in sheep, which facilitates energy homeostasis despite changing external and internal conditions. This study examined how leptin affects growth hormone (GH) release and investigated the effects of leptin, GH, and day length on the suppressor of cytokine signaling-3 (SOCS-3) mRNA levels in the adenohypophyses of sheep. The study consisted of two experiments. The first experiment was conducted during long (LD) and short (SD) days. Within-season and replicate sheep were centrally infused with Ringer-Locke buffer or leptin three times at 60-min intervals at the beginning of experiments. The second experiment involved adenohypophyses collected from sheep that were euthanized in May or November. Pituitary explants were treated with medium alone (Control) or medium with leptin or GH at different concentrations and incubated for various times. The results of the first experiment indicated GH concentrations were seasonally dependent and that leptin had no effect on GH secretion. The results of the second experiment indicated a stronger influence of leptin on the expression of SOCS-3 during the SD season than the LD season. During SDs, significant effects of both GH doses on SOCS-3 expression were observed. These results indicate a strong association between leptin, GH, and SOCS-3, which may explain the disruption of SOCS-3 leptin and GH signaling and the dominant effect of photoperiod on the above relationships.

AB  - Defence theories provide predictions about trade-offs in the allocation of resources to defence and growth. However, very little is known about how pressure from herbivores influences the allocation of resources during reproduction. Two common peatland bryophyte species, Sphagnum angustifolium and S. capillifolium, were chosen as study species. Vegetative and reproductive shoots of both Sphagnum species were subjected to treatments with and without herbivores in a lab experiment. After 4 weeks of exposure to herbivores in a growth chamber, we measured biomass production, net photosynthesis rate, defence traits (phenolics in leachate and phenolics in extract), nonstructural carbohydrates (soluble sugar and starch), and reproductive traits (capsule number, weight and diameter, and spore germination) of both Sphagnum species. Reproductive shoots had higher constitutive defence than vegetative shoots in S. angustifolium, and a similar pattern was observed in S. capillifolium. With herbivory, reproductive shoots showed stronger induced defence (released more phenolics) than vegetative shoots in S. capillifolium, but not in S. angustifolium. Herbivory had no effect on capsule number, weight, or diameter, but reduced spore germination percentage by more than half in both species. Our study highlights the hidden effects of herbivory on reproduction of Sphagnum and indicates the presence of maternal effects in bryophytes. Ecologists will benefit from examining both quality- and quantity-based traits when attempting to estimate the herbivory effect on plant fitness.

AB  - Wildlife play prominent roles in popular images of America's outdoor landscapes, yet our understanding of their contribution to place meanings is not fully developed. Although environmental management agencies have a long history of stewarding wildlife for hunting and fishing, they have been less inclined to prioritize non-consumptive uses such as the contribution of wildlife to sense of place. Given that agencies are increasingly challenged to implement policies that align with citizen priorities, connecting wildlife to sense of place could lead to more effective decisions. Our research explored the plurality of connections that residents made with wildlife in multiple protected areas across the USA region of Interior Alaska. Residents of nine communities were engaged over a five-year period, followed by a thematic analysis of interview data, which resulted in the identification of seven place meaning themes. These themes reflected qualities of the local environment that were appreciated by residents, including: 1) desirable travel destination, 2) distinct sense of community, 3) landscape of subsistence and tradition, 4) landscape of wildlife habitat, 5) natural resources in need of harvesting, 6) rural Alaskan lifestyle, and 7) wildland areas tied to recreation. Native wildlife species-from traditionally charismatic species like moose (Alces alces) to less iconic species such as snowshoe hare (Lepus americanus) - were discussed in the context of all seven place meaning themes. Wildlife provided a basis for study participants to interpret landscapes and ascribe meanings to places, thus supporting our argument that shared influences of wildlife and place meanings should be prioritized in environmental planning and management.

AB  - The impact of three intercrop patterns of potato (P), Solanum tuberosum L., and safflower (S), Carthamus tinctorius L.: 4P:2S, 4P:4S, and 4P:8S (row ratios) along with single crops were examined on densities of the Colorado potato beetle (CPB), Leptinotarsa decemlineata (Say), biodiversity of predators, and yield profits over the growing season of potatoes in a randomized complete block design in 2019 and 2020 in Iran. The significant reduction in the densities of CPB (adults, eggs, and larvae) was seen in intercrops compared with single potato in either year. Accordingly, the damage index was decreased in intercrops than in single potato. Furthermore, intercrops resulted in an enhancement in the abundance of most predatory species of CPB, the Shannon diversity index (HGREEK TONOS), and the Pielou's evenness index (J'), especially in 4P:4S and 4P:8S than single potato. The values of R2 between the densities of CPB and the main predators were low (0.01 <= R2 <= 0.19) in June, whereas R2 values were significantly enhanced in July (0.13 <= R2 <= 0.71) and August (0.46 <= R2 <= 0.97). All intercrops delivered extra yield benefit compared with the single crops (LER >= 1.20 in 2019 and >= 1.18 in 2020). Our results dis-closed that all intercrops, especially 4P:4S and 4P:8S could exercise in the controlling of L. decemlineata in potato fields.

AB  - Grazing animals act as a bioindicator to study the heavy metal status in the pasture lands because excessive amount of toxic metals in the animal diet either disturb their normal activity or deposit the contaminants into their tissues. The aim of this study was to appraise the chromium status in soil and pasture crops with respect to the nutritional requirement of grazing animals. Three different sites were selected to collect soil, forages, and animal samples from District Jhang. All the samples were processed through atomic absorption spectrophotometer to analyze the chromium concentration in them. Chromium concentration was varied as 0.703-4.20 mg/kg in soil, 0.45-2.85 mg/kg in forages, and 0.588-2.37 mg/kg in all collected animal samples. Both the soil and forage samples displayed the maximum chromium concentration in the Capparis decidua, whereas animal samples revealed maximum concentration in animal blood. Results of pollution load index (0.078 to 0.463 mg/kg) exhibited that all the sample values are less than unity while enrichment factor (1.57-8.25mg/kg) showed that significant level of chromium is enriched in these sites. The maximum value of daily intake (0.0007-0.0055mg/kg/day) and health risk index (0.0004-0.00370055mg/kg/day) was observed in the buffalo that feed on the Capparis decidua. Bio-concentration factor (0.398-2.09mg/kg) value was the maximum in the Medicago sativa. It is concluded that all the animal samples showed chromium concentration beyond their standards. Thus, proper measures should be taken to reduce the metal contamination in these areas that ultimately lessen the availability of toxic metals to grazing animals.

AB  - We describe here new materials of the Paleocene meridiolestidan mammal Peligrotherium tropicalis from the Banco Negro Inferior (BNI) facies of the Salamanca Formation of Punta Peligro, Chubut Province, Argentina. Past interpretations of the dental features in Peligrotherium have been handicapped by specimen incompleteness and extensive wear. The new specimens include a relatively complete and largely unworn dentition, as well as jaws and a partial skull of a single individual. Differential wear suggests the presence of three upper and lower premolars (P/p) and molars (M/m), with the last premolar fully molarized, as has been argued for other meridiolestidans, particularly mesungulatoids. Upper and lower P/p2-M/m3 show accessory roots and we infer the same sequential dental replacement pattern seen in other meridiolestidans, such as Cronopio and Orretherium. A high cementoenamel junction (CEJ) with a pronounced ridge that has undergone oral abrasion suggests a thick and tall gingiva, similar to the condition in extant hippopotamuses. Peligrotherium is the largest known mesungulatoid, with a body mass exceeding 5 kg. Cretaceous mesungulatoids are also heavy, suggesting the persistence of a relatively large lineage of mammals across the K-Pg boundary, a hypothesis also suggested for a crocodile lineage present in the same outcrops. Acquisition of a similar type of dentition by dryolestoids and early tribosphenic herbivores in the Late Cretaceous/Paleocene of North and South America points to the global spread of similar vegetation, likely composed of angiosperm groups that predate the K-Pg and successfully navigated the cataclysm at the end of the Mesozoic, diversifying in the early Cenozoic.

AB  - Plants have coevolved with herbivorous insects for millions of years, resulting in variation in resistance both within and between species. Using a manipulative experiment combined with untargeted metabolomics, microbiome sequencing and transcriptomics approaches, we investigated the roles of plant metabolites and the microbiome in defence mechanisms in native resistant Manchurian ash (Fraxinus mandshurica) trees and non-native susceptible velvet ash (Fraxinus velutina) trees against the highly invasive emerald ash borer (EAB, Agrilus planipennis). Comparative transcriptomics and metabolomics analyses show that the phenylpropanoid pathway, which is enriched in differentially expressed genes and differentially abundant metabolites, may serve as a potential regulator of resistance. Additionally, the microbiome is distinctly shifted in two ash species. Indicator taxa analysis reveals that the distinct genera are dominant in the galleries of two ash species, for example, Pseudomonas in velvet, and Hafnia-Obesumbacterium in Manchurian. The strong correlation between indicator taxa and metabolites suggests that the chemical compounds might impact the microbial community in phloem directly or indirectly, or vice versa. This study significantly enhances our understanding of the variation in resistance between ash species and its contribution to the invasion success of EAB, providing valuable insights for the development of pest management strategies.

AB  - Modern physical and chemical soil properties can favor or exclude C-3 and C-4 plants, yet little is known regarding these relationships from deep-time records that track the evolution and expansion of C-4 vegetation. In this study, we used a multi- proxy approach to reconstruct vegetation (C-3 vs. C-4 biomass) and pedogenic properties (soil alkalinity, salinity, sodicity, and texture) from paleolandscapes at Coffee Ranch, Texas, a site from which fossil horses provide the earliest evidence for C-4 herbivory in the Great Plains of North America. Local proportion of C-4 biomass was assessed using stable carbon isotope ratios of calcium carbonates (delta C-13(cc)) and organic matter (delta(13)(Com)) analyzed on four different paleosol types, freshwater tufa, and reworked carbonate nodules in fluvial channel lags. Using a Monte Carlo uncertainty analysis, we interpret delta C-13(cc) (range = 8.5 to 5.2% VPDB) and delta(13)(Com) values (range = 25.9 to 24.2% VPDB) to be consistent with C-4 biomass low in abundance and variability at the study site, but with large uncertainties that would be overlooked using simple linear mixing model approaches. Paleo-pedogenic properties were reconstructed using pedotransfer functions and provide evidence of possible salinity and sodicity in two of five paleosol profiles. However, saline-sodic conditions and soil texture were not correlated with delta C-13 values, contrary to some modern mixed C-3-C-4 biomes. Using late Miocene CO2 and paleoclimate model reconstructions, we argue that conditions were at or near crossover thresholds favoring C-4 over C-3 photosynthesis in the Great Plains despite the low abundance of C-4 vegetation across the paleolandscapes. This study presents evidence that abiotic factors that select for C-4 plants in modern systems-high growing season temperature, low atmospheric CO2, salinity-sodicity, and soil texture-were less influential in the late Miocene than biotic factors (i.e., ecological feedbacks) that suppressed C-4 plants prior to their increase in abundance in the Great Plains in the Pliocene.

AB  - BackgroundEthnoveterinary studies are important to maintain the sustainability of livestock health and support people's livelihoods through the provision of food, maintaining livestock health, and other biological resources. This study was carried out in Soro District, southern Ethiopia, to identify, document and analyse plant species with ethnoveterinary uses along with the associated indigenous and local knowledge.Materials and methodsInformants were selected using purposive (key informants) and systematic random sampling (general informants) methods. Data on ethnoveterinary plants and their uses were collected through semi-structured interviews, guided field walks, 13 focus group discussions with five to seven members in each and participant observation. Informant consensus factor and fidelity level were computed to identify the most common livestock ailment categories and the best plant species with ethnoveterinary use, respectively. Preference ranking methods were used to identify the potentially effective ethnoveterinary medicinal plants for the most frequently reported livestock ailments. The use diversity of multipurpose plants with ethnoveterinary importance was analysed using the analytical methods of ethnobotany including priority ranking, comparisons and important indices. The T-test statistic was used to compare knowledge differences among different social groups.ResultsA total of 132 plant species in 120 genera and 61 families were reported by informants as having ethnoveterinary uses. The plants are said to be used by the local communities in various ways to treat 50 livestock health problems. Higher number of informants (23.77%) cited Momordica foetida for the treatment of 16 livestock ailments. The highest informant consensus value for this species is associated with its use for treating blackleg in cattle; Nicotiana tabacum was cited for the treatment of 15 livestock ailments mainly recommended for the Lumpy Skin Disease/Ailment of bovines; Croton macrostachyus for treatment of 13 livestock ailments including wooden tongue, FMD in bovines; and Gymnanthemum amygdalinum for nine ailments mainly diarrhoea of all livestock types. Achyranthes aspera is claimed to provide the most effective treatment for Aspiration pneumonia (severe coughing in bovines, sheep and goats) alone, while Croton macrostachyus, Ximenia americana, Allium sativum and Juniperus procera were indicated as potential plant species to treat Lumpy Skin Disease in bovines in the order given. The fidelity level analysis showed that Datura stramonium, Dodonaea viscosa subsp. angustifolia and Asparagus africanus were potential medicinal plant species to treat the respective ailments of rabies, Peste des petits ruminants (PPR) and evil eye/spirit. Multipurpose plant species including Prunus africanus, Combretum molle and Afrocarpus falcatus have been highly threatened as indicated by direct matrix ranking mainly due to collection of fuel wood, construction materials and making household utensils, and farm implements rather than for other uses.ConclusionSoro District has rich and diversified livestock herbal medicinal resources, and indigenous knowledge of remedy preparations and applications is transmitted through generation lines. This resource faces anthropogenic threats with deforestation being the leading factor. Consequently, ethnoveterinary medicinal plants continue to decline before adequate and proper scientific documentation and testing are made.
   There is a dire need for planning and implementation of appropriate in situ and ex situ conservation strategies and to strive towards ensuring the survival and sustainable utilization of such important plant resources of Soro District. This must be supported by further documentation of the associated indigenous knowledge and pharmacological testing of the key promising species including Balanites aegyptiaca (novel species/NS to treat specific ailment), Brugmansia suaveolens (novel species/NS reported first to treat Livestock ailments/LsAs), Euclea divinorum (NS to treat specific ailments), Grevillea robusta (NS), Hagenia abyssinica (NS for the reported specific ailment), Pentanema confertiflorum (NS), Juniperus procera (NS), Maesa lanceolata (NS), Millettia ferruginea (NS for reported specific ailments), Schrebera alata/NS, Securidaca longepedunculata, Spiniluma oxyacantha/NS, Vepris nobilis (novel species reported first to treat LsAs), Zanthoxylum asiaticum /NS and Ximenia americana (NS for specific ailments). This ethnoveterinary study attempted to fill part of the gaps concerning the prevalent livestock health problems and the associated indigenous and local knowledge in the area.

AB  - The main objectives of this study are to analyze the presence of potentially toxic chemical elements (PTEs) in fish and shrimp from Sepetiba Bay (coastal region of the State of Rio de Janeiro, SE Brazil), compared to results obtained in previous studies and to discuss the risks of consuming contaminated food for humans. Sepetiba Bay is a coastal system heavily contaminated by PTEs. Concentrations of As, Cd, Co, Cr, Cu, Ni, Pb, Se, and Zn were analyzed in tissues and organs of crustaceans (shrimp, Farfantepenaeus subtilis) and bony fishes (Cynoscion leiarchus, Cynoscion acoupa, Centropomus undecimalis, Plagioscion squamosissimus, Selene setapinnis, and Caranx hippos) using an Inductively Coupled Plasma Optical Emission Spectrometer (ICP-OES). Copper was the element that reached the highest levels among the analyzed species/tissues/organs, followed by Zn > Se > As>Cd > Pb > Cr > Ni > Co. Still, Zn, Cu, and Cr were present in all analyzed samples. For most species, the organs with the highest levels of PTEs were the heart and liver. The statistical results showed positive and significant correlations between the PTE concentrations of the analyzed species/tissues/organs. The Bioenrichment Factors (BF: the ratio between the levels of PTEs in the analyzed tissues/organs and the limits defined by the regulatory agencies) show that there are higher levels of PTEs than those allowed by law in the analyzed species/tissues/organs (descending order number of times higher): Cr (71), Se (35), Pb (32), Cu (23), As (13), Cd (10), Zn (7), and Co (5). For example, Cr showed relatively high BF values: C. acoupa (heart: 70 times; gills 9 times), C. undecimalis (heart 17 times), C. leiarchus (gills 13 times; heart 11 times; liver 9 times); gonads 8 times), C. undecimalis (gills 12 times), P. squamosissimus (gills 10 times) and F. subtilis (cephalothorax 9 times; carapace 7 times; muscle 7 times). The heart of S. setapinnis (35 times), the liver of P. squamosissimus (23 times), and the muscle of F. subtilis (4 times) showed Se enrichment higher than the amount authorized by Brazilian legislation (Anvisa). The gills of P. squamosissimus (32 times) and the gonads of C. leiarchus (5 times) and C. acoupa (4 times) indicated considerable bioaccumulation values for Pb enrichment, above the FAO/WHO (Food and Agriculture Organization/World Health Organization) limit. Therefore, this study shows a potential risk of metal contamination in the population that eats fish in the Sepetiba region. Fish is part of the traditional diet of the population living around Sepetiba Bay, primarily among low-income families who dominate the area. The results of this study suggest the need to monitor seafood contamination in this region.

AB  - In Spain, livestock farming is a significant activity area that generates substantial revenues and essential jobs. However, the actual impact that this intensive activity might have on the environment is not entirely understood. Moreover, coastal aquifers are subjected to a significant environmental pressure due to nearby growing population, intensive agriculture, and livestock farming. In this work, three representative pig slurry ponds, under semiarid conditions, were studied using different techniques to evaluate the subsurface conditions in terms of pH, electrical conductivity, salts, and nitrate content. The electrical resistivity tomography (ERT) technique was employed in this study, which provides electrical resistivity values from the subsurface materials and fluids. These electrical resistivity values were compared to data obtained from geochemical analyses to derive their relationships and establish the pig slurry-affected subsurface area. Thus, ERT-based lower electrical resistivity values were associated with higher salts concentrations and nitrate content. ERT values indicated a near-surface affected by slurry infiltration that coincided with the increase of geochemical values obtained from sample analyses. Additionally, Spearman's correlation was used to evaluate the correlation between electrical resistivity data and the physical-chemical properties of soil. The most important pollutant accumulation mainly occurs in the two-meter depth. Therefore, the risk of slurry ponds affecting deep aquifers is limited in the studied area. Finally, this study proves a complete, affordable, and scalable methodology application to livestock residue storage facilities.

AB  - The physical properties of plants affect the transmission of plant-borne vibrational signals, which many herbivorous insects use for communication. Male calling signals (MCaSs, with sections S0, S1, and S2) and courtship signals (MCoSs, with sections S1 and S2) of Empoasca onukii Matsuda (Hemiptera: Cicadellidae), a major pest of tea plant, have a multicomponent structure. The same MCaS was repeatedly played back on different leaves of a tea branch, and parameters of the transmitted signal and female responses were measured on the leaf inhabited by females. We also measured the signal parameters and behaviors of E. onukii on single leaves of different ages. The intensity of MCaSs from other leaves attenuated after they propagated to leaves on which females were located, which decreased the duration of MCaS-S2. Higher leaf thickness, leaf hardness, and leaf area were associated with an increased pulse repetition time (PRT) of MCaSs, number of pulses in MCaS-S2, and duration of MCaS-S2, respectively. MCoS-S1 had a higher dominant frequency (Df) in leaves with a long main vein and high hardness, and the PRT of MCoS-S2 was longer on thicker leaves. In the initial stage of courtship, the signal excitation of males was affected by leaf traits, especially the temporal parameters of MCaS-S2, which was the most significantly affected section after host transmission; it also had an important effect on the response delay of females. In the location stage, the signal excitation of males was not only affected by leaf traits but also interacted with the signal excitation of females. These results facilitate exploration of the interaction between leafhoppers and host plants during courtship communication and have implications for the breeding of E. onukii-resistant varieties.

AB  - Current study was undertaken to investigate the effect of different levels of phosphorous (P) and phosphorous plus nitrogen (NP) fertilizer on nutritive value and in situ digestion kinetics of oat fodder in Nili Ravi buffalo bulls. Four cannulated buffalo bulls were used for in situ screening of oat fodder harvested at 100 days of age sown using different levels of phosphorous and phosphorous plus nitrogen fertilizers. Dry matter (DM) and crude protein (CP) content were higher (p<0.05) in oat fodder supplemented with P and NP fertilizer as compared to control. The supplementation of P fertilizer resulted in decreased NDF and hemicellulose and did not show any effect on ADF content of oat fodder. At 48 h of incubation, in situ digestibility of DM, CP, NDF, ADF and hemicellulose was greater (p<0.05) with medium levels (N20P20 and N25P25) of P and NP fertilizer as compared to control. The extent of DM, CP, NDF, ADF and hemicellulose digestion and rate of degradation was increased in response to P and NP fertilization. However, the lag time of DM, CP, NDF, ADF and hemicellulose of oat fodder was the inverse because it decreased in repose to medium level of P and NP fertilization as compared to control.

AB  - The complex relationships that exist between terrestrial mammals and their habitats make African ecosystems highly interactive environments. Anthropogenic activities including climate change have altered geochemical cycles, which influence nutrient availability and deficiency at local, regional and global scales. As synergistic and antagonistic interactions occur between essential elements at both deficiency and excess concentrations, the differences in feeding strategy between trophically distinct groups of terrestrial vertebrates are likely to influence the degree to which overall nutrient needs are met or may be deficient. The overall aim of this study was to investigate and compare quantitative differences of nine essential elements in terrestrial vertebrates occupying different trophic levels within two protected areas; Tswalu Kalahari Reserve (TKR) and Manyeleti Nature Reserve (MNR) South Africa, using faeces as an analytical matrix. Results from linear mixed effects models highlight that concentrations varied widely between individuals. Overall, measured concentrations above their respective means were evident for B and Mn in herbivores, Fe in omnivores and Cu, Co, Fe, Se and Zn in carnivores. Measured concentrations of Mo and Ni did not differ significantly between trophic groups. Although site-specific differences were evident for specific elements, measured mean concentrations of B, Co, Cu, Fe, Mo, Ni, Se and Zn were significantly higher overall at the MNR study site compared to the TKR site. This is the first study to noninvasively assess essential element concentrations across trophic levels in free ranging African wildlife species within protected areas of the savannah biome. Combined with the assessment of environmental matrices, this approach can be used as an effective diagnostic tool for the assessment of animal welfare and the management of protected areas globally.

AB  - Predation by feral cats (Felis catus) has caused the extinction of many native species in Australia and globally. There is growing evidence that the impacts of feral cats can be amplified in post-fire environments, as cats are drawn to hunt in or around recently burnt areas and are also more effective hunters in open habitats. In 2018-2019, we established arrays of camera traps to estimate the abundance of feral cats on Kangaroo Island, South Australia. Much of the island (including five of our seven survey sites) was subsequently burnt in a severe wildfire (December 2019-February 2020). We re-sampled the sites 3-8 months post-fire (seven sites) and 11-12 months post-fire (three sites). At two unburnt sites sampled post-fire, it was possible to produce density estimates of cats using a spatially explicit capture-recapture approach. Where estimating density was not possible (due to low detections or individual cats not being distinguishable), the number of individuals and percentage of trap nights with detections was compared between the sampling periods. Some low-level cat control occurred within 2 km of three of the seven arrays (all within the burn scar) within 3 months of the fire. Across the five burnt sites, there was a decline in cat detections post-fire (including those without post-fire cat control). At 3-8 months post-fire, there was, on average, a 57% reduction in the number of individual cats, and a 65% reduction in the number of nights with cat detections, relative to pre-fire levels. Although cat detections declined following the fire, reduced population sizes of prey species and reduced cover as a result of the fire might still mean that cat predation is a threat to some surviving prey species. Management that reduces feral cat predation pressure on wildlife following wildfire should enhance the likelihood of post-fire wildlife persistence and recovery.

AB  - Developing and implementing improved management practices are necessary to enhance the sustainability of organic cropping systems. This study examined the effects of various organic cropping systems on soil green-house gas (GHG) emissions and crop yields in Que ' bec, Canada. Organic cropping systems combining different: (i) crop sequences (barley [Hordeum vulgare L.]-grain corn [Zea mays L.], soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr.]-spring wheat [Triticum aestivum L.], and grain corn-soybean), (ii) nitrogen (N) sources (poultry manure [PM] and/or a fall-seeded green manure [GM] or no applied N), and (iii) primary tillage intensities (moldboard plough [MP] or chisel plough [CP]) were compared to a perennial forage (PF) and a bare fallow (BF) control. During the 2019 and 2020 snow-free seasons, nitrous oxide (N2O) and methane (CH4) emissions, soil water content, soil tem-perature, and mineral N concentrations were monitored periodically on a sandy loam soil. The lowest cumulative N2O emissions were found in CP-GM (0.52 +/- 0.11 kg N ha-1 in 2019 and 0.47 +/- 0.06 kg N ha-1 in 2020), whereas the highest N2O emissions were found in MP-PM in 2019 (3.55 +/- 0.72 kg N ha-1) and BF in 2020 (1.44 +/- 0.20 kg N ha-1). For the barley-grain corn sequence, the CP-GM treatment generated N2O emissions that were 40-70 % lower and yields that were 33-51 % lower than the MP-PMGM and CP-PMGM systems, which showed equivalent N2O emissions and yields. Yield-scaled N2O emissions were equivalent for all cropping systems. Peak N2O daily fluxes in the PF occurred shortly after cutting in 2020. During both years, CH4 emissions varied from -0.65 to + 0.18 kg C ha-1 with no detectable differences among cropping systems. The CP-GM cropping system minimized area-scaled N2O emissions without increasing yield-scaled emissions. However, this was a two-year study on a site that was recently converted from conventional agriculture, so a long-term assessment is still necessary to determine whether the benefits associated with these cropping systems change over time.

AB  - Simple Summary The issue of whether increasing inbreeding may be associated with a decrease in the trait values used to select sheep was investigated in all sheep breeds in Germany to obtain a picture of all populations in this country. We analyzed heritabilities and inbreeding depression for the three traits of wool quality, muscling conformation and exterior, for which all sheep intended for breeding are evaluated and upon which breeding decisions in Germany are based. All sheep breeds with sufficient data were included, resulting in 30 different breeds representing all breeding directions in different ecosystems. Heritabilities were across all breeds of moderate size. We estimated the degree of inbreeding depression by animal models and employing linear regressions of the phenotypic trait on inbreeding coefficients calculated from pedigree data. Linear regression slopes were estimated for the individual rate of inbreeding and new and ancestral inbreeding. Inbreeding depression was significant for all three traits when averaged across all 30 sheep breeds and was associated with a reduction in the mean value of the phenotypic trait by 0.33% standard deviation units. Positive effects through ancestral inbreeding seem to have an impact on the exterior of sheep. The results of this study should help to determine the effects of inbreeding on breeding objective traits in sheep breeds.Abstract This study provides comprehensive results on the current status of inbreeding depression for traits upon which sheep are selected for the herdbook in Germany. A total of 30 sheep breeds from the OviCap national database met the inclusion criteria for the present analysis regarding the depth and completeness of pedigrees and the number of animals with phenotypic data. We analyzed heritabilities and inbreeding depression for the three breeding objective traits of wool quality, muscling conformation and exterior. Heritabilities were across all breeds of moderate size, with estimates of 0.18 for wool quality and muscling conformation and of 0.14 for exterior. The models employed to estimate linear regression slopes for individual and ancestral inbreeding rates also account for non-genetic effects and the additive genetic effect of the animal. Inbreeding depression was obvious for all three traits when we averaged the estimates across all 30 sheep breeds. Inbreeding depression was significant for wool quality for only a few breeds, whereas for muscling conformation, 14/30 breeds achieved significant estimates. A 1% increase in inbreeding decreased the mean of all three traits across all sheep breeds by 0.33% of their standard deviation. Positive effects due to ancestral inbreeding were only significant in very few breeds in the different traits. Across all 30 sheep breeds, there were indications that purging effects (a reduction in negative effects of inbreeding depression due to selection for heterozygotes) may play a role for the exterior. The results of this study should help for reviewing breeding programs, particularly for sheep breeds with critical effective population sizes and increasing rates of inbreeding, with regard to the selection policy and selection intensity applied.

AB  - Simple Summary The sika deer is a very flexible invasive species, capable of living dynamically in both large forests and mixed environment characterized by a prevalence of agricultural land. The Japanese sika deer was introduced to the Czech Republic at the end of the 19th century. The success of an introduced alien species may consist in their hybridizing with closely related taxa. Where few barriers to gene flow exist, rapid introgression of genetic traits from one species into another frequently occurs. The current Czech sika populations embody the most abundant and expanding group in continental Europe. In western Bohemia, we confirmed the interspecific hybridization with the native red deer. In this context, the red deer gene pool is endangered. The animals proliferate steadily in all directions and will most probably spread all over the Czech Republic if no major, timely changes in game management are adopted. Although inter-species hybrids between the red and sika deer can be phenotypically determined only exceptionally, there is the eventuality of identification via molecular genetic analysis. We used bi-parentally inherited microsatellite markers and a Bayesian statistical framework to re-examine the proportion of hybrids in the Czech red and sika deer populations. In total, 123 samples were collected, and the nuclear dataset consisted of 2668 allelic values. The number of alleles per locus ranged from 10 (BM1818) to 22 (BM888 and T193), yielding the mean of 16 alleles per locus across the deer. The mean allelic diversity of the red deer markedly exceeded that of the Japanese sika deer. Interspecific hybrids were detected, enabling us to confirm the genetic introgression of the sika deer into the red deer populations and vice versa in western Bohemia. The mean hybrid score equaled 10.6%, with 14.3% of the hybrids being among red deer-like individuals and 6.7% among sika-like ones. At two western Bohemian locations, namely, Doupovske hory and SlavkovskATIN SMALL LETTER Y WITH ACUTE les, the total percentages of hybrid animals equaled 18.8 and 8.9, respectively. No red deer alleles were detected in the sika populations of the subregions of Kladska, Zlutice, and Lany. The NeighborNet network clearly separated the seven red and sika deer sampling populations according to the geography. The knowledge gained from the evaluated data is applicable in hunting management to reduce hybridization with the European deer.

AB  - The influences of stocking density on stereotypic behavior, fecal cortisol and the musk secretion of captive Alpine musk deer (Moschus chrysogaster) were studied in the Xinglongshan Musk Deer Farm (XMDF) of Xinglongshan National Nature Reserve in Gansu Province of Northwest China from the 1st November to the 30th December 2020. The behavior of 26 captive male musk deer was recorded using focal animal sampling and all-occurrence recording, while radioimmunoassay was used to determine fecal cortisol and testosterone levels, and the muscone content was determined by gas chromatography-flame ionization detection (GC-FID). The results showed that the stereotypy behavior of individuals in high stocking density group (HDG) was more frequent (88.89%) and lasted longer (8.4 +/- 1.0%) than of individuals in low density group (LDG) (50% and 4.2 +/- 1.7%, respectively) (p < 0.05). The fecal cortisol level of HDG individuals (60.19 +/- 5.83 ng g(- 1)) was significantly higher than that of LDG musk deer (36.34 +/- 4.77 ng g(- 1)) (p < 0.05). There was no difference in muscone content, musk secretion and testosterone level between HDG and LDG individuals (p > 0.05). In musk deer farming of XMDF, the stocking density significantly influenced the health of captive Alpine musk deer, but had no significant impact on the musk secretion.

AB  - Extrafloral nectaries (EFNs) are anti-herbivory defense-related glands. We measured morphological and anatomical EFN traits in Pityrocarpa moniliformis trees along a rainfall gradient in Caatinga dry forest. We observed a reduction in structural EFN traits as rainfall decreased. We conclude that this reduction is a cost-saving strategy, probably mediated by ants.

AB  - Background GPS/GSM tracking data were used to contrast use of (i) habitats and (ii) protected areas between three Arctic-nesting Greater White-fronted Geese (Anser albifrons, GWFG) populations throughout the annual cycle. We wished to demonstrate that the East Asian Continental Population (which winters on natural wetlands in the Chinese Yangtze River floodplain and is currently declining) avoids using farmland at multiple wintering sites. We also gathered tracking evidence to support general observations from two increasing population of GWFG, the North Sea-Baltic (which winters in Europe) and the West Pacific (which winter in Korea and Japan) winter mostly within farmland landscapes, using wetlands only for safe night roosts. Methods We tracked 156 GWFG throughout their annual cycle using GPS/GSM transmitters from these three populations to determine migration routes and stopover staging patterns. We used Brownian Bridge Movement Models to generate summer, winter and migration stopover home ranges which we then overlaid in GIS with land cover and protected area boundary at national level to determine habitat use and degree of protection from nature conservation designated areas. Results Data confirmed that 73% of European wintering GWFG homes ranges were from within farmland, compared to 59% in Japan and Korea, but just 5% in China, confirming the heavy winter use of agricultural landscapes by GWFG away from China, and avoidance of farmland at multiple sites within the Yangtze River floodplain. The same GWFG used farmland in northeast China in spring and autumn, confirming their experience of exploiting such habitats at other stages of their annual cycle. Chinese wintering birds showed the greatest overlap with protected areas of all three populations, showing current levels of site safeguard are failing to protect this population. Conclusions Results confirm the need for strategic planning to protect the East Asian Continental GWFG population. While the site protection network in place to protect the species seems adequate, it has failed to stop the declines. Buffalo grazing could serve as one simple strategy to improve the condition of feeding habitats at Dongting Lake and Poyang Lake in the Yangtze, where vast Carex meadows exist. In addition, while we warn against pushing GWFG to winter farmland feeding in China because of the long-term potential to conflict with agricultural interests, we recommend experimental sacrificial, disturbance-free farmland within designated refuge areas adjacent to the Yangtze River floodplain wetland reserves as a manipulative experiment to improve the conservation status of this population in years when natural food sources are limited.

AB  - In the context of modern pig farming, the central role of boars is underscored by large-scale centralized breeding and the widespread application of artificial insemination techniques. However, previous studies and breeding programs have focused mainly on product efficiency traits, such as growth rate, lean meat yield, and litter size, often neglecting boar semen traits. In this study, we estimated the genetic parameters and assessed the genomic prediction accuracy of boar semen traits with phenotypes evaluated from 274,332 ejections in a large population consisting of 2467 Duroc boars. Heritability of sperm morphological abnormality rate (ABN), fresh semen volume (VOL), sperm concentration (DEN), and motility (MOT) were estimated to be 0.43, 0.22, 0.23, and 0.16, respectively. GBLUP achieved a moderate predictive ability of semen traits, with a range of 0.32-0.50. Incorporating gene interactions indicated by the KEGG pathways (biBLUP) significantly improved predictive accuracy over the classical additive model (GBLUP) and epistatic model (RKHS). Moreover, biBLUP showed an improvement from 9.50% to 20.10% among the studied traits compared with GBLUP, with the greatest improvement (0.40 vs. 0.48) observed in sperm morphological abnormality rate. In conclusion, moderate to low heritability was estimated for the Duroc boar semen traits. Genomic prediction was able to achieve moderate accuracy, with a range from 0.32 to 0.56, for the studied traits. Considering gene interactions within KEGG pathways enhanced the predictive ability of boar semen traits.

AB  - Angelica sinensis (Oliv.) Diels, called DangGui in Chinese of the family Umbelliferae is a well-known perennial medicinal plant with versatile medicinal properties in the Chinese traditional medicine. In this research, a field experiment was carried on to understand the effect of organic and chemical fertilizers on biomass, ferulic acid content, essential oil yield, essential oil content and compositions of A. sinensis in Minhe county of Qinghai province of China. The treatments were: control (without fertilizer), pig manure (PM, 13.5 t ha(-1)), sheep manure (SM, 9.8 t ha(-1) ), chemical fertilizers (CF, 60, 45 and 30 kg.ha(-1), nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), kalium (K), respectively), organic fertilizer (OF, 600kg ha(-1)), pig manure + chemical fertilizers (PM+CF, 6.75 t ha(-1)+ 30-27.5-15 kg ha(-1) N, P, K) and sheep manure + chemical fertilizers (SM+CF, 4.9 t ha(-1)+ 30-27.5-15 kg ha(-1) N, P, K ). PM+CF treatment produced 31.4% higher crop yields and 49.4% higher essential oil yield over the control, respectively. The highest mean values of chlorophyll -a (2.07mg center dot g(-1)), chlorophyll -b (0.61mg center dot g(-1)) and total chlorophyll (2.68 mg center dot g(-1)) were acquired under the treatment of PM+CF. The major component of essential oil of A. sinensis is ligustilide. The highest amount of ligustilide was acquired under the treatment of PM+CF. The ferulic acid was increased (48.85% compared with control) under the treatment of PM+CF. The P and K contents of the soil were increased under the treatment of PM+CF (around 30.13% and 25.53% higher over the control, respectively). Our studies indicated that the combined application of fertilizers improved soil nutirent, leading to increase in biomass yield and improved the quality of A. sinensis.

AB  - Herbivory is an important ecological filter, affecting plant establishment in restoration sites. One group of herbivores whose abundance has been increasing with environmental changes are the leaf-cutting ants (LCA). Here we evaluated the influence of the surrounding landscape on Atta sexdens nest density in restoration sites, by testing the hypothesis that sites farthest from forest fragments or with less surrounding habitat cover have higher nest density. The study was conducted in eleven reforestations with native species, amidst an agricultural matrix in southern Brazil. For each site, we estimated LCA nest density (active, inactive and total) and landscape metrics (distance to nearest forest fragment, surrounding habitat area and an index combining both distance and surrounding habitat area, the Proximity Index). There were negative relationships between active and total nest density and surrounding habitat area. These results suggest that increased isolation from forest fragments is a factor contributing to the relaxation of top-down control. Therefore, the increase in A. sexdens population density in restoration sites is a result, at least in part, of low pressure from natural enemies, since LCA are not limited by resource availability.

AB  - Carbon (C) assimilation and allocation play a crucial role in determining plant responses to environmental stress such as herbivory. However, the pattern how these grasses allocate assimilated C under increasing herbivory intensity hasn't been fully understand. In this study, we quantified photosynthetic C assimilation and allocation of newly assimilated C among tissues and metabolic processes (structural growth, storage, and defense) under different grazing intensities using C-13 tracing of a dominant grass species, Leymus chinensis. Light grazing promoted utilization of newly-assimilated C-13 (more than 90% C-13 allocated to aboveground tissues on first day after labeling), photosynthetic rate, and reduced mean residence time of C-13 of L. chinensis . The photosynthetic capacity and regulation of chlorophyll fluorescence thereby C assimilation were constrained under medium and heavy grazing. Light grazing also increased accumulation of non-structural carbohydrates (NSC) in stems for energy supply to leaf regeneration. As herbivory pressure increased, C-13 tracing showed preferential allocation of newly assimilated C to belowground tissues (16-27% C-13 on first day after labeling), while upregulating leaf defenses by increasing secondary metabolites and in root storage by NSC accumulation. Although the significant changes showed in C allocation to storage and secondary metabolism of L. chinensis , there are no difference in structural growth (defined as structural biomass= biomass - NSC - secondary metabolites) among grazing intensities. Overall, L. chinensis adopted a conservative C-allocation strategy (upregulated C storage and secondary metabolism) that emphasized long-term survival under increasing herbivory. Light grazing was an optimal grazing intensity that promoted structural growth and C allocation of L. chinensis , which could sustain and even increase grassland productivity. These characteristics of the plant's C allocation strategy provide new insights into the C budget of grassland ecosystems and increase our understanding of the role of C fixation and partitioning when plants respond to environmental challenges.

AB  - Sect. Tuberculate Chang belongs to the genus Camellia, which is an endemic group in China and has high research value. However, the phenotypic patterns of this taxon are complex and diverse, and the phenotypic variation in key traits is still unclear. In this study, a total of 212 samples from 18 populations of sect. Tuberculate plants were studied for 30 phenotypic traits of flowers, fruits, and leaves using analysis of variance, correlation analysis, principal component analysis, and cluster analysis. The results showed the following. (1) The plants in sect. Tuberculate were rich in phenotypic trait variation and possessed rich phenotypic diversity. The differentiation of phenotypic traits mainly came from among populations, with leaves (66.804%) being the largest and flowers (53.476%) being the smallest. Qualitative traits (70.264%) were greater than quantitative traits (57.608%). (2) Correlation analyses showed close and complex relationships among the phenotypic traits of flowers, fruits, and leaves. (3) The cumulative contribution of the first 10 principal components was up to 73.49%, which screened out 12 major traits contributing to the phenotypic differences in plants of sect. Tuberculate. (4) Q-type analysis showed that they were classified into 18 taxa at a Euclidean distance of 7.5 and 11 taxa at a Euclidean distance of 10. The 18 populations were not fully clustered according to the geographic distance of the plants, and there was an overlap between some of the populations. In summary, the degree of variation in phenotypic traits among populations of sect. Tuberculate plants is high, which is affected by the climatic environment. The 12 major phenotypic traits screened can be used as the basis for the classification of sect. Tuberculate plants. There are trait overlaps among some populations, which may be affected by the stochastic influence of the geographic climate and gene flow. This study will provide important references for interspecific identification, classification system construction, genetic mechanism, germplasm resource conservation, and exploitation of plants in sect. Tuberculate.

AB  - The aim of this study was to explore the effects of dietary bile acids (BAs) supplementation on herbivorous diet adaptation in allodiploid hybrid fish derived from blunt snout bream (female) x topmouth culter (male). Three experimental diets were formulated: a commercial basal diet (CG group), a basal diet supplement with duckweed (H group), and a basal diet supplemented with duckweed and 600 mg kg(-1) BA (T group). After 56 days of feeding, the growth parameters increased, and greater intestinal cellulase activity was detected in the T group. Moreover, the T group fish presented a longer and denser small intestinal villi. In general, the characteristics of the H group were intermediate between those of the other two groups (T > H > CG). Compared with CG group fish, 711 specific differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified in the intestine of T group fish. The upregulated DEGs were primarily enriched in MAPK signaling pathway, protein digestion and absorption, and mTOR signaling pathway; the downregulated DEGs were predominantly enriched in steroid hormone biosynthesis, fatty acid metabolism and primary bile acid biosynthesis. Besides, several upregulated genes, such as jak, irs, egfr, prss, and cpa which related to cell proliferation and differentiation, digestion, and metabolism, are associated with the changes in intestinal histomorphology. These changes could promote the intestinal adaptation of an herbivorous diet. The metagenome sequencing results revealed that exogenous BAs significantly changed the structure of the gut microbiota; decreased the abundance of potentially pathogenic bacteria or fungi such as Proteobacteria, Mucoromycota, and Pseudomonas; and increased the abundance of probiotics such as the cellulose-producing bacteria Micromonospora. In addition, functional analysis revealed that the abundance of some enzyme families related to cellulose degradation was significantly greater in the T group. These findings suggested that exogenous BAs influences host intestinal gene expression and the structure of the gut microbiota via the gut microbiota-bile acid pathway, which in turn contributes to herbivorous diet adaptation in juvenile allodiploid hybrid fish.

AB  - The high value use of agricultural and livestock waste resources in the context of a low carbon economy is a challenge that currently plagues many countries. Yak dung, as a waste resource from livestock farming in the plateau, is considered to be a misplaced treasure. In this work, yak dung was processed into yak dung fiber (YDF) and yak dung ash (YDA), respectively, and the microscopic morphology of the YDF and YDA was assessed using scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The elements in the YDA were analyzed by energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX). Moreover, cementitious composites were prepared with YDF at 0%, 0.3%, 0.5% and 0.7% and by replacing cement with YDA at 5%, 10% and 15% to assess the workability, mechanical properties and shrinkage properties of cementitious composites containing different YDF types (alkali treated and untreated), contents and different YDA contents. The results showed that alkali-treated YDF and YDA contain a large number of honeycomb structure pores, and the strength of cementitious materials with alkali-treated YDF was higher. The addition of YDF had a negative effect on the fluidity and compressive strength of the cementitious material, but the 0.3% YDF was beneficial in increasing its flexural strength. The compressive strength and flexural strength first increased and then decreased with the increase of YDA content. Both YDF and YDA inhibited the shrinkage of the cement paste, and the shrinkage strain of the cement matrix composites containing 0.3% YDF and 10% YDA was reduced by 51.1% compared to the control group. This work is expected to promote the application of yak dung waste in cementitious materials.

AB  - Advances in next-generation sequencing have allowed the use of DNA obtained from unusual sources for wildlife studies. However, these samples have been used predominantly to sequence mitochondrial DNA for species identification while population genetics analyses have been rare. Since next-generation sequencing allows indiscriminate detection of all DNA fragments in a sample, technically it should be possible to sequence whole genomes of animals from environmental samples. Here we used a blood-feeding insect, tsetse fly, to target whole genome sequences of wild animals. Using pools of flies, we compared the ability to recover genomic data from hosts using the short-read sequencing (Illumina) and adaptive sampling of long-read data generated using Oxford nanopore technology (ONT). We found that most of the short-read data (85%-99%) was dominated by tsetse fly DNA and that adaptive sampling on the ONT platform did not substantially reduce this proportion. However, once tsetse reads were removed, the remaining data for both platforms tended to belong to the dominant host expected in the tsetse fly blood meal. Reads mapping to elephants, warthogs and giraffes were recovered more reliably than for buffalo, and there was high variance in the contribution of DNA by individual flies to the pools, suggesting that there are host specific biases. For elephants, using short-read sequencing we were able to identify over 300,000 unfiltered SNPs, which we used to estimate the allele frequencies and expected heterozygosity for the population. Overall, our results show that at least for certain wild mammals, it is possible to recover genome-wide host data from blood-feeding insects.

TI  - Harmonising control: understanding the complex impact of pesticides on parasitoid wasps for enhanced pest management
T2  - CURRENT OPINION IN INSECT SCIENCE
LA  - English
KW  - INSECTICIDES
AB  - The pervasive application of chemical pesticides is globally recognised for its effectiveness and cost-efficiency in controlling pest populations. However, this approach has inadvertently impacted a diverse array of organisms, including humans and beneficial insects, notably those that naturally regulate pest populations. This review synthesises current research on both the direct and indirect effects of pesticides on parasitoid wasps. These wasps are vital for the biological control of herbivorous insect populations through a top-down approach. Here, we examine the complex ways in which pesticides may compromise the parasitoids' life history traits, interfere with their host-seeking behaviour, and modulate the immune responses of the hosts that in turn affect parasitoid success. Gaining a more nuanced understanding of these dynamics is crucial for the development of integrated pest management strategies that aim to reconcile the use of chemical pesticides with biological control approaches, ultimately fostering more sustainable agricultural practices.

AB  - The northern coast of the San Jorge Gulf, Atlantic Patagonia, is recognised as a marine biodiversity hot spot and is designated as a priority conservation area. Among marine mammals, three species of pinnipeds inhabit the region. While South American sea lions (Otaria flavescens) have a higher abundance and a larger number of colonies than South American fur seals (Arctocephalus australis), a few individuals of the Southern elephant seal (Mirounga leonina) reside in the region. Nevertheless, little is known about the abundance and distribution of these pinnipeds before the 18th century, when various extractive activities became widespread, including the unregulated exploitation of furs and oil. This study aims to examine whether the distribution and relative abundance of ancient pinnipeds differ from present-day populations. To achieve this, we conducted inter-specific identification of pinniped bone remains coming from archaeological assemblages dated from 6000 to 600 14C years BP and reviewed historical sources to contrast these retrospective data with modern ecological literature. The results suggest changes over time in the relative abundances of species within the pinniped community. The relative abundance of fur seals was greater than or equal to that of sea lions in most Late-Holocene pinniped assemblages. Additionally, fur seals have been recorded in historical and Late-Holocene periods in places where they are currently very rare. These findings are consistent with the higher relative abundance of fur seals recorded in other archaeological sites along the Patagonian coast, suggesting that modern distribution and abundance have been heavily affected by commercial hunting. This study contributes to a better understanding of the nature and magnitude of the anthropic impact on the marine ecosystem of the northern coast of the San Jorge Gulf. It also provides historical baseline information to strengthen conservation policies and restoration efforts.

AB  - Small ruminant farming is the main rural occupation in mountain areas of Morocco. This activity is subject to numerous pressures, including repeated climatic hazards that modify pastoral resource availability and trigger changes in production systems. This study aimed to identify and analyse changes in availability and utilisation of pastoral resources acknowledged by farmers over the past 40 years for the small ruminant farming systems of the Central High Atlas region of Morocco. We hypothesised, on the basis of previous research, that resilience of the pastoral component of such systems increases with elevation. We interviewed 50 farmers in three municipalities of Azilal province, at moderate (800-1400 m), medium (1400-1800 m) and high (1800-3000 m) elevations. In the 1970-1980s, pastoral resources were abundant and mobile flocks grazed collective rangelands. Subsequently, repeated droughts and the increased stock numbers promoted by agricultural policies led to the deterioration of resource abundance and quality, especially palatable plants. At moderate elevations, wooded areas and phytomass declined; erosion occurred at high elevations. Traditional systems diversified by including agricultural activities. At moderate elevations, livestock farming intensified, with the adoption of a productive breed, concentrate distribution and the grazing of fallow land. Currently, flock mobility is limited and rangelands provide less than 60% of sheep requirements. At high elevations, the pastoral component persisted at the cost of a diversification of pastoral areas and greater flock mobility. Rangelands are still collectively managed and provide almost 90% of sheep requirements. Since rangelands remain a major feed source, changes in pastoral resources can be considered as a major driver of change in livestock systems. The sustainability of small ruminant farming systems at these elevations thus depends on the conservation of rangeland.

AB  - Multiuse marine protected areas (MPAs) that utilize a mosaic of no-take and sustainable use zones are an increasingly common tool for promoting fish population recovery while minimizing socioeconomic conflict. However, significant gaps remain in our understanding of the effects of multiuse MPAs on reef-fish populations, and how protection from fishing may interact with biophysical gradients to drive ecological outcomes. Here, we examine changes in fish assemblages inside and outside of two multiuse MPAs in Raja Ampat, Indonesia, over the first four to five years after their implementation. We use linear models to assess the impact of protection status, anthropogenic pressure, and biophysical gradients on changes in four biological metrics: abundance, biomass, mean size, and size-spectra. In addition, we use multivariate analyses to assess whether fish assemblages in protected and unprotected reefs diverged after MPA establishment. We find that both fish abundance and biomass were driven equally or more by benthic characteristics than protection status and that these environmental impacts were decoupled from the effects of MPAs. Contrary to expectations, increases in abundance were more pronounced in unprotected reefs, where fish assemblages diverged from protected reefs through an increase of herbivorous parrotfishes (Subfamily Scarinae) likely driven by increased algal production on hard-bottom reef areas. However, mean size and size-spectra improved in sustainable use zones compared to unprotected reefs, demonstrating that non-exclusionary management can provide ecological benefits, especially when combined with nearby no-take areas. Increased mean size was also associated with lower human population sizes, suggesting a strong influence of fishing pressure, which is mediated by MPAs. Our findings suggest that multiuse MPAs can quickly achieve some fisheries management objectives and that these effects are likely to increase over longer timescales. However, biophysical context can have significant impacts on reef-fish assemblages that are distinct from the effects of overlying fisheries management.

AB  - Plant toxicity shapes the dietary choices of herbivores. Especially when herbivores sequester plant toxins, they may experience a trade-off between gaining protection from natural enemies and avoiding toxicity. The availability of toxins for sequestration may additionally trade off with the nutritional quality of a potential food source for sequestering herbivores. We hypothesized that diet mixing might allow a sequestering herbivore to balance nutrition and defence (via sequestration of plant toxins). Accordingly, here we address diet mixing and sequestration of large milkweed bugs (Oncopeltus fasciatus) when they have differential access to toxins (cardenolides) in their diet. In the absence of toxins from a preferred food (milkweed seeds), large milkweed bugs fed on nutritionally adequate non-toxic seeds, but supplemented their diet by feeding on nutritionally poor, but cardenolide-rich milkweed leaf and stem tissues. This dietary shift corresponded to reduced insect growth but facilitated sequestration of defensive toxins. Plant production of cardenolides was also substantially induced by bug feeding on leaf and stem tissues, perhaps benefitting this cardenolide-resistant herbivore. Thus, sequestration appears to drive diet mixing in this toxic plant generalist, even at the cost of feeding on nutritionally poor plant tissue.

TI  - Horizontally acquired cysteine synthase genes undergo functional divergence in lepidopteran herbivores
T2  - HEREDITY
LA  - English
AB  - Horizontal gene transfer (HGT) plays an important role in evolutionary processes as organisms adapt to their environments, and now cases of gene duplication after HGT in eukaryotes are emerging at an increasing rate. However, the fate and roles of the duplicated genes over time in eukaryotes remain unclear. Here we conducted a comprehensive analysis of the evolution of cysteine synthase (CYS) in lepidopteran insects. Our results indicate that HGT-derived CYS genes are widespread and have undergone duplication following horizontal transfer in many lepidopteran insects. Moreover, lepidopteran CYS proteins not only have beta-cyanoalanine synthase activity but also possess cysteine synthase activity that is involved in sulfur amino acid biosynthesis. Duplicated CYS genes show marked divergence in gene expression patterns and enzymatic properties, suggesting that they probably have undergone subfunctionalization and/or neofunctionalization in Lepidoptera. The gene transfer of CYS genes and subsequent duplication appears to have facilitated the adaptation of lepidopteran insects to different diets and promoted their ecological diversification. Overall, this study provides valuable insights into the ecological and evolutionary contributions of CYS in lepidopteran insects.

AB  - The painted lady butterfly (Vanessa cardui) is a generalist herbivore with a global distribution. In North America, over 100 species have been identified as V. cardui larval host plants. This cosmopolitan species is commercially available in all life stages and can be reared on an artificial diet. As a result, V. cardui commonly serves as a model organism for education and outreach. However, gaps in our knowledge remain with regard to V. cardui ecology and larval host plant suitability for supporting complete development of larvae to reproductive adulthood. In a laboratory setting, we tested host plant suitability of five reported host plants commonly found in California sage scrub ecosystems by assessing survival of V. cardui caterpillars in its entirety. We also assessed how commercially sourced larvae survived on artificial diet: both raising the caterpillars exclusively on artificial diet as well as switching diets from artificial to thistle (a commonly reported host plant) and switching from thistle to artificial diet. We found that all commercially sourced caterpillars exhibited both high larval mortality and low pupation rates when reared on host plants, although larvae reared on Malacothamnus fasciculatus and Sphaeralcea ambigua survived longest. Moreover, M. fasciculatus and S. ambigua were the only host plants tested that supported successful pupation. This contrasted with 63% higher survival of wild-collected larvae. Our findings suggest that commercially obtained V. cardui may struggle to utilize wild host plants and that future investigations into host plant suitability in wild populations are needed. Additionally, future research using commercial larvae should consider the implications for interpreting host plant suitability as larvae may exhibit adaptations to artificial diet or the loss of adaptation to consuming plant material.

AB  - This study pursued to regulate bacterial community succession pattern and expedited biodegradation of microplastics (MP) during pig manure (PM) composting employing walnut shell biochar (WSB) and montmorillonite (M). The WSB with concentration of 0%, 2.5%, 5%, 7.5%, 10% and 12% along with 10% M participated into PM for 42 days compost to search the optimal solution. The results confirmed the most prosperous bacterial phylum consisted of Firmicutes (3.02%-91.80%), Proteobacteria (2.08%-48.54%), Chloroflexi (0-44.62%) and Bacteroidetes (0.85%-40.93%). The addition of biochar has dramatically arranged bacterial community at different stages of composting. Energy Dispersive Spectrometer (EDS) revealed that carbon element in MPs decreased since the chemical bond fracture, under the intervention of high-temperature composting and WSB, the carbon content of MPs was maximum reduced by 20.25%. Fourier transform infrared spectrum indicated that C--C, C-O, C-H and -COOH abundance of MPs in 10% and 12% dose biochar addition sharply reduced, interestingly, explicating WSB and composting made MP biodegradable. This experiment possesses affirmatory practical meaning for elimination of potential hazards by composting.

AB  - Artificial light at night (ALAN) can influence plant growth, defence, interactions with herbivores and invasion by exotic plants. However, studies assessing the interactive effects of ALAN, nutrient enrichment and herbivory on invasive and native plant species remain limited. We conducted a greenhouse experiment to investigate the interactive effects of ALAN (no-ALAN versus ALAN), nutrient enrichment (low versus high) and herbivory by a generalist Spodoptera litura (without versus with) on the growth, root allocation and defence of six congeneric pairs of invasive and native plant species. Nutrient enrichment increased total biomass more in native plants than in invasive plants. ALAN enhanced total biomass in both groups of plants without herbivory, but increased native plant biomass and decreased that of invasive plants under herbivory. ALAN reduced root mass fraction, especially under low-nutrient conditions without herbivory. Native plants exhibited greater tolerance to herbivory and higher net photosynthetic rates under ALAN compared to invasive species. Moreover, S. litura larvae grew faster on invasive plants but slower on native plants under ALAN. These findings suggest that ALAN may weaken the competitive advantage of invasive species by enhancing the defence mechanisms and physiological performance of native plants, potentially shifting competitive dynamics in favour of native flora.

AB  - Seahorses Hippocampus spp. are commercially and culturally important to many communities. Although seahorses are widely used in traditional medicine, as curios and as aquarium fishes in Southeast Asia, documentation on the current nature and extent of culturally motivated seahorse uses in Malaysia is lacking. To examine how ethnicity and other socio-demographic drivers shape traditional medicinal use and underlying cultural beliefs involving seahorses, we administered a questionnaire-based survey during March 2021-April 2022 to members of the general public and fishers in Malaysia. Approximately one-fifth (21.0%) of respondents reported consuming seahorses (34.4% of these used seahorses for medicinal purposes, 55.2% for other non-medicinal uses and 10.4% for both types). Consumers of seahorses were from all ethnic groups except for Indigenous groups. In the general public group, medicinal use was more common amongst the Chinese respondents, whereas in the fisher group, other uses were more common amongst the Malay respondents. Amongst the threats facing seahorses, which include overfishing, habitat destruction, bycatch and ocean plastic pollution, only bycatch was perceived as a major threat by most of the general public and fisher respondents. The relatively low prevalence of reported seahorse use amongst Malaysians is an encouraging finding from a conservation perspective. However, the high proportion of non-medicinal uses indicates the need to focus on such other uses to ensure the sustainability of seahorse use in Malaysia.

AB  - Systemic manipulations that enhance dopamine (DA) transmission around the time of fear extinction can strengthen fear extinction and reduce conditioned fear relapse. Prior studies investigating the brain regions where DA augments fear extinction focus on targets of mesolimbic and mesocortical DA systems originating in the ventral tegmental area, given the role of these DA neurons in prediction error. The dorsal striatum (DS), a primary target of the nigrostriatal DA system originating in the substantia nigra (SN), is implicated in behaviors beyond its canonical role in movement, such as reward and punishment, goal -directed action, and stimulus -response associations, but whether DS DA contributes to fear extinction is unknown. We have observed that chemogenetic stimulation of SN DA neurons during fear extinction prevents the return of fear in contexts different from the extinction context, a form of relapse called renewal. This effect of SN DA stimulation is mimicked by a DA D1 receptor (D1R) agonist injected into the DS, thus implicating DS DA in fear extinction. Different DS subregions subserve unique functions of the DS, but it is unclear where in the DS D1R agonist acts during fear extinction to reduce renewal. Furthermore, although fear extinction increases neural activity in DS subregions, whether neural activity in DS subregions is causally involved in fear extinction is unknown. To explore the role of DS subregions in fear extinction, adult, male Long -Evans rats received microinjections of either the D1R agonist SKF38393 or a cocktail consisting of GABA A /GABA B receptor agonists muscimol/baclofen selectively into either dorsomedial (DMS) or dorsolateral (DLS) DS subregions immediately prior to fear extinction, and extinction retention and renewal were subsequently assessed drug -free. While increasing D1R signaling in the DMS during fear extinction did not impact fear extinction retention or renewal, DMS inactivation reduced later renewal. In contrast, DLS inactivation had no effect on fear extinction retention or renewal but increasing D1R signaling in the DLS during extinction reduced fear renewal. These data suggest that DMS and DLS activity during fear extinction can have opposing effects on later fear renewal, with the DMS promoting renewal and the DLS opposing renewal. Mechanisms through which the DS could influence the contextual gating of fear extinction are discussed.

AB  - Quinoa (Chenopodium quinoa) agriculture has been a cornerstone of highland Andean diets for thousands of years, but it has received relatively little attention from archaeologists studying diet through stable isotope analysis. In this study, we present the largest sample published to date (n = 49) of archaeological carbon (delta C-13) and nitrogen (delta N-15) stable isotope ratios in quinoa, as well as single samples of cactus (Opuntia spp.), wild bean (Trifolium amabile), and potato (Solanum tuberosum) from a Late Intermediate Period (cal ad 1250-1450) hillfort town in the western Lake Titicaca basin. Quinoa delta N-15 averages + 8.83 parts per thousand +/- 2.17, indicating that agricultural fields at this site were fertilized with camelid manure, but values were significantly higher in samples recovered from high-status compounds than low-status ones. This suggests that high-status groups within the community had larger camelid herds and/or older fields that had been improved with fertilizer for longer periods of time, possibly allowing their plants to be more productive than those of lower-status groups. Mean quinoa delta C-13 was - 23.95 parts per thousand +/- 0.72, which indicates that plants were not significantly more water-stressed than modern or historic comparative samples grown with similar methods. This concurs with paleoclimate data suggesting that the environment surrounding this settlement was in a period of drought recovery during the occupation. Alternatively, fertilizer may have allowed plants to combat the effects of drought without recycling sub-stomatal CO2. This study is an important contribution to research on foodways in the ancient Andes and non-cereal grain-dependent societies more broadly.

AB  - The application of organic fertilizers caused large amounts of dissolved organic matter (DOM) entering the soil environment and influencing the behaviors and fates of heavy metals. Here, we investigated the molecular weight-dependent (high molecular weight [HMW], 1 kDa-0.7 mu m; low molecular weight [LMW], <1 kDa) compositions and lead (Pb) binding behaviors of DOM derived from sheep manure-based (SMOF) and shrimp peptide-based organic fertilizers (SPOF) using chromophoric and fluorescent spectroscopy, Fourier-transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry (FT-ICR-MS) and two-dimensional correlation spectroscopy (2D-COS). Results showed that SMOF released more DOM with higher aromaticity and hydrophobicity, containing more fluvic-like components, carboxylic-rich alicyclic molecules (CRAMs) and lignin phenolic compounds compared to SPOF-DOM with more microbially-transformed heteroatom-containing compounds (CHON, CHONS and CHOS). Furthermore, there was more aromatic compounds with ample carboxyl and hydroxyl groups in HMW-DOM but abundant protein-like components and heteroatom-containing compounds (CHONS and CHOS) in LMW-DOM. SMOF-DOM exhibited more obvious MW-dependent heterogeneity in molecular components compared to SPOF-DOM with higher molecular diversity. Moreover, 2D-COS indicated phenol and carboxyl groups in SMOF-DOM and polysaccharides in SPOF-DOM exhibited superior binding affinities for Pb. Pb binding to HMW-DOM derived from SMOF first occurred in the phenolic groups in fulvic-like substances, while polysaccharides in LMW-DOM first participated in the binding of Pb. In contrast, irrespective of MWs, polysaccharides and humic-like substances with aromatic (C--C) groups in SPOF-DOM displayed a faster response to Pb. Furthermore, the polysaccharides which preferentially participated in the binding of Pb to SPOF-DOM and SMOF-derived LMW-DOM may pose a higher risk of Pb in the environment. These results were helpful to understand the effects of sources and size-dependent compositions of DOM on the associated risks of heavy metals in the environments.

AB  - The question of whether food webs are resource or predation controlled is crucial for the development of sustainable IPM strategies in agriculture. Many IPM studies focus on top-down control, while little is known about bottom-up effects. Here, we unravelled the bottom-up interactions between rosy apple aphid (RAA) Dysaphis plantaginea and 13 apple cultivars in north-eastern Belgium. Population dynamics, apple leaf damage, preference and performance measurements were used to determine the interactions between RAA and apple cultivars. Seasonal abundances and RAA-infested shoots were significantly affected by the cultivar. The cultivars Fuji, Granny Smith, Jonagold and Cripps Pink harboured clearly higher numbers of aphids compared to other cultivars, especially Red Delicious. Regarding leaf damage degree, Fuji was significantly the most impacted, while the lowest damage was recorded on Red Delicious. The potential apparent competition among apple cultivars was evaluated using RAA overlap diagrams. By acting as a potential source of RAA, a particular cultivar can considerably affect other nearby cultivars. In host selection bioassays, significant differences in the choice behaviour of RAA were found in the laboratory for different apple cultivars. Other important findings from the reproduction-offspring performance bioassays revealed that while Fuji stimulated high production of nymphs, their development remained retarded on Fuji, compared to especially Boskoop on which significantly lower numbers of nymphs occurred. Our study provides a promising insight into the importance of studying apple-RAA interactions within an eco-friendly RAA management tactic.

AB  - Many species have not tracked their thermal niches upslope as predicted by climate change, potentially because higher elevations are associated with abiotic challenges beyond temperature. To better predict whether organisms can continue to move upslope with rising temperatures, we need to understand their physiological performance when subjected to novel high-elevation conditions. Here, we captured Anna's hummingbirds - a species expanding their elevational distribution in concordance with rising temperatures - from across their current elevational distribution and tested their physiological response to novel abiotic conditions. First, at a central aviary within their current elevational range, we measured hovering metabolic rate to assess their response to oxygen conditions and torpor use to assess their response to thermal conditions. Second, we transported the hummingbirds to a location 1200 m above their current elevational range limit to test for an acute response to novel oxygen and thermal conditions. Hummingbirds exhibited lower hovering metabolic rates above their current elevational range limit, suggesting lower oxygen availability may reduce performance after an acute exposure. Alternatively, hummingbirds showed a facultative response to thermal conditions by using torpor more frequently and for longer. Finally, post-experimental dissection found that hummingbirds originating from higher elevations within their range had larger hearts, a potential plastic response to hypoxic environments. Overall, our results suggest lower oxygen availability and low air pressure may be difficult challenges to overcome for hummingbirds shifting upslope as a consequence of rising temperatures, especially if there is little to no long-term acclimatization. Future studies should investigate how chronic exposure and acclimatization to novel conditions, as opposed to acute experiments, may result in alternative outcomes that help organisms better respond to abiotic challenges associated with climate-induced range shifts.

AB  - Conflict caused by wild herbivores damaging crops is an almost universal problem in conservation. We designed and implemented a game-theory-based system for supporting farmers whose crops were being heavily damaged by wild herbivores. In this community-operated system, farmers self-report their production, which is endorsed by neighboring farmers. The average deficit in production is compensated for by a payment that is directly proportional to the average deficit in production of the group and to the individual farmer's productivity. As a result, farmers are compensated for the average damage (support) and rewarded for individual productivity (reward) (i.e., support cum reward [SuR]). The design of the game is such that only honest reporting gives maximum returns. Farmers who underreport receive less payment because the SuR amount is proportionate to their self-reported productivity. The endorsing farmers, in their own self-interest, prevent overreporting. The system involves multiple game situations, the combined result of which is a stable strategy based on honesty and hard work. In 2 villages along the western boundary of Tadoba Andhari Tiger Reserve in central India, we tested the system with 75 farmers over 6 crop seasons. After a few initial attempts to cheat, honesty prevailed throughout the group. Average crop productivity increased 2.5-fold, in spite of damage, owing to increased effort by farmers. Apart from wildlife conflict resolution, the model offers a promising alternative to crop insurance and a potential behavioral green revolution in agriculture.

AB  - Seeds produce a myriad of specialized metabolites (SMs) with an essential role in the interaction of plants with the environment. We characterized SM landscapes, primary metabolites and lipid composition in the seeds of camelina genotypes grown in the open field in five consecutive growing seasons. Our results showed the predominant effect of the environment on the regulation of the seed SM, with a potential impact on seed quality of camelina that may also occur in other oilseed crops.

AB  - Context. Melatonin influences female reproduction, but expression of the melatonin system has not been characterised in the ovine uterus. Aims. We aimed to determine whether synthesising enzymes (arylalkylamine N-acetyltransferase (AANAT) and N-acetylserotonin-O-methyltransferase (ASMT)), melatonin receptors 1 and 2 (MT1 and MT2), and catabolising enzymes (myeloperoxidase (MPO) and indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase 1 and 2 (IDO1 and 2)), are expressed in the ovine uterus, and if they are influenced by the oestrous cycle (Experiment 1) or by undernutrition (Experiment 2). Methods. In Experiment 1, gene and protein expression was determined in sheep endometrium samples collected on days 0 (oestrus), 5, 10 and 14 of the oestrous cycle. In Experiment 2, we studied uterine samples from ewes fed either 1.5 or 0.5 times their maintenance requirements. Key results. We have demonstrated the expression of AANAT and ASMT in the endometrium of sheep. AANAT and ASMT transcripts, and AANAT protein were more elevated at day 10, then decreased to day 14. A similar pattern was observed for MT2, IDO1, and MPO mRNA, which suggests that the endometrial melatonin system might be influenced by ovarian steroid hormones. Undernutrition increased AANAT mRNA expression, but seemed to decrease its protein expression, and increased MT2 and IDO2 transcripts, whereas ASMT expression was unaffected. Conclusions. The melatonin system is expressed in the ovine uterus and is affected by oestrous cycle and undernutrition. Implications. The results help explain the adverse effects of undernutrition on reproduction in sheep, and the success of exogenous melatonin treatments in improving reproductive outcomes.

AB  - Aegilops tauschii is a wild diploid goat-grass which occupies a vast range in Central Eurasia and comprises three different gene-pools: TauL1, TauL2, and TauL3. Multivariate statistical analysis of the transcriptomes from the leaf tissue of 40 A.tauschii accessions, 18 of TauL1, 20 of TauL2, and 2 of TauL3, revealed that the gene-pools of A. tauschii distinctly and essentially differ in their genetic expression patterns. Statistically significant differential gene ex-pression of 2349, 376, and 272 were observed between TauL1 and TauL2; TauL1 and TauL3; TauL2 and TauL3, respectively. These findings indicate substantial adaptive intraspecies divergence in A. tauschii

AB  - Kangaroo rats communicate with nearby conspecifics and predators using low-frequency ground vibrations via footdrumming. When exposed to audio playbacks of low-frequency substrate-borne noise from vehicles, kangaroo rats respond with footdrumming, suggesting that vehicle ground vibrations are perceived as predators or as other kangaroo rats. However, this has yet to be tested on the giant kangaroo rat (Dipodomys ingens). The goal of our research was to determine whether D. ingens responded to vehicle ground vibrations through footdrumming. From 2018 to 2021, we used geophones to record the response of individuals in burrows as vehicles drove by on adjacent roadways (<50 m). In addition, as a comparison, we tested the behavioral response of individuals to predators in burrows near (<50 m) and far (>200 m) from roadways. This was accomplished by mimicking a predator scratching into a burrow and recording the response. Kangaroo rats responded very little to our traffic and predator treatments (only 7 out of 177 responded by footdrumming). We also found no significant difference between road traffic and predator treatments. There are several possible reasons for the lack of response, including season, time of day, roadway type, and activity. We believe that there is still a need to continue investigating kangaroo rat footdrumming responses to noise by exploring the effects of daytime, traffic frequency, and road surfaces.

AB  - Punjab is the leading province of Pakistan in the production of bovine milk and its consumption. Rapid industrialization, high energy demand, and the production of waste have increased the risk of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) toxicity in the environment. This research work was designed to assess human dietary exposure of Sigma PCBs17 congeners through ingestion of buffalo and cow's milk from eight main districts of Punjab, Pakistan. The average concentrations of SDL-PCBs (8.74 ng g(-1) and 14.60 ng g(-1)) and SI-PCBs (11.54 ng g(-1) and 18.68 ng g(-1)) in buffalo and cow milk samples were analyzed, respectively. The PCB-156 was predominantly high congener found in both buffalo (2.84 ng g(-1)) and cow milk (2.86 ng g(-1)). It was found that the highest PCBs in bovine milk samples were observed in close vicinities of urban and industrial areas. The estimated daily consumptions of DL-PCBs and I-PCBs, from buffalo and cow milk, were below the acceptable daily intake for both adults and children. Moreover, hazard quotients (HQ) of the Sigma PCBs17 congener value were less than 1.0 in adults and greater in the case of children reflecting the high chances of cancer. Furthermore, comprehensive monitoring for childhood cancer is recommended to establish the relationship in future studies.

AB  - Simple Summary Goats have always served as an important domesticated livestock. PLAG1 is a major gene that affects the stature and growth of animals. Body size traits are very important for goats as it directly affects the economic characteristics of meat and cashmere production. This study showed that the 15-base pair (bp) InDel (rs637141549) can significantly affect growth traits such as body weight, height, height at hip cross, chest circumference, hip width and body index of goats through the detection of large samples (n = 1581) in four indigenous breeds. Accordingly, it is suggested that the deletion mutation can be used as a potential molecular marker that significantly affects goat growth traits. Moreover, the 15bp deletion mutation can be used as a potential molecular marker, which significantly affects the growth traits of goats and plays an important role in animal husbandry production. Stature and weight are important growth and development traits for animals, which also significantly affect the productivity of livestock. Polymorphic adenoma gene 1 (PLAG1) is located in the growth-related quantitative trait nucleotides (QTN), and its variation has been determined to significantly affect the body stature of bovines. This study found that novel 15-bp InDel could significantly influence important growth traits in goats. The frequencies of genotypes of the 15-bp mutation and relationship with core growth traits such as body weight, body height, height at hip cross, chest circumference, hip width and body index were explored in 1581 individuals among 4 Chinese native goat breeds. The most frequent genotypes of Shaanbei white Cashmere goat (SWCG), Inner Mongolia White Cashmere goat (IMCG) and Guanzhong Dairy goat (GZDG) were II genotypes (insertion/insertion), and the frequency of ID genotype (insertion/deletion) was found to be slightly higher than that of II genotype in Hainan Black goat (HNBG), showing that the frequency of the I allele was higher than that of the D allele. In adult goats, there were significant differences between 15-bp variation and body weight, chest circumference and body height traits in SWCG (p < 0.05). Furthermore, the locus was also found to be significantly correlated with the body index of HNBG (p = 0.044) and hip width in GZDG (p = 0.002). In regard to lambs, there were significant differences in height at the hip cross of SWCG (p = 0.036) and hip width in IMWC (p = 0.005). The corresponding results suggest that the 15-bp InDel mutation of PLAG1 is associated with the regulation of important growth characteristics of both adult and lamb of goats, which may serve as efficient molecular markers for goat breeding.

AB  - Dhurrin is a cyanogenic glucoside found in all vegetative tissues of Sorghum bicolor, functioning as a herbivore repellent, antifungal agent, osmoprotectant, and nitrogen (N) storage. Dhurrin concentration is usually highest in young seedlings, where it rapidly accumulates following germination, after which its biosynthesis decreases and its turnover increases as the seedling ages. To avoid prussic acid poisoning from dhurrin catabolism in cattle grazing or foraging on sorghum, numerous research studies now focus on breeding for dhurrin-free or acyanogenic sorghum using EMS (Ethyl methanesulfonate) mutants with a non-functional dhurrin biosynthetic pathway. However, there has been limited and conflicting research investigating the role dhurrin plays as a potential nitrogen source in sorghum's early seedling growth, especially under N deficiency. It is plausible that the presence of background mutations in dhurrin-free sorghum mutants could mask or confound how the absence of dhurrin affects early seedling growth. Using a naturally occurring (non-mutant) ultra-low dhurrin genotype and known low and high dhurrin genotypes, the current research investigated the importance of dhurrin as a potential endogenous nitrogen source for early seedling growth in simulated non-marginal (N-available) and marginal (N-deficient) media. Dhurrin was implicated to be an N source for seedling growth from 8 to 13 days after planting under deficient N conditions. In N-deficient media at 13 days after planting, high-dhurrin-level genotypes accumulated more seedling fresh shoot biomass than low-dhurrin-level genotypes. Thus, while acyanogenic sorghum will be beneficial in expanding sorghum's economic value, the use of dhurrin knock-out mutants can prove problematic since the complete lack of dhurrin may affect field germination and stand establishment, particularly under N-deficient or low-N-input conditions.

AB  - The Massese is an autochthonous Italian sheep breed, used for meat and mainly milk production and thermo-regulatory variations can directly affect the performance of these animals. We evaluated the thermoregulatory patterns of Massese ewes and identified the changes due to environmental variations. Data was collected from 159 healthy ewes from herds of four farms/institutions. For thermal environmental characterization, air tem-perature (AT), relative humidity (RH) and wind speed were measured, and Black Globe Temperature, Humidity Index (BGHI) and Radiant Heat Load (RHL) were calculated. The thermoregulatory responses evaluated were: respiratory (RR), heart rate (HR), rectal temperature (RT) and coat surface temperature (ST). All variables were subjected to analysis of variance with repeated measures over time. A factor analysis was conducted to determine the relationship between environmental and thermoregulatory variables. Multiple regression analyses were also examined using General Linear Models, and Variance Inflation Factors were calculated. Logistic and Broken line non-linear regressions for RR, HR and RT were analyzed. The RR and HR values were outside reference values and associated with normal values of RT. In the factor analysis, most environmental variables were seen to affect the thermoregulation pattern of the ewes, except for RH. In the logistic regression analysis, RT was not affected by any of the variables studied, maybe because BGHI and RHL were not sufficiently high enough. Nevertheless, BGHI and RHL affected RR and HR. The study shows a divergence for Massese ewes from reference thermo-regulatory values for sheep.

AB  - This study assessed the influence of the additions of lignocellulose-degrading microbial agents and biochar on nitrogen (N) metabolism and microbial community succession during pig manure composting. Four treatments were established: CK (without additives), M (lignocellulose-degrading microbial agents), BC (biochar), and MBC (lignocellulose-degrading microbial agents and biochar). The results revealed that all treatments with additives decreased N loss compared with CK. In particular, the concentrations of total N and NO3-N were the highest in M, which were 21.87% and 188.67% higher than CK, respectively. Meanwhile, the abundance of denitrifying bacteria Flavobacterium, Enterobacter, and Devosia reduced with additives. The roles of Anseongella (nitrifying bacterium) and Nitrosomonas (ammonia-oxidizing bacterium) in NO3-N transformation were enhanced in M and BC, respectively. N metabolism pathway prediction indicated that lignocellulose-degrading microbial agents addition could enhance N retention effectively mainly by inhibiting denitrification. The addition of biochar enhanced oxidation of NH4+-N to NO2-N and N fixation, as well as inhibited denitrification. These results revealed that the addition of lignocellulose-degrading microbial agents individually was more conducive to improve N retention in pig manure compost.

AB  - Faunal remains from fossil arctic ground squirrel (Urocitellus parryii) middens provide insight into the composition of small mammal communities during the late Pleistocene of Yukon Territory. We evaluated skeletal remains present in 88 of 249 middens in addition to fecal remains from fourteen sites across the Klondike goldfields. Two temporally distinct populations of U. parryii middens were identified from middens in association with Dawson tephra (similar to 30,000 yr B.P.) and Sheep Creek Klondike tephra (similar to 80,000 yr B.P.) containing the remains of arctic ground squirrels, voles (Microtus sp. M. longicaudus, M. miurus, M. xanthognathus), collared lemmings (Dicrostonyx sp. D. groenlandicus), true lemmings (Lemmus sp.), birds (Indet. Aves), and larger unidentified bones. These remains provide a unique look into the fossorial life histories of U. parryii and other small mammals of eastern Beringia within an established chronological framework. We interpret that the assemblages could represent reoccupation of middens by arvicolines or that arvicolines fell prey to hungry arctic ground squirrels and/or were incorporated into the middens as a result of opportunistic scavenging. The presence of bird bones and indeterminate bones larger than arctic ground squirrels indicates that the scavenging behavior observed in modern arctic ground squirrel populations occurred in ancient populations.

AB  - Shaw's Agave (Agave shawii subsp. shawii) is a rare plant found in only a handful of occurrences within the extreme southwestern corner of the USA in a highly urbanized region. Seedling recruitment of Shaw's Agave in California is visibly low, and viable seed production appears to have been very low in recent years, and has been identified as a primary threat to the persistence of these populations. We performed pollination trials, seed germination studies, and inventoried floral visitors and potential pollinators (including the collection of invertebrates) to determine if pollination and/or germination failure is limiting reproduction. We placed bat detectors and camera traps near blooming agaves, and observed bird and insect visitation to the flowers. Pollination treatments included hand pollination with cross-individual and selfing trials. Our results found a low amount of seed produced per fruit across the pollination trials. Seedling herbivory was also very high (85% and 100%) in the two treatments. The combination of low seed set and high herbivory may help explain the lack of recruitment observed at multiple sites in recent years. No nectar feeding bats utilized the Shaw's agave in our study area. The only significant insect visiting flowers was the honey bee (Apis mellifera), which gathered nectar without touching the anthers. Hummingbird species were also frequent visitors but generally avoided touching the agave anthers. Only the Hooded Oriole (Icterus cucullatus), a migratory bird, appeared to regularly visit flowers for their nectar, while standing on the flowers and brushing against the anthers, potentially providing some pollination but only for plants blooming during the period the oriole is present in the region. Seedling predation was significant, and poses a considerable threat to this population. Further research into seed set and pollination treatments is recommended.

AB  - Plants harbour a great chemodiversity, that is diversity of specialised metabolites (SMs), at different scales. For instance, individuals can produce a large number of SMs, and populations can differ in their metabolite composition. Given the ecological and economic importance of plant chemodiversity, it is important to understand how it arises and is maintained over evolutionary time. For other dimensions of biodiversity, that is species diversity and genetic diversity, quantitative models play an important role in addressing such questions. Here, we provide a synthesis of existing hypotheses and quantitative models, that is mathematical models and computer simulations, for the evolution of plant chemodiversity. We describe each model's ingredients, that is the biological processes that shape chemodiversity, the scales it considers and whether it has been formalized as a quantitative model. Although we identify several quantitative models, not all are dynamic and many influential models have remained verbal. To fill these gaps, we outline our vision for the future of chemodiversity modelling. We identify quantitative models used for genetic variation that may be adapted for chemodiversity, and we present a flexible framework for the creation of individual-based models that address different scales of chemodiversity and combine different ingredients that bring this chemodiversity about.

AB  - Antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) are a new type of environmental pollutant. However, studies have mainly focused on the distribution characteristics of ARGs in the livestock environment, lacking of studies on the composition of ARGs in the intestinal tract of animals and the effect of nutrients on intestinal ARGs and microbial communities. Reducing antimicrobial resistance and maintaining optimal animal health and performance are urgently needed. Methionine is an essential amino acid which plays a critical role in the growth and reproductive performance of animals. In this study, feeding experiment, in vitro fermentation and bacterial culture experiment were performed to explore the influence of methionine on the intestinal resistome of sows. We found that dietary 0.2 % methionine supplementation decreased the total abundance of intestinal ARGs, which was further confirmed by in vitro fecal microbial fermentation of sows. Metagenome binning analysis identified that Escherichia coli was the major ARG host, which carried 60-113 ARGs and 134-286 virulence factors, indicating that Escherichia coli in the pig intestine is not only a core ARG host, but also an important pathogen. In addition, we found that methionine supplementation inhibited the growth of Escherichia coli, indicating that dietary methionine may reduce the resistome risk in sow intestine by inhibiting core ARG hosts such as Escherichia coli. These findings reveal that dietary methionine application plays a critical role in intestinal antibiotic resistance, providing a new idea for preventing and controlling environmental pollution by antibiotic-resistant microbes.

AB  - Mycoplasma ovipneumoniae (M. ovipneumoniae) causes a fatal infection in goats, leading to significant economic losses in the small-ruminant industry worldwide. The present study aimed to characterize the strains of M. ovipneumoniae infecting goats with pneumonia in Anhui Province, China. From November 2021 to January 2023, among 20 flocks, a total of 1320 samples (600 samples of unvaccinated blood, 400 nasal swabs, 200 samples of pleural fluid, and 120 samples of lung tissue) were obtained from goats with typical signs of pneumonia, such as a low growth rate, appetite suppression, increased temperature, discharge from the nose, and a cough. Necropsied goats showed increased pleural fluid, fibrinous pleuropneumonia, and attached localized pleural adhesions. M. ovipneumoniae isolated from the samples were subjected to an indirect hemagglutination test (IHA), PCR amplicon sequencing, phylogenetic analysis, and biochemical identification tests. The overall positivity rate of M. ovipneumoniae was 27.50%. Mycoplasmas were obtained from 80 (20.0%) nasal swabs, 21 (10.5%) pleural fluid samples, and 15 (12.5%) lung samples. PCR amplicon (288 bp) sequencing identified eight strains of M. ovipneumoniae. In a phylogenetic tree, the isolated strains were homologous to the standard strain M. ovipneumoniae Y-98 and most similar to M. ovipneumoniae FJ-SM. Local strains of M. ovipneumoniae were isolated from goats in Anhui province. The identified genomic features and population structure will promote further study of M. ovipneumoniae pathogenesis and could form the basis for vaccine and therapy development.

AB  - Stress induces neuroinflammation and disrupts sleep, which together can promote a number of stress-related disorders. Fear memories associated with stress can resurface and reproduce symptoms. Our previous studies have demonstrated sleep outcomes can be modified by stressor controllability following stress and fear memory recall. However, it is unknown how stressor controllability alters neuroinflammatory signaling and its association with sleep following fear memory recall. Mice were implanted with telemetry transmitters and experienced escapable or inescapable footshock and then were re-exposed to the shuttlebox context one week later. Gene expression was assessed with Nanostring (R) panels using RNA extracted from the basolateral amygdala and hippocampus. Freezing and temperature were examined as behavioral measures of fear. Increased sleep after escapable stress was associated with a down-regulation in neuro-inflammatory and neuro-degenerative related genes, while decreased sleep after inescapable stress was associated with an up-regulation in these genes. Behavioral measures of fear were virtually identical. Sleep and neuroimmune responses appear to be integrated during fear conditioning and reproduced by fear memory recall. The established roles of disrupted sleep and neuroinflammation in stress-related disorders indicate that these differences may serve as informative indices of how fear memory can lead to psychopathology.

AB  - Candidia barbata is a primary freshwater fish distributed in the western portion of Taiwan Island, but this species has also been found in southern and eastern Taiwan. Previous studies have documented that human-intervention populations of freshwater fishes exist not only in eastern Taiwan but also widely. To investigate the native population genetic diversity and structure and evaluate the sources of human-intervention populations of C. barbata, the sequences from the mitochondrial DNA cytochrome b gene and d-loop region were analyzed. These results indicated that (1) the native populations were distributed in northern, northwestern, western and southwestern Taiwan; (2) the human-intervention populations originated from multiple sources, including native populations and aquarium stocks; (3) most aquarium stocks originated from the northwestern and western populations; (4) the geological history of Taiwan Island shaped the native distribution range and population genetic structure; (5) the effective size of the populations declined greatly; and (6) the native populations could be assorted into three distinct management significant units (alpha - gamma). Finally, the human-mediated dispersal of freshwater species in Taiwan was more severe than expected and should be evaluated and monitored carefully.

AB  - Milkweed (Asclepias) are a widespread and diverse group of New World plants that produce a toxic latex as a defense against herbivores. Despite this defense, there are many arthropods that that feed upon these plants. Larvae of the monarch butterfly are among these species, and monarchs are currently declining in number. Owing to anthropogenic stressors, many milkweed species are also declining across their range. Here, we measure plant quality in reference to herbivores in terms of moisture and energy content. Other studies have found that higher quality plants confer an advantage of increased growth rate for caterpillars that feed upon them. We show that there is significant variation in moisture and energy content of foliage among nine species of milkweeds in Texas. This information may be of interest to conservation biologists to help monarch butterflies or other species within the community of organisms that rely on milkweed.

AB  - Simple Summary In caprine species, the semen quality of thawed samples still needs to be improved in order for this type of semen to provide an acceptable pregnancy rate when it is used for artificial insemination. It is therefore essential to have an adequate freezing protocol and extender for this species. By adapting freezing protocols that have proven successful in other species, such as pigs, together with the development of an extender that protects the sperm cells from damage caused by the freezing and thawing processes, and taking into account its composition in nutrients and cell-membrane-stabilizing substances, it has been possible, at least in vitro, to achieve high sperm quality in buck semen. In vivo studies of the fertilizing capacity of the semen cryopreserved in this way will be the next step to verify the effectiveness of the extender and semen-freezing protocol described in this work. Artificial insemination (AI) with frozen semen in goats still presents serious difficulties, especially in certain goat breeds, in spite of technological progress. The aim of this work is the in vitro study of seminal extenders adapted from those used on other species to evaluate the response of goat sperm to several homeostatic conditions in order to achieve optimal post-thaw semen quality. Three different extenders based on different activity principles were used: (1) extender according to the methodology proposed for pigs, (2) skimmed-milk-based extender according to the methodology proposed for goats in France, and (3) a new egg-yolk-based extender replacing membrane-protective surfactants with sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) and named by our team as extender "IMIDA". The freezing guidelines were those proposed for the freezing of porcine semen. The results obtained show that the egg-yolk-based extenders have good parameters of sperm motility at thawing, studied objectively using the computer-assisted sperm analysis (CASA) system and also subjectively. In particular, in the sperm resistance test after five hours, the thawed sperm containing SDS in their composition showed an optimal average on every evaluated parameter. The new IMIDA extender provided the highest sperm quality averages, so it could be a good extender to use in cryopreservation of semen in the caprine species.

AB  - The diets of individual animals within populations can differ, but few studies determine whether this is due to fundamental differences in preferences or capacities to eat specific foods, or to external influences such as dominance hierarchies or spatial variation in food availability. The distinction is important because different drivers of dietary specialisation are likely to have different impacts on the way in which animal populations respond to, for example, habitat modification. We used a captive feeding study to investigate the mechanisms driving individual dietary specialisation in a population of wild koalas (Phascolarctos cinereus) in which individuals predominantly ate either Eucalyptus viminalis or Eucalyptus obliqua foliage. All six koalas that primarily ate E. viminalis in the wild avoided eating E. obliqua for more than 1 month in captivity. In contrast, all seven koalas that primarily ate E. obliqua could be maintained exclusively on this species in captivity, although they ate less from individual trees with higher foliar concentrations of unsubstituted B-ring flavanones (UBFs). Our results show that fundamental differences between individual animals allow some to exploit food resources that are less suitable for others. This could reduce competition for food, increase habitat carrying capacity, and is also likely to buffer the population against extinction in the face of habitat modification. The occurrence of fundamental individual specialisation within animal populations could also affect the perceived conservation value of different habitats, translocation or reintroduction success, and population dynamics. It should therefore be further investigated in other mammalian herbivore species.

AB  - Host plant consumption and pathogen infection commonly influence insect traits related to development and immunity, which are ultimately reflected in the behavior and physiology of the insect. Herein, we explored changes in the metabolome of a generalist insect herbivore, Vanessa cardui (Lepidoptera: Nymphalidae), in response to both dietary variation and pathogen infection in order to gain insight into tritrophic interactions for insect metabolism and immunity. Caterpillars were reared on two different host plants, Plantago lanceolata (Plantaginaceae) and Taraxacum officinale (Asteraceae) and subjected to a viral infection by Junonia coenia densovirus (JcDV), along with assays to determine the insect immune response and development. Richness and diversity of plant and caterpillar metabolites were evaluated using a liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry approach and showed that viral infection induced changes to the chemical content of V. cardui hemolymph and frass dependent upon host plant consumption. Overall, the immune response as measured by phenoloxidase (PO) enzymatic activity was higher in individuals feeding on P. lanceolata compared with those feeding on T. officinale. Additionally, infection with JcDV caused suppression of PO activity, which was not host plant dependent. We conclude that viral infection combined with host plant consumption creates a unique chemical environment, particularly within the insect hemolymph. Whether and how these metabolites contribute to defense against viral infection is an open question in chemical ecology.

AB  - Urbanization alters components of natural ecosystems which can affect tick abundance and tick-borne disease prevalence. Likely due to these changes, tick-borne pathogen prevalence has increased in many U.S. urban areas. Despite the growing public health importance of tick-borne diseases, little is known about how they are influenced by urbanization in North America, especially in the central U.S. where several pathogens occur at or near their highest levels of incidence nationally. To determine whether urban development influences tick infection with bacteria and protozoa, we collected ticks at 16 parks across a gradient of urbanization intensity in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, USA and tested them using a variety of PCR assays. Adult ticks tested positive for Rickettsia parkeri, R. amblyommatis, R. rhiphicephali, 'Candidatus R. andeanae', Ehrlichia chaffeensis, E. ewingii, Panola Mountain Ehrlichia, 'Borrelia lonestari', Theileria cervi, Babesia spp. Coco, and Cytauxzoon felis. These results indicate the presence of a high diversity of tick-borne bacteria and protozoa across an expanding urban area in the U.S. Great Plains. Although there appeared to be some risk of encountering tick-borne microorganisms across the entire urbanization gradient, E. chaffeensis, E. ewingii, and T. cervi-infected ticks and microbe diversity decreased with increasing urbanization intensity. We identified a low rate of coinfection between different microorganisms, with coinfected ticks mainly collected from sites in the least-urbanized areas. This study suggests the need for awareness of tick-borne disease risk throughout urban areas in the central U.S., and highlights a need for studies of tick host habitat use and movement in cities.

AB  - Many animals and plants have species-typical annual cycles, but individuals vary in their timing of life-history events. Individual variation in fur replacement (moult) timing is poorly understood in mammals due to the challenge of repeated observations and longitudinal sampling. We examined factors that influence variation in moult duration and timing among elephant seals (Mirounga angustirostris). We quantified the onset and progression of fur loss in 1178 individuals. We found that an exceptionally rapid visible moult (7 days, the shortest of any mammals or birds), and a wide range of moult start dates (spanning 6-10x the event duration) facilitated high asynchrony across individuals (only 20% of individuals in the population moulting at the same time). Some of the variation was due to reproductive state, as reproductively mature females that skipped a breeding season moulted a week earlier than reproductive females. Moreover, individual variation in timing and duration within age-sex categories far outweighed (76-80%) variation among age-sex categories. Individuals arriving at the end of the moult season spent 50% less time on the beach, which allowed them to catch up in their annual cycles and reduce population-level variance during breeding. These findings underscore the importance of individual variation in annual cycles.

AB  - Simple Summary There is currently a global research interest in reducing off-farm input of chemical pesticides and fertilizers by using green alternative practices. Fungi belonging to the genus Trichoderma colonize plant roots and activate systemic plant defenses against the attack of pests and pathogens. Trichoderma spp. have positive impacts on the environment and guarantee food security, which, in turn, offer important economic benefits in agriculture. The purpose of the present study was to investigate the effects of the inoculation of a commercial Trichoderma strain on the arthropod community, downy mildew, and the agronomic performance of tomato plants in an experimental field. Our results showed that inoculation with Trichoderma positively influenced tomato fruit yields and could reduce the abundance of specific pests under field conditions. Fungi belonging to the genus Trichoderma have received much attention in recent years due to their beneficial effects on crop health and their use as pest control agents. Trichoderma activates direct plant defenses against phytophagous arthropods and reinforces indirect plant defense through the attraction of predators. Although the plant defenses against insect herbivores were demonstrated in laboratory experiments, little attention has been paid to the use of Trichoderma spp. in open field conditions. In the present study, we investigated the effects of the inoculation of the commercial Trichoderma harzianum strain T22 on the arthropod community associated with tomato plants and on the crop performance in an experimental field located in South Italy. Our results showed that inoculation with T. harzianum could alter the arthropod community and reduce the abundance of specific pests under field conditions with respect to the sampling period. The present study also confirmed the beneficial effect of T. harzianum against plant pathogens and on tomato fruit. The complex tomato-arthropod-microorganism interactions that occurred in the field are discussed to enrich our current information on the possibilities of using Trichoderma as a green alternative agent in agriculture.

AB  - To explore the molecular mechanism of the puberty effects on the reproduction of goats, goats at different growth stages from two breeds (Jining Grey (JG) goats and Liaoning Cashmere (LC) goats) were divided into three groups with three replicates (juvenile stage (JG 30d vs. LC 30d, AO group), puberty (JG 90d vs. LC 180d, BO group) and the same age control of puberty (JG 90d vs. LC 90d, EO group). Ovary tissues were taken from goats on 30 days, 90 days and 180 days, total RNA was extracted, differentially expressed (DE) gene libraries were constructed by suppression subtractive hybridization (SSH) technology, and puberty-related differential genes were screened. A total of 184 differentially expressed genes were screened, including 57, 68 and 59 in the AO, BO and EO groups, respectively. There are 22 differentially expressed genes were directly associated to the ovary development. According to the gene function analysis in KOG database, the known genes were clustered into 10 subdivisions in A group, 8 in E group and 9 in B group under three categories, mainly in posttranslational modification, protein turnover, chaperones, energy production and conversion, and transcription process. Pathway analysis in KEGG pathway database of the known genes revealed that the five pathways that most differentially expressed genes involving: GnRH signaling pathway, oxytocin signaling pathway, melanogenesis, thyroid hormone synthesis, and insulin secretion. Online tool was used to predict the function of DEGs, the results showed that the CYP11A1 gene might regulate the GDF9 and other prolificacy-associated markers in ovary organs of goats, thereby affecting the development of puberty. The expression of various genes and the transduction of hormone secretion signals, improving the reproduction of goats.

AB  - Simple Summary
   South American camelids (SACs) constitute the greatest livestock wealth of the Andean populations. Approximately half a million people from the high Andean areas are dedicated to the breeding of SACs as their main activity. In general, infectious diseases, particularly diarrheal infections, cause high morbidity and mortality in offspring and adult animals. In the study, we demonstrated that multiple virus pathogens circulate among neonatal SACs, and coinfections from other viruses might be common among SAC crias. We also demonstrated, for the first-time anywhere, the circulation of mammalian orthoreovirus in SACs or camelids. Diarrheal infections can potentially impact livestock productivity, which translates into serious economic losses for the Peruvian SAC industry, especially within rural communities, directly impacting their livelihood. Better knowledge of the infections that afflict these animals will enable the implementation of measures for the prevention and control of pathogens, the results of which will ultimately be reflected in improving the quality of life of these communities.
   Enteric infections are a major cause of neonatal death in South American camelids (SACs). The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of enteric viral pathogens among alpacas and llamas in Canchis, Cuzco, located in the southern Peruvian highland. Fecal samples were obtained from 80 neonatal alpacas and llamas and tested for coronavirus (CoV), mammalian orthoreovirus (MRV), and rotavirus A (RVA) by RT-PCR. Of the 80 fecal samples analyzed, 76 (95%) were positive for at least one of the viruses tested. Overall, the frequencies of positive samples were 94.1% and 100% among alpacas and llamas, respectively. Of the positive samples, 33 (43.4%) were monoinfected, while 43 (56.6%) had coinfections with two (83.7%) or three (16.3%) viruses. CoV was the most commonly detected virus (87.5%) followed by MRV (50%). RVA was detected only in coinfections. To our knowledge, this is the first description of MRV circulation in SACs or camelids anywhere. These data show that multiple viruses circulate widely among young alpaca and llama crias within the studied areas. These infections can potentially reduce livestock productivity, which translates into serious economic losses for rural communities, directly impacting their livelihoods.

AB  - The anthelmintics (regularly administered to livestock to control the infections caused by parasitic worms) and their metabolites formed in treated animals are excreted to the environment. This contamination might have a negative influence on non-target organisms including plants. Our previous studies described the uptake, metabolism, and effects of anthelmintics in plants using in vitro models exposed to anthelmintic drugs in solutions. The present study was performed in clover grown in soil fertilized with manure from sheep treated with the recommended dose of albendazole (ABZ), ivermectin (IVM), or monepantel (MOP). The uptake and metabolism of drugs in clover were monitored for six weeks using UHPLC-MS/MS, and several stress markers (proline accumulation, lipid peroxidation, and antioxidant enzymes activities) were evaluated. The results showed that ABZ and MOP were absorbed, metabolized, and translocated to leaves, while IVM was detected only in the roots. No or minimal drug-response was observed in monitored stress markers, and only a temporary increase of several antioxidative enzymes activities was observed. Overall, manure from sheep treated with anthelmintics does not evoke chronic stress in clover, but it can cause the entry of anthelmintics in other organisms and the food-chain.

AB  - Simple Summary: Some of the compounds involved in sexual steroids' metabolic pathways (i.e., androstenone, indole, and skatole) might accumulate in the adipose tissue of intact male pigs after sexual maturity, resulting in boar taint (BT). With a perspective future ban on surgical castration, in pig population where early slaughtering is not a viable option, the exploitation of genomic selection procedures might prevent this off-odor and off-flavor. The accuracy provided by the use of genomic information was equal or higher than the one obtained using pedigree information. This indicates that genomic selection could be beneficial for the traits investigated as it minimizes the need to collect individual measures of BT compounds. Several genomic regions, each with a small effect on BT compound concentrations, were identified. Genes previously associated with BT, reproduction traits, and fat metabolism are located in those genomic regions. Detection of candidate genes related to fat metabolism might be explained by the relationship between sexual steroid levels and fat deposition and be ascribed to the pig line investigated, selected for ham quality and not for lean growth.
   With a perspective future ban on surgical castration in Europe, selecting pigs with reduced ability to accumulate boar taint (BT) compounds (androstenone, indole, skatole) in their tissues seems a promising strategy. BT compound concentrations were quantified in the adipose tissue of 1075 boars genotyped at 29,844 SNPs. Traditional and SNP-based breeding values were estimated using pedigree-based BLUP (PBLUP) and genomic BLUP (GBLUP), respectively. Heritabilities for BT compounds were moderate (0.30-0.52). The accuracies of GBLUP and PBLUP were significantly different for androstenone (0.58 and 0.36, respectively), but comparable for indole and skatole (similar to 0.43 and similar to 0.47, respectively). Several SNP windows, each explaining a small percentage of the variance of BT compound concentrations, were identified in a genome-wide association study (GWAS). A total of 18 candidate genes previously associated with BT (MX1), reproduction traits (TCF21, NME5, PTGFR, KCNQ1, UMODL1), and fat metabolism (CTSD, SYT8, TNNI2, CD81, EGR1, GIPC2, MIGA1, NEGR1, CCSER1, MTMR2, LPL, ERFE) were identified in the post-GWAS analysis. The large number of genes related to fat metabolism might be explained by the relationship between sexual steroid levels and fat deposition and be partially ascribed to the pig line investigated, which is selected for ham quality and not for lean growth.

AB  - With the rapid development of the economy, household activities have emerged as an important source of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, making them a crucial focal point for research in the pursuit of sustainable development and carbon emission reduction. Hulunber, as a typical steppe region in eastern Eurasia, is representative of studying the GHG emissions from household ranches, which are the basic production units in this region. In this paper, based on survey data of 2018 and 2019, we quantified and assessed GHG emissions from household ranches by combining life cycle assessment (LCA) and structural equation modeling (SEM) approaches, with LCA to define household ranches system boundary and SEM to determine the key driving factors of emissions. The results showed that GHG emissions of meat sheep live weight was 23.54 kg CO2-eq/kg. The major contributor to household GHG emissions was enteric methane (55.23 %), followed by coal use (20.80 %) and manure management systems (9.16 %), and other contributing factors (14.81 %). The SEM results indicated that the GHG emissions from household ranches were derived primarily by economic level, while the economic level was significantly affected by income. This study also found a significant positive and linear correlation between household GHG emissions and the number of meat sheep (R-2 = 0.89, P < 0.001). The GHG emissions from meat sheep production (67.52 %) were double times greater than household livelihood consumption (32.48 %). These findings emphasized the importance of reducing emissions from meat sheep production and adjusting the energy mix of household livelihood, contributing to the establishment of a low-carbon household livelihood operation.

AB  - Camellia japonica is a renowned flower and an influential plant in Chinese urban landscaping. However, Colletotrichum, one of the world's most commercially important phytopathogenic genera that causes anthracnose on a wide range of plant species, have annually caused significant economic losses to Ca. japonica. In this study, 115 strains were isolated from Ca. japonica leaves with typical symptoms from the provinces of Hunan, Jiangxi, Hainan, Guangxi, Hubei, Chongqing, Guizhou, and Shanxi. They were then subjected to pathogen identification and using method of morphology combined with ApMat gene sequence analysis, along with the pathogenicity tests based on Koch's postulates. The 115 strains were identified as C. gloeosporioides, C. fructicola, C. siamense, C. camelliae or C. aeschynomenes. Pathogenicity tests revealed that all species produced brown lesions on healthy Ca. japonica leaves, indicating significant virulence. Furthermore, C. fructicola had the broadest distribution and the highest isolation rate., Most importantly, this is the first report in China of C. aeschynomenes causing the anthracnose disease in Ca. japonica.

AB  - Damage by herbivores often modifies plant structure and physiology, which may change the behaviour and performance of future herbivores. Here, we studied such interactions among the major coconut pest, the mite Aceria guerreronis (Acari: Eriophyidae), and two minor pests, the mite Steneotarsonemus concavuscutum (Acari: Tarsonemidae) and the moth Atheloca bondari (Lepidoptera: Pyralidae). All these species develop in the meristematic zone of coconuts, which is difficult to access because of the small opening between the epicarp and perianth. Both mites cause necrosis on the epicarp of the nuts, which may facilitate access to the meristematic zone by caterpillars of the moth. However, the caterpillars co-occur predominantly with A. guerreronis and not with S. concavuscutum. We show that caterpillars did not colonize nuts without mites and colonized nuts with A. guerreronis most frequently, in agreement with the openings caused by this mite and caterpillar size. When the opening between epicarp and perianth was artificially increased, caterpillars also colonized nuts without mites and nuts with S. concavuscutum. When offered a choice, caterpillars preferred nuts with easy access to the meristematic region, regardless of the presence of mites. Caterpillars performed better on the A. guerreronis-infested nuts than on other nuts, but moth females did not preferentially oviposit in coconut bunches infested with mites. Hence, caterpillars, not adults, select suitable feeding sites within a bunch of coconuts, and A. guerreronis facilitates the infestation of coconuts by A. bondari. We discuss how damage by mites affects the relevance of A. bondari as a coconut pest.

AB  - Camelina (Camelina sativa L.) is a potential biofuel crop and beneficial rotation crop in dryland cropping systems. Little is known about camelina microbiota or the legacy effect of soil origin/cropping system zones on camelina-associated microbiome assembly. To explore camelina-microbe associations, we grew camelina in the greenhouse using soil transplanted from 33 locations in the dryland wheat production area of eastern Washington. Bacterial, archaeal, and fungal communities from bulk soil, rhizosphere, and endosphere were characterized with 16S rRNA and internal transcribed spacer amplicon sequencing and were analyzed alongside site-specific climatic and edaphic data. We found that soil from the highest precipitation zone had higher alpha diversity than soil from the driest zone, but this effect was not seen in the greenhouse rhizosphere or endosphere. Plant compartment, cropping system zone, and soil origin all significantly influenced microbial composition, with soil pH and organic matter, as well as precipitation at origin, as major predictors. Analysis of abundance-occupancy distributions showed that the Actinobacteriota Aeromicrobium and Marmoricola and the fungus Pseudogymnoascus in the rhizosphere were plant-selected, while the endosphere was characterized by a number of Actinobacteriota, Rhizobium, and Clostridium. Sphingomonas amplicon sequence variants were also consistently enriched in the rhizosphere, suggesting that they are present in soils collected throughout eastern Washington and may represent good candidate biostimulants. Several lignin decomposing fungi had site-specific rhizospheric distributions, suggesting that they may be dispersal-limited or result from the legacy effect of long-term wheat cropping. Overall, this study contributes to our understanding of microbiome assembly in and on camelina roots while also highlighting the potential impact of cropping history on soil- and plant-associated microbiomes.The author(s) have dedicated the work to the public domain under the Creative Commons CC0 "No Rights Reserved" license by waiving all of his or her rights to the work worldwide under copyright law, including all related and neighboring rights, to the extent allowed by law, 2025.

AB  - The global decline in insect biomass has far-reaching implications for terrestrial and freshwater food webs, impacting species reliant on insects as a crucial component of their diet. This issue extends to species traditionally considered agricultural pests, such as the common cockchafer Melolontha melolontha. In the race to combat cockchafers through collection, insecticide use, and other control methods, the repercussions of their numerical fluctuations on predators, including species of high conservation importance like bats, have been largely overlooked. Drawing on 31-years of monitoring data for a greater horseshoe bat Rhinolophus ferrumequinum population in the Aosta Valley (Western Italian Alps), we investigated whether annual fluctuations in bat counts are influenced by cockchafer availability and weather conditions. Despite an overall positive trend in bat abundance, we observed pronounced annual fluctuations, mostly driven by cockchafer availability rather than variations in temperature and precipitation. Furthermore, we found a significant association between cockchafer availability and the median date of birth and birth rate of bats. Births occurred approximately 5 days earlier in cockchafer flight years, with earlier births also linked to warmer spring temperatures and higher numbers of warm days in April. Moreover, the ratio pups/older bats was 0.56 in cockchafer flight years, compared to 0.47 in other years. Our results underscore the importance of considering predator-prey dynamics when examining the long-term population trends of species of conservation concern. We recommend implementing restrictions on the use of chemicals and other potentially harmful practices that may diminish prey abundance or quality, including that of species considered as agricultural pests. In designing conservation strategies, a delicate balance should be struck between the current interests of farmers and the overarching goal of preserving biodiversity against potential future threats.

AB  - With the continuous increase in the demand for energy storage equipment, it is imperative to develop new electrode materials with high specific capacitance. In this study, yak dung derived carbon materials (N-YD) were prepared by a simple, economical, and effective method, and it was applied as a supercapacitor electrode material. The N-YD-800 material exhibited high nitrogen content, as well as a large number of multipore structures, which were beneficial to improve the capacitance performance. N-YD-800 exhibited an excellent specific capacitance (346.3Fg-1 at 1Ag-1), good rate performance (56.6% from 0.5Ag-1 to 10Ag-1), and excellent cycling stability (93.3% after 5000 cycles). This study provided a new method for the treatment of livestock and poultry manure resources, affording a cost-effective, easy-to-use carbon source to solve the problem of nonrenewable energy.
   A simple, economical, and effective method for preparing N-YD-800 materials with a high specific capacitance is proposed. By using yak dung as the raw material, without the addition of any chemical substance, nitrogen-doped porous carbon is successfully prepared. The carbon materials have high nitrogen content and a lot of porous structure, which is beneficial to improve the capacitance performance: excellent specific capacitance (346.3 F g(-1) at 1 A g(-1)), and excellent cycling stability (93.3% after 5,000 cycles).

AB  - A mutualistic symbiosis exists between the alga Sargassum spp. and two shrimp species, Latreutes fucorum and Leander tenuicornis. However, little is known about how these shrimp locate and establish their host alga. Both visual and chemical cues are potentially available. A previous study has looked at both cue variables with results that are mixed. Specifically, these same shrimp species used chemical cues only when visible cues were available simultaneously. Visual cues would be presumably restricted at night, but chemical cues are potentially available continuously. This current research elaborates on the previous study to fully understand Sargassum shrimp chemoreception. Increases in sample sizes and both a 4-chambered and Y-maze apparatus were used to test whether the shrimp could detect Sargassum cues, dimethylsulfoniopropionate (DMSP) (a chemical excreted by some marine algae), and conspecific cues. Neither shrimp species showed a strong directional response to any of the chemical cues, but the Sargassum and DMSP cues did cause more shrimp to exhibit searching behavior. Additionally, several differences in responses between male and female shrimp were found for each cue. A lowered dilution of DMSP was also tested to determine sensitivity of L. fucorum shrimp to the chemical cue; although searching behavior was triggered, conclusions about quantifying the sensitivity could not be made. Overall, these results show the shrimp can detect chemical cues-in the absence of visual cues-that could affect initiating and maintaining this shrimp/algal symbiosis.

AB  - Above-belowground insect herbivore interactions and plant compensatory growth are crucial for reshaping the fitness of invasive plants, and it is likely that climate warming, nitrogen (N) deposition, and plant provenance influence this interaction and growth in a complex way. We performed an experiment with Solidago canadensis from home and introduced ranges, leaf-chewing Spodoptera litura, and root-feeding Protaetia brevitarsis under climate warming and N deposition, and addressed how these abiotic stressors and plant provenance jointly shaped the reciprocal effects between S. litura and P. brevitarsis and the compensatory growth of S. canadensis after herbivory. Under ambient conditions, S. litura and P. brevitarsis inhibited each other on the basis of growth; warming, N addition or warming plus N addition shifted or even reversed this competition depending on provenance. While the survival-based above-belowground interactions differed from growth-based ones, warming or warming plus N addition also shifted or even reversed the neutralism or amensalism detected under ambient conditions depending on provenance. S. canadensis from its home range was more tolerant of herbivory than from its introduced range under ambient conditions; warming, N addition or warming plus N addition decreased the plant compensatory growth of native S. canadensis, but increased that of invasive S. canadensis relative to ambient conditions. These findings suggest that climate warming and N deposition could enhance positive above-belowground insect interactions, increasing insect pressures on S. canadensis, and that plant provenance might be important in mediating climate change effects on insect interactions and host compensatory growth under plant invasions.

AB  - Perfluoroalkyl acids (PFAA) are among the leading chemical pollutants in the twenty-first century. Of these, perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (PFOS) have been widely detected in a large number of animal and environmental samples. Wild boars accumulate PFAA in their livers, but it has not yet been clarified to what extent wild boars of the same population accumulate different PFAA in their livers or whether any conclusions can be drawn from any differences found in regard to environmental contamination. In this study, liver samples from wild boars killed during driven hunts in 2019 and 2020 from a defined forest area in North Rhine-Westfalia, Germany were analyzed for 13 different PFAA. A mean load of 493 mu g/kg (+/- 168 mu g/kg) PFAA was measured in 2020. Perfluorosulfonic acids accounted for 87% of the total load in both years, with PFOS dominating this group. These results were similar to those of 14 liver samples collected from other regions of Germany for comparison. In addition, the livers of hunted pregnant sows and fetuses were examined. The load of short-chain perfluorocarboxylic acids (< C8) in the fetus liver was as high as that of the sows, whereas the concentrations of long-chain perfluorocarboxylic acids (>= C8) were lower than in the dams. This result shows for the first time that fetuses take up PFAA from their mothers in utero. Our study shows that PFAA content in wild boar livers is comparably high in all animals in a local population and indicates a need for further research regarding a nationwide background exposure to PFAA in wild boars and their surrounding environment.

AB  - Purpose: This study was carried out to evaluate the effects of the tillage system and consecutive application of swine slurry for seven years on arbuscular mycorrhizal fungal abundance and infective propagules in Brazilian soil with crop rotation. Method: The spore density, the external mycelium, and the most probable number of infective propagules of mycorrhizal fungal abundance were assessed in soil samples from an Oxisol in a long-term field experiment in response to soil management (no-tillage and conventional tillage) and following successive application of swine slurry (0, 30, 60, 90 and Results: A greater amount of external mycelium was observed in soil under no-tillage, while mycorrhizal fungal abundance spore density was greater in soil under conventional tillage. In soil under no-tillage, mycorrhizal fungal abundance infective propagules were more abundant; however, in soil with both management systems, this variable was reduced with different levels of swine slurry application. In no-tillage, the main source of mycorrhizal fungal abundance propagules is the external mycelium, while in conventional tillage, the main inoculum component is the spores. Conclusion: In this study, we verified that the application of swine slurry, with high phosphorus contents, reduces arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi propagules. However, these effects are mitigated in no-tillage systems compared to conventional tillage.

AB  - Background and Aims: Condensed tannin (CT) is an important compound in plant biological structural defence and for tolerance of herbivory and environmental stress. However, little is known of the role and location of CT within the fine roots of woody plants. To understand the role of CT in fine roots across diverse species of woody dicot, we evaluated the localization of CT that accumulated in root tissue, and examined its relationships with the stele and cortex tissue in cross-sections of roots in 20 tree species forming different microbial symbiotic groups (ectomycorrhiza and arbuscular mycorrhiza).
   Methods: In a cool-temperate forest in Japan, cross-sections of sampled roots in different branching order classes, namely, first order, second to third order, fourth order, and higher than fourth order (higher order), were measured in terms of the length-based ratios of stele diameter and cortex thickness to root diameter. All root samples were then stained with rho-dimethylaminocinnamaldehyde solution and we determined the ratio of localized CT accumulation area to the root cross-section area (CT ratio).
   Key Results: Stele ratio tended to increase with increasing root order, whereas cortex ratio either remained unchanged or decreased with increasing order in all species. The CT ratio was significantly positively correlated to the stele ratio and negatively correlated to the cortex ratio in second- to fourth-order roots across species during the shift from primary to secondary root growth. Ectomycorrhiza-associated species mostly had a higher stele ratio and lower cortex ratio than arbuscular mycorrhiza-associated species across root orders. Compared with arbuscular mycorrhiza species, there was greater accumulation of CT in response to changes in the root order of ectomycorrhiza species.
   Conclusions: Different development patterns of the stele, cortex and CT accumulation along the transition from root tip to secondary roots could be distinguished between different mycorrhizal associations. The CT in tissues in different mycorrhizal associations could help with root protection in specific branching orders during shifts in stele and cortex development before and during cork layer formation.

AB  - This study aims at characterizing the hydrodynamic context and transport patterns that prevailed during the MERITE-HIPPOCAMPE cruise to assist in the interpretation of in-situ observations. The main physical attributes and structures (mesoscale eddies as well as fine-scale fronts and filaments) are analyzed based on various physical diagnostics. They were computed from satellite data and data-assimilative model outputs to describe ocean dynamics. The Northern and Algerian Currents were prominent features during the cruise while the western basin is divided by the vertically-tilted Balearic front. Temperature and salinity were used to distinguish different water masses at both surface and sub-surface. Sea-level anomalies, relative vorticity, and Okubo-Weiss parameter distributions have shown the presence of marked eddies around stations St10 and St11. Furthermore, Finite-Size Lyaponuv Exponents revealed that the former was rather located on a fine-scale filament near the edge of a cyclonic eddy while the latter was closer to the core of an anticyclone. Nearshore thermal fronts were detected with the Belkin and O'Reilly Algorithm (BOA), especially around stations St17 and St19. The potential coastal sources of contaminants were tested using Lagrangian Origin Maps (LOM), suggesting that stations St1, St2, St4, St11, and St15 were most likely influenced by coastal waters. Additionally, an atmospheric reanalysis combined with a Lagrangian dispersal model allowed for estimating wet deposition events of contaminants while tracking the fate of water masses where rainfall took place. Finally, we provide a set of explanatory quantitative and qualitative variables for future statistical analyses that aim at explaining the distribution of both chemical and biological samples collected during the cruise.

AB  - Heat stress poses a significant challenge to sheep farming in arid and semi-arid regions, impacting growth performance, health, and physiological responses. While sheep have innate mechanisms to manage heat stress, prolonged exposure impairs their performance and health. This study evaluated the influence of varying doses of Curcumin Nano-Micelle (CNM) on heat-stressed fattening lambs in northeastern Iran over three months, examining the relationship between CNM doses and growth performance, feeding behavior, physiological responses, immune function, and antioxidant status. Thirty-two crossbred male lambs were included in a completely randomized design with four treatments and eight replications. The experimental treatments were as follows: 1) CTRL: No dietary inclusion of CNM, (control group); 2) T20: Dietary inclusion of 20 mg of CNM per head per day; 3) T40: Dietary inclusion of 40 mg of CNM per head per day; and 4) T80: Dietary inclusion of 80 mg of CNM per head per day. The results revealed that dietary supplementation with 20 and 40 mg of CNM significantly improved live body weight, weight gain, average daily gain (ADG), and feed conversion ratio (FCR) compared to the control treatment. Regression analysis demonstrated quadratic models between growth performance parameters and the Temperature-Humidity Index (THI), indicating a correlation between CNM doses and the animals' responses to heat stress. Regarding eating behavior, CNM doses of 40 and 80 mg/day significantly reduced eating time while increasing ruminating time. Blood analysis indicated significant reductions in glucose levels across all treatments, with T40 significantly reducing both cholesterol and triglyceride (TG) levels. Additionally, CNM supplementation decreased serum malondialdehyde (MDA) levels and increased superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione peroxidase (GPx) activities, indicating enhanced antioxidant status. Physiological responses were influenced by CNM, notably reducing rectal temperature (RT), skin temperature (ST), respiration rate (RR), while pulse rate (PR) increased across various time intervals, particularly in the T80 group. This study demonstrates that CNM supplementation can enhance performance, physiological responses, and antioxidant status in heat-stressed fattening lambs, highlighting its potential to mitigate heat stress effects in sheep farming.

AB  - Past work has shown that group formation in foraging animals aids in resource acquisition and reduces the number of interactions with predators. However, group formation can also increase competition for resources among group members. Here, we model how the individual costs and benefits of group formation drive group size. Our model predicts that when competition for resources occurs within and between groups, forager group size will exhibit a one-third power-law relationship with population abundance. However, if groups form due to intragroup competition and predation, we predict either a one-half power-law relationship with population abundance or a constant group size depending on the coupling between predator and prey. Using empirical data on group foraging birds and ungulates, we found a scaling relationship consistent with the one-third power-law, suggesting that hierarchical competition drives the average group size. Our results support work highlighting the importance of density-dependent group formation in maintaining population stability.

AB  - The objective of this study was to define coping style of sheep by using unsupervised machine learning approaches. A total of 105 Norduz sheep (age 3-5 years) were subjected to a 5-minute arena test. Agglomerative Hierarchical Clustering (HCA) was performed on scores of selected principal components retained from Principal Components Analysis (PCA) on arena behaviors to identify sheep coping style. Initially, the variables retained for the PCA were determined with Bartlett's test for sphericity and Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin (KMO) measure of sample adequacy. Seven behavioral variables with KMO values greater than 0.5 were used for final PCA: the average distance to group sheep (DTG), the average distance to stimulus (DTS), the duration of locomotion (LOC), the total number of zone boundaries crossed during the test (CRS), the total number of times that tested sheep sniffed stimulus (NSS), latency to the first sniff the stimulus (LSS), and subjective scores (SCR) scored by an observer on a scale from 1 to 5 (1: extremely calm, 5: extremely restless). The first two components, which were the only ones with an eigenvalue greater than one, accounted for 70.32% of the total variation and were used for clustering analysis. Clustering tendency showed that the scores for the first two components were suitable for clustering (Hopkins' H = 0.852). Several cluster validity indexes were used to obtain aggregated results to determine the most appropriate clustering method and number of clusters. Five different clustering methods: k-means and hierarchical clustering with Ward, average, single and complete linkage were compared. Bootstrap resampling was used to evaluate the stability of a given cluster using the Jaccard coefficient. The clustering method and number of clusters corresponding to the highest rank aggregation score from the bootstrap resampling indicate that the hierarchical clustering method with average linkage and 5 clusters is the most suggested clustering method. However, Ward's algorithm identified the strongest clustering structure for hierarchical clustering, as it had the highest agglomerative coefficient value (0.98). When both Jaccard and aggregation scores are considered together, Ward's method with 3 clusters was selected as the most appropriate method. Sheep were classified into three coping styles (CS) based on HCA results as reactive (Cluster 1, n = 71), intermediate (Cluster 2, n = 22) or proactive (Cluster 3, n = 12). Coping style had significant effect on behavioral variables, DTG, DTS, LOC, CRS and NSS (P < 0.05). The individuals that have proactive coping style had the highest mean values for the variables DTG, DTS and LOC and SCR (P < 0.0001). This indicates that proactive sheep are more active then reactive sheep. The CRS, LOC and NSS mean values were higher for intermediate sheep compared to reactive sheep (P < 0.05). The NSS values were higher for intermediate sheep compare to proactive sheep (P < 0.0001). The findings of the current study show that distinct coping styles in sheep may be identified based on behaviors recorded in an arena test. The findings also revealed that sheep's coping style can be objectively identified by unsupervised machine learning from unlabeled behavioral data.

AB  - Not all antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) pose an ecological risk to their host animals. A standard should be developed to study which types of ARGs posed an ecological risk to wild animals under human disturbances (HDs). In this study, the golden snub-nosed monkeys (Rhinopithecus roxellana) were used as sentinel species. According to the animals-associated enrichment, mobility, and pathogenicity, the ARGs in habitat of sentinel species were divided into four levels. If the mobile and pathogenic ARGs that could be collinear with the metagenome-assembled genome (MAGs) in the gut of the sentinel species, the ARGs were defined as Rank I ARGs and they were considered to have ecological risk to sentinel species. Functional genes in the MAGs that collinear with the Rank I ARGs were used to predict the health risks of sentinel species. The ecological risk to sentinel species was present in 0.158 % of the ARGs-contigs in the habitat. Cultivation and villages, but not grazing, agriculture and ecotourism, increased the ecological risk of the ARGs to wild animals, The ability of gut microbiome to acquire mobile and pathogenic ARGs increased, as did the collinear functional genes, and the health risks of the wild animals also enhanced by the disturbances of cultivation and villages. Cultivation and villages increased the nutrient content of the soil, and they had a positive effect on the ecological risk of Rank I ARGs by affecting the mobile genetic elements (MGEs), microbiome and the resistant group in the habitat, which was why the cultivation and villages increased the health risks of wild animals. We proposed that cultivation and living should be controlled, while grazing, agriculture and ecotourism could be developed in nature reserves of wild animals, but the nutrients in the wild animals' habitat should be monitored.

AB  - Granulosa cells (GCs) synthesize estrogens needed for follicular growth. However, the effects of hypoxia on steroidogenesis in buffalo GCs remain unclear. In this study, the impacts of hypoxic conditions (5% oxygen) on estrogen synthesis in buffalo GCs were examined. The results showed that hypoxia improved both the expression levels of estrogen synthesis-related genes (CYP11A1, CYP19A1, and 3 & beta;-HSD) and the secretion levels of estradiol in buffalo GCs. Hypoxic conditions promoted the sensitivity of buffalo GCs to FSH. Furthermore, inhibition of cAMP/PKA signaling pathway (H89, a cAMP/PKA signaling pathway inhibitor) reduced both the expression levels of estrogen synthesis-related genes (CYP11A1, CYP19A1, and 3 & beta;-HSD) and the secretion levels of estradiol in hypoxia-cultured buffalo GCs. Besides, inhibition of cAMP/PKA signaling pathway lowered the responsiveness of buffalo GCs to FSH under hypoxic conditions. The present study indicated that hypoxia enhanced the steroidogenic competence of buffalo GCs principal by affecting cAMP/PKA signaling pathway and subsequent sensitivity of GCs to FSH.

AB  - Livestock blood, a major organic waste generated by the livestock industry, poses a risk of pollution due to its rapid decomposition. However, it is a potential protein source for agricultural purposes due to its protein-rich organic matter. In this study, we conducted studies on an eco-friendly, scalable, and effective protein degradation process using livestock blood to reduce waste and produce an amino acid liquid fertilizer that can be recycled for agricultural use. Ultrasonic technology was applied as a pretreatment method to improve the enzymatic hydrolysis efficiency of proteins in livestock blood, and the optimal conditions that led to 95.91% solubilization rate of hemoglobin were ultrasound duration for 30 min at an ultrasound density of 0.5 W/mL. As a result of hydrolyzing ultrasonically pretreated blood by mixing exo- and endo-type proteolytic enzymes, the optimal combination was a mixture of Savinase (R) 1% and Flavourzyme (R) 1%. After 4 h of reaction, the protein concentration was 27.8 mg/mL and the amino acid concentration was confirmed to be 54.6 mg/mL. This is about 4.2 times higher than the amino acid concentration of blood without ultrasound pretreatment, 13.1 mg/mL, and it was confirmed that sonication has a significant effect on improving protein degradation efficiency. As protein degradation increased, the viscosity of blood gradually decreased, suggesting that the physical force applied to the agitator torque diminished during the enzyme reaction; a significant correlation between protein and amino acid concentrations (biological factors) and torque (mechanical factor) was observed. Measuring torque during an enzyme reaction can confirm the extent of the enzyme reaction, so it can be used as an indicator of reaction progress when scaling up the process in the future.

AB  - Bisphenols are widely used in various branches of industry for the production of plastics. They penetrate to the natural environment and thus living organisms. As endocrine disruptors, bisphenols have adverse effects on various internal organs and systems. Contrary to humans, the knowledge of the exposure of wild terrestrial mammals to bisphenols is extremely limited.Therefore, this study for the first time assessed the exposure level of wild boars to three bisphenols commonly used in industry (i.e. bisphenol A -BPA, bisphenol S -BPS and bisphenol F -BPF) using hair sample analysis in liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS).The presence of BPA and/or BPS has been noted in the samples collected from >80 % of animals included in the study (n = 54), while the presence of BPF was not found in any sample. At least one of the bisphenols was present in every sample tested. Mean concentrations of BPA and BPS in the hair of wild boars were 151.40 +/- 135.10 pg/mg dry weight (dw.) and 29.40 +/- 36.97 pg./mg dw, respectively. Concentrations of BPA and BPS in females were statistically higher than in males (p < 0.05). Moreover, statistically significantly higher concentration levels of BPA (and not BPS) in the areas with higher degree of industrialization and higher human population density were also found.This is the first study concerning the use of hair samples to assess the exposure of wild terrestrial mammals to bisphenols. The obtained results show that an analysis of the hair may be a useful tool of biomonitoring bisphenols in wild animals. The presence of BPA and BPS in wild boar hair in relatively high concentration also suggests that these substances may have an influence on the health status not only in humans and aquatic animals, but also in wild terrestrial mammals. However, many aspects connected with this issue are not clear and require further study.

AB  - Roadkill, the result of collisions between vehicles and wildlife, is becoming one of the most important conservation issues. This is especially evident in regions such as the Cerrado savannas which are under strong land use conversion, forcing animals to move more through the landscape and thus increasing exposure to roadkill. Herein, we assess the temporal and spatial patterns of roadkill of the striped hog-nosed skunk (Conepatus semistriatus) as well as its interaction with surrounding land use in the Brazilian Cerrado. To do so, we sampled BR-050, a nationally-important highway, for roadkilled C. semistriatus between 2015 and 2020 and used location and date to identify temporal and spatial patterns of roadkill. Furthermore, we assessed whether different land uses affected wildlife-vehicle collisions using a random forest model. We recorded 672 roadkilled individuals of C. semistriatus, and detected both monthly and yearly temporal hotspots as well as spatial hotspots. These hotspots were significantly surrounded by soy, which along with savannas and crops were the most impactful land uses. Since conservation practitioners need to know when and where there are higher risks of wildlife-vehicle collision, our results are essential for the conservation of C. semistriatus in the Cerrado by incorporating land use into roadkill.

AB  - Simple Summary: Using the random forest model to predict the potential habitat of Amur tigers (Panthera tigris altaica) in Heilongjiang Province and Jilin Province of northeastern China was based on animal occurrence sites and various environmental variables. The results show that the suitable habitat for the Amur tiger was mainly distributed in the southern part of the Laoyeling Mountains (Hunchun-Wangqing-Dongning-Suiyang) at the border between Jilin and Heilongjiang provinces, the Sino-Russian areas of the border of Huilin-Raohe in the eastern part of the Wanda Mountains, and Yichun Forest Areas in the Lesser Khingan Mountains. The potential habitat of Amur tigers in the study areas was small and severely fragmented, with a lack of connectivity between patches. The results of this study suggested that habitat protection, restoration, and ecological corridor construction should be strengthened to increase population dispersal and exchange, providing technical support for the Amur tiger population conservation and habitat restoration in the future. Amur tigers are at the top of the food chain and play an important role in maintaining the health of forest ecosystems. Scientific and detailed assessment of the habitat quality of Amur tigers in China is the key to maintaining the forest ecosystem and also addressing the urgent need to protect and restore the wild population of Amur tigers in China. This study used the random forest method to predict the potential habitat of Amur tigers in Heilongjiang and Jilin provinces using animal occurrence sites and a variety of environmental variables. Random forests are a combination of tree predictors such that each tree depends on the values of a random vector sampled independently and with the same distribution for all trees in the forest. The generalization error for forests converges to a limit as the number of trees in the forest becomes large. The generalization error of a forest of tree classifiers depends on the strength of the individual trees in the forest and the correlation between them. The results showed that the AUC value of the test set was 0.955. The true skill statistic (TSS) value is 0.5924, indicating that the model had good prediction accuracy. Using the optimal threshold determined by the Youden index as the cutoff value, we found that the suitable habitat for Amur tigers in the field was approximately 107,600 km(2), accounting for 16.3% of the total study areas. It was mainly distributed in the Sino-Russian border areas in the south of the Laoyeling Mountains at the junction of Jilin and Heilongjiang provinces, the Sino-Russian border areas of Hulin-Raohe in the eastern part of the Wanda Mountains, and the Lesser Khingan Mountain forest region. The habitat suitability of the Greater Khingan Mountain and the plain areas connecting Harbin and Changchun was relatively low. Prey potential richness was the most critical factor driving the distribution of Amur tigers. Compared with their prey, the potential habitats for Amur tigers in Heilongjiang and Jilin provinces were small in total areas, sporadically distributed, and had low continuity and a lack of connectivity between patches. This indicates that some factors may restrict the diffusion of the Amur tiger, whereas the diffusion of ungulates is less restricted. The Amur tigers in this area face a serious threat of habitat fragmentation, suggesting that habitat protection, restoration, and ecological corridor construction should be strengthened to increase population dispersal and exchange.
   We provide a reference for future population conservation, habitat restoration, construction of ecological migration corridors, and population exchange of Amur tigers.

AB  - With the recent revolution in the green economy, agricultural solid waste resource utilization has become an important project. A small-scale laboratory orthogonal experiment was set up to investigate the effects of C/N ratio, initial moisture content and fill ratio (v(cassava residue): v(gravel)) on the maturity of cassava residue compost by adding Bacillus subtilis and Azotobacter chroococcum. The highest temperature in the thermophilic phase of the low C/N ratio treatment is significantly lower than the medium and high C/N ratios. The C/N ratio and moisture content have a significant impact on the results of cassava residue composting, while the filling ratio only has a significant impact on the pH value and phosphorus content. Based on comprehensive analysis, the recommended process parameters for pure cassava residue composting are a C/N ratio of 25, an initial moisture content of 60%, and a filling ratio of 5. Under these conditions, the high-temperature conditions can be reached and maintained quickly, the organic matter has been degraded by 36.1%, the pH value has dropped to 7.36, the E4/E6 ratio is 1.61, the conductivity value has dropped to 2.52 mS/cm, and the final germination index increased to 88%. The thermogravimetry, scanning electron microscope, and energy spectrum analysis also showed that the cassava residue was effectively biodegraded. Cassava residue composting with this process parameter has great reference significance for the actual production and application of agriculture.

AB  - The development and utilization of unconventional forage resources is crucial to alleviating the current situation of shortage of forage resources. Giant reed (Arundo donax) is a promising forage resource from the Poaceae family, one of the largest herbaceous plants globally, with fast growth, high biomass yield, and strong ecological adaptability. However, there are still very few reports on the use of giant reed in livestock and poultry production. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effects of adding giant reed instead of wheat straw in total mixed ration (TMR) diets on growth performance, blood biochemical indexes, nutrient digestibility, and antioxidant properties of sheep, thereby providing a theoretical basis for the development and utilization of giant reed herbage resources. A total of 24 fattening sheep (Han x Duper) with similar body weight (20 kg), age (2 months), and health status were randomly divided into four groups with six replicates per group. Sheep in the control group were fed a basal diet (CON), and those in the experimental groups were fed giant reed Lvzhou No. 1 instead of wheat straw, with replacement proportions of 10% (GR10), 20% (GR20), and 30% (GR30) of the total diet, respectively. The results showed that (1) the body weight (FBW) and average daily gain (ADG) of sheep in the GR20 and GR30 groups were higher than those of sheep in the CON and GR10 groups (p < 0.05). Meanwhile, the feed to gain ratio (F/G) of sheep in the GR20 and GR30 groups was lower than those sheep in the CON and GR10 groups (p < 0.05), and the F/G of the GR30 group was lower than that of the GR20 group (p < 0.05). (2) The apparent digestibility of DM and CP in groups GR10, GR20 and GR30 was significantly higher than that in group CON (p < 0.005). The digestibility of NDF and ADF in groups GR20, and GR30 was significantly higher than that in the CON and GR10 groups (p < 0.05). (3) dietary substitution of giant reed for wheat straw had no effect on serum biochemical indices, except serum glucose (GLU, p = 0.014) of sheep. In addition, the substitution of giant reed for wheat straw had a tendency to decrease serum urea content of sheep (p = 0.098). (4) Dietary substitution of giant reed for wheat straw significantly improved serum T-SOD (p < 0.001) and T-AOC (p < 0.001), and significantly decreased MDA (p < 0.001) of sheep. In conclusion, replacing wheat straw with giant reed can significantly enhance growth performance, nutrient digestibility, and antioxidant capacity in sheep without adverse effects on their normal physiological functions.

AB  - Flatheaded borers (FHB; Chrysobothris spp.), are woodboring-beetles that lay their eggs in the bark and cambium of deciduous trees in North America. Females often target stressed host-plants for oviposition. The reason why is unknown; however, stressed plants often suffer various induced phytochemical changes that may enhance larval infestation success depending on the stressor such as induced upregulation of defenses, reallocation of nutrients, and changes to volatile organic compound (VOC) emissions. To understand attraction of FHB to specific stress-induced changes, we analyzed phytochemical changes associated with stress treatments and attractiveness maple trees to FHB. Trees were stressed by: (1) chemical stress (pelargonic acid herbicide), (2) physical stress (physically removing leaves), and (3) physical stress (removing portions of bark near the root crown). After reflush of defoliated trees, bark tissues where FHB larvae feed were analyzed for nutritional changes (carbon and nitrogen), anti-nutritive changes (polyphenols and tannins) and emissions of foliar VOCs. At the end of the growing season, trees were assessed for FHB larval presence and oviposition attempts. There were more larvae and oviposition attempts on trees stressed by herbicide application. Compared to other treatments, herbicide-stressed trees had greater nitrogen and total polyphenol concentrations. Greater nitrogen may play a role in the fitness of feeding larvae, and the greater polyphenol concentration may stimulate female oviposition in the herbicide stressed trees. Females may be able to locate the herbicide-stressed trees by using volatile cues such as increases in limonene, alpha-farnesene, (E)-4,8-dimethyl-1,3,7-nonatriene (DMNT) and hexenyl acetate.

AB  - One of the biggest dangers to the degradation of biodiversity worldwide is climate change. Its oscillations in the future could result in potential alterations to species populations and habitat structure. With Sanjiangyuan District as the study site, an uncrewed aerial vehicle (UAV) was utilized to investigate the number and location of the bharal (Pseudois nayaur). The Maximum Entropy model and the Minimum Cumulative Resistance model (MaxEnt-MCR) were coupled to simulate the distribution of wildlife. On this basis, the future geographical distribution of bharal under different climate scenarios was simulated, and the ecological corridor and habitat centroid of bharal were revealed. The results showed that the suitable area of the bharal habitat was 4669 km(2), which was mainly concentrated in the Maduo, Qumalai, and Gonghe counties. The potential distribution of the species under different future climate scenarios had a decreasing trend. Under the SSP-245 scenario, the habitat area of bharal in 2030 and 2050 decreased by 25.68 and 44.61% compared with the present situation and cumulatively decreased by 1199 and 2083 km(2), respectively. Under the SSP-585 scenario, the habitat area of bharal in 2030 and 2050 decreased by 27.5 and 48.44%, with a total reduction of 1284 and 2262 km(2), respectively. Furthermore, a complete loss of habitat was predicted in Gonghe County by 2050. In addition, it was observed that the landscape structure in Sanjiangyuan District would be more fragmented and complex. The continued climate change will seriously affect the habitat distribution of this species. Therefore, preventive measures, such as protecting habitat areas and establishing ecological corridors for bharal, should be implemented in the Sanjiangyuan District. Such measures should not focus solely on the potential degradation but should also be extended to include potential distribution areas for future migration.

AB  - Urbanization is associated with numerous changes to the biotic and abiotic environments, many of which lead to a loss of biodiversity. Some studies have documented increased herbivory rates in cities, which has been hypothesized to lead to the evolution of novel defence traits in plants. Yet evidence supporting this hypothesis is contradictory and entirely absent from South American cities. To address this research gap, we evaluated herbivory rates in the native urban wildflower, Turnera subulata (Turneraceae), along an urbanization gradient in Joao Pessoa, Brazil. We predicted that higher rates of herbivory in cities would lead to the expression of cyanogenesis, a chemical defence found in a closely related Turnera species. We estimated herbivory rates and screened for cyanogenesis in 32 populations along the urbanization gradient, quantified by the Human Footprint Index and the amount of impervious surface surrounding each site. We found herbivory rates increased in T. subulata populations with increasing urbanization, but we did not find evidence of cyanogenesis in any of the populations. Our results suggest that although herbivores respond positively to urbanization, the fitness effects of leaf herbivory may be insufficient to select for the evolution of cyanogenesis in some plants. Our results provide valuable insight into the effects of urbanization on plant-herbivore interactions in the tropics.

AB  - Although chemical defenses and herbivore pressure are widely established as key targets and agents of selection, their roles in local adaptation and determining potential evolutionary responses to changing climates are often neglected. Here, we explore fitness differences between 11 rangewide M. guttatus populations in a field common garden experiment and assess the agents and targets of selection driving relative fitness patterns. We use piecewise structural equation models to disentangle associations between chemical defenses, (phenylpropanoid glycosides; PPGs), and life history traits with herbivory and fitness. While the historical environment of populations is not predictive of fitness differences between populations, >90% of variation in fitness can be predicted by the flowering time and foliar PPG defense arsenal of a population. Piecewise structural equation models indicate that life history traits, particularly earlier flowering time, are strongly and directly linked to fitness. However, herbivory, particularly fruit predation, is also an important agent of selection that creates indirect links between fitness and both chemical defenses and life history traits. Our results emphasize the multivariate nature of the agents and targets of selections in producing adaptation and suggest that future responses to selection must navigate a complex fitness landscape.

AB  - Estuaries provide enumerable ecosystem services to mankind in terms of provisional, regulating, supporting, recreational and information services. However, the persistent human-environment interactions for these services altered the ecological integrity of estuaries. Although the small estuaries receive little attraction in scientific studies due to their low surface area and regional importance, these ecosystems are more vulnerable to anthropogenic pressures and require urgent attention from the scientific fraternity. The Terekhol Estuary (TRE) is a small tropical estuary situated along Goa, west coast of India, gaining recognition in recent years due to the pollution risk from tourism activities. Moreover, the estuary also behaves as an extension of the marine realm during the dry season. The food web structure and network flow indices of the TRE was assessed to reveal its present ecological status. The Ecopath modelling approach was employed to delineate the ecosystem structure and trophic functioning of the estuary distributed in 22 ecological compartments from 2018 to 2019. The trophic level of the food web ranged from detritus (TL-1) to sharks (TL-4.53). The ecosystem structure demonstrated a grazing chain (herbivory) based organization over the detritus-based pathway. The proportion of exports to the total flows was 35% for the TRE. The model has a high total system throughput (12,043.6 t km-2 year-1), low system omnivory index (0.17) and connectance index (0.21), and a moderate relative ascendency (45.1%). Finn's cycling index (2.17%) indicated very low recycling in the system. All these indicators along with the eco-exergy index (8567.22 g detritus equivalent m-2), specific eco-exergy (38.25) and robustness index (0.11) classified the estuary as be immature, less stable and less organized and is in the initial stages of its development. The ecological indicators analyzed here point towards a medium to a high level of impact in the TRE due to anthropogenic activities. We also highlight the management measures to be implemented in order to restore the ecological quality of the TRE.

AB  - The consumption of carrion is a key process in food web ecology and a common foraging strategy for facultative scavengers in the carnivore guild. As carrion represents a high-quality trophic resource, carcasses may be visited by multiple carnivore species and have the potential to act as hotspots for intraguild interactions. Mesocarnivores frequently consume carrion, yet the mechanisms used by these species to access carcasses and coexist with larger carnivores have been poorly studied. Here, we investigate the factors influencing carcass use by two under-studied African mesocarnivores, the side-striped jackal (Canis adustus) and the African civet (Civettictis civetta). Using camera traps to monitor ungulate carcasses in Liwonde National Park (LNP), Malawi, we assess the in-fluence of competing carnivores (spotted hyena; Crocuta crocuta), carcass size and carcass age on mesocarnivore detection rates. Jackals frequently consumed carrion and their detection at a carcass was positively associated with civet presence, increasing the potential for competitive interactions. Co-occurrence of jackals and civets, where both species were detected simultaneously, were mainly recorded at large (>200 kg) carcasses, suggesting competitive interactions were reduced when more abundant resources were available. Jackal and civet detection at a carcass was not influenced by the presence of spotted hyena, although we found evidence that civets use temporal partitioning to access carcasses at times of reduced spotted hyena activity. Continued monitoring of carcasses will be important to further understand carnivore coexistence dynamics, particularly as large carnivore populations recover in LNP.

AB  - Dietary fiber plays an important role in porcine gut health and welfare. Fiber is degraded by microbial fermentation in the intestine, and most gut microbiota related to fiber digestibility in pigs are worth pursuing. The aim of this study was to identify gut microbiota associated with the apparent total tract digestibility (ATTD) of neutral detergent fiber (NDF) and of acid detergent fiber (ADF) in pigs. Large phenotypic variations in the ATTD of NDF and of ADF were separately found among 274 Suhuai pigs. Microbial community structures were significantly different between high and low fiber digestibility groups. Fourteen genera separately dominated the communities found in the high ATTD (H-AD) of NDF and ADF samples and were in very low abundance in the low ATTD (L-AD) of NDF and ADF samples. In conclusion, norank_f__Bacteroidales_S24-7_group (p < 0.05), Ruminococcaceae_UCG-005 (p < 0.05), unclassified_f__Lachnospiraceae (p < 0.05), Treponema_2 (p < 0.01), and Ruminococcaceae_NK4A214_group (p < 0.01) were the main genera of gut microbiota affecting the ATTD of NDF in pigs. Christensenellaceae_R-7_group (p < 0.01), Treponema_2 (p < 0.05), Ruminococcaceae_NK4A214_group (p < 0.05), Ruminococcaceae_UCG-002 (p < 0.05), and [Eubacterium]_coprostanoligenes_group (p < 0.05) were the main genera of gut microbiota affecting the ATTD of ADF in pigs. The most important functions of the above different potential biomarkers were: carbohydrate transport and metabolism, general function prediction only, amino acid transport and metabolism, cell wall/membrane/envelope biogenesis, translation, transcription, replication, energy production and conversion, signal transduction mechanisms, and inorganic ion transport and metabolism. The most important metabolic pathways of the above different potential biomarkers were: membrane transport, carbohydrate metabolism, amino acid metabolism, replication and repair, translation, cell motility, energy metabolism, poorly characterized, nucleotide metabolism, metabolism of cofactors and vitamins, and cellular processes and signaling.

AB  - Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) is a prominent pathogen responsible for mastitis in dairy goats, and capable of contaminating farm environments. Luteolin is a naturally derived flavonoid found in many plant types. To our best of knowledge, this study involved the initial investigation into the prevalence of S. aureus and screened the multidrug-resistant (MDR) S. aureus from raw milk samples and farm environments. Furthermore, we explored the antimicrobial and antibiofilm activities of luteolin against MDR S. aureus. Antibiofilm activity was evaluated via crystal violet staining and confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM). Bacterial morphology and biofilm microstructure were observed via scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and the antibiofilm mechanisms were further explored based on extracellular polymeric substance (EPS) production, extracellular DNA (eDNA) content, and quantitative reverse transcription PCR (qRT-PCR). In total, 28 and 43 S. aureus isolates were isolated from raw milk and environmental samples, respectively. Raw milk samples had the highest prevalence of S. aureus (58.33%), followed by sewage sludge (35.42%), soil (27.78%), excrement (19.44%), bulk tank (12.50%), milking parlor (11.11%), and feed (7.50%). Among the isolated strains, 40 isolates (56.34%) expressed the MDR phenotype. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) of luteolin against MDR S. aureus were 8-32 & mu;g/mL and 16-64 & mu;g/mL, respectively. Compared to that in the untreated control isolate, the number of dead cells increased, while the auto-aggregation and cell surface hydrophobicity decreased. Moreover, the cell membrane dissolved with the increase in luteolin concentration. Luteolin down-regulated the transcription of seven biofilm related genes: icaA, icaD, icab, hld, hla, agrA and RNAIII. These results indicated that S. aureus coexisted in raw milk and goat farm environments, and also suggested the potential of luteolin as a promising antibiofilm agent against MDR S. aureus.

AB  - Some types of plant accumulate liquid in their inflorescences creating phytotelmata. These environments protect the flowers against florivory, although they may be colonized by aquatic or semi-aquatic florivorous insect larvae, whose effects on the fitness of the plants remain unclear. We tested the hypothesis of floral antagonism by the occupants of phytotelmata, which predicts that florivory by the occupants of the phytotelmata represents a cost to the female fitness of the plant, reducing its fecundity. We manipulated experimentally the infestation by 3 florivores larvae species occupants of phytotelmata in inflorescences of Heliconia spathocircinata (Heliconiaceae) to test for negative direct trophic effects on the fecundity of the flowering and fruiting bracts. We found that the foraging of the hoverfly (Syrphidae) and moth (Lepidoptera) larvae in the inflorescences contributed to a decline in the fecundity of the plant. While the lepidopteran impacted fecundity when foraging in both flowering and fruiting bracts, the syrphid only affected the fruiting bracts, which indicates that the nectar and floral tissue are the principal resource exploited by the hoverfly. By contrast, soldier fly (Stratiomyidae) had a neutral effect on fecundity, while foraging in flowering or fruiting bracts. These findings corroborate our hypothesis, that herbivory by the larval occupants represents cost to the host plant having phytotelmata. The negative influence of this foraging on plant fecundity will nevertheless depend on the consequences of the exploitation of resources, which vary considerably in ephemeral habitats such as the phytotalmanta of flower parts.

AB  - The study of the leafmining moth of the chestnut miner (Cameraria ohridella Deschka & Dymic, 1986) was carried out through the planting of the common horse chestnut (Aesculus hippocastanum L.) in the Main Botanical Garden of the Russian Academy of Sciences. The effect of various degrees of insolation of horse chestnut plants on leaf morphology and the composition of secondary metabolites, as well as the relationship of these parameters with the number and density of C. ohridella populations during the growing season, was studied. The solar influence, it was noted, had a significant impact. Thus, the largest number of the pests was recorded on the leaves of the sunlit side of the tree crown, and the smallest on the leaves of the shady part of the crown. The low content of polyphenols in the pool of secondary metabolites in the tissues of the A. hippocastanum leaves did not deter C. ohridella and poorly protected the plants from this miner, while the significant content of carbohydrates in the leaves reduced the resistance of chestnut plants to damage by the Ohrid leaf miner.

AB  - AimLong-standing theory predicts that the intensity of biotic interactions increases from high to low latitudes. Studies addressing geographic variation in predation on insect prey have often relied on prey models, which lack many characteristics of live prey. Our goals were to explore global latitudinal patterns of predator attack rates on standardised live insect prey and to compare the patterns in predation on live insects with those on plasticine prey models.LocationGlobal forested areas.Time Period2021-2023.Major TaxaArthropods, birds.MethodsWe measured predation rates in 43 forested locations distributed across five continents from 34.1 degrees S to 69.5 degrees N latitude. At each location, we exposed 20 sets of three bait types, one set per tree. Each set included three live fly larvae (maggots), three live fly puparia and three plasticine models of the puparia. We used glue rings to isolate half of the sets from non-flying predators.ResultsArthropod attack rates on plasticine prey decreased linearly from low to high latitudes, whereas attack rates on maggots had a U shaped distribution, with the lowest predation rates at temperate latitudes and the highest rates at tropical and boreal latitudes. This difference emerged from intensive predator attacks on live maggots, but not on plasticine models, in boreal sites. Site-specific attack rates of arthropod predators on live and plasticine prey were not correlated. In contrast, bird attack rates on live maggots and plasticine models were positively correlated, but did not show significant latitudinal changes.Main ConclusionsLatitudinal patterns in predation differ between major groups of predators and between types of prey. Poleward decreases in both arthropod and combined arthropod and bird predation on plasticine models do not mirror patterns of predation on our live prey, the latter likely reflecting real patterns of predation risk better than do patterns of attack on artificial prey.

AB  - Heat stress (HS) poses a major threat to human health and agricultural production. Oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction appear to play key roles in muscle injury caused by HS. We hypothesized that mitoquinol (MitoQ), would alleviate oxidative stress and cellular dysfunction in skeletal muscle during HS. To address this, crossbred barrows (male pigs) were treated with placebo or MitoQ (40 mg/d) and were then exposed to thermoneutral (TN; 20 ?C) or HS (35 ?C) conditions for 24 h. Pigs were euthanized following the environmental challenge and the red portion of the semitendinosus (STR) was collected for analysis. Unexpectedly, malondialdehyde concentration, an oxidative stress marker, was similar between environmental and supplement treatments. Heat stress decreased LC3A/B?I (p < 0.05) and increased the ratio of LC3A/B-II/I (p < 0.05), while p62 was similar among groups suggesting increased degradation of autophagosomes during HS. These outcomes were in disagreement with our previous results in muscle from gilts (female pigs). To probe the impact of biological sex on HS-mediated injury in skeletal muscle, we compared STR from these barrows to archived STR from gilts subjected to a similar environmental intervention. We confirmed our previous findings of HS-mediated dysfunction in muscle from gilts but not barrows. These data also raise the possibility that muscle from gilts is more susceptible to environment-induced hyperthermia than muscle from barrows.

AB  - Since assisted reproductive technologies (ART) are becoming increasingly important in wildlife conservation breeding programs, we need to discuss their implications to ensure their responsible use regarding the environment, the animals, and the people involved. In this article, we seek to contribute to the ongoing ethical and philosophical debate on ART in conservation by discussing the current attempt to save the northern white rhino (Ceratotherium simum cottoni, NWR) from extinction. Only two female NWRs are known to the world, both unable to carry a pregnancy, and the last chance to avoid sure extinction relies on pushing the boundaries of contemporary science through the use of advanced ART and stem cell-associated techniques. The attempt to save the NWR constitutes a valuable testbed for assessing the use of ART in conservation and an occasion for identifying possible critical issues. It touches upon several ethically relevant points-that we identify and organize in an Ethical Matrix-such as the need to guarantee animal welfare, and it provides the opportunity to discuss some significant questions related to conservation. For instance, how far is it legitimate to go in trying to save a taxon? Is using sophisticated technologies to remedy anthropogenic harm a part of the problem rather than the solution?

TI  - Experimental safety testing shows that the NSAID tolfenamic acid is not toxic to Gyps vultures in India at concentrations likely to be encountered in cattle carcasses

AB  - Population declines of Gyps vultures across the Indian subcontinent were caused by unintentional poisoning by the non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) diclofenac. Subsequently, a number of other NSAIDs have been identified as toxic to vultures, while one, meloxicam, is safe at concentrations likely to be encountered by vultures in the wild. Other vulture-safe drugs need to be identified to reduce the use of those toxic to vultures. We report on safety testing experiments on the NSAID tolfenamic acid on captive vultures of three Gyps species, all of which are susceptible to diclofenac poisoning. Firstly, we estimated the maximum level of exposure (MLE) of wild vultures and gave this dose to 40 Near Threatened Himalayan Griffons G. himalayensis by oral gavage, with 15 control birds dosed with benzyl alcohol (the carrier solution for tolfenamic acid). Two birds given tolfenamic acid died with elevated uric acid levels and severe visceral gout, while the remainder showed no adverse clinical or biochemical signs. Secondly, four G. himalayensis were fed tissues from water buffaloes which had been treated with double the recommended veterinary dose of tolfenamic acid prior to death and compared to two birds fed uncontaminated tissue; none suffered any clinical effects. Finally, two captive Critically Endangered vultures, one G. bengalensis and one G. indicus, were given the MLE dose by gavage and compared to two control birds; again, none suffered any clinical effects. The death of two G. himalayensis may have been an anomaly due to i) the high dose level used and ii) the high ambient temperatures at the time of the experiment. Tolfenamic acid is likely to be safe to Gyps vultures at concentrations encountered by wild birds and could therefore be promoted as a safe alternative to toxic NSAIDs. It is manufactured in the region, and is increasingly being used to treat livestock.

AB  - Ant-plant interactions are widespread and have profound effects on plant fitness, food webs, and species diversity. Whereas most experimental work has tested for ant effects on herbivores, few studies have investigated ant effects on plant pathogens, and even less dual effects on herbivores and pathogens. In this work, we tested whether ants protect wild cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.) plants against insect herbivores and fungal pathogens by means of an ant exclusion field experiment. In addition, we measured extrafloral nectar (EFN) traits (volume and concentration) to assess their role in ant attraction, and controlled for cotton direct chemical defenses (phenolics) in testing for ant-mediated defense. Ant exclusion did not have a detectable effect on either insect herbivory or pathogen infection levels on wild cotton leaves, and, accordingly, did not impact plant growth (height) over the growing season. We found that EFN traits were associated with ant recruitment to wild cotton plants, with both nectar amount and concentration being positively correlated with ant abundance on control plants. The above tests accounted for leaf phenolics, a type of direct defense, indicating no independent effect of indirect defense mediated by ants on wild cotton during the study. These results provide limited evidence of biotic defense by ants against insect and pathogens on wild cotton at the study site, but call for further assessments of spatiotemporal variation in wild cotton-ant interactions.

AB  - Zearalenone (ZEN), an estrogenic mycotoxin inducing reproductive toxicity, disrupts endometrial cell function and contributes to pregnancy failure, although its endometrial toxicity mechanisms remain unclear. This study reveals that ZEN inhibits goat endometrial epithelial cells (EECs) proliferation through estrogen receptor 1 (ESR1) homodimers. ESR1 knockout reversed ZEN-induced mitochondrial structural/functional damage via the ESR1-OMA1 zinc metallopeptidase (OMA1) axis. Furthermore, ZEN suppresses glycolysis and mitochondrial pyruvate transport in goat EECs through the ESR1-pyruvate kinase isoenzyme type M2 (PKM2) pathway. Pyruvate level alterations critically influence mitochondrial function and cell proliferation, with the expression of OMA1 mediating this regulatory process. Collectively, ZEN impairs mitochondrial dynamics in goat EECs through ESR1-OMA1 signaling and disrupts energy metabolism via the ESR1-PKM2 pathway, ultimately arresting cell proliferation. These mechanistic insights into ZEN's reproductive toxicity may guide protective strategies for human and animal health.

AB  - To reduce the pressure of sheep on plant resources, good nutritional practice models must provide new farming systems and feed management models, which reduce the pressure on grasslands by developing sheep farms integrated in the production of fodder in agricultural crops and on mowing pastures, well-managed grazing and improving the floristic composition of meadows and increasing their nutritional value, by administering phosphorus fertilizers for the development of nitrogen-fixing leguminous species or using organic fertilizers to increase the production of green mass. The good nutritional practices proposed for implementation contribute to the improvement of feed assimilation by sheep in different exploitation systems, because breastfeeding plays a fundamental role in the nutritional intake due to the intake of nutrients from the feed, milk production and weaning weight of the lambs.

However, it is still challenging to identify the seed-rodent interaction at individual level so as to reveal the differences in mutualistic or predatory interactions between seeds and rodents due to lack of efficient methods of tracking seed hoarding behaviour and seed fate. Here, by using the double-duplex passive integrated transponder tagging technique, we investigated seed hoarding behaviour of two rodent species (Niviventer confucianus with larger body size; Apodemus draco with smaller body size) on seeds of two tree species (Quercus variabilis with larger seeds, thicker seed coat, higher tannin and starch contents; Camellia oleifera with smaller seeds, thinner seed coat, and lower tannin but higher fat contents) in a subtropical forest of China. We found N. confucianus preferably consumed and scatterhoarded seeds of Q. variabilis. In contrast, A. draco preferably consumed and scatterhoarded seeds of C. oleifera. Our study showed significant difference in mutualistic or predatory interactions between trees and rodent species, which is likely to be associated with the functional traits of seeds and rodents. Our results suggest that the double-duplex passive integrated transponder tagging technique is useful in quantifying mutualistic or predatory interactions between multiple tree and rodent species.

AB  - Seasonal feed shortages often limit goat productivity in rural areas, creating a need for alternative, locally available feed resources. This study evaluated the effect of Berchemia discolor leaf meal on feed intake, digestibility and growth performance of South African non-descript goats. Sixteen yearling goats (average age 12 months, body weight 19.63 +/- 1.68 kg) were randomly assigned to four dietary treatments in a completely randomized design and housed individually in metabolic cages. They were fed diets containing 0%, 15%, 20% and 30% B. discolor leaf meal, formulated on a dry matter basis for 42 days (14-day adaptation, 28-day measurement). B. discolor supplementation had no effect on weight and feed intake (p > 0.05). However, goats fed diets with 0% and 30% inclusion levels had a significantly higher average daily gain and more efficient feed conversion ratio compared to those fed 15% and 20% inclusion levels (p < 0.05). Daily dry matter intake did not differ (p > 0.05) among groups. However, B. discolor had lower (p < 0.05) crude protein (CP), neutral detergent fiber (NDF) and acid detergent fiber (ADF) contents compared to the control (0% inclusion). Metabolic weight intakes were similar (p > 0.05) across treatments. B. discolor had no effect (p > 0.05) on dry matter digestibility, but CP and ADF digestibility were higher (p < 0.05) in goats fed 0% B. discolor than those in 15%, 20% or 30% inclusion groups. In conclusion, B. discolor inclusion improved growth performance and feed conversion efficiency in non-descript goats, though higher levels reduced nutrient digestibility. Inclusion up to 20% supported intake and growth, but the highest feed conversion ratio was observed at 0% and 30% inclusion.

AB  - Conflict between livestock producers and wild predators is a central driver of large predator declines and simultaneously may imperil the lives and livelihoods of livestock producers. There is a growing recognition that livestock-predator conflict is a socio-ecological problem, but few case studies exist to guide conflict research and management from this point of view. Here we present a case study of coyote-sheep predation on a California ranch in which we combine methods from the rapidly growing field of predation risk modeling with participatory mapping of perceptions of predation risk. Our findings reveal an important selection bias that may occur when producer perceptions and decisions are excluded from ecological methods of studying conflict. We further demonstrate how producer inputs, participatory mapping, and ecological modeling of conflict can inform one another in understanding patterns, drivers, and management opportunities for livestock-predator conflict. Finally, we make recommendations for improving the interoperability of ecological and social data about predation risk. Collectively our methods offer a socio-ecological approach that fills important research gaps and offers guidance to future research.

AB  - Simple Summary Due to the seasonal imbalance and limited nutrients in pastures available for grazing in China, cashmere goats are often raised in a confined yard-feeding system, which may lead to metabolic disease from a lack of green pastures. The rumen is an important organ for nutrient metabolism in ruminants. Noni (Morinda citrifolia L.) could promote in vitro ruminal fermentation in lactating dairy goats. In addition, Noni fruit polysaccharides could alleviate inflammatory bowel disease by regulating the intestinal microbial composition in mice. Therefore, noni fruit polysaccharides may help ruminants to metabolize nutrients. The aim of this experiment was to characterize the effects of polysaccharide-rich noni fruit extract (NFP) on ruminal fermentation, ruminal microbiota and nutrient digestion in cashmere goats combining in vitro and in vivo techniques. The results showed that NFP depressed protozoa, improved N utilization and enhanced ruminal fermentation in vitro, which was better when the dosage was 0.40%. This dosage yielded similar results in vivo and promoted nutrient digestibility. In addition, the high proportion of Firmicutes/Bacteroides might be compensation for the decrease in protozoa, and the increase in volatile fatty acid concentration might be associated with the greater abundance of Ruminococcus_1. The Rikenellaceae_RC9_gut_group might have a negative effect on ruminal N utilization. In two consecutive studies, we evaluated the effects of polysaccharide-rich noni (Morinda citrifolia L.) fruit extract (NFP) on ruminal fermentation, ruminal microbes and nutrient digestion in cashmere goats. In Exp. 1, the effects of a diet containing NFP of 0, 0.1%, 0.2%, 0.4% and 0.55% on in vitro ruminal fermentation at 3, 6, 9, 12 and 24 h were determined, whereas in Exp. 2, fourteen cashmere goats (46.65 +/- 3.36 kg of BW +/- SD) were randomly assigned to two treatments: the basal diet with or without (CON) supplementation of NFP at 4 g per kg DM (0.4%). The in vitro results showed that NFP linearly increased concentrations of volatile fatty acids (VFA), quadratically decreased ammonia-N concentration, and changed pH, protozoa number, gas production and the microbial protein (MCP) concentration, and was more effective at 0.4% addition, which yielded similar results in ruminal fermentation in Exp. 2. In addition, NFP increased the apparent digestibility of dry matter and crude protein and the abundance of Firmicutes, and reduced the abundance of Bacteroides and Actinobacteria. Ruminococcus_1 was positively associated with VFA concentration. The Rikenellaceae_RC9_gut_group was positively correlated with protozoa and negatively correlated with MCP concentration. Thus, NFP has potential as a ruminal fermentation enhancer for cashmere goats.

AB  - Early socialization not only facilitates positive behaviors and cognition abilities of post-weaning piglets, but also has effects on social behavior and physiology of suckling piglets during the lactation. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the effects of early socialization environment on social behavior, stress coping and weaning weight of suckling piglets. We selected 199 piglets (Large White x Duroc x Min pig) from 18 litters and three treatments were differentiated: intermittent contact group (IC, 6 litters), piglets of two neighboring litters were socialized twice a week for 3 h from D14 (14 days of age) to D35; continuous contact group (CC, 6 litters), piglets of two neighboring litters were socialized continuously from D14 to D35; the control group (CON, 6 litters), piglets were not socialized during the lactation. Behavioral observation occurred on D14, D15, D21, D22, D28, D29, D33 and D34, and blood samples were collected on D16, D28 and D34. The results revealed that the amount of fighting and head knocking in IC group was higher than CC and CON groups (P < 0.05). On the social interaction during the lactation, for performing piglet, piglets in CC group showed more oral-nasal contact than IC in 3 weeks of age (W-3 , D21 and D22) (P = 0.045), and socialized groups (CC, IC) showed more oral-nasal contact than CON in W-4 (P = 0.001). The amount of mounting in CC was higher than IC and CON from W-3 to W-5 (P < 0.001). For receiving pig, amounts of avoiding behavior in IC and CC were higher than CON in W 4 (P = 0.047). The return approach (positive response to the performing pig) of IC and CC were higher than C in W-2, CC was higher than IC and CON in W-3 (P = 0.003), socialized groups were higher than CON in W-4 and W-5 (P < 0.001). Serum epinephrine concentration in IC and CC were lower than CON on D16 (P < 0.001). The brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) concentration of IC was higher than CC and CON (P < 0.05) on D16 and D28, IC and CC were higher than CON (P = 0.004) on D34. There was no significant difference in weaning weight and crosssucking frequency among treatments. In conclusion, the early socialization environment provided opportunities for piglets to improve their social skills, increased the expression of social behaviors and had a positive impact on the expression of BDNF in piglets.

AB  - Sperm heterogeneity creates challenges for successful artificial insemination. Seminal plasma (SP) surrounding sperm is an excellent source for detecting reliable non-invasive biomarkers of sperm quality. Here, we isolated microRNAs (miRNAs) from SP-derived extracellular vesicles (SP-EV) of boars with divergent sperm quality statuses. Raw semen from sexually mature boars was collected for eight weeks. Sperm motility and normal morphology were analyzed, and the sperm was classified as poor- or good-quality based on standard cutoffs of 70% for the parameters measured. SP-EVs were isolated by ultracentrifugation and confirmed by electron microscopy, dynamic light scattering, and Western immunoblotting. The SP-EVs were subjected to total exosome RNA isolation, miRNA sequencing, and bioinformatics analysis. The isolated SP-EVs were round spherical structures approximately 30-400 nm in diameter expressing specific molecular markers. miRNAs were detected in both poor- (n = 281) and good (n = 271)-quality sperm, with fifteen being differentially expressed. Only three (ssc-miR-205, ssc-miR-493-5p, and ssc-miR-378b-3p) allowed gene targeting associated with cellular localization (nuclear and cytosol) and molecular functions (acetylation, Ubl conjugation, and protein kinase binding), potentially impairing sperm quality. PTEN and YWHAZ emerged as essential proteins for protein kinase binding. We conclude that SP-EV-derived miRNAs reflect boar sperm quality to enable therapeutic strategies to improve fertility.

AB  - Distinguishing between selective and opportunistic hunting is a major challenge in Paleolithic archaeology, requiring the comparison of the human hunting record to the usually unknown natural prey abundance. Open-air hunting camps are ubiquitous in the Eurasian Middle Paleolithic (MP) record, alongside cave sites, and are often dominated by large-bodied species. In the Levant, MP faunal records differ between caves and open-air sites: Caves are dominated by mountain gazelle and fallow deer, while open-air sites are more aurochs-dominated. This discrepancy can be explained by transport patterns, but whether the abundance of aurochs in open-air sites is due to deliberate targeting or natural abundance in the landscape is unclear. The Nesher Ramla open-air site is a natural sinkhole in central Israel with an 8-m-deep MP sequence. Detailed zooarchaeological, dental wear, and isotope analyses of the upper sequence fauna found a highly diverse assemblage dominated by medium-sized ungulates in the uppermost phases (Units I and IIa). Results concerning ungulate dietary niches and isotopic signatures demonstrate that animals from different biomes and topographies congregated at the site. Evidence of human butchery is infrequent and fewer than carnivore modifications. Several articulated vertebral columns attest to in situ preservation. Our results demonstrate that the Nesher Ramla's uppermost sequence formed primarily under natural conditions, suggesting that it was a site of opportunistic hunting by humans and carnivores, probably targeting ungulates that came to the sinkhole to drink. Therefore, we consider this assemblage representative of the site's "natural" environment and use it as a benchmark for comparing assemblages and hunting strategies. Thus, we observe a clear difference between our case study and those recovered from the site's lower layers (Unit IIB and below) and other open-air sites. For the first time, we can show that the abundance of large bovines in MP open-air sites is not necessarily due to their abundance in the environment but to deliberate human planning and selective hunting.

AB  - The term "applied ecology of fear" was recently introduced to describe the growing research field that applies the theory of the ecology of fear to manage wildlife behaviour. The management goal is to drive targeted species spatially and temporally away from areas of human interest by inducing cues from real or simulated predators to reduce human-wildlife conflict. We aimed to quantify, through a meta-analysis, if prey anti-predator response would vary among field trials versus pen-based studies, predator cue types, predator hunting style and prey feeding type, and be stronger in response to larger predators relative to the prey's size. We also explored what studies found in terms of wildlife habituation to cues. We used species belonging to the Cervidae family as a case study since deer are among the group of species with the highest degree of human-wildlife conflict. We retrieved 114 studies from online databases and collected information from 39 of those studies that fitted our research scope. We found that acoustic cues more frequently led to an anti-predator response in deer than olfactory or visual cues. Neither predator hunting strategy nor deer feeding strategy or type of study (free-ranging or pen-based animals) influenced the extent to which deer responded to cues. Deer more frequently responded to cues that belonged to a larger predator relative to their size. Habituation was reported in less than one-third of the studies, with a study period ranging from 1 to 90 days, and occurred as soon as 7 days after the start of the study on average. Our meta-analysis suggested that acoustic cues hold most potential as a tool to manage deer behaviour. These findings support the development of applied ecology of fear tools that introduce predator cues to reduce human-wildlife conflicts.

AB  - Males in many large mammal species spend a considerable portion of their lives in all-male groups segregated from females. In long-lived species, these all-male groups may contain individuals of vastly different ages, providing the possibility that behaviours such as aggression vary with the age demographic of the social environment, as well as an individual's own age. Here, we explore social factors affecting aggression and fear behaviours in non-musth male African elephants (Loxodonta africana) aggregating in an all-male area. Adolescent males had greater probabilities of directing aggressive and fearful behaviours to non-elephant targets when alone compared to when with other males. All males, regardless of age, were less aggressive towards non-elephant targets (e.g. vehicles and non-elephant animals) when larger numbers of males from the oldest age cohort were present. The presence of older males did not influence the probability that other males were aggressive to conspecifics or expressed fearful behaviours towards non-elephant targets. Older bulls may police aggression directed towards non-elephant targets or may lower elephants' perception of their current threat level. Our results suggest male elephants may pose an enhanced threat to humans and livestock when adolescents are socially isolated, and when fewer older bulls are nearby.

AB  - Intercropping, by capitalizing on positive biodiversity-productivity relationships, represents a promising option to increase agricultural sustainability. However, the complexity and context-dependency of plant-plant interactions can make it challenging for farmers to find suitable crop combinations. Furthermore, intercropping is usually implemented with standard inter-row spacing and plant densities based on monoculture practices, which might not be the ideal configuration to maximize yield.
   Here we present a spatially-explicit yield analysis method based on plant ecological interaction models that allowed to optimize crop species combinations and spatial configurations for maximal yield in intercropped systems. We tested this method with three crop species, namely oat, lupine, and camelina. In a first step, field experiments in which crop density and adjacent crop type were varied provided us with indications on which species would compete more with each other. The results showed us that oat and camelina strongly competed with each other. In addition, the distance experiments allowed us to understand how the changes in yield associated with the presence of neighbors vary with distance. This allowed us to find the sets of parameters (identity of neighbors, sowing density, distances between individuals) that optimise intercrop yield (measured as Land Equivalent Ratio [LER]) for the three considered species. Specifically, we show that alternating rows of species led to higher LERs than a homogeneous species mixing, and that 3-species combinations are not necessarily more performant than the best 2-species combinations. In addition, we show that increasing the density of oat is generally beneficial for LER, while increasing the density of lupine is not.
   By modelling crop yield from simple and reproducible density and distance experiments, our results allow to optimize crop mixtures in terms of species combinations and spatial configurations, for maximal crop yield.

AB  - Estimating animal abundance and density are fundamental goals of many wildlife monitoring programs. Camera trapping has become an increasingly popular tool to achieve these monitoring goals due to recent advances in modeling approaches and the capacity to simultaneously collect data on multiple species. However, estimating the density of unmarked populations continues to be problematic due to the difficulty in implementing complex modeling approaches, low precision of estimates, and absence of rigor in testing of model assumptions and their influence on results. Here, we describe a novel approach that uses still image camera traps to estimate animal density without the need for individual identification, based on the time spent in front of the camera (TIFC). Using results from a large-scale multispecies monitoring program with nearly 3000 cameras deployed over 6 years in Alberta, Canada, we provide a reproducible methodology to estimate parameters and we test key assumptions of the TIFC model. We compare moose (Alces alces) density estimates from aerial surveys and TIFC, including incorporating correction factors for known TIFC assumption violations. The resulting corrected TIFC density estimates are comparable to aerial density estimates. We discuss the limitations of the TIFC method and areas needing further investigation, including the need for long-term monitoring of assumption violations and the number of cameras necessary to provide precise estimates. Despite the challenges of assumption violations and high measurement error, cameras and the TIFC method can provide useful alternative or complementary animal density estimates for multispecies monitoring when compared to traditional monitoring methods.

AB  - Heat stress profoundly affects the reproductive success of buffaloes, which are vital for the dairy industry due to their unique anatomical and physiological characteristics, necessitating careful evaluation under such conditions. Hence, this guided our search for quantifying heat stress' impact on Mehsana buffaloes using the best THI model and evaluating sires' performance. Fertility records (days open converted to daughter pregnancy rate) were collected in the span of over 24 years, w.e.f. 1989 to 2012. Finally, 3070 records of first lactation cows, daughters of 117 sires from DURDA, Gujarat, India, were used in the analysis. Meteorological data were retrieved from IMD, Pune, to understand the relationship between daughter pregnancy rate (DPR) and heat stress indicators. Several heat stress models were compared based on R-2, adjusted R-2, AIC, and BIC values, and the impact of heat stress was quantified. The year was classified into different heat stress zones, viz., Non heat stress zone (NHSZ), Heat stress zone (HSZ), and critical heat stress zone (CHSZ), drawing from the findings of DPR and THI. The THI 4th model based on dry and wet bulb temperature was identified as the best-fit model, and DPR significantly changed (P < 0.01) by 1.14% per unit change in THI value based on the month of calving. The average EBVs of the sires for DPR were found to be 20.78% (NHSZ), 38.09% (HSZ), and 39.08% (CHSZ) using BLUP-SM and 20.78% (NHSZ), 37.30% (HSZ), and 38.87% (HSZ) using BLUP-AM. Subsequently, the optimum sire for each of the zones was prioritized. It is noteworthy that bulls that performed better in NHSZ did not perform as well in HSZ and CHSZ, and vice versa. This supports the possibility of evaluating bulls independently in each heat stress zone.

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic highlighted the urgent need for effective surface disinfection solutions, which has led to the use of mobile robots equipped with ultraviolet (UVC) lamps as a promising technology. This study aims to optimize the navigation of differential mobile robots equipped with UVC lamps to ensure maximum efficiency in disinfecting complex environments. Bio-inspired metaheuristic algorithms such as the gazelle optimization algorithm, whale optimization algorithm, bat optimization algorithm, and particle swarm optimization are applied. These algorithms mimic behaviors of biological beings such as the evasive maneuvers of gazelles, the spiral hunting patterns of whales, the echolocation of bats, and the collective behavior of flocks of birds or schools of fish to optimize the robot's trajectory. The optimization process adjusts the robot's coordinates and the time it takes to stops at key points to ensure complete disinfection coverage and minimize the risk of excessive UVC exposure. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithms effectively adapt the robot's trajectory to various environments, avoiding obstacles and providing sufficient UVC radiation exposure to deactivate target microorganisms. This approach demonstrates the flexibility and robustness of these solutions, with potential applications extending beyond COVID-19 to other pathogens such as influenza or bacterial contaminants, by tuning the algorithm parameters. The results highlight the potential of bio-inspired metaheuristic algorithms to improve automatic disinfection and achieve safer and healthier environments.

AB  - Fat deposition in yaks plays an important part in survival, multiplication, and meat quality. In this work, the characteristic of fat deposition in male yaks (MYs) and female yaks (FYs) and the regulations of gender to yak fat deposition were explored by mRNA-Seq and non-targeted metabolomics analyses. FYs possessed a higher body fat rate (BFR) of visceral fat, fat content in longissimus dorsi (LD) and liver, and subcutaneous fat thickness (p < 0.05). The fat and cholesterol synthesis in liver and the fat transport in FY blood increased. The fat metabolism in yaks is the combined effect of carbohydrate, fatty acid, and amino acid metabolism by tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, and an increase of triglyceride (TG) synthesis was accompanied by an increase of steroid synthesis. The high levels of myo-inositol and cortisol (COR) (p < 0.01) activated the calcium signaling in FY subcutaneous fat, followed by the increase of adipocyte secretion, and resulted in more leptin (LEP) secretion (p < 0.01). Then peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) signaling was activated by the focal adhesions and ECM-receptor interaction. Finally, the TG and steroid synthesis increased by the expression regulation of ME1, SCD, ELOVL6, DGAT2, DBI, LPL, CPT1, PLIN1, LIPA, DHCR24, and SQLE gene. The above genes can be considered as the candidate genes for yak with higher fat amount in molecular breeding in the future. This study can provide a theoretical basis for improving the meat quality and breeding of yaks.

AB  - Camellia luteoflora Li ex Chang is an endangered plant endemic to the East Asian flora with high ornamental value as well as phylogenetic and floristic research value. Predicting the impact of climate change on its distribution and suitable habitat is crucial until scientific conservation measures are implemented. Based on seven environmental variables and 17 occurrence records, this study optimized the MaxEnt model using the kuenm data package to obtain the optimal parameter combinations (RM = 1.3, FC = LPT) and predicted the potential distribution pattern of C. luteoflora in various future periods. The results revealed that the mean diurnal range, temperature annual range, and precipitation of the wettest month were the influential factors determining the distribution pattern of C. luteoflora, contributing 60.2%, 14.4%, and 12.3% of the variability in the data, respectively. Under the current conditions, the area of suitable habitats for C. luteoflora was only about 21.9 x 10(4) km(2). Overall, the suitable area around the C. luteoflora distribution points will shrink in a circular pattern in response to future global warming, but some potentially suitable distribution areas will expand and migrate to higher latitudes and the Hengduan Mountains region, representing a survival strategy for coping with climate change. It is hypothesized that the future climate refugia will be the highly suitable area and the Hengduan Mountains region. Furthermore, a retrospective validation method was employed to assess the reliability of the predictions and estimate the model's predictive performance in the future. This study proposes a survival strategy and adaptation measures for C. luteoflora in response to climate change, and the proposed measures can be generalized for application in conservation planning and restoration processes. We also recommend that future studies incorporate factors such as the anthropogenic disturbances and associated socio-economic activities related to C. luteoflora into the model and to further predict the distribution pattern for C. luteoflora in response to historical climatic changes, tracing the evolutionary history of its population.

AB  - The extensive application of farm manure that is contaminated with pharmaceutical antibiotics not only causes substantial soil pollution but additionally leads to the input of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) into the soil. These ARGs would proliferate and affect human health via the food chain. The effects of cultivated crops and wild plants on ARGs in rhizosphere soil are unclear. Therefore, we chose potted plants of cultivated crops (pakchoi, lettuce, corn) and wild plants (barnyard grass, crabgrass, dog tail), and set up test groups, i.e., treatment group, antibiotic-contaminated soil; control group, no antibiotic-contaminated soil; and a blank group without plants. The aim was to explore differences in the distribution and transfer of ARGs in the soil-plant system between cultivated crops and wild plants and at the same time to explore the influence of bacterial community evolution on ARGs in the rhizosphere soil of cultivated crops and wild plants. We concluded that under the pressure of antibiotic selection, ARGs can be transferred to the root endophytes of plants through the soil and further to the phyllosphere of plants, and cultivated crops such as pakchoi and wild plants barnyard grass have a strong ability to transport ARGs. Regardless of cultivated crops or wild plants, the abundance of ARGs in rhizosphere soil can be substantially reduced by 66.53 -85.35%. Redundancy analysis and network analysis indicated that bacterial community succession is the main mechanism affecting changes of ARGs in rhizosphere soil. The reduction of Firmicutes due to the plant was the main factor responsible for the reduction of the abundance of ARGs in rhizosphere soil. The tetA, tetG, tetX, sul2, and qnrS genes are highly related to some potential pathogens, and the health risks they bring are a red flag that deserves attention.

AB  - Insect meals could be a sustainable protein source in ruminant diets to overcome the environmental, market, and feed-food-fuel issues associated with the widespread use of soybean meal (SBM). However, research on this topic is still very scarce. This study was conducted to examine the possibility of replacing SBM with house cricket (Acheta domesticus) meal (HCM) in ruminant feeding. Four cannulated sheep were fed a total mixed ration containing either 10% SBM (Control diet) or 10% of non-defatted HCM (Insect diet) over two consecutive periods. Effects on ruminal fermentation, degradation, and biohydrogenation were evaluated. Despite some differences in rumen dry matter and N degradation kinetics, replacing dietary SBM with HCM did not affect the ruminal disappearance of dry matter, N and, neutral detergent fibre of in situ incubated feedstuffs. Nor were there differences between the meals in the in vitro intestinal digestibility of rumen non-degraded nitrogen. The replacement had no negative effects on rumen pH or ammonia concentrations, but resulted in lower total and individual (i.e. acetate, propionate, butyrate, and minor) volatile fatty acid concentrations. This adverse effect was probably due, at least in part, to the unexpectedly high content of fat in HCM and its relatively high degree of unsaturation. Inclusion of HCM in the diet facilitated modulation of the fatty acid profile of the rumen digesta without negative effects on biohydrogenation pathways (e.g. it increased trans-11 18:1 and cis-9 trans-11 CLA concentrations, with only a small variation in the trans-10:trans-11 18:1 ratio). Replacing SBM with HCM in ruminant diets could be a promising alternative to address the challenges related to SBM and to improve the lipid composition of ruminant-derived products. However, further research is still needed to investigate, for example, the most appropriate level of inclusion of HCM in the diet or the use of defatted meal.

AB  - Simple Summary Game meat popularity is connected with the fact that harvesting game is part of the sustainable management of game species. As hunted animals grow in their natural environments-with access to natural forage, exercise, and unlimited possibilities to perform natural behaviors-consumers are enabled to think about game meat as a healthy product, obtained from animals that grew in welfare-friendly conditions. On the other hand, the popularity of using offal (including those from game species) in dishes or processed products is lower compared to muscle tissue and differs among cultures and regions. Nevertheless, we should remember that offal is a nutritional and valuable animal product, and its use allows us to limit the amounts of utilized by-products, and therefore should also be considered from the perspective of sustainability in the meat production chain and its environmental effects. The goal of this study was to examine the seasonal variation in the body composition, carcass composition, and quality of edible internal organs from the fallow deer hunt-harvested in the summer (n = 9) and the winter (n = 10) seasons. The weight and proportion of the mesenteric and omental fat were greater for the animals harvested in the winter (1.12 kg and 2.75%) compared to those from the summer season (0.43 kg and 1.02%). The winter-harvested animals had more perinephric fat (0.75 kg and 1.84%) than those hunted in summer (0.26 kg and 1.84%). The gastrointestinal tract of the fallow deer hunted in summer was more filled with feed and therefore heavier (7.92 kg) compared to those from the winter season (5.16 kg). The proportion of fat was significantly greater in the carcasses obtained in winter compared to the summer season (6.55% vs. 3.79%). No seasonal variety was found in the physicochemical characteristics of the edible offal, but the content of extractable fat was significantly affected by the season. In conclusion, the effect of the season on the slaughter value of the hunt-harvested fallow deer was limited to a variation in the proportion of some of the internal organs and affected the fat deposition in the body of the examined animals. The season significantly affected the fat content in the carcass and the extractable fat content in the examined offal.

AB  - The existing cultural heritage mapping in Norway is incomplete. Some selected areas are mapped well, while the majority of areas only contain chance discoveries, often with bad positional accuracy. The goal of this research was to develop automated tools for improving the cultural heritage mapping in Norway, thus enabling detailed mapping of large areas within realistic budgets and time frames. The focus was on three types of cultural heritage that occur frequently in many types of Norwegian landscape: grave mounds, pitfall traps in deer hunting systems and charcoal kilns.
   A recent development in deep neural networks for object detection in natural images is the region-proposing convolutional neural network (R-CNN), which may also be used for cultural heritage detection in local relief model (LRM) visualizations of airborne laser scanning (ALS) data. Python code for 'Simple Faster R-CNN' was downloaded from Github.
   On 737 test images (16.6 km(2)) not seen during training, 87 % of the true cultural heritage objects were correctly identified, while 24 % of the predicted cultural heritage locations were false. However, all test images were small (150 m x 150 m) and contained at least one cultural heritage object, meaning that the false positive rate may be higher for an entire landscape. In Larvik municipality, Vestfold and Telemark County, on a 67 km(2) area not seen during training, the R-CNN correctly identified 38 % of the true grave mounds, with 89 % false positives. On a 937 km(2) area covering Ovre Eiker municipality, Viken County, the R-CNN correctly identified 90 % of the charcoal kilns, with 38 % false positives.
   In conclusion, we have demonstrated that Faster R-CNN is well suited for semi-automatic detection of cultural heritage objects such as charcoal kilns, grave mounds and pitfall traps in high resolution airborne lidar data. However, it is desirable to reduce the false positive rate in order to limit the amount of visual inspection needed when the method is applied to large areas for detailed archaeological mapping.

AB  - Studies of animal abundance and distribution are often conducted independently of research on movement, despite the important links between processes. Movement can cause rapid changes in spatial variation in density, and movement influences detection probability and therefore estimates of abundance from inferential methods such as spatial capture-recapture (SCR). Technological developments including camera traps and GPS telemetry have opened new opportunities for studying animal demography and movement, yet statistical models for these two data types have largely developed along parallel tracks. We present a hierarchical model in which both datasets are conditioned on a movement process for a clearly defined population. We fitted the model to data from 60 camera traps and 23,572 GPS telemetry locations collected on 17 male white-tailed deer in the Big Cypress National Preserve, Florida, USA during July 2015. Telemetry data were collected on a 3-4 h acquisition schedule, and we modeled the movement paths of all individuals in the region with a Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process that included individual-specific random effects. Two of the 17 deer with GPS collars were detected on cameras. An additional 20 male deer without collars were detected on cameras and individually identified based on their unique antler characteristics. Abundance was 126 (95% CI: 88-177) in the 228 km(2) region, only slightly higher than estimated using a standard SCR model: 119 (84-168). The standard SCR model, however, was unable to describe individual heterogeneity in movement rates and space use as revealed by the joint model. Joint modeling allowed the telemetry data to inform the movement model and the SCR encounter model, while leveraging information in the camera data to inform abundance, distribution and movement. Unlike most existing methods for population-level inference on movement, the joint SCR-movement model can yield unbiased inferences even if non-uniform sampling is used to deploy transmitters. Potential extensions of the model include the addition of resource selection parameters, and relaxation of the closure assumption when interest lies in survival and recruitment. These developments would contribute to the emerging holistic framework for the study of animal ecology, one that uses modern technology and spatio-temporal statistics to learn about interactions between behavior and demography.

AB  - Human dire need for environmental sustainability have triggered researchers to seek for organic substrates as an alternative to synthetic fertilizers in order to enhance bioremediation. Presently, nitrogen-rich organic substrate not only proffered the solution but also have proven useful in enhancing the rate of bioremediation. Animal manure is a nitrogen-rich organic substrate which has been found very effective for stimulating plant growth. Some of the animal manure used by researchers are poultry droppings, cow dung, goat manure, and pig manure. In all the papers reviewed, it was gathered that animal manure enhances bioremediation by providing nutrients favoring microbial growth and activities responsible hydrocarbon degradation. However, of the four commonly used animal manure, poultry droppings was severally reported to be a better biostimulant. Also, animal manure when sun-dried and pulverized yielded better results. It was observed that animal manure serves as substrates for earthworms which further accelerates the potential of the earthworms to remediate the soil. Also, the pollution of soil by crude oil causes a surge in its carbon content which may slow down microbial growth and activities. Thorough review of literatures, however, indicates that animal manure is capable of providing appropriate nutrient concentrations to offset such imbalance. Studies continue to lay credence to the efficacy of animal manure in enhancing microbial growth and activities responsible for the biodegradation of hydrocarbons contained in crude oil. Furthermore, the co-application of animal manure with other bioremediation strategies, such as phytoremediation and vermiremediation, should be combined for effective bioremediation of oil-contaminated environment.

AB  - The impact assessment of a weed biocontrol agent offers insight into the potential of the agent and weed responses in long-term weed management. The impact of the jewel beetle Hedwigiella jureceki Obenberger (Coleoptera: Buprestidae) and its first-generation larvae on the long-pod (LP) and short-pod (SP) forms of cat's claw creeper, Dolichandra unguis-cati (L.) L.G. Lohmann (Bignoniaceae) was studied by initiating one, two, or five pairs (male and female) of adults in a glasshouse experiment. With the higher density of adults, the number of leaves increased significantly, as did the numbers of dead leaves and larval mines, and the percentages of affected leaves (up to 40%), and damaged leaf areas (up to 60%). Plants with the five pairs of adults had fewer leaves and reduced dry weights (e.g., tuber biomass was reduced by 50.4-62.5%). Regardless of adult density, the dry weights of the leaves and tubers were lower in the SP form. Conversely, the LP form had fewer leaves (ca. 17% fewer) and slower shoot growth (mean +/- SE = 46.3 +/- 2.6 cm per week) than the SP form (66.5 +/- 3.8 cm per week). However, the number of tubers was not affected by the plant form and adult density. Larval mines (262 +/- 30), pupae (186 +/- 17), and adults (144 +/- 14) in LP form were higher than in SP form (243 +/- 20, 167 +/- 14, and 115 +/- 11, respectively). Likewise, the average weight of adults that emerged on the LP form was higher. Therefore, H. jureceki impacted both LP and SP forms. The SP form showed a higher impact in terms of reduced tuber growth, and the LP form is anticipated to be harmed more in the long term as a higher number of H. jureceki offspring developed on it when competition for food was increased.

AB  - Simple Summary Linseed has been utilized in ruminant nutrition to improve the production and quality of milk. In regard to the increasing concerns of consumers for the healthy aspects of foods as well as for animal welfare, in this research, we showed that linseed supplementation increased fat content but did not improve the milk concentration of odd- and branched-chain fatty acids (OBCFA), which are known to produce healthy effects in humans. Importantly, linseed did not show negative effects on animals' health, suggesting it can be safely used in goats' diet. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of linseed supplementation on milk yield and quality, serum biochemistry and, in particular, to evaluate its possible effects on the production of odd- and branched-chain fatty acids (OBCFA) in the milk of Cilentana grazing goats. Twelve pregnant Cilentana dairy goats were divided into two groups (CTR, control, and LIN, linseed supplementation group). After kidding, the goats had free access to the pasture and both groups received a supplement of 400 g/head of concentrate, but the one administered to the LIN group was characterized by the addition of linseed (in a ratio of 20% as fed) to the ingredients. During the trial, milk samples were taken from April to August in order to evaluate milk production, composition, and fatty acid profile. In addition, blood samples were taken for evaluating the effects of linseed supplementation on goats' health status. The health status of the goats was not influenced by the linseed supplementation, as confirmed by blood analyses. Concerning the effects on milk, the supplementation positively affected (p < 0.001) milk production and fat percentage and the fatty acid profile was markedly influenced by the lipid supplementation. In particular, milk from the LIN group was characterized by significantly lower concentrations of saturated fatty acids (FA; p < 0.001) and higher proportions of monounsaturated FA, polyunsaturated FA, and conjugated linoleic acids (CLAs) than milk from the CTR group (p < 0.001). In contrast, the OBCFA were negatively influenced by the linseed supplementation (p < 0.0001). Further studies are needed to test the effects of different fat sources and other nutrients on the diets.

AB  - Coprophanaeus ensifer (Germar) is a large dung beetle species primarily scavenger with paracoprid habits, habitually removing and burying parts of the food resource to build its nest and feed its larvae. This species is widely distributed in central-eastern South America and its association with decomposing carcasses confers great potential for forensic entomology. This study aimed to characterize behavioral aspects of C. ensifer associated with decomposing pig carcasses in the Cerrado of Central Brazil. Observational expeditions were carried out in the National Park of Brasilia (PNB), Federal District. Three pig carcasses of approximately 5 kg were exposed for a 30-day period on three typically rainy months. Behavioral observations were made daily in loco at twilight/nighttime throughout the decomposition process. This study comprised 45 h of observation. A total of 34 individuals (11 males and 23 females) of C. ensifer were observed and marked. The following events/behaviors were observed: copulation, flight, feeding/perforation of the carcasses, scattering of carcasses portions, soil turning, opening of tunnels below/around the carcasses, burying of carcasses portions, nesting, and agonistic behavior/fighting. The behaviors of feeding, scattering of the carcasses, turning the soil, and opening of tunnels were observed in a high frequency, regardless of sex. The species is most attracted by substrates on the intermediate stages of active decomposition and causes important actions on the carcasses such as drilling and dismemberment. Behavioral descriptions and forensic implications are discussed in the text.

AB  - This study investigated the accuracy of animal identification based on herd behaviour from drone camera footage. We evaluated object detection algorithms and point pattern analysis, using footage from drone altitudes ranging from 15 m to 130 m. We applied transfer learning to state-of-the-art lightweight object detection algorithms (Tensorflow and YOLO) based on feature extraction. In the point pattern analysis, we treated each animal as a point and identified them by the behavioural pattern of those points. The five animal species investigated were African elephant (Loxodonta africana), giraffe (Giraffa camelopardalis), white rhinoceros (Ceratotherium simum), wildebeest (Connochaetes taurinus) and zebra (Equus quaggas). As we increased the altitude of the drone camera, the detection algorithms using features significantly lost accuracy. Animal features are harder to detect at higher altitudes and in the presence of environmental camouflage, animal occlusion, and shadows. The performance of lightweight object detection algorithms (F1 score) decreased with increasing drone altitude to a minimum of 29%, while the point pattern algorithms produced an F1 score above 96% across all drone altitudes. Using point pattern analysis, the accuracy of animal identification is invariant to drone camera altitude and disturbances from environmental conditions. Animal social interactions within herds follow speciesspecific hidden patterns in their group structure that allow for reliable species identification.

AB  - Several studies have inferred the ecological significance regarding the morphometrics of Aristotle's lantern and the mechanical properties of magnesium in echinoid teeth. This study attempts to combine these aspects, connecting them to the trophic habits of three native and an invasive echinoid in the Eastern Mediterranean Sea. Spatiotemporal data from the central and southern Aegean Sea were obtained, regarding the relative size of lanterns and demi-pyramids of Arbacia lixula, Paracentrotus lividus, Sphaerechinus granularis, and the invasive echinoid Diadema setosum and the Mg/Ca ratios of four zones on the tooth cross-section. Since environmental factors affect the examined factors, data for temperature, salinity, and concentration of chlorophyll-a were included in a principal component analysis. A. lixula and P. lividus presented intraspecific differences in the relative size of the lantern and demi-pyramid, while S. granularis and D. setosum exhibited variation in the elongation index. Differences in the Mg/Ca ratios were observed for all species although in different zones. Temperature appears to be related to all Mg/Ca zones except for the stone part, while the elongation index showed an inverse trend to all other morphometric parameters. The results of the PCA for the four species on the spatiotemporal level exhibited a distinction of individuals with season but not species, except for A. lixula, an omnivore with a carnivorous tendency, which was clearly separated from the herbivorous species. Using hierarchical clustering on the principal components it was evident that the three native species occupy different clusters, but when D. setosum was added, it shared the same cluster with S. granularis. This might infer similar feeding preferences, specifically for coralline algae, which might lead to a swift in the ecological equilibrium in regions, where D. setosum is found, either by affecting habitat type, or by restricting the distribution of S. granularis as was previously observed with Diadema africanum.

AB  - This study examined the effect of different feeding methods on the rumen bacterial flora of Tan sheep, a Chinese indigenous breed, using 16S rDNA high-throughput analysis. The rumen fluid was collected from 9-month-old Tan sheep that were either house-fed or grazed. The results showed that the diversity of rumen flora in the grazing group was significantly higher than that in the house-raised group (P < 0.01). In the grazing group, the abundance of 96 genera was significantly higher than that in the house-raised group (P < 0.05), whereas in the house-raised group, the abundance of only 24 genera was significantly higher than that in the grazing group (P < 0.05). At the phylum level, the abundance of Bacteroidetes, Firmicutes, Fibrobacteres, and Tenericutes in the rumen of grazing Tan sheep was significantly higher than that in the house-raised group (P < 0.01), whereas the abundance of Proteobacteria in the rumen of the house-raised group was significantly higher than that in the grazing group (P < 0.01). At the generic level, the abundance of Fibrobacter, Ruminococcus, Lachnospiraceae_XPB1014_group, and Lachnospiraceae_NA, which are associated with hemicellulose degradation, and Desulfovibrio, which is associated with lactic acid oxidation, was significantly higher in the grazing than in the house-raised group (P < 0.01). The abundance of the acid-producing Enterobacter, Vibrio, and Selenomonas in the house-raised group was significantly higher than that in the grazing group (P < 0.05). The abundance of Prevotella_7 and Succinivibrionaceae-UCG-001 in the house-raised group was 272.07 and 7605.75% higher than that in the grazing group, respectively, but the abundance of Prevotella_1 in the house-raised group was 3657.96% lower than that in the grazing group, with these differences highly significant (P < 0.01). The higher abundance of Prevotella_7 in the house-raised group and the higher abundance of Prevotella_1 in the grazing group are differences worthy of further study in Tan sheep.

AB  - The Canada-Alberta Oil Sands Monitoring (OSM) Program began long-term surface water quality monitoring on the lower Athabasca River in 2012. Sampling of low level, bio-accumulative polycyclic aromatic compounds (PACs) targeted a suite of parent and alkylated compounds in the Athabasca River (AR) mainstem using semi-permeable membrane devices (SPMDs). Samples were collected along a gradient from upstream reference near Athabasca, Alberta, through exposure to the Athabasca oil sands deposit (AOSD), various tributary inflows, and mining activities within the OSMA, to downstream recovery near Wood Buffalo National Park (WBNP) and reference on the Slave River. The program adapted over the years, shifting in response to program review and environmental events. The AOSD chemical fingerprint was present in samples collected within the AOSD, through the oil sands mineable area (OSMA), downstream to recovery from 2013 to 2019. PACs were dominated by alkylated phenanthrenes/anthracenes (PAs) and dibenzothiophenes (Ds), with elevated levels of alkylated fluorenes (Fs), naphthalenes (Ns), fluoranthenes/pyrenes (FlPys) and benzo[a]anthracenes/chrysenes (BaACs), increasing in concentration from C1 < C2 < C3 < C4. Concentrations of these petrogenic PACs were at their highest within the OSMA and downstream of tributaries. The AOSD fingerprint was absent from sites located outside of the influence of the AOSD and downstream of the Peace-Athabasca Delta on the Slave River. PAC concentrations in the AR increased with mainstem discharge and loadings from tributaries, were moderated by the PAD, and diluted by the Peace River. This work bolsters the baseline PAC information previously reported for the Athabasca River and waters downstream, reporting 7 years of data, from all sites within the mainstem monitoring program, and exploring potential regional and hydrological drivers of these between sites and over time.

AB  - The relationship between monthly variation and serum steroid concentrations in P & egrave;re David's deer (Elaphurus davidianus) was investigated. In total, 48 male and 48 female deer were captured between March 2016 and February 2017 in Dafeng Milu Nature Reserve, eastern China.The serum concentrations of several steroids (including follicle-stimulating hormone, luteinising hormone, prolactin, oestradiol, progesterone and testosterone) were measured using radioimmunoassay. We identified significant differences with Mann-Whitney U tests between males and females with respect to serum concentrations of progesterone, testosterone and oestradiol. Correlation analysis indicated that male and female serum oestradiol concentrations in different months were significantly positively correlated, but serum concentrations of follicle-stimulating hormone, luteinising hormone, progesterone, prolactin and testosterone were not significantly correlated between males and females, but did show a negative pattern. We found that serum steroid concentrations differed between males and females, which reflects the physiological differences between females and males in P & egrave;re David's deer. Our results can provide important information for population breeding and conservation in animal husbandry.

AB  - Extreme precipitation during Hurricane Florence, which made landfall in North Carolina in September 2018, led to breaches of hog waste lagoons, coal ash pits, and wastewater facilities. In the weeks following the storm, freshwater discharge carried pollutants, sediment, organic matter, and debris to the coastal ocean, contributing to beach closures, algae blooms, hypoxia, and other ecosystem impacts. Here, the ocean pathways of land-sourced contaminants following Hurricane Florence are investigated using the Regional Ocean Modeling System (ROMS) with a river point source with fixed water properties from a hydrologic model (WRF-Hydro) of the Cape Fear River Basin, North Carolina's largest watershed. Patterns of contaminant transport in the coastal ocean are quantified with a finite duration tracer release based on observed flooding of agricultural and industrial facilities. A suite of synthetic events also was simulated to investigate the sensitivity of the river plume transport pathways to river discharge and wind direction. The simulated Hurricane Florence discharge event led to westward (downcoast) transport of contaminants in a coastal current, along with intermittent storage and release of material in an offshore (bulge) or eastward (upcoast) region near the river mouth, modulated by alternating upwelling and downwelling winds. The river plume patterns led to a delayed onset and long duration of contaminants affecting beaches 100 km to the west, days to weeks after the storm. Maps of the onset and duration of hypothetical water quality hazards for a range of weather conditions may provide guidance to managers on the timing of swimming/shellfishing advisories and water quality sampling.
   Hurricane Florence hit the southeastern United States in September 2018, causing historic rainfall and flooding. Floodwaters carrying contaminants traveled down rivers to the ocean, causing harmful algal blooms, beach closures, and other impacts. In the Cape Fear River Basin, North Carolina's largest watershed, open-air lagoons used to store waste from industrial hog farming were breached, causing sewage to flow into the ocean in a coherent feature called a 'river plume' that moved in different patterns. Flooding impacts are increasing, but the movement of contaminants in river plumes following extreme events is not well understood. We used a numerical ocean model to simulate the Cape Fear River plume carrying a dye representing contaminants following Hurricane Florence. The plume initially traveled west hugging the coast due to Earth's rotation, alternately spreading east or offshore due to changes in the direction of winds blowing on the ocean. The river plume patterns led to a delayed onset and long duration of contaminants affecting beaches far down the coast, days to weeks after the storm. We also simulated several scenarios with different river discharge and winds. This information could help guide managers on when to perform water quality sampling and issue swimming or shellfishing advisories.

AB  - Understanding the dynamics that drive human-wildlife conflict and identifying potential mitigation solutions requires understanding the spatial patterns of conflict. The juxtaposition of ecological preservation and economic growth has led to increased conflicts between humans and Asian elephants Elephas maximus in the Rajaji-Corbett landscape of Uttarakhand, India, where the conversion of elephant habitat to agricultural land have increased over the last several decades. We investigated the predictors influencing household-level human-elephant conflicts (HECs) using binomial Generalized Linear Models (GLMs) collected from semi-structured questionnaire-based surveys of 266 households in the human-wildlife interface next to protected areas. Further, we modelled the landscape predictors that influence the spatial distribution of HECs by collecting occurrence data of HECs in 25 km(2) grid units (N = 1473 grids) using Maxent software. We discovered that HECs are directly influenced by the diversity of major and minor crops planted and the proximity to agricultural land (conflicts decreased with increasing distance from the agricultural land). We also observed that the probability of HECs decreased with increasing elevation, increase in road networks, and with increasing slope in the study area; while HECs increased with increase in human population. We discovered that nearly one-fifth of areas sampled (3606.87 km(2)) in the Rajaji-Corbett landscape were at high risk of HEC, especially flat, agrarian areas where most people reside. Farmers in the susceptible risk areas identified by our study could lessen the likelihood of crop damage and HEC incidents by cultivating highly profitable alternative crops that are less attractive to elephants. Additionally, implementing mobile-based Early Warning System in high HEC hotspot areas could mitigate crop raiding and potentially reduce the occurrence of HECs. The findings of our study can assist policymakers and park management in designing landscape-scale human-wildlife conflict mitigation strategies tailored to identified conflict hotspots.

AB  - The study was aimed at evaluating the concentration of serum thyroid hormones and diurnal trends in rectal and body surface temperatures in neonatal buck-kids and doelings. Rectal and body surface (eye, head and trunk) temperatures as well as the differences between rectal and surface (DBRS) temperatures were determined in 39 kids, having equal number of Red Sokoto, Sahel and West African Dwarf (WAD) goats during daytime nadir (07:00 h) and zenith (13:00 h) in ambient temperatures. All variables and blood samples were obtained from birth to Day 20, post-natal. Results revealed significantly (P < 0.05) lower values of morning and afternoon rectal temperatures at birth with subsequent post-natal increase, attaining higher stable values after Day 2. Morning head surface temperature decreased significantly after birth, whereas, DBRS temperatures were lower at birth and increased in subsequent days. From birth, diurnality was distinct (P < 0.05) in all body surface and DBRS temperatures, while, diurnality in rectal temperature was only observed on Days 1-8 (P < 0.05). All body temperatures (rectal, eye, head and trunk) recorded during the afternoon hours in the late neonatal life (Days 10-20) were significantly higher in WAD than Red Sokoto and Sahel kids. Buck-kids had higher (P < 0.05) values of morning rectal temperature than doelings. Circulating concentration of tri-iodothyronine was significantly lower in Sahel than Red Sokoto and WAD goat kids, whereas, the values of thyroxin were lower (P < 0.05) in Red Sokoto than Sahel and WAD kids. Similarly, lower (P < 0.05) values of tri-iodothyronine were recorded in buck -kids, while a higher (P < 0.05) level of thyroxin was recorded in doelings. In conclusion, neonatal adjustment in body temperatures of tropical breeds was influenced by thyroid hormone concentration, and the feeble cutaneous thermoregulation atbirth, contributed significantly to heat loss and gain during the morning and afternoon hours, respectively.

AB  - The predation of livestock by gray wolf (Canis lupus; hereafter, wolf) is a problem throughout eastern Europe and poses a threat to sustainable pasture-based livestock production in some areas. In Croatia, farmers have alarmed the public with news of frequent wolf attacks in the last decade, and wolves, as protected animals, are perceived as a pest and a threat. The aim of this study was to analyze and present the frequency of attacks and killed/injured domestic animals in Croatia. During the ten-year period (2010-2020), 13,359 attack events were reported, where it was determined, with certainty, that the attack was by the wolf. In these attacks, 19,111 domestic animals were killed and 4634 were injured. Predation events occurred predominantly (92.71%) in three counties located in southern Croatia (sub-Mediterranean Croatia), whose total area is 11,170 km(2) (19.74% of the total area of Croatia). The most frequently killed species were sheep (64.78% of all killed animals), which was followed by goats (19.28%) and cattle (9.59%). The highest frequency of attacks and animals killed was recorded in the summer followed by spring and autumn, and the lowest was in winter. The majority of attacks (79.57%) occurred in the morning and during the day. The animal with the highest average number killed per attack was sheep (1.64), which was followed by goats (1.38), cattle (0.99), horses (0.94), donkeys (0.95), and guardian dogs (0.92). During the studied period, in the three counties with the most frequent attacks, 11.72% of the average goat population, 6.34% of the cattle population, and 5.61% of the sheep population were killed. Wolf predation in sub-Mediterranean Croatia presents a threat to the population of domestic ruminants dominantly kept in pastoral livestock systems, and additional efforts need to be made to achieve co-existence between the wolf population and farmers.

AB  - Despite the increasing number of species assessed for extinction risk by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) (163,040 species as of 2024), only about 1 in 1,000 have been downlisted due to genuine population improvement. Although this rare conservation achievement has been widely celebrated in several recent cases, some other downlisting decisions have met with controversy. A primary role of the IUCN is to assess extinction risk. In this role, it must maintain its independence and not be influenced by the public outcry that may occur when a high-profile species is downlisted, even if well-established conservation programs may be disrupted or abandoned as a result. We explored the potential positive and negative consequences of downlisting for conservation efforts through case studies of the giant panda (Ailuropoda melanoleuca), red-crowned crane (Grus japonensis), saiga antelope (Saiga tatarica), and black-faced spoonbill (Platalea minor), which has recently been proposed for downlisting. Although downlisting can enable more effective use of limited resources, these cases highlight potential risks, including weakened legal backing, diversion of resources away from the species, and declining public and political support. The relatively unquestioned downlisting of the saiga antelope illustrates how early and inclusive engagement of local experts, assessors, donors, and other stakeholders can help ensure that decisions are effectively communicated and implemented without jeopardizing species recovery. The IUCN Green Status of Species assessment is a complementary tool to the IUCN Red List and offers a useful measure of conservation progress, which can help decision makers ensure that downlisting does not undermine long-term conservation efforts.

AB  - With the establishment of the action plan for the goal of "carbon peaking and carbon neutrality", how to achieve high-quality agricultural development, help implement the construction of the green Longjiang River, reduce agricultural carbon emissions, and increase the level of agricultural carbon sink is a key problem that must be solved for Heilongjiang Province to achieve the goal of "double carbon". This article uses the Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) method to estimate the carbon emissions of animal husbandry in Heilongjiang Province and 13 cities from 2000 to 2020. By constructing the Tapio decoupling model, Kaya identity, and the LMDI model, the relationship between animal husbandry economy and carbon emissions in Heilongjiang Province and the driving factors affecting animal husbandry carbon emissions are explored. The results indicate that: (1) From 2000 to 2020, the carbon emissions of animal husbandry in Heilongjiang Province showed an overall slightly upward trend. From the perspective of various emission links, the highest carbon emissions are from the gastrointestinal fermentation environment (42.49%), with beef cattle, cows, and live pigs being the main livestock and poultry in Heilongjiang Province with carbon emissions. (2) The Tapio decoupling model results indicated that from 2000 to 2020, the relationship between the economic development of animal husbandry in Heilongjiang Province and carbon emissions was mainly characterized by weak decoupling. (3) The main driving force behind the continuous increase in carbon emissions from animal husbandry in Heilongjiang Province is the changing factors of agricultural population returns and changes in the production structure of animal husbandry; The driving factors that suppress the increase in carbon emissions from animal husbandry in Heilongjiang Province are changes in animal husbandry production efficiency, population and urban development levels, and population mobility factors. Finally, based on the decoupling effect status and driving factors of decomposition between Heilongjiang Province and its various cities, it is recommended to implement countermeasures and suggestions for the transformation of animal husbandry in the province towards green and low carbon at the macro level. This can be achieved through the adoption of sustainable and eco-friendly practices such as the use of renewable energy sources and the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. Additionally, promoting research and development in sustainable agriculture and animal husbandry can also contribute to the transformation towards a more environmentally friendly industry.

AB  - Sustainable management approaches should be considered to meet gaps between soybean N demand and biological N fixation in poor nutrient soils. Field studies were laid out in 2015 and 2016 to determine the effect of integrated fertilizer systems and zeolite application on two cultivars of soybean. The experiment design was randomized complete block design with factorial arrangement of treatments and three replications. Treatments comprised of two soybean cultivars (C) (M7 and M9), five fertilization systems (F1, 100% sheep manure; F2, 100% urea; F3, 50%, urea + 50% sheep manure; F4, 75% urea + 25% sheep manure and F5, 25% urea + 75% sheep manure), and four zeolite rates (Z1: 0 Mg ha(-1) zeolite application (control) Z2: 4 Mg ha(-1), Z3: 8 Mg ha(-1), Z4: 12 Mg ha(-1)). Soybean seed yield and yield components were considerably enhanced by applying integrated treatments (F3-F5), but the impact of their application was potentiated by increasing the level of applied zeolite. Increasing the zeolite from 0 to 12 Mg ha(-1) increased M7 seed yield by 55% and 73% in F2 and F4 treatments, respectively. Fertilizer systems did not affect oil content, even though cultivar xyear interaction affected this trait. According to the quadratic model, the maximum seed protein was achieved with the application of 8.4 Mg zeolite ha(-1). Nitrogen fertilizer led to a low oil yield and a high protein yield while zeolite improved both traits. The study demonstrates that amending soil by these natural fertilizers manures could be a promising strategy to improve soybean yield and quality.

AB  - Theca cells (TCs) play an important role in follicular development and atresia. TCs synthesize androgens that act as substrate for granulosa cells aromatization to estrogens needed for follicular growth. However, the effects of hypoxia on steroidogenesis in buffalo TCs remain unclear. In the present study, the impacts of hypoxic conditions (5% oxygen) on androgen synthesis in buffalo TCs were examined. The results showed that hypoxia improved both the expression levels of androgen synthesis-related genes (CYP11A1, CYP17A1, and 3 beta-HSD) and the secretion levels of testosterone in buffalo TCs. Hypoxic conditions promoted the sensitivity of buffalo TCs to LH. Furthermore, inhibition of PI3K/AKT signaling pathway reduced both the expression levels of androgen synthesis-related genes (CYP11A1, CYP17A1, and 3 beta-HSD) and the secretion levels of testosterone in hypoxia-cultured buffalo TCs. Besides, inhibition of PI3K/AKT signaling pathway lowered the sensitivity of buffalo TCs to LH under hypoxic conditions.

AB  - Conservation strategies are hindered by a lack of accurate maps of important habitat for many wildlife species, but especially for species inhabiting managed forest landscapes. Prioritizing restoration efforts on Alaska's Tongass National Forest from past extensive clearcut logging is extremely challenging given the difficulty in accurately mapping its remote, rugged temperate rainforest landscapes. We tested the application of airborne light detection and ranging (LiDAR) technology to build a winter habitat model for Sitka black-tailed deer (Odocoileus hemionus sitkensis), the primary herbivore in the coastal temperate rainforest. We analyzed the importance of geomorphometric and forest structure characteristics as predictors of deer winter habitat selection using Random Forest applied to a 3-year GPS relocation dataset collected from 40 adult female deer. The LiDARbased habitat model had a predictive performance of 94% (Out-of-bag error = 6%), a 10% lower model error compared to air-photo interpreted polygons and modeled plot data. Random Forest also outperformed analogous resource selection function models based on a comprehensive k-fold cross-validation. Deer habitat selection patterns in the LiDAR-based model were nonlinear across geomorphometric and forest structure predictive variables, and generally supported existing studies of deer habitat selection. Besides improving deer conservation and management on the Tongass National Forest, our approach could greatly enhance the accuracy and resolution of habitat maps used for conservation and restoration planning across large managed forest landscapes.

AB  - BackgroundOur research is the first to explore the ultrastructural features of the lingual papillary system of Arab Zebu cattle, highlighting their Chadian environmental adaptations.ResultsThere were two types of papillary systems: gustatory (fungiform and circumvallate) and mechanical (filiform, conical, and lentiform). The dorsal surface of the apex and rostral parts of the body had well-developed filiform papillae, whereas the tip's surface had mucosal folds, tubercles, and few filiform papillae. The torus lingua's dorsal surface displayed few lentiform papillae, while two conical papillae subtypes and numerous circumvallate papillae were present on its lateral surfaces. A slight median ridge on the dorsal surface of the body had not been described previously. Six filiform papillae subtypes were identified: long and rod-like on the tip; tongue-like and elongated on the lateral area of the apex and body; transient conical and leaf-like on the median line. The accessory processes were: one pair (on long, tongue-like, and transient conical), two pairs (on leaf-like and elongated), and four pairs on the large conical papillae. The two fungiform papillae subtypes were surrounded by a groove and had taste pores (3-5 on the oval and 5-9 on the round papillae). The U-shaped annular bad were observed around the ovoid circumvallate papillae, and the circular bad were observed around the round ones. The circumvallate had taste pores (8-14 on the round's dorsal and lateral surfaces and 6-10 on the ovoid's lateral surface).ConclusionThe papillary system's regional divergence was specialized for its harsh and semi-harsh diet.

AB  - The behavioral dynamics underlying the expansion of Homo sapiens into Europe remains a crucial topic in human evolution. Owing to poor bone preservation, past studies have strongly focused on the Initial Upper Paleolithic (IUP) stone tool record. Recent excavations and extensive radiocarbon dating at Bacho Kiro Cave (Bulgaria) pushed back the arrival of IUP H. sapiens into Europe to ca. 45,000 years ago. This site has exceptional bone preservation, and we present the study of 7431 faunal remains from across two IUP layers (I and J) and one Middle Paleolithic layer (K). We identified a shift in site use and occupation intensity through time, marked by increased find density and human modifications in Layer I. Alongside a decrease in carnivore presence and seasonality data demonstrating human presence in all seasons, this indicates a more frequent or prolonged occupation of the site by IUP groups. Contrarily, the dietary focus across the IUP and Middle Paleolithic layers is similar, centered on the exploitation of species from a range of habitats including Bos/Bison, Cervidae, Equidae, and Caprinae. While body parts of large herbivores were selectively transported into the site, the bear remains suggest that these animals died in the cave itself. A distinct aspect of the IUP occupation is an increase in carnivore remains with human modifications, including these cave bears but also smaller taxa (e.g., Canis lupus, Vulpes vulpes). This can be correlated with their exploitation for pendants, and potentially for skins and furs. At a broader scale, we identified similarities in subsistence behavior across IUP sites in Europe and western Asia. It appears that the first IUP occupations were less intense with find densities and human modifications increasing in succeeding IUP layers. Moreover, the exploitation of small game appears to be limited across IUP sites, while carnivore exploitation seems a recurrent strategy. (C) 2021 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Molecular analysis is a powerful tool for assessing and developing conservation strategies for endangered species. Elasmobranchs comprise one of the most threatened groups of vertebrates, with about one-third of the species subject to some degree of threat. This is the case for Pseudobatos horkelii, the Brazilian guitarfish, which has suffered severe population reductions (>80%) in recent decades, mainly through coastal overfishing. Understanding the genetic diversity of this species is paramount to applying adequate management and conservation strategies.In this context, the present study evaluated the genetic diversity of P. horkelii, employing single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) nuclear markers obtained by double-digest restriction site-associated DNA sequencing (ddRADseq). Samples collected in three areas along the Brazilian Coast (Rio de Janeiro, Sao Paulo, and Rio Grande do Sul) provided an average of 1,565,339 reads and 2,846 SNPs.The results indicate the presence of at least two genetically distinct populations along the Brazilian Coast, with molecular diversity differences noted among clusters. The heterozygosity excess observed in all populations is likely the result of a bottleneck, probably resulting from overfishing and habitat fragmentation. Moreover, the upwelling phenomenon in Cabo Frio, in the state of Rio de Janeiro, may have a significant influence over the observed genetic structure.The gene flow between the clusters was estimated and was noted as asymmetric between the populations studied. The observed patterns may be the result of the combination of biological characteristics and overfishing pressure in the past decades. The evidence of structured populations presenting genetic diversity differences provides insightful information for the development of stock management and conservation strategies for the Brazilian guitarfish.

AB  - Elasmobranchii are relatively well-studied. However, numerous phylogenetic uncertainties about their relationships remain. Here, we revisit the phylogenetic evidence based on a detailed morphological re-evaluation of all the major extant batomorph clades (skates and rays), including several holomorphic fossil taxa from the Palaeozoic, Mesozoic and Cenozoic, and an extensive outgroup sampling, which includes sharks, chimaeras and several other fossil chondrichthyans. The parsimony and maximum-likelihood analyses found more resolved but contrasting topologies, with the Bayesian inference tree neither supporting nor disfavouring any of them. Overall, the analyses result in similar clade compositions and topologies, with the Jurassic batomorphs forming the sister clade to all the other batomorphs, whilst all the Cretaceous batomorphs are nested within the remaining main clades. The disparate arrangements recovered under the different criteria suggest that a detailed study of Jurassic taxa is of utmost importance to present a more consistent topology in the deeper nodes, as issues continue to be present when analysing those clades previously recognized only by molecular analyses (e.g., Rhinopristiformes and Torpediniformes). The consistent placement of fossil taxa within specific groups by the different phylogenetic criteria is promising and indicates that the inclusion of more fossil taxa in the present matrix will likely not cause loss of resolution, therefore suggesting that a strong phylogenetic signal can be recovered from fossil taxa.

AB  - The lemurs of Madagascar include numerous species characterized by folivory across several families. Many extant lemuriform folivores exist in sympatry in Madagascar's remaining forests. These species avoid feeding competition by adopting different dietary strategies within folivory, reflected in behavioral, morphological, and microbiota diversity across species. These conditions make lemurs an ideal study system for understanding adaptation to leaf-eating. Most folivorous lemurs are also highly endangered. The significance of folivory for conservation outlook is complex. Though generalist folivores may be relatively well equipped to survive habitat disturbance, specialist folivores occupying narrow dietary niches may be less resilient. Characterizing the genetic bases of adaptation to folivory across species and lineages can provide insights into their differential physiology and potential to resist habitat change. We recently reported accelerated genetic change in RNASE1, a gene encoding an enzyme (RNase 1) involved in molecular adaptation in mammalian folivores, including various monkeys and sifakas (genus Propithecus; family Indriidae). Here, we sought to assess whether other lemurs, including phylogenetically and ecologically diverse folivores, might show parallel adaptive change in RNASE1 that could underlie a capacity for efficient folivory. We characterized RNASE1 in 21 lemur species representing all five families and members of the three extant folivorous lineages: (1) bamboo lemurs (family Lemuridae), (2) sportive lemurs (family Lepilemuridae), and (3) indriids (family Indriidae). We found pervasive sequence change in RNASE1 across all indriids, a d(N)/d(S) value > 3 in this clade, and evidence for shared change in isoelectric point, indicating altered enzymatic function. Sportive and bamboo lemurs, in contrast, showed more modest sequence change. The greater change in indriids may reflect a shared strategy emphasizing complex gut morphology and microbiota to facilitate folivory. This case study illustrates how genetic analysis may reveal differences in functional traits that could influence species' ecology and, in turn, their resilience to habitat change. Moreover, our results support the body of work demonstrating that not all primate folivores are built the same and reiterate the need to avoid generalizations about dietary guild in considering conservation outlook, particularly in lemurs where such diversity in folivory has probably led to extensive specialization via niche partitioning.

AB  - Simple Summary
   In smallholder communal farming systems, Nguni people slaughter goats using indigenous methods which have cultural and spiritual significance to them. Nguni wethers were slaughtered using the transverse neck incision (TNI), suprasternal notch (SNP) and under the shoulder blade at the chest floor point of elbow piercing (CFP) to the direction of the heart to assess meat physico-chemical characteristics parameters. Nguni wethers slaughtered with the TNI and CFP methods produced meat with an acceptable appearance similar to goats slaughtered with the conventional standard procedures.
   To improve goat meat quality in rural communities, it is important to evaluate the effects of indigenous slaughter methods used by resource-limited farmers when performing traditional ceremonies on the meat physico-chemical characteristics. The current study assessed the effects of the meat physico-chemical characteristics of Nguni goats slaughtered with the transverse neck incision (TNI), suprasternal notch piercing (SNP) and the under shoulder blade piercing at the chest floor point of elbow (CFP) to the direction of the heart methods. Thirty Nguni weathers were randomly assigned to three slaughter treatments (10 goats/treatment). Musculus longissimus thoracis et lumborum (LTL) was sampled at post-mortem for physico-chemical characteristic measurements. Meat from wethers slaughtered with the SNP method had greater ultimate pH values than meat from wethers slaughtered with TNI and CFP slaughter methods. Wethers slaughtered with the SNP method had lower meat redness (a*), yellowness (b*), and chroma (C*) values than those slaughtered with TNI and CFP slaughter methods. Goat slaughter method did not affect meat drip loss, water holding capacity, cooking loss and shear force. Overall, Nguni wethers slaughtered with the TNI and CFP methods produced chevon with fresher meat appearance than those slaughtered using the SNP method.

AB  - The prediction of methane (CH4) concentration is important for pig farming due to its environmental impact on pigs and farm workers. This study examined the utilization of machine learning algorithms, specifically multiple linear regression (MLR), XGBoost regression (XGB), and random forest regression (RFR), to predict CH4 concentrations in pig barns during the growing-finishing stage of pigs. The dataset included five key input biophysical variables: feed intake (FI), pig mass (MP), carbon dioxide (CO2) levels, temperature (T), and relative humidity (RH). Data was collected from three experimental pig barns during 2022 and 2023 to train and test the machine learning models. Among the three machine learning models, the RFR consistently outperformed both MLR and XGB in predicting CH4 concentrations. The results demonstrated better performance by the RFR model in testing (R-2 > 0.81), with improvements in R-2 of up to 1.92% and 10.46%, as well as decreases in RMSE of up to 5.74% and 20.51%, compared to the XGB and MLR across the three input datasets. In terms of stability, MLR exhibited the maximum stability, followed by RFR and XGB. Sensitivity analysis found FI to be the most influential input variable for CH4 concentration prediction, with the impact ranking being FI > MP > CO2 > T > RH. This study emphasized the potential of machine learning models, particularly RFR, in predicting CH4 concentrations using relevant input variables. These findings enhance understanding of CH4 concentration, providing useful insights into pig production and environmental management.

AB  - Livestock feces with antimicrobial resistant bacteria reaches the farm floor, manure pit, farm land and wider environment by run off and aerosolization. Little research has been done on the role of dust in the spread of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) in farms. Concentrations and potential determinants of antimicrobial resistance genes (ARGs) in farm dust are at present not known. Therefore in this study absolute ARG levels, representing the levels people and animals might be exposed to, and relative abundances of ARGs, representing the levels in the bacterial population, were quantified in airborne farm dust using qPCR. Four ARGs were determined in 947 freshly settled farm dust samples, captured with electrostatic dustfall collectors (EDCs), from 174 poultry (broiler) and 159 pig farms across nine European countries. By using linear mixed modeling, associations with fecal ARG levels, antimicrobial use (AMU) and farm and animal related parameters were determined. Results show similar relative abundances in farm dust as in feces and a significant positive association (ranging between 0.21 and 0.82) between the two reservoirs. AMU in pigs was positively associated with ARG abundances in dust from the same stable. Higher biosecurity standards were associated with lower relative ARG abundances in poultry and higher relative ARG abundances in pigs. Lower absolute ARG levels in dust were driven by, among others, summer season and certain bedding materials for poultry, and lower animal density and summer season for pigs. This study indicates different pathways that contribute to shaping the dust resistome in livestock farms, related to dust generation, or affecting the bacterial microbiome. Farm dust is a large reservoir of ARGs from which transmission to bacteria in other reservoirs can possibly occur. The identified determinants of ARG abundances in farm dust can guide future research and potentially farm management policy.

AB  - Aim Macroecological studies that require habitat suitability data for many species often derive this information from expert opinion. However, expert-based information is inherently subjective and thus prone to errors. The increasing availability of GPS tracking data offers opportunities to evaluate and supplement expert-based information with detailed empirical evidence. Here, we compared expert-based habitat suitability information from the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) with habitat suitability information derived from GPS-tracking data of 1,498 individuals from 49 mammal species. Location Worldwide. Time period 1998-2021. Major taxa studied Forty-nine terrestrial mammal species. Methods Using GPS data, we estimated two measures of habitat suitability for each individual animal: proportional habitat use (proportion of GPS locations within a habitat type), and selection ratio (habitat use relative to its availability). For each individual we then evaluated whether the GPS-based habitat suitability measures were in agreement with the IUCN data. To that end, we calculated the probability that the ranking of empirical habitat suitability measures was in agreement with IUCN's classification into suitable, marginal and unsuitable habitat types. Results IUCN habitat suitability data were in accordance with the GPS data (> 95% probability of agreement) for 33 out of 49 species based on proportional habitat use estimates and for 25 out of 49 species based on selection ratios. In addition, 37 and 34 species had a > 50% probability of agreement based on proportional habitat use and selection ratios, respectively. Main conclusions We show how GPS-tracking data can be used to evaluate IUCN habitat suitability data. Our findings indicate that for the majority of species included in this study, it is appropriate to use IUCN habitat suitability data in macroecological studies. Furthermore, we show that GPS-tracking data can be used to identify and prioritize species and habitat types for re-evaluation of IUCN habitat suitability data.

AB  - The genome of the osmophilic Aspergillus wentii, unlike that of the osmotolerant Aspergillus nidulans, contains only the gfdA, but not the gfdB, glycerol 3-phosphate dehydrogenase gene. Here, we studied transcriptomic changes of A. nidulans (reference strain and Delta gfdB gene deletion mutant) and A. wentii (reference strain and An-gfdB expressing mutant) elicited by high osmolarity. A. nidulans showed a canonic hyperosmotic stress response characterized by the upregulation of the trehalose and glycerol metabolism genes (including gfdB), as well as the genes of the high-osmolarity glycerol (HOG) map kinase pathway. The deletion of gfdB caused only negligible alterations in the transcriptome, suggesting that the glycerol metabolism was flexible enough to compensate for the missing GfdB activity in this species. A. wentii responded differently to increased osmolarity than did A. nidulans, e.g., the bulk upregulation of the glycerol and trehalose metabolism genes, along with the HOG pathway genes, was not detected. The expression of An-gfdB in A. wentii did not abolish osmophily, but it reduced growth and caused much bigger alterations in the transcriptome than did the missing gfdB gene in A. nidulans. Flexible glycerol metabolism and hence, two differently regulated gfd genes, may be more beneficial for osmotolerant (living under changing osmolarity) than for osmophilic (living under constantly high osmolarity) species.

AB  - Aims Phyllosphere microbes are closely linked to plant health and are important for the maintenance of host community stability. Tea plants (Camellia sinen-sis) can synthesize abundant secondary metabolites (SMs), however, it is unclear how they affect tea plant phyllosphere homeostasis. Methods We investigated the effects of secondary metabolites of two tea plant cultivars (Longjing43 and Zhongcha108) that have different levels of resistance to anthracnose on the composition, function, assembly and network of phyllosphere fungi. Results We found that the phyllosphere fungal compositions of Longjing43 and Zhongcha108 were distinct, with certain fungal pathogens significantly enriched in the susceptible cultivar Longjing43 (e.g., Fusarium), which had a higher relative abundance of phytopathogenic functional groups. In addition, the phyllosphere fungal community assembly of the resistant cultivar Zhongcha108 with a higher habitat niche breadth was more influenced by stochastic processes. More importantly, the fungal network of Zhongcha108 exhibited higher complexity and stability, indicating a more resilient network structure. Random forest and partial least squares path models revealed that secondary metabolites, fungal community diversity, composition and function essentially determined network stability. (-)-Epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG) and caffeine (CAF) were the most important predictors of phyllosphere fungal network stability in 2018 and 2019, respectively. Rare fungal taxa were particularly important in maintaining phyl-losphere homeostasis. Conclusions Our study suggests that secondary metabolites may mediate phyllosphere fungal home-ostasis in tea plants. These findings highlight the importance of secondary metabolites in shaping the phyllosphere fungal community and provide ideas for regulating plant resistance to pathogenic fungi.

AB  - Simple Summary Fecundity is an important economic trait of sheep that directly affects their economic and productive efficiency. Our study aimed to identify single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) loci associated with sheep puberty or litter size which could be used in future breeding programs to improve fertility. We obtained one SNP on GNAQ gene (NC_040253.1: g.62677376G > A), which was associated with litter size in Cele Black sheep. Perhaps this SNP could be a criterion to screen polytocous sheep. Fecundity is an important economic trait in sheep that directly affects their economic and productive efficiency. Our study aimed to identify SNP loci associated with sheep puberty or litter size which could be used in future breeding programs to improve fertility. Genomic DNA was obtained from Hetian and Cele Black sheep breeds and used for reduced-representation genome sequencing to identify SNP loci associated with pubertal initiation and litter size. Selective signatures analysis was performed based on the fixation index and nucleotide diversity, followed by pathway analysis of the genes contained in the selected regions. The selected SNP loci in the genes associated with pubertal initiation and litter size were validated using both sheep breeds. In total, 384,718 high quality SNPs were obtained and 376 genes were selected. Functional annotation of genes and enrichment analysis identified 12 genes associated with pubertal initiation and 11 genes associated with litter size. SNP locus validation showed that two SNP on PAK1 and four on ADCY1 may be associated with pubertal initiation, and one SNP on GNAQ gene (NC_040253.1: g.62677376G > A) was associated with litter size in Cele Black sheep. Our results provide new theoretical support for sheep breeding.

AB  - The Turopolje pig is a fatty-type pig breed created during the Middle Ages in the Turopolje region in Central Croatia. Although the population of the Turopolje pig is stable today, this breed is still one of the endangered breeds that are severely threatened by inbreeding. The aim of this work was to evaluate the genetic diversity parameters of the recent Turopolje pig population in Croatia and to consider mating strategies to limit the increase in inbreeding in the population using algorithms within an optimal contribution selection frame. The pedigree of 1155 individuals was analysed. In addition to the basic pedigree structure, the following population parameters were analysed: average coefficient of inbreeding; mean rate of increase in coancestry; increase in coancestry between any individuals; effective population size. Based on obtained parameters, mating optimization using estimated kinship between candidates in several scenarios was carried out, restricting maximal kinship between candidates on a minimal possible value 0.07, as the least possible level of kinship, candidates on a value of 0.10, and candidates on a value of 0.25. The average inbreeding coefficient (F) in the population was 0.03, while the average F of inbred animals was 0.10. The effective population size obtained from pedigrees based on the increase in coancestry (0.17) was 29.14. Mating plans were created from 5 active boars and 120 sows in different scenarios with constraint on the level of kinship between candidates. The least possible level of kinship was 0.07, and no available solutions were under this level. With the increase in the allowed kinship between candidates, the level of inbreeding increased from 0.01 to 0.06 in the next generation. Under practical conditions, mating between ideal individuals in local pig populations is not always possible, and the use of optimisation algorithms allows alternative mating within existing populations to be considered. Finally, this approach opens up the possibility of potentially improving sustainable breeding through selection by considering breeding values for economically important traits. This approach can help to differentiate the Turopolje pig breed from other commercial and local breeds, e.g., for meat quality traits.

   Aspen sapling recruitment increased as browsing by elk decreased, following the 1995-96 reintroduction of wolves in Yellowstone National Park. The photos show aspen stands with various levels of recovery: (a) no young aspen exceeded 200 cm in height, an indicator of potential recruitment, (b) many young aspen exceeded 200 cm, and (c) a group of young aspen were much taller than the rest in the stand. Two different sampling methods agreed in the first two stands, but not in the third stand where growth was patchy. We address claims by Brice et al. (2021) that previous studies exaggerated recent aspen recovery. We conclude that their results actually supported previous work showing a trophic cascade benefiting aspen.image

AB  - In "The Effects of Plant Compensatory Regrowth and Induced Resistance on Herbivore Population Dynamics," which appeared in The American Naturalist in 2016, Stieha et al. argued that overcompensatory regrowth of plant tissues lost to herbivory ("overcompensation") promotes cyclic herbivore outbreaks. In contrast, they concluded that partial regrowth ("tolerance") stabilizes herbivore dynamics, preventing outbreaks. These conclusions were based on a comparison between two plant-herbivore models that differed in two properties: (1) whether biomass could ever be higher after herbivory and regrowth than before herbivory (i.e., is overcompensatory regrowth possible?) and (2) how much herbivory the plants could withstand before only being able to partially compensate for losses (for overcompensating plants, there was a threshold herbivory level above which this occurred, whereas tolerant plants always showed partial compensation). While Stieha et al. supposed that difference 1 was responsible for the increased propensity for outbreaks in their overcompensation model, we show here that, in fact, difference 2 is responsible. Thus, we conclude that Stieha et al.'s results about "overcompensating" plants apply more broadly: the risk of herbivore outbreaks is elevated whenever plants with low-enough herbivore loads can perfectly compensate or overcompensate for losses to herbivory.

AB  - The ammonium oxidation process is a critical step in the nitrogen cycle during aerobic composting, affecting the efficiency of nitrogen transformation and the quality of the compost. This study employed quantitative PCR and high-throughput sequencing to investigate the effects of different concentrations of Manno-oligosaccharides (MOS) (0.1 %, 0.5 %, 1.0 %, and 2.0 %) on nitrogen dynamics and ammonia-oxidizing microbial communities in composting cattle manure and straw, with a control. The results indicated that different concentrations of MOS increased the peak temperatures during the thermophilic stage of composting to above 60 degrees C, higher than that of the CK (57.4 degrees C), while ensuring that all treatments met the requirements for harmless disposal. Particularly, the germination index (GI) of the 0.5 % manno-oligosaccharide treatment reached 109.3 %, demonstrating excellent treatment efficacy. The 0.5 % manno-oligosaccharide treatment significantly increased the NO3--N content in compost (P < 0.05). The copy number of AOB amoA gene in the M0.5 and M1 treatments during the compost maturation stage was significantly higher than that in other treatments. Norank_p_environmental_samples and Nitrosomonas are the dominant microorganisms driving ammonia oxidation in the compost. Especially in the treatment with 0.5 % MOS, they play a crucial role in the immobilization of ammonia nitrogen. Structural equation modeling (SEM) analysis showed a significant positive correlation between AOB amoA genes and NO3--N in the 0.5 % oligosaccharide treatment, indicating effective promotion of nitrogen conversion by ammonia-oxidizing bacteria in the compost. These findings highlight the potential of manno-oligosaccharide as a biological modifier to improve composting efficiency and nitrogen management.

AB  - Animals Raised in the Ukraine Colonization Community of Palmital, Parana State, Brazil. Although Brazil is one of the world's major cattle producers and has rich social, ethnic, and biological diversity, ethnoveterinary studies are rare in Southern Brazil. Knowledge of plant use by farmers in the rural areas of the Ukrainian colony of Palmital, southern Brazil, can contribute to understanding the relationships among plants, smallholder farmers, and their livestock. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with non-random sampling following the "snowball" method. The information collected included local plant names, plant parts used, mode of preparation, route of administration, domestic animal species, and diseases requiring treatment. The informants were encouraged to show the plants, which were collected, identified, and stored. The informant consensus factor (ICF) and the use value (UV) were calculated. Thirty women and 20 men reported a total of 45 native and introduced plant species belonging to 29 families that are used for ethnoveterinary practices, mostly for cattle and goats, with the highest ICF for mastitis and antiparasitic treatments. Cattle are the most important livestock species bred in the community; therefore, most plant treatments were for cattle health problems. Similar studies on European immigrant communities in Brazil are lacking and could be a valuable source of information about how immigrant culture translate into local knowledge of veterinary medicinal plants.

AB  - Rodent diversification is associated with a large diversity of species-specific social vocalizations generated by two distinct laryngeal sound production mechanisms: whistling and airflow-induced vocal fold vibration. Understanding the relative importance of each modality to context-dependent acoustic interactions requires comparative analyses among closely related species. In this study, we used light gas experiments, acoustic analyses and laryngeal morphometrics to identify the distribution of the two mechanisms among six species of deer mice (Peromyscus spp.). We found that high frequency vocalizations (simple and complex sweeps) produced in close-distance contexts were generated by a whistle mechanism. In contrast, lower frequency sustained vocalizations (SVs) used in longer distance communication were produced by airflow-induced vocal fold vibrations. Pup isolation calls, which resemble adult SVs, were also produced by airflow-induced vocal fold vibrations. Nonlinear phenomena (NLP) were common in adult SVs and pup isolation calls, suggesting irregular vocal fold vibration characteristics. Both vocal production mechanisms were facilitated by a characteristic laryngeal morphology, including a two-layered vocal fold lamina propria, small vocal membrane-like extensions on the free edge of the vocal fold, and a singular ventral laryngeal air pocket known as the ventral pouch. The size and composition of vocal folds (rather than total laryngeal size) appears to contribute to species-specific acoustic properties. Our findings suggest that dual modes of sound production are more widespread among rodents than previously appreciated. Additionally, the common occurrence of NLP highlights the nonlinearity of the vocal apparatus, whereby small changes in anatomy or physiology trigger large changes in behavior. Finally, consistency in mechanisms of sound production used by neonates and adults underscores the importance of considering vocal ontogeny in the diversification of species-specific acoustic signals.

AB  - Sea-level rise and adverse environmental conditions (e.g., drought, herbivory, and altered sedimentation and hydrology) stress coastal salt marsh vegetation, leading to reduced productivity, conversion to open water, and subsequent marsh loss. Potential for loss may vary spatially within a single marsh creek system, as well as at the larger landscape-scale level across creek systems. Spatial patterns of plant stress that may signal future loss could inform management and conservation strategies. To inform predictions of marsh loss, in a field study in 12 Juncus roemerianus marshes on Florida's Big Bend, we observed spatial patterns of plant stress and potential environmental drivers (1) within individual creek systems and (2) across a region of multiple creek systems. Juncus stress was higher at the creek margin (lower belowground biomass production and higher proline concentrations, K+ and Na+ ion levels, and relative stem water content) where soil salinity was higher, and soil nutrients were lower. Patterns were not predicted by elevation alone, and other indicators did not similarly vary within creeks, but differed between creek systems, which often was explained by proximity to large freshwater inputs. Management strategies that account for these observed within- and between-creek patterns of stress, which represent symptoms that likely precede conversion to open water, may best increase marsh persistence. This uniquely comprehensive data set (15 Juncus responses and 8 environmental variables across 12 marshes) highlights the challenge of determining stress patterns across a broad region and the necessary monitoring to generate information needed to spatially prioritize management efforts to ameliorate marsh loss.

AB  - Gravity may exert species-specific effects on quadrupedal vasoreactivity, reflecting variations in the vertical displacement of the cardiocranial axis from the dorsal plane. Deer show markedly displaced cardiocranial axes compared to their closest phylogenetic relatives, but their relative cerebrovascular responses remain unelucidated. Accordingly, we investigated the responses to noradrenaline (NA), acetylcholine (ACh), 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT), histamine, angiotensin (Ang) II, and bradykinin (BK) in cervine basilar arterial rings. NA and 5-HT induced slight contraction, and ACh induced relaxation, which contrasts with the findings reported in pigs and cattle. The cumulative response to ACh was abolished by endothelial denudation and inhibited by N omega-nitro-L-arginine (a nitric oxide synthase inhibitor), atropine (a nonselective muscarinic antagonist), and p-fluoro-hexahydro-sila-difenidol (an M3 antagonist). Pirenzepine (an M1 antagonist) and methoctramine (an M2 antagonist) showed no significant effects. Histamine induced contractions, with its concentration-response curve shifted to the right in parallel by diphenhydramine (an H1 antagonist). However, cimetidine (an H2 antagonist) showed no significant effects. Ang II and BK had no vasomotive effects. NA and ACh induced different cerebrovascular responses in sika deer versus cattle, but histamine and BK did not. Our findings suggest that cerebrovascular responses are influenced by the similarity of animal species and the head and heart positions relative to gravity.

AB  - Plant-induced defences can shape multitrophic interactions by affecting herbivore performance and altering their suitability as prey. While the direct effects of these defences on herbivores are well documented, their indirect consequences-particularly for predator behaviour and biological control effectiveness-remain less understood. In our study, we examined how activating salicylic acid (SA)-mediated defences in tomato plants affects the performance and nutritional quality of the aphid, Macrosiphum euphorbiae, and how this intraspecific variation in aphid quality as prey impacts the predation by the lady beetle predator, Hippodamia convergens. Aphids on SA-treated plants exhibited reduced body mass, protein and lipid content, indicating lower nutritional value as prey. Correspondingly, we recorded a stronger decline in aphid population on SA-treated plants in the presence of predators. To investigate the effects of reduced aphid quality on predation, we conducted a controlled no-choice assay, which showed that individual lady beetle predators consume more aphids from the SA-treated plants. This increased consumption is consistent with compensatory feeding in response to nutrient-poor prey, although alternative explanations, such as increased prey vulnerability, should also be considered. Our findings demonstrate that SA-mediated defences can shape predator-prey interactions through bottom-up effects on prey quality and underscore the need to consider these cascading effects when evaluating the ecological impact of plant resistance traits in biological control strategies.

AB  - Objectives Although fermented food use is ubiquitous in humans, the ecological and evolutionary factors contributing to its emergence are unclear. Here we investigated the ecological contexts surrounding the consumption of fruits in the late stages of fermentation by wild primates to provide insight into its adaptive function. We hypothesized that climate, socioecological traits, and habitat patch size would influence the occurrence of this behavior due to effects on the environmental prevalence of late-stage fermented foods, the ability of primates to detect them, and potential nutritional benefits.
   Materials and methods We compiled data from field studies lasting at least 9 months to describe the contexts in which primates were observed consuming fruits in the late stages of fermentation. Using generalized linear mixed-effects models, we assessed the effects of 18 predictor variables on the occurrence of fermented food use in primates.
   Results Late-stage fermented foods were consumed by a wide taxonomic breadth of primates. However, they generally made up 0.01%-3% of the annual diet and were limited to a subset of fruit species, many of which are reported to have mechanical and chemical defenses against herbivores when not fermented. Additionally, late-stage fermented food consumption was best predicted by climate and habitat patch size. It was more likely to occur in larger habitat patches with lower annual mean rainfall and higher annual mean maximum temperatures.
   Discussion We posit that primates capitalize on the natural fermentation of some fruits as part of a nutritional strategy to maximize periods of fruit exploitation and/or access a wider range of plant species. We speculate that these factors contributed to the evolutionary emergence of the human propensity for fermented foods.

AB  - The prospective ban on zinc oxide in pig feed in Europe is a major challenge facing the swine industry to maintain piglet health and performance during the weaning period. Weaning is a particularly difficult period for the young pig that is associated with abrupt dietary, environmental and social changes that cause significant levels of stress and disrupt gut development in the pig. Mushrooms are a rich natural source of bio-actives and have long been regarded as a health-promoting food due to their immunomodulatory and antioxidant effects and their ability to modulate the gut microbiota. Mushrooms contain high levels of ergosterol, which allows them to naturally produce vitamin D when they are exposed to light. The present study aimed to compare the effects of mushroom and vitamin D-2-enriched mushroom powders to zinc oxide on the molecular, physiological and microbial changes that influence performance during the post-weaning period. Our study showed that vitamin D-2-enriched mushrooms were equally as effective as zinc oxide in improving gastrointestinal health parameters. However, both mushroom powders reduced feed intake in pigs and negatively affected animal performance. For this reason, mushroom powders have limited use as a commercial feed additive in replacing zinc oxide in pig diets.
   The objective of this study was to compare the molecular, physiological and microbial effects of mushroom powder (MP), vitamin D-2 enriched mushroom powder (MPD2) and zinc oxide (ZnO) in pigs post-weaning. Pigs (four pigs/pen; 12 pens/treatment) were assigned to: (1) basal diet (control), (2) basal diet + ZnO, (3) basal diet + MP (2 g/kg feed) and (4) basal diet + MPD2 (2 g/kg feed). Zinc oxide supplementation improved the feed intake (p < 0.001); increased the caecal abundance of Lactobacillus (p < 0.05); increased the villus height (p < 0.05) in the duodenum, jejunum and ileum; increased the expression of chemokine interleukin 8 (CXCL8; p < 0.05); and decreased the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokine gene interleukin 6 (IL6; p < 0.05), tumour necrosis factor (TNF; p < 0.05), nutrient transporters peptide transporter 1 (SLC15A1; p < 0.05) and fatty acid binding protein 2 (FABP2; (p < 0.05) in the duodenum. Whereas dietary supplementation with MPD2 improved the gastrointestinal morphology (p < 0.05); increased the total volatile fatty acid concentrations (p < 0.05); increased the expression of anti-inflammatory cytokine gene interleukin 10 (IL10; p < 0.05) and nutrient transporters SLC15A1 (p < 0.05), FABP2 (p < 0.05) and vitamin D receptor (VDR; p < 0.05); and reduced the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokine gene IL6 (p < 0.05), it adversely affected average daily feed intake (ADFI; p < 0.001) and average daily gain (ADG; p < 0.05). Mushroom powder supplementation had a positive impact on gastrointestinal morphology (p < 0.05) and upregulated the expression of nutrient transporters SLC15A1 (p < 0.05) and FABP2 (p < 0.05) and tight junction claudin 1 (CLDN1) (p < 0.05) compared to the controls but had no effect on the expression of inflammatory markers (p > 0.05). Furthermore, MP reduced ADFI (p < 0.01); however, this did not negatively impact the ADG (p > 0.05). In conclusion, MP and MPD2 have limited use as commercial feed additives in replacing ZnO in pig diets as feed intake was reduced post-weaning.

AB  - There are many hypotheses regarding influences on the early hominin biogeographic spread into Eurasia; among them is increased meat-eating. Dmanisi in Georgia is one of the rare Early Pleistocene sites in Eurasia, and here we present primary information and analysis of the medium and large mammal taphonomy, contributing information about site formation and the hominins' interaction with the fauna. Nearly 85% of the specimens come from the B1 stratum. Relative abundances of mammal families demonstrate some bias toward carnivores, especially Canis borjgali, and diverse Felidae species. Bones display little weathering. Post-depositional surface modifications and matrix obscure many bone surfaces, but carnivore tooth marking is the most common bone surface modification from the nutritive taphonomic phase. Tooth pits are large, in the size range of those made by modern Crocuta crocuta and Panthera leo. Breakage variables indicate most breaks occurred while the bones were still fresh, many by carnivore consumption. Fairly even limb bone representation of herbivores suggests carcasses were introduced to the site nearly whole. Hominin tool marks are present in low frequencies, but they suggest a variety of behaviors. These marks are found on Equus, Palaeotragus, Bison, large cervids, Pseudodama, Canis, and Mammuthus. Some were made by filleting proximal limb segments, and so are likely indicative of early access to carcasses, while other marks suggest scavenging. The Homo taphonomic variables resemble the rest of the taphonomic signatures from the site with little weathering, a slightly higher percentage of their bones are whole, but only a few have probable carnivore damage. The assemblage characteristics are compared to modern actualistic and experimental assemblages, and it is concluded that Dmanisi presents a palimpsest of hyena denning, felid activity, hominin meat-eating and likely natural deaths.

AB  - The Reeves' muntjac Muntiacus reevesi is an ungulate native to China and Taiwan that has been released into the wild in several continental European countries and the United Kingdom. We present recent records of the species in mainland France. We also investigated the dispersal rate and density of the established population in the Centre-Val de Loire region. The number of observations of M. reevesi was low in the period 2008-2016, increased sharply until 2019 and then decreased until 2023. From a comparison between the distribution in 2008-2012 and 2013-2017, the dispersal rate was estimated at an average of 3.2 km/year, and 7.6 km/year between 2013-2017 and 2018-2023. Based on a camera trap protocol, the population density was assumed to be very low in forested areas but estimated with a lack of robustness due to a single observation. Further efforts must be made to better assess the risk of an increase in the wild population of Reeves' muntjac in the Centre-Val de Loire region. To prevent potential impacts, rapid control measures can be put in place in the large area (10,800 km(2)) where muntjacs are now rapidly spreading.

AB  - In order to explore the response of soil nutrient supply capacity and tea plant nutrient utilization capacity to tea-planting years in precious ancient tea garden, field investigation and indoor analysis methods were employed to research the soil and plant nutrient content, eco-stoichiometric characteristics and the correlation between them, with artificially bred Camellia tetracocca at different time periods (5 years, 15 years, 25 years and 40 years). The results showed that: (1) the contents of soil organic carbon and total nitrogen were higher in the 25- and 40-year teas than in 5- and 15-year teas. The soil pH and total phosphorus were the highest in the 40-year tea, and the available nutrient content was the lowest in the 40-year tea. (2) The contents of nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium in tea shoots were the highest in 15-year tea. The nutrient content of tea trees were highest according to the following order: new shoots > leaves > branches. (3) The N: P of soil and leaves was 4.11-7.55 and 6.37-11.76, respectively. Available nutrients and soil pH were the main factors affecting the contents of nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium in new shoots. In conclusion, the soil nutrient supply capacity and the nutrient utilization capacity of tea plants in the Camellia tetracocca garden were significantly different under different tea-planting years. The growth of the tea plants was restricted by the soil nitrogen supply. The nutrient absorption and utilization capacity of precious Camellia tetracocca were higher in the 15- and 25-year teas, respectively. The study provides the basis for the rational development and sustainable utilization of precious ancient tea plants, and the scientific management of tea gardens.

AB  - Typhoon Saola was the ninth typhoon that generated over the Western North Pacific (WNP) in 2023, and it caused severe storm impacts. However, its complex moving track and heavy intensity made it extremely difficult to forecast; therefore, detailed analysis is necessary. In this study, GPM, Himawari-9, and FY-4B satellite data were used to analyze the characteristics of the structure, brightness temperature, and precipitation of the typhoon cloud system. Our results showed that, in the 89 and 183 GHz channels of GPM-1CGMI, the brightness temperature of the typhoon eye was 80-90 K higher than that of the eye wall, and the strong convective areas below 200 K were clearer in these high-frequency channels. GPM-2ADPR estimated heavy rain (over 30 mm/h) area, storm height (5 km), and vertical precipitation rate (30-40 mm/h) more accurately than the GPM-2Aka and GPM-2Aku products. Himawari-9 satellite data showed that the brightness temperature of the eye wall and spiral cloud bands was 180-200 K, the typhoon eye was small and round, and strong convective activities were mostly located in the southwest side of the center. The FY-4B CLP and CLT products showed that, in the mature period of the typhoon, the percentage of supercooled and mixed clouds first stabilized and then rapidly decreased. The trends observed among the three types of ice-phase clouds were characterized by an initial increase, followed by a decrease, and then another increase, with percentages between 10% and 25%, 5% and 15%, and 15% and 30%, respectively.

AB  - Background Relative to temperate regions, little is known about bobcats (Lynx rufus) in the Sonoran Desert portion of their range, in part due to the difficulty of sampling an elusive carnivore in harsh desert environments. Here, we quantify habitat selection and evaluate diet of bobcats at Kofa National Wildlife Refuge, Arizona, USA, using multiple sampling techniques including GPS telemetry, camera traps, and DNA metabarcoding. Results Home ranges during the hot season were smaller than during the cool season. Camera trapping failed to yield a high enough detection rate to identify habitat occupancy trends but third-order resource selection from GPS-collar data showed a preference for higher elevations and rugged terrain at lower elevations. Diet composition consisted of a diverse range of available small prey items, including a higher frequency of avian prey than previously observed in bobcats. Conclusions Desert bobcats in our study maintained smaller home ranges and primarily consumed smaller prey than their more northern relatives. This study illustrates the benefit of employing multiple, complementary sampling methods to understand the ecology of elusive species.

AB  - Copper (Cu) is one of the common heavy metal pollutants in the environment, and its toxic mechanisms have been extensively studied. However, the immunotoxicity induced by Cu remains rarely reported, and the effects of Cu on endoplasmic reticulum stress and mitochondria-mediated apoptosis have been little studied in the spleen. In this study, pigs were fed with different contents of Cu (10, 125, and 250 mg/kg Cu) for 80 days to establish a toxicity model. The results showed the Cu exposure triggered endoplasmic reticulum stress in the spleen, as evidenced by increased mRNA and protein levels of GRP94, GRP78, CHOP, XBP1, ATF6, and JNK; the positive rate of GRP78 increased by immunofluorescence analysis. Additionally, mitochondrial fission and fusion homeostasis were disrupted, the expression levels of mitochondrial dynamics-related genes Mfn1, Mfn2, and OPA1 decreased, DRP1 increased, and the positive rate of Mfn1 decreased by immunofluorescence analysis. Furthermore, Cu exposure could induce apoptosis, as demonstrated by the increased expression level of related proteins and genes Bak, Bax, Caspase-3, P53, and Cytc. In conclusion, these results suggest chronic Cu exposure can lead to endoplasmic reticulum stress and imbalance in mitochondrial dynamics and induced apoptosis of pig spleen, and these results provided new insights into the underlying mechanism of Cu exposure caused splenic toxicity, which has public health implications where humans and animals are exposed to copper contamination.

AB  - For longer-lived species, individuals hedge their bets by skipping breeding when conditions are poor to preserve the opportunity for future breeding attempts. Thus, understanding the ecological drivers behind the 'choice' to reproduce or not is a key step in identifying and diagnosing causes of population change. We investigated both marine and terrestrial factors that might influence whether Kittlitz's Murrelets Brachyramphus brevirostris-a long-lived seabird of conservation concern that is often associated with glacially-influenced habitats-choose to breed in a given year. We used a suite of proxies to explain variation in reproductive metrics of radio-tagged Kittlitz's Murrelets, exploring three hypotheses related to prey availability, nest depredation risk, and energetic costs of nesting in Icy Bay, Alaska, 2007-2012. In two of the years, we compared results with the locally co-occurring, closely-related Marbled Murrelet B. marmoraus. Across the six-year period of our study, the posterior mean breeding propensity of Kittlitz's Murrelets was 0.21 (95% credible interval [CrI] = 0.15-0.27), nesting success was 0.41 (CrI = 0.25-0.57), and fecundity was 0.04 (CrI = 0.02-0.06). Although none of our three hypotheses were strongly supported by the data, our results collectively suggest that successful nesters expended greater effort than failed nesters and non-nesters to acquire sufficient prey-they stayed longer in the study area, had larger marine core use areas, spent slightly less time diving, and had shorter commuting distances and longer incubation shifts. Also, in years when fecundity was highest, overlap of individual marine core use areas was greatest, suggesting predictable foraging hotspots for murrelets in those years. Importantly, when comparing Brachyramphus species, we found that Marbled Murrelets outperformed Kittlitz's Murrelets reproductively by three to four times in overlapping years, suggesting different drivers of reproduction. From our collective results, we posit that the limitation to reproduction of Kittlitz's Murrelets may not be prey abundance or quality, but instead efficient access to prey. While our associations with indices of prey availability, depredation risk, and energetic costs to nesting did not explain much of the variation in fitness metrics, our study demonstrates the value of using a comparative approach and multiple metrics to diagnose factors limiting a population, especially when data are sparse. For bet-hedging species with complex life histories, we recommend using a combination of integrated modeling and a monitoring framework designed to accumulate evidence across studies to estimate population dynamics and improve inferences about ecological drivers.

AB  - The electrolytes Na and K both function to maintain water balance and membrane potential. However, these elements work differently in plants-where K is the primary electrolyte-than in animals-where ATPases require a balanced supply of Na and K. Here, we use monthly factorial additions of Na and K to simulate bovine urine inputs and explore how these electrolytes ramify through a prairie food web. Against a seasonal trend of increasing grass biomass and decreasing water and elemental tissue concentrations, +K and +Na plots boosted water content and, when added together, plant biomass. Compared to control plots, +Na and +K plots increased element concentrations in above-ground plant tissue early in summer and decreased them in September. Simultaneously, invertebrate abundance on Na and K additions were sequentially higher and lower than control plots from June to September and were most suppressed when grass was most nutrient rich. K was the more effective plant electrolyte, but Na frequently promoted similar changes in grass ionomes. The soluble/leachable ions of Na and K showed significant ability to shape plant growth, water content, and the 15-element ionome, with consequences for higher trophic levels. Grasslands with high inputs of Na and K-via large mammal grazers or coastal aerosol deposition-likely enhance the ability of plants to adjust their above-ground ionomes, with dramatic consequences for the distribution of invertebrate consumers.

AB  - Simple Summary Sarcoptic mange represents an important concern for chamois management; in our study, the effects of an epidemic were monitored on an alpine population from 2006 to 2020. Passive surveillance and demographic data were analyzed in order to describe a mange outbreak. Furthermore, an enhanced passive surveillance protocol was implemented in a subpart of the study area in order to evaluate the efficiency of the ordinary one. Generally, the demographic decline caused by the epidemic reached the highest values between the first and the third year after the first mange cases. The enhanced passive surveillance approach proved to be an important asset for disease surveillance: However, its adoption may be too costly if applied for longer periods on a wide scale. Passive surveillance, in both ordinary and enhanced surveillance protocol, should encompass the use of other monitoring strategies in the future to study the eco-epidemiology of this disease in wild Caprinae. Since 1995, the Alpine chamois (Rupicapra r. rupicapra) population of the Dolomites has been affected by sarcoptic mange with considerable management concerns. In this study, 15 years (2006-2020) of passive surveillance and demographic data were analyzed in order to describe a mange outbreak. Furthermore, an enhanced passive surveillance protocol was implemented in order to evaluate the efficiency of ordinary vs. enhanced surveillance protocol in identifying dead chamois in the field and in reaching a correct diagnosis. Our results confirm the role of mange as a determining factor for chamois mortality, while stressing the importance of a wider view on the factors affecting population dynamics. The enhanced passive surveillance protocol increased the probability of carcass retrieval and identification of the cause of death; however, its adoption may be too costly if applied for long periods on a wide scale. Passive surveillance, in both ordinary and enhanced surveillance protocol, should encompass the use of other strategies in the future to study the eco-epidemiology of the disease in wild Caprinae.

AB  - Artificial light at night has been proposed as a global threat to biodiversity. Insectivorous bats are strictly nocturnal animals that are vulnerable to disruption from artificial light. Given that many light-sensitive bats tend to avoid night light during roost departure, it is often assumed that nighttime light pollution reduces their foraging opportunities, albeit empirical evidence in support of this hypothesis remains elusive. Here, we used least horseshoe bats, Rhinolophus pusillus, to assess whether white artificial light is detrimental for the opportunities of foraging. We manipulated the levels of ambient illumination and perceived predation risk inside the bat roost. We monitored bats' emergence activity using high-speed video and audio recording systems. DNA based faecal dietary analysis and insect survey were applied to determine activity time of prey in foraging areas. Following experimentally manipulation of white light-emitting diode (LED) lighting 0-15 min after sunset, bat pass, flight duration, and echolocation pulse emission decreased. The mean emergence time of bats flying out was delayed by 14 min under lit treatment compared with the dark control. Only 10% of bats left for foraging during 40 min of light exposure. Aversive effects of LED light on bat emergence were robust regardless of the presence of a potential predator. Insect prey reached a peak of abundance between 30 and 60 min after sunset. These results demonstrate that white artificial light hinders evening emergence behavior in least horseshoe bats, leading to a mismatch between foraging onset and peak food availability. Our findings highlight that light pollution overrides foraging onset, suggesting the importance of improving artificial lighting scheme near the roosts of light-sensitive bats.

AB  - Light-emitting diodes often are used to substitute and enhance fluorescent or incandescent light for plants that are grown in climate-controlled environments. These lights often are chosen over other light sources because of the light-emitting diodes' durability, long life, enhanced wavelength for specific plant species, lower energy costs, lower surface heat safety risk, and easier ability to incorporate into advanced climate control systems. However, previous studies have shown that characteristics of Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench (Poaceae) are altered under light-emitting diodes. Therefore, we grew 4 cultivars of sorghum in growth chambers with either conventional or light-emitting diodes. Plants were infested with either the sugarcane aphid, Melanaphis sacchari (Zehntner) (Hemiptera: Aphididae) or were un-infested (control). Sorghum grown under light-emitting diodes was shorter and produced more leaves that were wider than those of plants grown under conventional lights. Two of the cultivars had lower photosynthetic rates and reduced stomatal conductance under light-emitting diodes. When exposed to sugarcane aphids, resistant cultivars tolerated aphid feeding with reduced damage under conventional lights but were similar to susceptible cultivars when grown under light-emitting diodes. Our results suggest that light-emitting diodes affect sorghum physiology and morphology, and also compromises resistance to herbivores. Our study provides further evidence that the physiological effects of different light spectra and interaction of plant defenses and herbivores need to be tested across a broad range of plant groups.

AB  - Harvest, through its intensity and regulation, often results in selection on female reproductive traits. Changes in female traits can have demographic consequences, as they are fundamental in shaping population dynamics. It is thus imperative to understand and quantify the demographic consequences of changes in female reproductive traits to better understand and anticipate population trajectories under different harvest intensities and regulations. Here, using a dynamic, frequency-dependent, population model of the intensively hunted brown bear (Ursus arctos) population in Sweden, we quantify and compare population responses to changes in four reproductive traits susceptible to harvest-induced selection: litter size, weaning age, age at first reproduction, and annual probability to reproduce. We did so for different hunting quotas and under four possible hunting regulations: (i) no individuals are protected, (ii) mothers but not dependent offspring are protected, (iii) mothers and dependent offspring of the year (cubs) are protected, and (iv) entire family groups are protected (i.e., mothers and dependent offspring of any age). We found that population growth rate declines sharply with increasing hunting quotas. Increases in litter size and the probability to reproduce have the greatest potential to affect population growth rate. Population growth rate increases the most when mothers are protected. Adding protection on offspring (of any age), however, reduces the availability of bears for hunting, which feeds back to increase hunting pressure on the nonprotected categories of individuals, leading to reduced population growth. Finally, we found that changes in reproductive traits can dampen population declines at very high hunting quotas, but only when protecting mothers. Our results illustrate that changes in female reproductive traits may have context-dependent consequences for demography. Thus, to predict population consequences of harvest-induced selection in wild populations, it is critical to integrate both hunting intensity and regulation, especially if hunting selectivity targets female reproductive strategies.

AB  - Simple Summary The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of different source forages fed to preweaning yak calves on growth performance, pancreatic morphology, and functional development. In the experiment, we performed three different sets of experimental treatments by feeding tests, collected pancreatic tissues and recorded their organ indices at the end of the experiment, collected pancreatic tissue samples to observe morphological structures by tissue sectioning, determined the activity of main digestive enzymes and hormone levels in the pancreas by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and obtained metabolic pathways and their small-molecule differential metabolites by nontargeted metabolomics techniques. The endocrine and exocrine divisions of the pancreas, which functions as a metabolic organ, are involved in the control of glucose and the organism's digestive metabolism. We discovered that feeding preweaning yak calves a combination of oat hay and alfalfa hay was better for the morphological and functional development of the pancreas than feeding either hay alone. This is essential for the early development of the pancreas in yak calves and serves as a critical resource for their healthy growth and scientific feeding. In this study, we used a combination of animal nutrition and nontargeted metabolomics to investigate the effects of feeding different sources forages rations on the morphology and function of the pancreas in preweaning yak calves, providing theoretical guidance and important references for the healthy and high-quality rearing of yak calves. At 45 days old, 21 yak calf males were divided into OP, AP, and AOP groups, with seven animals in each group, which were fed with oat hay, alfalfa hay, and mixed oat and alfalfa hay, respectively. Five calves from each group were selected randomly to slaughter after a pretest period of 21 days and the official period of 120 days, when the average daily feed intake reached 1 kg. During the test, the growth and pancreas weight of yak calves were recorded, and the morphology and function of the pancreas tissues were determined using tissue sectioning methods, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) tests, and nontargeted metabolomics strategies. The results showed that the body weight and pancreatic organ index of yak calves in the AOP group were significantly higher than those of the AP and OP groups. Compared to the AP and OP groups, the AOP group had considerably lower ratios of the area of the pancreatic endocrine component and overall percentage of that section of the organ, and the AOP group increased pancreatic amylase activity and a higher concentration of growth inhibitor. The AP group had significantly higher levels of the differential metabolites L-ascorbic acid, spermidine, spermine, and dopaquinone in the glutathione, beta-alanine, and tyrosine metabolic pathways than the OP group. The AOP group had significantly lower levels of the differential metabolites spermine and phenylacetylglycine in the glutathione and phenylalanine metabolic pathways than the AP group. In summary, compared to feeding oat or alfalfa hay alone, combined feeding oat hay and alfalfa hay is more beneficial to promote the morphological and functional development of the pancreas in preweaning yak calves, so as to enhance the digestion and absorption of nutrients in the diet and maintain the positive regulation of blood glucose levels. This provides an important basis for the optimized forage supply of healthy and high-quality rearing in preweaning yak calves.

AB  - Artificial light at night is increasingly recognized as a cause of habitat degradation, and as a conservation threat to wildlife species. We studied the behavioral response of Pacific kangaroo rats (Dipodomys agilis) to natural and artificial light in coastal sage scrub in southern California, United States. We used digital trail cameras to monitor visits to seed trays in shrub and open, intershrub microhabitats. Under natural-light conditions, kangaroo rats were more active on full- than new-moon nights, and concentrated foraging beneath shrubs. Surprisingly, kangaroo rats frequently interacted with other rodents in seed trays. Near to an artificial light source, kangaroo rats removed fewer seeds, had fewer foraging bouts, and spent less time in trays-especially in brightly lit open microhabitats-compared to distances farther from the light. Differences between the first and second nights of trials during both experiments suggested that kangaroo rats learned locations of resource-rich seed trays and modified their behavior accordingly. Our results are similar to recent studies showing that artificial light depresses foraging activity of rodents in the areas of highest illumination, and adds to evidence of the need to mitigate impacts of urban lighting in fragments of coastal sage scrub, especially along the urban-wildland interface.
   Artificial light at night represents a novel risk for wildlife living at the urban-wildland interface. By monitoring behavior at seed trays using digital trail cameras, we found that artificial light significantly reduced foraging activity of a California-endemic kangaroo rat compared to natural moonlight levels.

AB  - Herbivory is a highly sophisticated feeding behavior that requires abilities of plant defense suppression, phytochemical detoxification, and plant macromolecule digestion. For plant-sucking insects, salivary glands (SGs) play important roles in herbivory by secreting and injecting proteins into plant tissues to facilitate feeding. Little is known on how insects evolved secretory SG proteins for such specialized functions. Here, we investigated the composition and evolution of secretory SG proteins in the brown marmorated stink bug (Halyomorpha halys) and identified a group of secretory SG phospholipase C (PLC) genes with highest sequence similarity to the bacterial homologs. Further analyses demonstrated that they were most closely related to PLCs of Xenorhabdus, a genus of Gammaproteobacteria living in symbiosis with insect-parasitizing nematodes. These suggested that H. halys might acquire these PLCs from Xenorhabdus through the mechanism of horizontal gene transfer (HGT), likely mediated by a nematode during its parasitizing an insect host. We also showed that the original HGT event was followed by gene duplication and expansion, leading to functional diversification of the bacterial-origin PLC genes in H. halys. Thus, this study suggested that an herbivore might enhance adaptation through gaining genes from an endosymbiont of its parasite in the tripartite parasitic and symbiotic interactions.

AB  - The crosstalk between glucocorticoid (GC) and immune response is critical for the maintenance of homeostasis. However, it remains elusive whether chronic stress affects lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced inflammation via the crosstalk. Pigs were administered LPS injection with or without continuous adrenocorticotropine hormone (ACTH) pretreatment. Twenty-four 30-day-old Duroc x Landrace x Large White crossbred piglets (12 +/- 0.5 kg) were randomly assigned to 4 treatments: control, LPS, ACTH, and ACTH+LPS groups. Each group consisted of 6 male piglets. All ACTH pigs and ACTH+LPS pigs were injected intramuscularly with ACTH (2.25 IU/kg body weight) for 7 consecutive injections at 6-h intervals. Then, LPS pigs and ACTH+LPS pigs were injected intramuscularly with LPS (15 mu g/kg body weight). LPS upregulated levels of pulmonary IL-1 beta, IL-10, TLR2 gene mRNAs (P <0.01, P =0.006, P =0.04, respectively), and T-NOS, iNOS and cNOS proteins (P =0.002, P =0.028 and P =0.003, respectively) and increased serum tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) concentration (P <0.01), but ACTH treatment has no significant effect on them. Neither ACTH nor LPS treatment had any significant effect on levels of pulmonary SOD, CAT and MDA secretion, as well as expression of IL-6, TNF-alpha, IL-10, COX-2 and TLR4 mRNAs (P >0.05). Pulmonary cortisol level was inhibited by LPS (P =0.034), with a similar trend of inhibition by ACTH (P =0.062). Pretreatment with ACTH tended to downregulate total GR protein levels (P =0.084), and LPS tended to inhibit GR protein expression in the nucleus (P =0.088). Pulmonary expression level of Let-7i targeted TLR4 was significantly increased by ACTH treatment (P =0.013), but not with LPS. These results suggest that LPS may increase the expression of pulmonary TLR2 mRNA by inhibiting nuclear translocation of GC-GR, thus causing a slight inflammatory response in the lungs of pigs, which is not affected by chronic ACTH treatment.

AB  - In recent decades, the golden jackal Canis aureus has experienced a population increase in many European countries, including Croatia. As a result, human-jackal conflicts (e.g., damage to livestock and wildlife, general nuisance in (sub)urban areas) have increased dramatically, and there is an urgent need to develop and use a range of mitigation tools that also aim to control population growth. Hunting is one of the well-known tools for population control; therefore, the aim of this study was to determine the effects of habitat type and weather conditions on jackal hunting success. From 2019 to 2023, a total of 217 jackals were culled during 106 hunting events in an approximately 10,500 ha lowland habitat along the Sava River in central Croatia. All jackals (56% males and 44% females) were culled using small calibre rifle (222 Remington) with night vision scope. Based on age structure, 16% juveniles and 84% adults were shot, and the average catch per unit effort (CPUE) was 2.0 animals/day. The best hunting success was obtained by attracting jackals with a calling method, i.e., by playing the sound of a wounded hare. Regarding the type of habitat, 56% of the culls were in cultivated, non-forested areas. It was confirmed that weather conditions, i.e., daily temperature and precipitation, influence hunting success, especially for males. Hunting success of adult males was lower on days with higher temperatures and on days with more precipitation. We can state that individual hunting with using calling method is an effective tool for successful golden jackals harvesting; moreover, jackal hunting can minimize the conflict with gamekeepers and farmers and would help to improve public perception of jackals.

AB  - The excessive use of antibiotics in the pig breeding industry leads to the accumulation of antibiotic residuals in the environment, which is attributed to the improper treatment of livestock excrements. Sulfamethoxazole (SMX) and Norfloxacin (NOR) are antibiotics used in pig breeding and veterinary medicines as growth promoters and antibacterial drugs. The aim of this study was to examine the effects of these antibiotics and thermophilic pre-treatment on methane (CH4) yield by anaerobic co-digestion (AcoD) of pig manure and corn straw under mesophilic temperature condition (35 +/- 1 degrees C). We used antibiotics at a concentration of 0, 20 and 60 mg L-1 (three stages) in two lab-scale continuously stirred tank reactors. The first reactor was run using untreated fed and the second reactor was run with thermophilic (55 +/- 1 degrees C) pre-treated fed. The results showed that the CH4 productions from reactor one were 205, 163 and 128 and from reactor two were 222, 185 and 173 mL CH4 g-1 VSadded, respectively. This elucidates that the presence of antibiotics had a negative effect on CH4 production. Moreover, thermophilic pre-treatment improved the performance of the anaerobic digestion and CH4 production.

AB  - Bottom-up effects are major ecological forces in plant-herbivore-parasitoid multitrophic interactions. Biochar amendment in the field alters the bottom-up effects, as it can directly affect the soil environment and plant nutrient uptake, which in turn, indirectly affects herbivores and their natural enemies. However, such effects are poorly documented. We examined the influence of biochar on soil enzyme activity, soybean defense chemicals, and fitness of Spodoptera litura and its parasitoid Meteorus pulchricornis. As the biochar application rate increased, soil urease and sucrase activities, soybean trypsin protease inhibitor content, and polyphenol oxidase activity gradually increased. However, S. litura survival rate and adult body weight showed an initial increase, followed by a decrease, and then remained steady. Soil phosphatase activity initially increased and then stabilized, while M. pulchricornis cocoon emergence rate and fecundity showed an initial increase, followed by a decrease. Spo-doptera litura adults preferred to oviposit on soybean at the 10 g/kg biochar level, whereas the parasitoids preferred the hosts at the 20 g/kg biochar level. Our results indicate that the biochar amendment of soils increased soil enzymes activity and soybean defenses, which had a positive effect on S. litura and M. pulchricornis at low levels, but became detrimental at high levels. The bottom-up effects triggered by biochar seemingly affected the second and third trophic levels, resulting in increased defense potential against herbivorous insects. Thus, biochar showed potential to enhance direct plant defenses against pests and indirectly influenced defenses mediated by natural enemies.

AB  - The Morrison Formation of the Late Jurassic Period is characterized by its diverse assemblage of sauropods, several species of which reached the size of modern cetaceans. While much scientific attention has concerned their biology in life, researchers have yet to examine how their massive carcasses may have influenced the evolution of other dinosaurs in their communities, such as theropods. Theropod consumers local to this faunal system are typically described as powerful apex predators at the top of local food webs, but instead, may have been shaped by competition for carrion resources generated as a byproduct of their giant sauropod neighbors. To test this hypothesis, we wrote a series of agent-based simulations (ABS). Specifically, we simulated allosaurid consumer behavior versus spatially distributed sauropod carcass resources such as could be expected in ecosystems like that represented in the Morrison Formation. We incorporated conditions to test how competition among consumers, seasonality, and predation success influenced carnosaur survival both with and without carrion-abundant systems. Trials of the ABS resulted in a strong selective advantage for allosaurs as obligate scavengers because of the high metabolic and survival costs associated with predation of large vertebrates. Allosaurs with increased predatory success over peers failed to succeed competitively unless the probability of scavenging opportunities fell below a certain threshold and a significant proportion of herbivores were available as prey targets, which might not have been the case in sauropod-dominated systems. Our results may explain why carnosaurs like Allosaurus did not evolve powerful bite forces, binocular vision, or advanced cursorial adaptations. Given the enormous supply of sauropod carrion, they were under no resource-based selective pressure to overpower prey and may have evolved as terrestrial vulture analogues. This also may explain why the absence of sauropods in certain environments led to more obvious predatory adaptations in theropods such as tyrannosaurs. Tyrannosaurs may have been forced to meet their energy budgets by hunting, because non-sauropod carrion production was too low to support them passively.

AB  - We developed a composite outcrop proxy record of Plio-Pleistocene climate in eastern Africa using the radiometrically-dated sediments of the Omo Group that preserve evidence for early hominin evolution. New stable oxygen isotopic measurements from pedogenic carbonate nodules (delta O-18(pc), n = 270) are added to the existing database for a total of 759 observations spanning a similar to 3.6 Myr interval from 4.33-0.65 Ma. Linear interpolation of sample positions between tuffaceous marker horizons produced the chronostratigraphy of the delta O-18(pc) record that was correlated to Indo-Pacific marine core sediment records and astronomical solutions of orbital climate forcing. Rainfall/evaporation changes inferred from the delta O-18(pc) record carry orbital eccentricity signals, and the amplitude modulation of short eccentricity (-100 kyr) predicted by the astronomical solutions is evident during some intervals. delta O-18(pc) variations recover many of the similar to 100 kyr cycles between similar to 4.3-0.7 Ma, with chronostratigraphic offsets between the Omo Group time series and astronomical solutions usually within the resolution of the radiometric uncertainties, i.e., <= 50 kyr; however, missing time at -1.2 Ma contributes to nearly 150 kyr of offset. These delta O-18(pc) data also indicate a long-term drying trend beginning at 2.11 Ma that correlates to a thicker eastern Indian Ocean mixed layer and upwelling in the eastern Pacific, implying a simultaneous response across the tropics to strengthening Walker Circulation. Published delta O-18(pc) values from the same pedogenic carbonate nodules indicate that C4 vegetation abundances increased beginning at similar to 2.0 Ma, also suggesting climatic drying. Spectral analysis of the delta O-18(pc) time series provides weaker evidence of orbital forcing as compared to the delta O-18(pc) time series, particularly for long orbital eccentricity (405 kyr) and climatic precession (similar to 20 kyr), suggesting other factors, such as feeding ecology of herbivores or global greenhouse gas, may have contributed to the vegetation patterns. The climatic precession component to the delta O-18(pc) time series increases amplitude through strengthening Walker Circulation, which may signal a change in the intensity of interannual climate events. No indications were observed to suggest that the Plio-Pleistocene Northern Hemisphere glaciation resonated as either climatic cyclicity or an abrupt, stepwise shift in the regional hydroclimate. At major junctures of hominin evolution, including the origins of different genera and the earliest stone tools, environmental variability derived from the orbital forcing of the monsoon appears to have been low. However, we propose that at 2.11-1.66 Ma, directional aridity coupled with interannual climate events presented a new adaptive context where Homo erectus and Acheulian stone tools first appeared in eastern Africa.

AB  - In an era marked by increasing anthropogenic pressure, understanding the relations between human activities and wildlife is crucial for understanding ecological patterns, effective conservation, and management strategies. Here, we explore the potential and usefulness of socio-economic variables in species distribution modelling (SDM), focusing on their impact on the occurrence of wild mammals in Poland. Beyond the environmental factors commonly considered in SDM, like land-use, the study tests the importance of socio-economic characteristics of local human societies, such as age, income, working sector, gender, education, and village characteristics for explaining distribution of diverse mammalian groups, including carnivores, ungulates, rodents, soricids, and bats. The study revealed that incorporating socio-economic variables enhances the predictive power for >60 % of species and overall for most groups, with the exception being carnivores. For all the species combined, among the 10 predictors with highest predictive power, 6 belong to socio-economic group, while for specific species groups, socio-economic variables had similar predictive power as environmental variables. Furthermore, spatial predictions of species occurrence underwent changes when socio-economic variables were included in the model, resulting in a substantial mismatch in spatial predictions of species occurrence between environment-only models and models containing socio-economic variables. We conclude that socio-economic data has potential as useful predictors which increase prediction accuracy of wildlife occurrence and recommend its wider usage. Further, to our knowledge this is a first study on such a big scale for terrestrial mammals which evaluates performance based on presence or absence of socio-economic predictors in the model. We recognise the need for a more comprehensive approach in SDMs and that bridging the gap between human socio-economic dynamics and ecological processes may contribute to the understanding of the factors influencing biodiversity.

AB  - The Kazakh sheep is native to China. The breed has many advantages, including its size, hardiness, and good meat production, it has the economic disadvantage of having a low reproductive rate. Inhibin-alpha (INH alpha) regulates the synthesis and secretion of follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and could feasibly be used to boost reproduction in the Kazakh sheep. However, the current methods of INH alpha preparation are both costly and time-consuming. Here, we investigated the effects of INH alpha on Kazakh sheep reproductive performance by immunization with INH alpha and analyzing the subsequent changes in reproductive hormone levels and blood biochemical indices. An anti-INH alpha polyclonal antibody was raised in camel. It and a recombinant INH alpha protein were used to immunize groups of adult Kazakh sheep in anestrus. Reproductive hormones (FSH, luteinizing hormone [LH], progesterone [P-4], and estradiol [E-2]) were measured by ELISA, together with the measurement of changes in INH levels and blood physiological and biochemical indicators. The blood levels of LH and P-4 in the sheep immunized with the camel anti-INH alpha polyclonal antibody (group A) did not differ significantly from those in the recombinant INHa protein (group B) and the control group (group C) ( P >0.05). FSH and E-2 levels in group A were significantly higher than the controls (P <0.05) and the INH concentrations were significantly lower than those in group C (P <0.05). There were no abnormalities in the blood biochemical indices in groups A, B, and C.In conclusion, immune INHa preparations significantly affected the blood reproductive hormone levels of Kazakh sheep. This technique has potential application for improving the reproductive performance in these sheep and is also relevant for future research into the development of an INH alpha vaccine.

AB  - Simple Summary Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is a public health concern. Increasing resistance has arisen due to the inappropriate use of antimicrobial drugs in both, human and veterinary medicine. Although AMR is mainly linked to direct and indirect human activities, little is known about the presence and impact that AMR has on wild animals, especially for those bound to habitats subjected to little human pressure. Our study analyzed the AMR profiles of different Pasteurellaceae species obtained from the infected lungs of Pyrenean chamois (Rupicapra pyrenaica) and domestic sheep found in a National Hunting Reserve from Spain. We have found evidence of the presence of AMR in both animal species. Furthermore, some isolates were resistant to cephalosporins and fluoroquinolones, which are antimicrobials of critical importance in human medicine. Further research is needed to discern pathways of AMR dissemination within natural environments and assess its persistence in wildlife in order to prevent further AMR spreading at a global scale. Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) has spread worldwide due to the inappropriate use of antimicrobial drugs in human and veterinary medicine, becoming a public health problem. However, little is known about its occurrence and maintenance in wild animals, and very few studies have been carried out in ecosystems subjected to low human pressure. In our study, nasal and lung swabs were collected from hunted Pyrenean chamois (Rupicapra pyrenaica), and nasal swabs from sympatric domestic sheep were also collected. The swabs were cultured in agar plates to obtain bacterial isolates from the Pasteurellaceae family. The presence of AMR was assessed in a total of 28 Pasteurellaceae isolates from 45 Pyrenean chamois, and 9 isolates from sympatric domestic sheep found in the National Hunting Reserve of Freser-Setcases (Northeastern Pyrenees, Spain). The isolates belonged to one of the following three species: Pasteurella multocida, Mannheimia haemolytica and Bibersteinia trehalosi. Some P. multocida and M. haemolytica isolates tested positive for AMR. The statistical analysis revealed no differences between the AMR levels from chamois and domestic sheep isolates. However, one P. multocida of chamois origin presented resistance to cephalosporins and fluoroquinolones, which are antibiotics of critical importance for human health. Further studies are required to elucidate potential routes of dissemination of AMR genes in natural environments and assess any significant persistence in wildlife to design risk mitigation actions.

AB  - Trypanosoma (Megatrypanum) spp. are isolated from domestic and wild ruminants, including deer, worldwide. The prevalence of trypanosomes in mammals is influenced by a number of factors such as host age and vector abundance. However, the seasonal variation of and factors affecting trypanosome infection in the wild deer population remain elusive. In this study, we analyzed the seasonal variation in trypanosome prevalence and the factors that affect Trypanosoma theileri Laveran, 1902, infection in wild sika deer (Ezo sika deer) Cervus nippon yesoensis (Heude, 1884) in Eastern Hokkaido through a two-year survey. Seasonal variation in the prevalence of trypanosome infection in the deer population ranged from 0 to 41% as per hematocrit concentration and 17 to 89% as per PCR results. In general, the prevalence of T. theileri by PCR in 2020 was higher than that in 2019. Moreover, the prevalence was significantly higher in the aged population than among the younger population. These findings may explain why individual conditions and sampling season were associated with trypanosome prevalence. This is the first study to investigate the seasonal variation in and risk factors affecting trypanosome infection in wild deer.

AB  - Interaction between two biological control agents released against Lantana camara L. (sensu lato) (Verbenaceae) was studied in replicated semi-field plots. Caged plants under semi-field conditions were inoculated with Uroplata girardi Pic (Coleoptera: Chrysomelidae) and Ophiomyia camarae Spencer (Diptera: Agromyzidae), either alone or in combination, to investigate the extent to which co-infestation of the two agents affects the reproductive capacity and growth of their host. At the end of the trial, both single and combined attacks by the two agents had no effect on stem diameter, stem height, and canopy width. However, uncaged control plants were heavily attacked by Teleonemia scrupulosa Stal (Hemiptera: Tingidae), and therefore became significantly shorter than all the caged plants in all the treatments. When confined alone, feeding damage by O. camarae resulted in higher reduction of fruit and flower biomass relative to that caused by U. girardi alone. However, when confined alone, U. girardi caused higher reductions in leaf density and fruit biomass than when combined with O. camarae. Single attack by O. camarae caused higher reduction in flower biomass than simultaneous attack by both agents. Above-ground biomass of all single and combined treatment plants were significantly lower than those of the caged control plants. Uncaged control plants exposed to heavy attack by T. scrupulosa did not produce flowers and fruits, and their above-ground biomass was significantly lower than those of caged control plants. Overall, the study showed that simultaneous attack by the two herbivores alters their herbivory, thereby affecting reproductive capacity and growth of their host.

AB  - The natural distribution of Cycas micronesica includes three island groups. Damage to the widespread tree from the armored scale Aulacaspis yasumatsui was initiated with the 2003 invasion of Guam and the 2007 invasion of Rota. This herbivore has threatened the unique gymnosperm species with extinction. The number and identity of co-occurring consumers are dissimilar among disjunct insular subpopulations, and six of these habitats were used to assess tree mortality trends to confirm that A. yasumatsui stands alone as the greatest threat to species persistence. Following the initial infestation outbreak of this pest into each new subpopulation, the standing seedlings and saplings were the first to be culled, the juvenile plants were the next to be culled, and then the adult trees were killed more slowly thereafter. The timing of this plant population behavior did not differ among habitats with five other consumers, three other consumers, one other consumer, or no other consumers. We have shown that A. yasumatsui acting as the sole biotic threat in an isolated subpopulation can generate a decline in survival that is as rapid as when it is acting in conjunction with up to five other consequential consumers. This armored scale is the most acute threat to C. micronesica, and adding other specialist herbivores to the scale herbivory does not alter the speed and extent of initial plant mortality.

AB  - Pareiasaurs (Amniota, Parareptilia) were characterized by a global distribution during the Permian period, forming an important component of middle (Capitanian) and late Permian (Lopingian) terrestrial tetrapod biodiversity. This clade represents an early evolution of sizes over a ton, playing a fundamental role in the structure of middle and late Permian biodiversity and ecosystems. Despite their important ecological role and relative abundance around the world, our general knowledge of the biology of these extinct tetrapods is still quite limited. In this contribution we provide a possible in vivo reconstruction of the largest individual of the species Scutosaurus karpinskii and a volumetric body mass estimate for the taxon, considering that body size is one of the most important biological aspects of organisms. The body mass of Scutosaurus was calculated using a 3D photogrammetric model of the complete mounted skeleton PIN 2005/1537 from the Sokolki locality, Arkhangelsk Region, Russia, on exhibit at the Borissiak Paleontological Institute, Russian Academy of Sciences (Moscow). By applying three different densities for living tissues of 0.99, 1, and 1.15 kg/1,000 cm(3) to reconstructed "slim," "average" and "fat" 3D models we obtain average body masses, respectively, of 1,060, 1,160, and 1,330 kg, with a total range varying from a minimum of one ton to a maximum of 1.46 tons. Choosing the average model as the most plausible reconstruction and close to the natural condition, we consider a body mass estimate of 1,160 kg as the most robust value for Scutosaurus, a value compatible with that of a large terrestrial adult black rhino and domestic cow. This contribution demonstrates that barrel-shaped herbivores, subsisting on a high-fiber diet and with a body mass exceeding a ton, had already evolved in the upper Palaeozoic among parareptiles, shedding new light on the structure of the first modern terrestrial ecosystems.

AB  - Intensive livestock production is a source of water, soil, and air contamination. The first aspect that negatively affects the quality of life of residents in the vicinity of piggeries is malodorous aerosols, which are not only responsible for discomfort but can be an etiological factor in the development of various diseases during prolonged exposure. One of the proven and efficient ways to counteract odor emissions is the usage of air biofiltration. The purpose of this study was to qualitatively analyze the bacterial community colonizing the biofilm of a biofilter operating at an industrial piggery in Switzerland. The study material consisted of biofilm and leachate water samples. The microbiological analysis consisted of DNA isolation, amplification of the bacterial 16S rRNA gene fragment (V3-V4), preparation of a library for high-throughput sequencing, high-throughput NGS sequencing, filtering of the obtained sequencing reads, and evaluation of the species composition in the studied samples. The investigation revealed the presence of the following bacterial genera: Pseudochelatococcus, Methyloversatilis, Flexilinea, Deviosia, Chryseobacterium, Kribbia, Leadbetterella, Corynebacterium, Flavobacterium, Xantobacter, Tessaracoccus, Staphylococcus, Thiobacillus, Enhydrobacter, Proteiniclasticum, and Giesbergeria. Analysis of the microbial composition of biofilters provides the opportunity to improve the biofiltration process.

AB  - Nutrients present in the guano of the aquatic birds might alter the water quality and nutrient loading in the wetland ecosystem. We recorded the changes in waterbird abundance for two consecutive wintering seasons, October-March (2018-2019 and 2019-2020), in four wetlands of Bankura and Purulia district, West Bengal, India, on Central Asian and East Asian-Australasian Flyways. The monthly variation in the water parameters, along with total guano and nutrient loadings by waterbirds, were evaluated during the study. Waterbird species varied from 37 to 61 in these wetlands. Guano loading in the study tenure ranged from 50.2 to 2979.1 kg month-1, depending on the wetland resources and the abundance of waterbird species. In most cases, total guano loading showed significant positive correlations with total N and P loading and, consequently, NO3 and PO4 concentrations in water. In all four wetlands, guano and nutrients added by herbivorous waterbirds were significantly higher than carnivorous and omnivorous waterbirds due to the much higher abundance of herbivorous waterbirds. Linear regression analyses showed that the abundance of the wintering waterbird community significantly impacted the nitrate and phosphate availability in most of the sites. Sustainable management of these wetlands depends on the delicate balance of guanotrophic nutrient enrichment and habitat fitness to attract migratory waterbirds.

AB  - Spiny icefish (Chaenodraco wilsoni), a common high-Antarctic ichthyofauna icefish, exhibits variable feeding habits in regions around the Southern Ocean. In the Bransfield Strait (BS), C. wilsoni has received considerable attention as it preys predominantly on krill. Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba), the keystone species in the Southern Ocean, has a versatile feeding strategy, particularly in a highly dynamic environment. The central basin of the BS is a highly dynamic environment, providing an ideal place to explore the application of biochemical tracers in a specialist predator to reveal the diet of its prey. In this study, fatty acid and stable isotopic data demonstrated that the trophic niche of C. wilsoni expanded from late austral summer to early fall, which was primarily reflected in variability in the food availability of krill, i.e., herbivorous features were weakened, benthic-feeding features were strengthened, and omnivorous features showed no significant difference. A highly dynamic hydrography, coupled with an unusual diatom bloom in the BS during 2016, may have resulted in krill's prolonged filtering on diatoms in the water column, which was further reflected in the difference in biochemical tracers of C. wilsoni from late austral summer to early fall. The study demonstrated that biochemical tracers can be used to reflect the variability in the diet of prey, particularly in a highly dynamic environment.

AB  - The brown bear has a large body and it is described as the largest carnivore in Europe. While the brown bear can move safely and comfortably in its own habitat thanks to its large size, it is challenging for it to travel to different habitats over long distances. Therefore, negative changes that may occur with global warming may cause the existing brown bear populations and their habitats to be restricted, reduced, or destroyed. The aim of this study was to reveal the effect of Chelsa climate envelope models for current and future years on brown bear habitats in Europe. For this purpose, the MaxEnt method was used, which is frequently used in wildlife species distribution modelling. The current habitat suitability model of the brown bear was in the "good model" category with the training data set ROC value of 0.834 and the test data set ROC value of 0.828. The variables contributing to the current model are annual range of temperature (48.2%), mean monthly precipitation amount of the warmest quarter (22.1%), temperature seasonality (18.2%) and annual precipitation amount (11.5%), respectively. When the mapping results using the variables contributed to the brown bear current habitat suitability model are compared with the IUCN inventory results, the current brown bear habitats in Europe will change regionally. However, it was determined that brown bear habitats will shrink according to the SSP126 Chelsa climate scenario for the year 2100, and these habitats will fragment according to the SSP370 scenario, as well as that brown bear habitats will disappear in some regions in the SSP585 scenario.

AB  - Members of the salicaceous genus Populus are primarily used by plant biologists as a model system for understanding the genetic underpinnings of woody plant growth and development. Beyond their importance to those conducting developmental research, Populus spp. are key members of ecosystems in the Northern Hemisphere and show promise as a vital renewable source of biomass for sustainable biofuel production. This genus also produces a class of signature herbivore-deterring and medicinally significant phenolic glycosides, commonly referred to as salicinoids. Although salicinoids in Populus are primarily associated with defense against biotic disturbances, they have also been implicated in structuring the chemotaxonomy of Populus and Salicaceae, shaping endophytic microbiomes, directing abiotic stress responses and participating in primary metabolism. Despite advancements in understanding these interactions through functional genomics and biotechnological techniques such as CRISPR/Cas9, much about their function and biosynthesis still remains obfuscated. Here, we summarize a global view of progress made in Populus salicinoid research, focusing particularly on studies conducted through a biotechnological lens, to elucidate the distribution, ecological significance, and biosynthesis of these compounds.

AB  - The Middle Pleistocene archaeological record of the southern Levant has proven key to understanding human evolution and intercontinental faunal biogeography. Knowledge of archaeological sites of that period in the southern Levant is biased, with most Middle Pleistocene localities in the Mediterranean areas in the north, despite the mosaic of environments that mark the entire region. A key Middle Pleistocene location in the Judean Desert - on the eastern margin of the Mediterranean zone - is the site of Oumm Qatafa, excavated in the early 1900s, which yielded a faunal collection spanning an estimated time period of 500-200 kya. Here, we present a revised taxonomy of the macromammalian fauna from the site, discuss the palaeoenvironmental implications of this assemblage, and relate the finds to other Pleistocene sites from the Levant. These data enable a more precise palaeoenvironmental reconstruction which attests to an open landscape, but with the addition of a mesic Mediterranean component close by. In addition, detailed taphonomic observations on butchery marks and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy analysis of burnt bone link the fauna for the first time to anthropogenic activities in the cave.

AB  - Improving fertilizer efficiency with assistance of biochar has drawn much attention in sustainable agriculture. Promoting slow-release properties of biochar itself with cost-effective production technology is a pressing demand. In this study, hydrochar derived from nutrition-enriched yak dung (HC) and corresponding controlled release nitrogen fertilizer (HCRNF) via HCI modifying were studied, and the slow release performance as well as mechanisms were investigated. The results show that HCRNF presents a better N controlled-release performance with cumulative N release amounts of 56.01%-70.30% compared with 72.60%-78.45% of HC. The specific surface area reached highest 47.161 m(2). g(-1) in HCRNFs with the pore volume of 0.098 cm(3).g(-1). Hydrochloric acid modification treatment increases the surface acid group contents such as phenolic hydroxyl group content increasing to 1.48 mmol .g(-1) in HCRNF250. Because the porous structure and stable internal force between N and O-containing functional groups are improved, the N desorption from HCRNF is retarded, which shows a controlled release behavior. We concluded that the HCRNF via HCl modification in this work has a great application potential as slow released N fertilizer in sustainable green agriculture. (C) 2021 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Dillenia indica produces mucilaginous seeds embedded in hard, fibrous, megafaunal fruits, and little is known about the ecological function of mucilage in its regeneration. Using standard laboratory protocols, we investigated the role of mucilage on seed dispersal (buoyancy), chemical defense (antibiotic, antifungal, antioxidant, and allelopathic activities), and seed germination. Further, we characterized seed germination, dormancy, and storage physiology of D. indica. Results revealed that mucilage associated with seed-coat assists seeds in floating on water for a longer duration, acts as an antimicrobial agent without hampering the overall seed germination. It was noticed that fresh mature seeds possess an underdeveloped embryo that grows within the seed before radicle emergence (a sign of morphological dormancy; MD), and seeds took similar to 70 days to achieve 95% germination (a sign of physiological dormancy; PD). However, the rate of germination increased when seeds were treated with gibberellin or subjected to 1-month dry-storage (confirmation of PD). Seeds disperse with similar to 12% moisture and retain high viability even after ultradrying over silica gel, indicating an orthodox seed storage physiology. Study concludes that mucilage plays a crucial ecophysiological function in dispersal-defense mechanism of D. indica seeds, by enhancing seed buoyancy, helping seeds to disperse long-distance, and protecting the seeds from soil pathogens through antimicrobial activity. Our study confirmed that seeds of D. indica possess morphophysiological dormancy (MPD), unlike the MD reported in an earlier study from North India. Possible ecophysiological function of mucilage on seed dispersal-defense mechanism and production of morphophysiological dormant and orthodox seeds in D. indica are discussed.
