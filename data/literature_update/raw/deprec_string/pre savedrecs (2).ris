AB  - Ecosystems face multiple, potentially interacting, anthropogenic pressures that can modify biodiversity and ecosystem functioning. Using a bryophyte-microarthropod microecosystem we tested the combined effects of habitat loss, episodic heat-shocks and an introduced non-native apex predator on ecosystem function (chlorophyll fluorescence as an indicator of photosystem II function) and microarthropod communities (abundance and body size). The photosynthetic function was degraded by the sequence of heat-shock episodes, but unaffected by microecosystem patch size or top-down pressure from the introduced predator. In small microecosystem patches without the non-native predator, Acari abundance decreased with heat-shock frequency, while Collembola abundance increased. These trends disappeared in larger microecosystem patches or when predators were introduced, although Acari abundance was lower in large patches that underwent heat-shocks and were exposed to the predator. Mean assemblage body length (Collembola) was reduced independently in small microecosystem patches and with greater heat-shock frequency. Our experimental simulation of episodic heatwaves, habitat loss and non-native predation pressure in microecosystems produced evidence of individual and potentially synergistic and antagonistic effects on ecosystem function and microarthropod communities. Such complex outcomes of interactions between multiple stressors need to be considered when assessing anthropogenic risks for biota and ecosystem functioning.

AB  - Fences are increasingly used globally as a management tool in conservation to reduce wildlife depredations, disease transmission, and wildlife mortality. There are a limited number of studies on the genetic effects of perimeter fencing of protected areas on megaherbivores. Using population genetic analyses on 226 sequences of a 400 bp fragment of the mtDNA Dloop from 10 East African buffalo populations (3 fenced and 7 unfenced), the influence of spatial isolation and fencing on buffalo population genetic diversity and genetic differentiation was examined. Mean gene diversity between fenced and unfenced buffalo populations was not different (fenced: 0.978 +/- 0.003, unfenced: 0.973 +/- 0.004, p = 0.300), but nucleotide diversity was higher in fenced than unfenced populations (fenced: 0.038 +/- 0.019, unfenced: 0.030 +/- 0.015, p = 0.005). Genetic differentiation among buffalo populations based on haplotype frequencies and model-based genetic distance was weak (FST = 0.08, Phi ST = 0.06) and contributed to 6.2% and 8.5% of total genetic variance, respectively. Ninety-three percent of population pairs were genetically differentiated by distances determined from haplotype frequencies, but only 51% of population pairs were differentiated using modeled distances, suggesting recent differentiation. There was no correlation between linearized FST and geographical distance (r = -0.005, p = 0.52), but linearized Phi ST was moderately correlated with geographic distance (r = 0.329, p = 0.03). The distance effect was greater when fenced populations were excluded (Phi ST: r = 0.464, p = 0.05), suggesting that insularization due to fencing is distorting isolation by distance. SSD analyses revealed that 2 of 3 fenced populations and 2 of 7 unfenced populations had non-unimodal distributions, suggesting demographically declining populations. Our study reveals the high genetic diversity but warns that genetic erosion due to isolation, including fencing, is likely setting in and will have an impact on East African buffalo populations.

AB  - Juvenile corals and their spatio-temporal changes are essential predictors in assessing the recovery of coral reef after disturbances, including by coral bleaching. To gain a deeper understanding, we conducted observations of juvenile corals before and after the 2016 coral bleaching event and their relationship with reef-associated biota at ten permanent monitoring sites in the Pieh Islands Marine Tourism Park (PIMTP), West Sumatera, Indonesia. Our study reveals a decrease in the abundance of juvenile corals following the 2016 bleaching, amounting to approximately 26%, primarily affecting juveniles of Montipora, Acropora, and Pocillopora, with no significant changes observed. The dominant juvenile corals, Montipora, Pocillopora, and Acropora, before the bleaching event were replaced by Pavona and Porites, which persisted and increased post-bleaching. While several genera were not found, new genera emerged. Despite these changes in species composition, species diversity remained unaffected. Although an increase in the abundance of juvenile corals correlated with live coral cover, the correlation was low and negative. The presence of algae as niche competitors exhibited a different correlation compared to previous studies and did not impact coral juveniles significantly, with herbivorous reef fish showing a reasonable control effect. Rubble, serving as a substrate for larval settlement and a micro-habitat for juvenile coral development, exhibited a negative correlation. Our research delineates the temporal changes in young coral populations pre and post the 2016 coral bleaching event. These findings contribute to the scientific understanding that juvenile coral serves as a critical predictor of coral reef resilience and recovery from bleaching, emphasizing its implications for coral reef conservation.

AB  - The role of ecological interactions and abiotic factors in shaping macroevolutionary patterns has been extensively debated. Yet, the effect of predator-prey interactions on diversification dynamics is unclear. Here, we test the influence of predator-prey interactions in the diversification of sabre-toothed cats, a subfamily of felids (Felidae: Machairodontinae) that developed a highly specialized morphology, the notoriously long upper canines. This morphology has been associated with a high degree of trophic dependence on large prey, which is assumed as one of the main reasons for the group's demise. To test the hypothesis that prey availability affected the diversification of sabretooths we examined whether shifts in speciation and extinction rates were linked with changes in the species richness of their potential prey clades. The only association we detected was between the increase in extinction rates of North American sabretooths and the decline in Equidae richness. However, when accounting for the prey richness per species, regardless of taxonomic affiliation of the prey, we found that the endpoint of most sabretooth taxa occurred when prey richness for that taxon was at its lowest. Our analyses then suggested that reduced prey richness was associated with increased extinction risk. These results support the hypothesis that the extinction of sabretooths was associated with the decline in megafauna, but extend it to more remote times, millions of years before their final demise, suggesting that prey availability contributed to drive the diversification dynamics of the group. More broadly, our findings highlight the importance of ecological interactions in shaping macroevolutionary patterns.

AB  - The Millennium Ecosystem Assessment assessed ecosystem change, human wellbeing and scientific evidence for sustainable use of biological systems. Despite intergovernmental acknowledgement of the problem, global ecological decline has continued, including declines in insect biodiversity, which has received much media attention in recent years. Several roadmaps to averting biological declines have failed due to various economic and political factors, and so biodiversity loss continues, driven by several interacting human pressures. Humans are innately linked with nature but tend to take it for granted. The benefits we gain from the insect world are broad, yet aversion or phobias of invertebrates are common, and stand firmly in the path of their successful conservation. Providing an integrated synthesis for policy teams, conservation NGOs, academic researchers and those interested in public engagement, this article considers: (1) The lack of progress to preserve and protect insects. (2) Examples relating to insect decline and contributions insects make to people worldwide, and consequently what we stand to lose. (3) How to engage the public, governmental organizations and researchers through "insect contributions to people" to better address insect declines. International political will has consistently acknowledged the existence of biodiversity decline, but apart from a few narrow cases of charismatic megafauna, little meaningful change has been achieved. Public values are reflected in political willpower, the progress being made across the world, changing views on insects in the public should initiate a much-needed political sea-change. Taking both existing activity and required future actions, we outline an entomologist's "battle plan" to enormously expand our efforts and become the champions of insect conservation that the natural world needs.

AB  - Introduction: The effects of habitat loss and fragmentation on wildlife are complex processes mediated by factors other than habitat size and isolation alone. For example, the quality of the surrounding matrix, edge-induced effects, and proximity to large forest tracks are of particular importance. These factors may allow or limit animal movements and, thus, population persistence in human-modified landscapes. This is the case in some remaining forest fragments in Costa Rican landscapes. Objective: To investigate the influence of the landscape composition on medium (< 10 kg) and large-sized (> 10 kg) terrestrial mammals thriving in an agricultural landscape, we surveyed mammal species in 30 sites in the Sarapiqui region, Costa Rica. Methods: We used 45 camera traps to assess the richness and composition of mammal species in forest fragments embedded in pineapple plantations and pastures from 2013 to 2014. Richness estimates were calculated using capture-recapture models for closed populations. We adjusted the models for repeated count data analysis to determine landscape cover types that best explained species richness. Results: Twenty-two species of mammals in nine orders and 16 families were recorded. Despite the habitat loss, fragmentation, and agricultural practice pressures over the years, the Sarapiqui region maintains a significant portion of its native mammalian fauna compared to comprehensive historical inventories available for the area. We found that forest cover best predicts the levels of species richness. Conclusion: many forest-dependent species, such as the threatened Baird's Tapir, can thrive in fragmented habitats in agricultural landscapes, while other species seem to be heavily affected by habitat modification and land use type. Forested areas and pastures with a high density of scattered trees and proximity to extensive forests could enhance the conservation of mammal communities despite the intense human land use in these agricultural landscapes.

AB  - Forests canopy gaps play an important role in forest ecology by driving the forest mosaic cycle and creating conditions for rapid plant reproduction and growth. The availability of young plants, which represent resources for herbivores, and modified environmental conditions with greater availability of light and higher temperatures, promote the colonization of animals. Remarkably, the role of gaps on insect communities has received little attention and the source of insects colonizing gaps has not been studied comprehensively. Using a replicated full-factorial forest experiment (treatments: Gap; Gap + Deadwood; Deadwood; Control), we show that following gap creation, there is a rapid change in the true bug (Heteroptera) community structure, with an increase in species that are mainly recruited from open lands. Compared with closed-canopy treatments (Deadwood and Control), open canopy treatments (Gap and Gap + Deadwood) promoted an overall increase in species (+ 59.4%, estimated as number of species per plot) and individuals (+ 76.3%) of true bugs, mainly herbivores and species associated to herbaceous vegetation. Community composition also differed among treatments, and all 17 significant indicator species (out of 117 species in total) were associated with the open canopy treatments. Based on insect data collected in grasslands and forests over an 11-year period, we found that the species colonizing experimental gaps had greater body size and a greater preference for open vegetation. Our results indicate that animal communities that assemble following gap creation contain a high proportion of habitat generalists that not occurred in closed forests, contributing significantly to overall diversity in forest mosaics.

AB  - Browsing by ungulates can affect the development of a forest stand due to selective browsing and shifts in the growth ranking between tree species. Assessing browsing impact in an objective way is difficult in patchily distributed beech forests. In systematically arranged plots near Kirchberg, Switzerland, the height increment of the two saplings nearest to the plot center (k-tree method) was measured for each height class and tree species, and the within-tree browsing intensity and damage frequency were assessed. In total, 21 tree species were found. Browsing was particularly frequent in climate-adapted species. Winter browsing was more frequent than summer browsing, which was also true for deciduous species, and it significantly reduced height growth. Former damage along the main stem further reduced upgrowth. Browsing shifted the height increment ratio in favor of Fagus sylvatica. Many winter-browsed saplings of Abies alba, Fagus sylvatica, Acer pseudoplatanus, Fraxinus excelsior and Prunus avium had no new leader shoot by the end of the next growing season, i.e., browsing had a long-lasting impact. For estimating browsing impact, it is thus important to assess delays in the response after browsing. Foresters could easily apply the k-tree method in autumn for effective assessments of browsing impact.

AB  - Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) form extensive symbiotic relationships with plants, which are critical for plant-driven biogeochemical cycles and ecosystem functions. Grazing and mowing, which are common grassland utilization patterns globally, significantly alter plant community characteristics as well as soil nutrients and structure, thereby potentially influencing AMF communities. However, the effects of these grassland managements on AMF community structure and ecological processes remain unclear. Here, we investigated AMF communities in cattle grazing, sheep grazing, and mowing grasslands. We examined AMF community diversity, composition, assembly processes, and network interactions. Our results revealed distinct AMF compositions across different grassland managements. In cattle and sheep grazing grasslands, the AMF community assembly processes were determined by dispersal limitation and drift, with increased importance of stochasticity. Although AMF abundance did not alter by grassland managements, AMF diversity decreased under sheep grazing, associated with reduced pH levels compared to cattle grazing or mowing. AMF formed more complex (higher average degree and graph density) and integrated (lower modularity) networks in grazing grasslands than mowing grasslands. The AMF network in cattle grazing grasslands showed the highest stability, associated with a broader habitat niche, balanced interspecies competition, and higher soil AP and MBN. Meanwhile, some species with high adaptability to grazing became key nodes in the AMF network, such as Funneliformis. Our findings highlight significant AMF responses to grazing, including increased network complexity and ecological stochasticity, providing new insights into how grassland managements influence the composition and assembly patterns of soil symbiotic microbial communities.

AB  - Herbal leys (multispecies swards) can potentially deliver greater agronomic and environmental benefits than conventional grass-clover swards in grazed agroecosystems. However, despite their popularity in agri-environment schemes, little is known about the effect of herbal leys on soil physical (e.g., porosity), chemical (e.g., carbon), and biological (e.g., soil fauna) characteristics. In the UK, a 2-ha replicated-field experiment utilising a herbal or grass-clover ley (n = 3 per sward) aimed to investigate the effect of sward type on soil quality. Each sward was rotationally grazed by weaned lambs (3.2 LU ha(-1)) over two grazing seasons, with soil physiochemical and biological characteristics assessed after 2-years using techniques such as X-ray micro-Computed Tomography (mu CT) and microbial shallow shotgun sequencing. Soil chemical characteristics (e.g., pH) were unaffected by sward type. Similarly, topsoil (0-10 cm) organic carbon stocks measured after 2-years did not differ between the herbal (26.1 +/- 1.1 t C ha(-1)) and grass-clover ley (25.7 +/- 1.1 t C ha(-1)). X-ray mu CT analysis revealed greater pore connectivity (Euler number) in grass-clover ley intact soil cores (0-10 cm depth, 7.5 cm width) than herbal ley cores dominated by Plantago lanceolata (p = 0.008). However, there was no sward-type difference in aggregate stability or general pore characteristics, determined using X-ray mu CT, in air-dried 4 mm aggregates obtained from 0-5 or 5-10 cm depth, nor did sward type affect earthworm abundance, microbial community composition or the functional gene profile. This study is the first to explore the effects of a commercial herbal ley on physical, chemical, and biological soil quality indicators in a rotationally grazed sheep pasture. While no improvements in soil quality indicators were observed after 2-years, these findings have significant implications for agri-environment schemes promoting herbal leys to achieve soil quality and sustainability, with further research needed to optimise the seed mixture and management regime to deliver greater long-term below-ground ecosystem service benefits.

AB  - Amazonian floodplain lakes, distinguished by their water types, are crucial ecosystems for fish biodiversity. In these ecosystems, the annual hydrological cycle, known as the "flood pulse," is the primary driving force for fish productivity, providing habitat and feeding opportunities. However, how seasonal water level changes affect fish assemblages and feeding guild responses in floodplains with varying watershed characteristics is still poorly understood. We conducted a comparative stable isotope study in both a white-water and a black-water floodplain lake to investigate fish trophic dynamics during periods of rising and low water levels. Analyses of a broad taxonomic range of fish (seven orders and 27 families, with 73 and 82 taxa in the studied lakes, respectively) revealed that the fish assemblages in the studied white-water and black-water lakes exhibited different trophic dynamics in response to changes induced by the hydrological cycle. In contrast to the white-water lake, a strong, trophic guild-related effect shaped the delta 13C and delta 15N dynamics in the black-water lake. As a result, the fish assemblage in the black-water lake experienced significant trophic shifts with generally opposite dynamics over the water levels compared to the white-water lake. In the black-water lake, water level changes caused alterations in trophic niche width in almost all analyzed guilds (carnivorous, detritivorous, herbivorous, invertivorous, omnivorous, planktivorous), while this was less consistent in the white-water lake. Our results suggest that the fish assemblage in the nutrient-poor black-water lake is more dependent on the annual flood pulse and associated resources than in the white-water lake. These findings may further imply a relatively higher vulnerability of the black-water lake to alterations in the regular flood pulse compared to the white-water lake, indicating greater stability in feeding conditions and fish trophic dynamics in the latter.

AB  - Urbanization often results in biodiversity loss and homogenization, but this result is not universal and there is substantial variability in the spatiotemporal effects of urbanization on wildlife across cities and taxa. Areas with lower population and housing density are some of the fastest-growing regions in the western United States; thus, more research in these areas could offer additional insight into the effects of urbanization on wildlife and the potential importance of wild spaces in maintaining a diverse biotic community surrounding developed areas. To address this need, we conducted a study to identify the effects of urbanization (i.e. housing density) on mammals along a housing density gradient from wilderness to suburbia in Missoula, Montana. We deployed 178 motion-activated trail cameras at random sites within urban/suburban, exurban, rural, and wild regions from May to October 2019 to 2020. We identified all mammals >150 g, then evaluated how housing density influenced: (i) occupancy and (ii) species richness using multispecies occupancy models; (iii) relative abundance using Poisson models; and (iv) diel activity patterns using kernel density estimation and logistic regression. Urbanization was the strongest driver of mammal distribution, with a linear decline in mammal species richness as housing density increased. Urbanization also had strong effects on occupancy and detection rates, with larger-bodied mammals generally having stronger negative associations. Overall, mammal relative abundance was highest in suburban regions; however, this effect was largely driven by White-tailed Deer. Natural environmental factors explained most changes in mammal nocturnal activity; however, urbanization strongly affected nocturnality in some species, with Black Bear and White-tailed Deer becoming more nocturnal and Red Fox and Northern Raccoon becoming less nocturnal as housing density increased. While our study confirms that some mammals can live and thrive in developed areas, it emphasizes the importance of maintaining wild areas for those species that cannot.

AB  - Leptospirosis is an emerging zoonotic disease caused by bacteria of the genus Leptospira. Wild animals may present acute disease or become chronic hosts. The present study aimed to identify Leptospira spp. infection and determine circulating serogroups in free-ranging sambar deer (Rusa unicolor) in a fragment of peri-urban tropical forest in northeastern Brazil. Blood samples were collected and subjected to microscopic agglutination testing (MAT) and PCR analysis (genes lipL32 and secY). Anti-Leptospira antibodies were detected in 60% of the animals tested, with serogroups Cynopteri (33.4%), Hebdomadis (22.2%) and Grippotyphosa (22.2%) identified as most prevalent. DNA corresponding to the pathogenic species Leptospira interrogans was detected in 2/15 (13.3%) of the samples tested. Sambar deer experience a high level of exposure to Leptospira spp. in our epidemiological setting. It is important to emphasize the implementation of effective measures (i.e., maintaining habitats and reducing human contact) for the conservation of endangered species.

AB  - Global warming has pronounced effects on tundra vegetation, and rising mean temperatures increase plant growth potential across the Arctic biome. Herbivores may counteract the warming impacts by reducing plant growth, but the strength of this effect may depend on prevailing regional climatic conditions. To study how ungulates interact with temperature to influence growth of tundra shrubs across the Arctic tundra biome, we assembled dendroecological data from 20 sites, comprising 1153 individual shrubs and 223 63 annual growth rings. Evidence for ungulates suppressing shrub radial growth was only observed at intermediate summer temperatures (6.5 degrees C-9 degrees C), and even at these temperatures the effect was not strong. Multiple factors, including forage preferences and landscape use by the ungulates, and favourable climatic conditions enabling effective compensatory growth of shrubs, may weaken the effects of ungulates on shrubs, possibly explaining the weakness of observed ungulate effects. Earlier local studies have shown that ungulates may counteract the impacts of warming on tundra shrub growth, but we demonstrate that ungulates' potential to suppress shrub radial growth is not always evident, and may be limited to certain climatic conditions.

AB  - 1. Despite supporting a disproportionately large fraction of the global biodiversity, freshwater ecosystems are ranked as the most highly threatened habitats ahead of both terrestrial and marine ecosystems. Furthermore, many regions are still characterized by limited knowledge on taxonomy and ecology of freshwater fishes. The need for ecological information in understudied regions is important particularly where there are recent discoveries of new species and unique lineages and for threatened and endangered taxa that require conservation management.
   2. This study evaluated the trophic ecology of two freshwater fish species Sandelia bainsii and Amatolacypris trevelyani that are both classified as endangered in the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List. These two species, which are narrow-range endemics in the Eastern Cape, South Africa, comprise allopatric lineages whose ecology is poorly known. This study used stable isotope analysis to evaluate the food web patterns, explore the trophic niche dynamics and estimate the prey source contributions for the two species in different headwater habitats.
   3. The fishes isotopic niche sizes were spatially variable, suggesting the likely importance of stochastic variation in resource availability and probable interspecific interactions. The three lineages within S. bainsii exhibited low isotopic niche overlap onto those of sympatric fishes in most habitats. Isotopic mixing model revealed that these lineages' diets were mostly dominated by gatherers/collectors. In comparison, the two lineages within A. trevelyani exhibited high niche overlap with other species and generally had variable diets.
   4. Despite the low and high niche overlap patterns of S. bainsii and A. trevelyani, respectively, the isotopic niche overlap patterns of co-occurring species onto those of the former suggest the likely lack of competitive hierarchies. The trophic niche patterns of these two endangered species helped to shed some light on the potential invasion risks by non-piscivorous fishes with opportunistic feeding habits, which could exert competitive interspecific interactions.

AB  - Background Anthropogenic linear features change the behavior and selection patterns of species, which must adapt to these ever-increasing features on the landscape. Roads are a well-studied linear feature that alter the survival, movement, and distribution of animals. Less understood are the effects of fences on wildlife, though they tend to be more ubiquitous across the landscape than roads. Even less understood are potential indirect effects when fences are found in tandem with roads along transportation corridors. Methods We assessed how the spatial configuration of fences and roads effect the movement (crossing effect) and distribution (proximity effect) of a partially migratory pronghorn population (Antilocapra americana) on the grasslands of southern Alberta, Canada. We used data from 55 collared pronghorn within a step-selection function framework to assess the influence of 4 linear features: (1) pasture fences, (2) roads not fenced, (3) roads fenced on one side, and (4) roads fenced on both sides on the selection pattern of migratory and resident animals. We examined whether steps along a movement pathway (i.e., crossing effect) were influenced by the type of linear feature animals attempted to cross and, whether these features affected the distribution of pronghorn (i.e., proximity effect) across the landscape. Results The top model for crossing effect for both movement tactics contained all 4 linear features and land cover. Regression coefficients were negative for all linear features, indicating that individuals were less likely to chose steps that crossed linear features. For the proximity effect, migrant animals avoided all linear features except roads fenced on both sides, where they selected areas closer to this feature. Resident animals, on the other hand, were found closer to pasture fences but further from roads without fences. Conclusions Our results indicate that both fences and roads are indirectly affecting pronghorn resource use spatially and behaviorally, whether each linear feature is found separately or in tandem. Modifying existing fences and roads to account for responses to these distinct linear features could facilitate more successful crossing opportunities and/or shifts in distribution. Allowing pronghorn to freely move across the landscape will maintain functional connectivity to ensure population persistence of this endemic ungulate.

AB  - Due to the rapid growth of urban environments, interactions between animals and humans in cities are increasingly common. Large mammals, such as capybaras (Hydrochoerus hydrochaeris), provide benefits to people and biodiversity of urban areas, but can also result in conflicts, such as animal-vehicle collisions or disease transmission. As a consequence, understanding the space use of urban capybara, and the effect of human activity on capybaras, is conducive to the promotion of coexistence. We studied the home range and the role of human disturbance on activity and habitat selection of urban capybaras in the city of Campo Grande (Brazil). We monitored nine groups of capybaras living at four parks: two parks subjected to high human visitation on workdays and two on weekends. Home range of the urban capybaras in the study is larger than those reported in previous studies of wild capybaras. The capybaras under study presented a bimodal activity pattern, which was delayed on days of high human presence, increasing animals' nocturnality. In addition, habitat selection was completely altered on days of high human presence, leading animals to increase avoidance of urban areas and reversing the selectivity patterns for forests, grasslands, and water bodies, that capybaras show on days with low human presence. Even when completely surrounded by an anthropic environment, our results indicate that a mosaic of grasslands near a water body and forested areas will allow capybaras to maintain daily activity and large home ranges. However, human presence significantly altered the daily activity patterns and habitat selection of capybara. Urban planners should account for these data to improve the coexistence of capybaras with humans and thereby minimize the potential for conflicts.

AB  - Key message Different components of water balance and temperature reduce density and height growth of saplings of Picea abies (L.) H. Karst (Norway spruce), Abies alba Mill. (silver fir) and Fagus sylvatica L. (European beech) in mixed uneven-aged forests in the French Alps and Jura mountains. Ungulate browsing is an additional pressure on fir and beech that could jeopardise the renewal of these species in the future. Context The uncertainty in tree recruitment rates raises questions about the factors affecting regeneration processes in forests. Factors such as climate, light, competition and ungulate browsing pressure may play an important role in determining regeneration, forest structures and thus future forest composition. Aims The objective of this study was to quantify sapling densities and height increments of spruce, fir and beech and to identify dominant environmental variables influencing them in mixed uneven-aged forests in the French Alps and Jura mountains. Methods Sapling height increment and density were recorded in 152 plots, and non-linear mixed models were obtained to establish relations between them and environmental factors known to affect regeneration, namely altitude, slope, aspect, canopy openness, soil characteristics, temperature, precipitation and ungulate browsing. Results Regeneration density, varying from 0 to 7 saplings per m (2), decreased with sapling height and was also negatively affected for spruce by PET, but positively for fir by precipitation and for beech by mean annual soil water content. Height increment reached up to 50 cm annually, increasing with sapling height and canopy openness and decreasing under high maximum summer temperatures for spruce and beech. The statistical effect of different environmental variables varied slightly among species but trends were quite similar. Additionally, ungulate browsing was high, with fir being the most intensely browsed, followed closely by beech, while spruce was rarely browsed. Conclusions All these results suggest that more temperature warming and a decrease in water availability could negatively impact sapling growth and density in the three species, with possible reduction of forest renewal fluxes. The observed increase of ungulate populations leading to increased browsing could be particularly detrimental to fir saplings.

AB  - Herbivorous fish are key to maintaining a balance between coral and algae on reefs, where reefs with greater herbivore biomass often show lower algal cover. For reefs worldwide, algal turf cover is expanding and is increasingly used as an indicator of disturbance. Water depth affects reef fish composition; thus, it may be expected that herbivory could also differ by depth. We examined relationships between algal turf cover and biomass (g m(-2)), density (# m(-2)) and size (cm) of herbivore groups (grazers, browsers and scrapers) across shallow (< 6 m), mid (6-18 m) and deep (18-30 m) coral reefs in the Main Hawaiian Islands. We find that across all depth classes, algal turf cover decreased with increasing grazer and scraper density, with steeper relationships observed at mid and deep reefs than in shallow reefs. In contrast, algal turf cover slightly increased with increasing grazer and browser biomass at deep reefs. Considering fish size, algal turf cover increased with larger grazer and scrapers at mid and deep reefs. The results indicate that herbivorous fish density, rather than biomass, is a better indicator of reductions in algal turf cover and resulting coral-algal balance on Hawaiian reefs, where smaller fish exert greater top-down control on cover than larger fish. Despite significant differences in herbivorous fish compositions, length-frequency distributions and fishing intensities across depth, algal turf cover remains similar across depths. Increases in fishing would have a disproportionately negative impact in deep than shallow reefs due to a lower overall fish density, where grazing functions in deep reefs are maintained by significantly fewer and smaller grazers and browsers, and larger scrapers, than in shallow reefs. Developing an understanding of patterns of algal turf herbivory by depth is important to understanding the spatial scale at which herbivory and regime shifts operate.

AB  - A large number of non-native species have been introduced to urban ecosystems, and it is a distinctive feature of the urbanization process. However, it is unclear whether these non-native species have similar functional traits to native ones and are similarly integrated into the local food web. We evaluated the differences in leaf functional traits and herbivory between native and non-native species of common woody plants in 50 parks in Beijing, China. The nutrient contents, defensive traits, and levels of herbivory were measured in 2681 leaves across 138 (52 native and 86 non-native species) woody plant species. Results show that compared to native species, non-native trees showed greater potential for short-term carbon sequestration, lower nutrient contents, and chemical defense but similar levels of herbivory. Non-native shrubs had lower carbon contents and herbivory levels than native shrubs. Phylogenetic history explained much more of the variance in plant traits and herbivory than spatial variation, suggesting the high homogeneity of environments among different urban parks. Furthermore, the variation in leaf traits and herbivory of non-native species had higher uncertainty than that of native species. Our research findings indicate that compared to native species in urban ecosystems, non-native species have reduced plant-herbivore energy flow to primary consumers, which may hinder biodiversity at higher nutrient levels. In the future, urban parks should incorporate more native plant species and enhance environmental heterogeneity.

AB  - Climate change may affect the ability of hunters to harvest wildlife and, hence, threaten food security of local people. However, few studies have investigated the relative influence of environmental conditions on wildlife harvest rates. We harnessed a 24-year dataset of harvest dates for a boreal ungulate in a region where climate change is having pronounced impacts on snow depth, precipitation, and temperatures to investigate the effect of weather on harvest rates. We used generalized linear models and a model selection framework to examine the influence of weather covariates (snow depth, mean daily temperature, precipitation) and socio-economic factors (gasoline and red meat prices, employment rates, and moose [Alces americanus] harvest) on harvest rates of bison (Bison bison) in Yukon, Canada, at two temporal scales: annual and daily. At an annual scale, snow depth was the only covariate that was important in explaining bison harvest. No socioeconomic variables improved our model beyond the null. At the daily scale, snow depth and mean daily temperature influenced bison harvest rates, with a 1 SD increase resulting in a 14 % and 9 % increase in daily harvest rates, respectively. Increased snow depth facilitates ease of travel in remote, roadless areas by snowmobile to locate bison and truncates movements of bison, resulting in increased harvest rates. Decreased snow depth due to climate change will impact hunter access to boreal ungulates and food security for northern people. More broadly, our data suggests that in some socioecological systems, environmental covariates have a greater influence on wildlife harvest rates than socioeconomic factors and need to be considered in future studies to better understand and predict harvest rates.

AB  - The red imported fire ant (Solenopsis invicta, RIFA) is one of the most ecologically disruptive invasive species, yet its impacts on arthropod biodiversity within subtropical orchard agroecosystems-particularly guava (Psidium guajava) and cherimoya (Annona cherimola) plantations-remain insufficiently quantified. This study investigated how RIFA invasion influences arthropod community composition, diversity and trophic group dynamics across these 2 plantation systems in southern China. Results indicated that RIFA invasions significantly reduced both order- and family-level richness and evenness. Arthropod order richness declined markedly in invaded areas, with only 8 orders detected in invaded cherimoya plots compared to 11 in non-invaded plots. At the family level, diversity decreased by 75% in guava plantations (from 8 to 2 families) and by 60% in cherimoya plantations (from 10 to 4 families). In invaded plots, RIFAs constituted over 80% of the total arthropod population. Hedges' g effect sizes further revealed substantial increases in overall arthropod abundance (+277.62%) and RIFA-specific abundance (+357.42%), coupled with significant declines in family richness (-16.29%) and non-RIFA arthropod abundance (-22.78%). Piecewise structural equation modeling indicated that RIFA exerted strong, negative impacts on detritivores and omnivores, while herbivores were less affected, indirectly suppressing predators by reducing their prey base. Collectively, these findings suggested that RIFA invasion drove pronounced taxonomic homogenization, functional simplification and trophic imbalance within agricultural landscapes. Effective, long-term monitoring and biodiversity-focused management strategies are urgently needed to mitigate the ecological degradation driven by RIFA invasions in these critical agroecosystems.

AB  - Plant community productivity generally increases with biodiversity, but the strength of this relationship exhibits strong empirical variation. In meta-food-web simulations, we addressed if the spatial overlap in plants' resource access and animal space-use can explain such variability. We found that spatial overlap of plant resource access is a prerequisite for positive diversity-productivity relationships, but causes exploitative competition that can lead to competitive exclusion. Space-use of herbivores causes apparent competition among plants, resulting in negative relationships. However, space-use of larger top predators integrates sub-food webs composed of smaller species, offsetting the negative effects of exploitative and apparent competition and leading to strongly positive diversity-productivity relationships. Overall, our results show that spatial overlap of plants' resource access and animal space-use can greatly alter the strength and sign of such relationships. In particular, the scaling of animal space-use effects opens new perspectives for linking landscape processes without effects on biodiversity to productivity patterns.

AB  - The construction of the Suez Canal connected the Red Sea and the Mediterranean Sea, which allowed rapid marine bio-invasion. Over the last century, several bivalve species have invaded the Levantine basin, yet their distribution and impact on the benthic community have not been thoroughly studied. Large-scale benthic surveys along the rocky substrate of the Israeli Mediterranean coastline indicate that invading bivalves, such as Spondylus spinosus, Brachidontes pharaonis, and Pinctada radiata, now dominate the rocky environment, with densities of tens to hundreds of individuals per m(2). No native bivalve specimens were found in any of the transects surveyed. The small-scale ecological effects of the established invading populations on the benthic community were examined over a year using an in-situ exclusion experiment where all invading bivalves were either physically removed or poisoned and kept in place to maintain the physical effect of the shells. Surprisingly, the experimental exclusion showed a little measurable effect of bivalve presence on the invertebrate community in close vicinity (similar to 1 m). Bivalve presence had a small, but statistically significant, effect only on the community composition of macroalgae, increasing the abundance of some filamentous macroalgae and reducing the cover of turf. The generally low impact of bivalves removal could be due to (1) wave activity and local currents dispersing the bivalve excreta, (2) high grazing pressure, possibly by invading herbivorous fish, reducing the bottom-up effect of increased nutrient input by the bivalves, or (3) the natural complexity of the rocky habitat masking the contribution of the increased complexity associated with the bivalve's shell. We found that established invading bivalves have replaced native bivalve species, yet their exclusion has a negligible small-scale effect on the local benthic community.

AB  - Dietary supplementation is one of the most used strategies to reduce the effect of environmental fluctuations in arid and semi-arid environments. We evaluated changes in vegetation and in patterns of animal defoliation as a result of incorporating supplementation on semi-arid grasslands of Patagonia. We selected three paddocks on a sheep ranch where winter supplementation was carried out, and a feed silo was identified in each one. Fixed transects (50 m) were placed at increasing distances from the silos (100, 250 and 500 m), and several measurements were taken along the transects: grasses defoliation intensity; height, flowering and vigor of the key species; vegetation cover; and forage availability. Measurements were made during 3 seasons at two periods of the year. The defoliation intensity of species of low preference decreased with increasing distance from the silo, reaching at 100 m the same defoliation intensity as the preferred species, which did not change with distance. Vegetation, grasses and standing dead cover increased with distance from the silo. The use of dietary supplementation alters the animals' pattern of species selection and this has consequences for plant cover. It is therefore important to consider the possible long-term effects of using this technology.

AB  - Soil fauna performs several functions in native and anthropized ecosystems, being affected by spatiotemporal variation and by environmental resource availability. However, there is still a gap in knowledge of how land use change, climatic seasonality, and soil and climate variables impact trophic groups of soil fauna in semiarid environments. We investigated the abundance of detritivores, herbivores, microbivores and predators in three land uses (native forest, pasture and irrigated agriculture), during the dry and wet season, using two collection methods (manually separated soil monoliths and pitfalls) and the effects of soil and climate variables on soil fauna. Detritivore and predator activity was predominant in the 0-20 cm layer (monoliths), while herbivores and microbivores abundance were greater on the soil surface (pitfalls). Irrigated agricultural areas had higher abundance of soil fauna and a different community structure from native forest and pasture, due to continuous water availability. Climatic seasonal variables (temperature, air humidity, solar radiation and wind speed), soil characteristics (Macronutrients, C, C:N ratio, pH and CEC) and land use change impacted all trophic groups. Irrigated agriculture in semiarid regions can serve as a refuge for soil fauna, bringing light to a new community structure that can be shaped to shelter the highest possible biodiversity.

AB  - Globally, rangelands are undergoing rapid social-ecological changes, yet the scale of these changes is rarely measured. Fencing, sedentarization, and land conversion limit access by wildlife and livestock to vital resources such as water and seasonal forage, leading to rangeland degradation. In addition, these changes limit connectivity between wildlife sub-populations, triggering a spiral of decreasing biodiversity and weakening ecosystem function. Moreover, the combination of land privatization, sedentarization and fencing endangers pastoral livelihoods by reducing resilience to drought and diminishing livestock holdings per person. We provide a unique, urgent, and vital snapshot across >30,000 km(2) of southern Kenya's rangeland, covering four ecosystems renowned for their rich megafauna and pastoral people. We document and explore the drivers of extensive fencing (similar to 40,000 km), the proliferation of livestock enclosures (>27,000), and the conversion of rangelands for cultivation (similar to 1,500 km(2)). Our analyses were based on an open-access database recently synthesized for the region. Fencing is generally more prolific in areas that have been converted from community tenure to private title, especially where land values are raised by agricultural potential and proximity to Kenya's capital, Nairobi. These factors drive the transfer of land ownership from traditional pastoralists to speculators, eventually resulting in the transformation of rangeland into agricultural, industrial and urban land uses. Space for wildlife (and traditional pastoralism) is limited on private, subdivided land, where livestock enclosures are at their highest density, and where there is less unfenced land and less untransformed land, compared to conservation areas and pastoral commons. Conflicting planning incentives, policies, and economic forces are driving unsustainable and potentially irreversible social-ecological transitions over unprecedented spatial scales. The lesson from southern Kenya is that a range of financial, policy and governance-related interventions are required to allow people and nature to coexist sustainably in African savannas.

AB  - Patterns of insect diversity along elevational gradients are well described in ecology. However, it remains little tested how variation in the quantity, quality, and diversity of food resources influence these patterns. Here we analyzed the direct and indirect effects of climate, food quantity (estimated by net primary productivity), quality (variation in the specific leaf area index, leaf nitrogen to phosphorus and leaf carbon to nitrogen ratio), and food diversity (diversity of leaf traits) on the species richness of phytophagous beetles along the broad elevation and land use gradients of Mt. Kilimanjaro, Tanzania. We sampled beetles at 65 study sites located in both natural and anthropogenic habitats, ranging from 866 to 4,550 m asl. We used path analysis to unravel the direct and indirect effects of predictor variables on species richness. In total, 3,154 phytophagous beetles representing 19 families and 304 morphospecies were collected. We found that the species richness of phytophagous beetles was bimodally distributed along the elevation gradient with peaks at the lowest (similar to 866 m asl) and upper mid-elevations (similar to 3,200 m asl) and sharply declined at higher elevations. Path analysis revealed temperature- and climate-driven changes in primary productivity and leaf trait diversity to be the best predictors of changes in the species richness of phytophagous beetles. Species richness increased with increases in mean annual temperature, primary productivity, and with increases in the diversity of leaf traits of local ecosystems. Our study demonstrates that, apart from temperature, the quantity and diversity of food resources play a major role in shaping diversity gradients of phytophagous insects. Drivers of global change, leading to a change of leaf traits and causing reductions in plant diversity and productivity, may consequently reduce the diversity of herbivore assemblages.

AB  - Fires are a disturbance that can lead to short term dune destabilisation and have been suggested to be an initiation mechanism of a transgressive dune phase when paired with changing climatic conditions. Fire severity is one potential factor that could explain subsequent coastal dune destabilisations, but contemporary evidence of destabilisation following fire is lacking. In addition, the suitability of conventional satellite Earth Observation methods to detect the impacts of fire and the relative fire severity in coastal dune environments is in question. Widely applied satellite-derived burn indices (Normalised Burn Index and Normalised Difference Vegetation Index) have been suggested to underestimate the effects of fire in heterogenous landscapes or areas with sparse vegetation cover. This work assesses burn severity from high resolution aerial and Sentinel 2 satellite imagery following the 2019/2020 Black Summer fires on Kangaroo Island in South Australia, to assess the efficacy of commonly used satellite indices, and validate a new method for assessing fire severity in coastal dune systems. The results presented here show that the widely applied burn indices derived from NBR differentially assess vegetation loss and fire severity when compared in discrete soil groups across a landscape that experienced a very high severity fire. A new application of the Tasselled Cap Transformation (TCT) and Disturbance Index (DI) is presented. The differenced Disturbance Index (dDI) improves the estimation of burn severity, relative vegetation loss, and minimises the effects of differing soil conditions in the highly heterogenous landscape of Kangaroo Island. Results suggest that this new application of TCT is better suited to diverse environments like Mediterranean and semi-arid coastal regions than existing indices and can be used to better assess the effects of fire and potential remobilisation of coastal dune systems.

AB  - Aim Plant herbivory and disease, which are often associated with each other but subject to different processes, are pivotal in biodiversity maintenance and ecosystem function. Although drivers of plant herbivory and disease have been widely studied separately, their relationships, patterns and determinants remain unclear in fragmented landscapes. Methods We surveyed incidence and severity of foliar herbivory and disease of 2,027 adult trees within 30 sites in 17 tropical forest fragments in Xishuangbanna, southwestern China. We aim to explore the relationship of plant herbivory and disease, and effects of local environmental variables (forest type, plant richness, elevation, slope, soil properties) and landscape environmental variables (patch size, edge distance, isolation). Results We found that incidence, but not severity of disease was positively correlated with that of herbivory. Herbivory severity and incidence were more associated with local variables; both increased with plant richness but decreased with soil nutrients and pH. In contrast, the landscape variable isolation was the dominant driver of disease, with lower severity and incidence in contiguous forests than forest fragments. Conclusion In summary, we show that herbivory and disease are associated with drivers at different scales in fragmented landscapes. Herbivory is mainly driven by local-scale variables, while disease is mainly driven by landscape-scale variables. To control plant herbivory and disease in fragmented landscapes, increasing landscape connectivity and conserving different forest types are urgently required to maintain ecosystem functions under global land use change.

AB  - The Black-winged Myna (Acridotheres melanopterus) is an Endangered passerine endemic to the islands of Java and Bali, Indonesia. Illegal trapping to supply the cage-bird trade has led to its near-total extinction, with the global population estimated to number fewer than 100 individuals. We estimated the current range and population size of the species at Baluran National Park, which supports Java's last known population, and used species distribution modeling to evaluate potential suitability of currently unoccupied areas across the park to identify priorities for management intervention. We estimate that the Black-winged Myna population numbers 179 individuals (95% CI: 111-288; density: 14.3 +/- 3.5 individuals km(2)) and that its current range is 12.3 km'. Our model indicated that some 72 km(2) of the park (30% of total area) has potentially suitable habitat for the species, and we infer that the principal cause for the disparity between its current and potential range is trapping, compounded by savanna loss and degradation due to illegal domestic cattle grazing and the spread of invasive thorny acacia (Vachellia nilotica). The partial clearance of acacia in recent years appears to have assisted a modest population recovery by the myna. Its further population growth and range expansion in Baluran will depend on effective management of illegal poaching, further clearance of acacia, and easing domestic cattle grazing pressure on areas of savanna, particularly through engagement with communities living inside the park. Any actions that increase the size of the Black-winged Myna population are likely to benefit other threatened savanna-dependent wildlife in the park, notably banteng (Bos javanicus) and Green Peafowl (Pavo muticus). While our models and recommendations may be applicable to other protected areas in Java, and indeed other threatened myna species, trapping and habitat change may have site-specific dimensions, especially outside of protected areas, and thus demand local bespoke solutions.

AB  - Seagrass beds are composed of foundation species, providing essential nursery grounds, feeding areas, and refuge for various marine life. Several species of fish and invertebrates utilize seagrasses as essential habitat. The Dwarf Seahorse (Hippocampus zosterae) is an understudied species in Texas, and little is known about its density, distribution, and habitat associations in this area of their range. Physicochemical water parameters, nekton community data, habitat data, and Dwarf Seahorse catch data were collected at 80 sites in Texas. The highest catch per unit effort (CPUE) of the target species was in Aransas Bay (0.038/m2). There was a positive relationship between the presence and percent cover of turtle grass (Thalassia testudinum) and the presence and CPUE of Dwarf Seahorses. Dwarf Seahorses were detected more often and at a higher CPUE in locations with a higher seagrass community diversity and richness. The nekton community at sites where Dwarf Seahorses were detected was also more abundant, diverse, and species rich. This is the first comprehensive study of the distribution of the Dwarf Seahorse along the Texas coast. Dwarf Seahorses were generally found in higher abundances in association with mature, stable, and diverse seagrass beds. Recommended conservation strategy to protect Dwarf Seahorses should prioritize the protection of established and mature seagrass beds. Continued directed monitoring of this species is recommended to better understand their distribution and population status.

AB  - Proboscideans were keystone Cenozoic megaherbivores and present a highly relevant case study to frame the timing and magnitude of recent megafauna extinctions against long-term macroevolutionary patterns. By surveying the entire proboscidean fossil history using model-based approaches, we show that the dramatic Miocene explosion of proboscidean functional diversity was triggered by their biogeographical expansion beyond Africa. Ecomorphological innovations drove niche differentiation; communities that accommodated several disparate proboscidean species in sympatry became commonplace. The first burst of extinctions took place in the late Miocene, approximately 7 million years ago (Ma). Importantly, this and subsequent extinction trends showed high ecomorphological selectivity and went hand in hand with palaeoclimate dynamics. The global extirpation of proboscideans began escalating from 3 Ma with further extinctions in Eurasia and then a dramatic increase in African extinctions at 2.4 Ma. Overhunting by humans may have served as a final double jeopardy in the late Pleistocene after climate-triggered extinction trends that began long before hominins evolved suitable hunting capabilities.
   The authors use model-based approaches to examine the entire fossil history of proboscideans, from their dispersal outside of Afro-Arabia in the Oligocene to late Miocene extirpations and Quaternary collapse, identifying the innovations that allowed this group to overcome 60 million years of severe environmental shifts.

AB  - Populations of woodland caribou (Rangifer tarandus caribou) are declining throughout their range and many are at risk of extirpation, yet the role of nutrition in these declines remains poorly understood, in part owing to a lack of information about available nutritional resources during summer. We quantified rates of intake of digestible protein and digestible energy by tame caribou foraging in temporary enclosures in the predominant plant communities of northeastern British Columbia, Canada, during summer-autumn and compared intake rates to daily requirements for protein and energy during lactation. We tested hypotheses related to the nutritional adequacy of the environment to support nutritional requirements during lactation (with and without replenishment of body reserves) and simulated scenarios of foraging by caribou in these plant communities to better understand how wild caribou could meet nutritional demands on these landscapes. Nutritional resources varied among plant communities across seasonal, ecological, and successional gradients; digestible energy intake per minute and per day were significantly greater in younger than older forests; dietary digestible energy and per-minute and daily intake of digestible protein were greater, though not significantly so, in younger than older forests; and dietary digestible protein was greater in older than younger forests, though differences were not significant. Tame caribou were unable to satisfy protein and energy requirements during lactation, even without replenishment of body reserves, at most sites sampled. Further, foraging simulations suggested widespread nutritional inadequacies on ranges of wild caribou. Selection for habitats offering the best nutrition may mitigate some nutritional inadequacies, but given low availability of vegetation communities with high nutritional value, performance (e.g., calf production, growth, replenishment of body fat and protein) of caribou may be depressed at levels of nutrition documented herein. Our results, coupled with recent measurements of body fat of wild caribou in northeastern British Columbia, refute the hypothesis that the nutritional environment available to caribou during summer in northeastern British Columbia is adequate to fully support nutritional demands of lactating caribou, which has implications to productivity of caribou populations, recovery, and conservation.

AB  - New data were obtained for the Chulym River basin in the southeastern part of the West Siberian Plain, one of the understudied parts of Siberia in terms of age and composition of carbon and nitrogen stable isotopes for Late Pleistocene megafauna. The C-14 dates from the Sergeevo outcrop, the most complete section of Late Quaternary deposits in the region, are mostly greater than similar to 30 550 Bp. Other localities yielded C-14 values in the range from >44 500 to similar to 19 300 Bp. The finite date of similar to 42 270 Bp for the Khozarian steppe elephant (Mammuthus trogontherii chosaricus) from Asino is intriguing because previously it was not detected in the Late Pleistocene of Siberia after the last interglacial (Marine Isotope Stage 5e), similar to 115 000-130 000 years ago. Stable isotope data show both similarities and differences compared to the pre-Last Glacial Maximum megafaunal species in other parts of Siberia. (C) 2022 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Global change is associated with variable shifts in the annual production of aboveground plant biomass, suggesting localized sensitivities with unclear causal origins. Combining remotely sensed normalized difference vegetation index data since the 1980s with contemporary field data from 84 grasslands on 6 continents, we show a widening divergence in site-level biomass ranging from +51% to -34% globally. Biomass generally increased in warmer, wetter and species-rich sites with longer growing seasons and declined in species-poor arid areas. Phenological changes were widespread, revealing substantive transitions in grassland seasonal cycling. Grazing, nitrogen deposition and plant invasion were prevalent in some regions but did not predict overall trends. Grasslands are undergoing sizable changes in production, with implications for food security, biodiversity and carbon storage especially in arid regions where declines are accelerating.
   Remotely sensed NDVI data and contemporary field data from 84 grasslands on 6 continents show increasing divergence in aboveground plant biomass between sites in different bioclimatic regions.

AB  - Seismic lines-narrow and straight corridors from which overstory has been removed to allow access for oil and gas exploration-are a major human footprint in the boreal forest of western Canada. With slow to minimal recovery of tree cover along these corridors, seismic lines have become a persistent landscape feature affecting connectivity and habitat quality in forested ecosystems, particularly in wetland areas. Soil mounding is a common ground preparation treatment widely applied along seismic lines, with the expectation that it will enhance tree seedling establishment and improve the return of tree cover to disturbed areas. However, much is still unknown about environmental responses following treatment application. In this study, we compared the ground microtopography in treated and untreated seismic lines, as well as the relative elevation between treated and untreated seismic lines with their adjacent treed peatland. The ground elevation in both treated and untreated sites was significantly lower on seismic lines relative to their adjacent treed peatland, with a greater elevation difference in treated areas. Likewise, ground microtopography was orders of magnitude higher along treated areas compared to the natural variation in the adjacent treed peatland. Given the important changes in relative elevation and topography following treatment application, our results suggest the potential for eventual treatment success may be more unpredictable than expected; this may have critical consequences for other ecological properties beyond the restoration goal of tree establishment and return of tree cover.

AB  - The Malayan tapir (Tapirus indicus) is an endangered species endemic to Southeast Asia. Previous research have used maternally inherited, mitochondrial DNA genetic markers to investigate the population genetics of the species but not the biparentally inherited, nuclear genetic markers. However, the increasing pressure of habitat fragmentation and roadkill on the Malayan tapirs has called for an urgent need to assess the species' genetic status. In this study, the genetic diversity, population genetic structure, and sex-biased dispersal patterns of the tapir population in Penin-sular Malaysia were investigated using nine cross-species microsatellite markers, using sixty-seven tapir samples (39 wild, 11 captive-born, and 17 of unknown origin) provided by the wildlife department, zoo and conservation centre. Low genetic diversity of the wild population was found based on heterozygosity and allelic richness, and a cryptic pattern of population ge-netic structure was inferred. One (K = 3) to two (K = 4) genetic clusters in proximity to the south-western part of the major forest complexes seemed to be experiencing restricted gene flows compared to the other more widespread clusters or clines. Effective to census population size was estimated at 0.39-0.46. Sex-biased dispersal was not found in the current dataset. Even though these results may need cautious interpretation due to possible sampling bias, this study is the first study that investigated the genetic diversity distribution for the species using nuclear markers, and therefore will have conservation implications for the implementation of the Central Forest Spine Master Plan in Peninsular Malaysia to connect major forest complexes.

AB  - Animals are inherently tied to nutritional resources of the landscape. Added cost of coping with environmental stressors, like disease, can exacerbate nutritional limitations. Pneumonia, a respiratory disease caused primarily by bacterial pathogens, has caused massive declines in populations of bighorn sheep (Ovis canadensis) throughout western North America. Nevertheless, population dynamics following a pneumonia epizootic vary across populations, which has spawned the idea that ecological conditions may play a role in regulating populations after a die-off. We used 2 bighorn sheep populations with contrasting dynamics to test the hypothesis that habitat quality on summer range affects population dynamics following a pneumonia epizootic. We sampled over 700 vegetation transects and quantified nutrient content of 2,093 forage samples of 127 genera on summer ranges to compare habitat quality (macro- and micronutrients in forage, biomass, plant cover, and species diversity) between the ranges. The population exhibiting growth, higher recruitment, and better nutritional condition had over double the herbaceous biomass in their core foraging areas in summer than the population exhibiting decline, lower recruitment, and poorer nutritional status. The population experiencing growth also had more macro- and micronutrients available on their summer range as a function of higher biomass along with higher species diversity. Although winter range often is considered the nutritional bottleneck for ungulates, we demonstrate that the conditions of summer range can have consequences for population dynamics. Habitat quality should be incorporated when considering management objectives and population recovery of large herbivores in the presence of disease; interactions between habitat quality and population dynamics still apply and likely are amplified with additional stressors like disease.

AB  - The effects of gastropod Biomphalaria sp. on the benthic algae community (micro and macroalgae) were experimentally studied in an unshaded artificial stream. Using artificial substrates, two treatments were tested: with herbivores and without herbivores. The substrates remained submerged for 50 days, and the environmental and biological variables (algal abundance and richness) were obtained on days 7, 15, 30, 40 and 50 after the experiment has been installed. Repeated measure analyses of variance were applied to verify possible differences of chlorophyll-a content, species richness, microalgal density and macroalgal density and percent cover between treatments at each date. Results showed that herbivory pressure reduces significantly all measured biotic variables except algal richness. Higher presence of macroalgae was related to a higher presence of microalgae in the substrates, indicating a potential relationship between these components. Thus, it seems that herbivore activity over microalgal biomass may have an indirect and negative effect on macroalgae, so that a reduction in microalgal density by grazing may have led to a corresponding decrease in abundance of macroalgae. Thus, the results suggest that the establishment and development of macroalgae in lotic environments can be regulated by a top-down cascade effect, in which the action of herbivores, herein the scraper Biomphalaria sp., on microalgae indirectly impacts the abundance of macroalgae.

AB  - Wild pigs (Sus scrofa), which are invasive in many regions globally, can alter ecosystems and compete with native species through interference competition and resource exploitation. Wild pig impacts on other species may increase with greater niche overlap, which could vary over time based on environmental conditions, resource availability, or biological traits like diet, especially as seasonal variation in wild pig diet has been widely documented. A limited number of studies have assessed spatial or temporal overlap between native species and invasive wild pigs, with only a handful simultaneously assessing overlap in these niche dimensions. We investigated the potential for interspecific interactions involving invasive wild pigs in the Piedmont region of South Carolina, USA, by examining seasonal spatiotemporal overlap with other wildlife using N-mixture models and diel activity overlap analyses. Site use by white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) and coyote (Canis latrans) was negatively associated with wild pig activity in the fall, when the species had high diel activity overlap, indicating spatial partitioning could reduce interference competition with wild pigs in this season. Conversely, white-tailed deer site use was positively associated with wild pig activity in the winter, suggesting higher spatial overlap may be necessary if resources are limited. Site use by bobcat (Lynx rufus) and nine-banded armadillo (Dasypus novemcinctus) in the spring, along with raccoon (Procyon lotor) and wild turkey (Meleagris gallopavo) site use in the summer, was positively associated with wild pig activity. With the exception of diurnal wild turkey, diel activity overlap between these species and wild pigs was high, although temporal partitioning could have occurred at finer spatiotemporal scales than we examined. Our results collectively emphasize the importance of accounting for seasonal spatial and temporal responses by individual species to invasive wild pigs, with special consideration given to species in seasons where high niche overlap with wild pigs is anticipated.

AB  - Human-wildlife conflict in expanding peri-urban and urban areas is of increasing concern, as a result of growing human populations along with the associated anthropogenic footprint on wildlife habitats. Empirical data from wildlife research carried out within human dominated landscapes are key to understanding the effects of human pressures on wildlife ecology and behaviour, exploring wildlife behavioural flexibility (or phenotypic plasticity), and informing wildlife management decisions. Here, we explored how female fallow deer (Dama dama) responded to human and dog presence during the birthing period in the largest walled urban park in Europe. We collected data on 477 bedsites utilised by 283 neonate fawns across three consecutive fawning seasons, gathered fine-scale data on humans and dogs space use, and built Resource Selection Functions at multiple spatial scales. We found that, when choosing bedsites to give birth and leave fawns unattended, fallow deer mothers significantly avoided hotspots of park visitors on foot (and their dogs) along the hiking trail routes. Bedsites were also unlikely to be in close proximity of paved roads used by vehicle traffic. Additionally, fallow deer mothers were found to select for dense understory vegetation for bedsites, providing low visibility to conceal their offspring. Our results provide detailed insights into bedsite spatial and habitat selection by a large herbivore in response to human activities, and we provide clear indications to wildlife managers to preserve established fawning sites and alleviate human-wildlife conflict during a critical period of the deer annual biological cycle.

AB  - Grazing by wildlife on agricultural land is widespread across geographical regions, and can cause human-wildlife conflicts due to reduced crop yield when the grazing pressure is high. Growing red deer Cervus elaphus populations in Europe call for an increased understanding of their grazing patterns to mitigate damages. We quantified how red deer grazing pressure (grazing presence and grazing level) on agricultural grass meadows (n = 60) in Norway varied across multiple spatial scales. We used a nested, hierarchical study design transcending from a broad scale (meadows across the landscape) to intermediate (between nearby meadows) and local (within-meadow) scales, allowing us to identify at which scale the variation in grazing pressure was strongest. We estimated how grazing was determined by broad-scale factors influencing forage availability and quality through population density, distance to coastline, and differences between the first versus second harvest, by intermediate-scale factors in terms of meadow management causing differences in botanical composition and quality, and by local-scale factors in terms of perceived predation risk and disturbance. At a broad scale, higher population densities were associated with higher grazing pressure, and more grazing occurred before the first compared to the second harvest. Intermediate-scale factors explained the most variation of grazing pressure from red deer, with higher grazing pressure on newly renewed meadows compared to other nearby meadows. On a local scale, more grazing occurred closer to the forest edge, providing cover, and further away from infrastructure, with increased risk and disturbance. Overall, our study highlights how drivers of grazing pressure on agricultural land vary across spatial scales. Population reductions on a broader scale may have some effect in reducing the grazing pressure, but renewed meadows will nevertheless attract red deer, causing higher grazing pressure compared to neighbouring meadows. This insight is crucial for determining effective mitigation strategies facing rising red deer populations across Europe.

AB  - Increased ocean temperatures have led to large-scale declines in many ecologically important species, including kelp forests. Spatial heterogeneity across seascapes could protect kelp individuals and small populations from thermal stress and nutrient limitation. Habitat features within upwelling regions may facilitate the transport of deep, cold water into shallow systems, but little is known about the spatiotemporal occurrence or stability of these climate refugia. Kelp in climate refugia may, however, also experience other stressors, such as overgrazing by kelp herbivores, reducing their effectiveness. Here, we use high-resolution kelp canopy maps generated from CubeSat constellation data to characterize kelp persistence in northern California following a dramatic decline in kelp abundance due to increased temperature and nutrient limitation during a severe marine heatwave and continued intense grazing pressure by purple sea urchins. Kelp persistence was associated with local areas of relatively cool water temperature and seascape features such as shallow depths and low-complexity bathymetry, which may have provided refuge from overgrazing. However, a very small percentage of kelp forests in the region exhibited high persistence, with many forests present in only one or two of the 9 years studied. Most kelp patches were not spatially stable over time. Initially, kelp presence aligned with climate refugia, but as overgrazing emerged as the dominant driver of kelp distributions post-2019, kelp shifted to areas that offered protection from grazing pressure. Synthesis. Cooler areas with localized upwelling acted as climate refugia during the increased ocean temperatures from the 2014-2016 marine heatwave, supporting nutrient-rich environments and mitigating heat stress for kelp forests. However, these temperature refugia often did not spatially overlap with areas providing protection from grazing pressure, leaving kelp forests vulnerable to future warming even within temperature refugia if grazing pressure remains high.

AB  - Ungulate species are classified as 'hiders' rather than 'followers' when neonates tend to remain separated from their mother and hidden within vegetation during the early postpartum period. Among species, hiding is associated with the availability of cover habitat; however, our understanding of these behaviours often has been limited to relatively coarse and infrequent observations. We leveraged modern technologies, including GPS collars affixed to neonates, LiDAR, fine-scaled encounter risk with predators, accelerometers and multiscale temperature readings, to complement these observations in evaluating how predation risk, thermoregulation and nutritional attributes of habitat contribute to hiding behaviour and its consequences for survival in mule deer, Odocoileus hemionus. Hiding decisions by mule deer were nuanced and counter to prevailing notions that suggest hiding is associated with increasing availability of cover. In support of the risk hypothesis, mule deer were most likely to hide in areas where vegetation height was low and encounter risk with predators was high, and behavioural shifts were prominent relative to variation in time of day, with hiding behaviour increasing at night during periods of predator activity. Nutrition and thermoregulatory hypotheses were supported in that hiding was more likely and neonate and mother were in closer proximity in areas with greater resource availability, and neonates adjusted hiding behaviour to minimize thermoregulatory costs. Variation in hiding indicated the importance of activity and interaction with the mother for neonate survival. Broad-scale habitat patterns have proven useful for defining hiding behaviour across species and may play an important role in setting the bounds that define individual variation; however, we encourage considering local conditions as drivers of hiding and following behaviour in ungulates. Together, patterns across multiple scales are more likely to describe the nature of neonate behaviour, relative to considerations at one scale alone.

AB  - Simple Summary Climate change is profoundly affecting ecosystem dynamics, with grassland arthropods serving as critical indicators. This in situ study examines the responses of arthropod communities to rising temperatures in intensively managed pastures on the volcanic island of Terceira (Azores, Portugal), employing a functional trait approach. Along an elevation gradient, Open Top Chambers (OTCs) were used to simulate increased temperatures, allowing the analysis of soil-dwelling arthropods over winter and summer seasons. Our results underscore the nuanced responses of arthropods to temperature variations across elevations and treatments within intensive pastures, revealing significant changes in functional community composition. This study emphasizes the importance of considering functional traits when assessing patterns of diversity in complex ecological communities involving multiple trophic levels.Abstract This study investigates the impact of elevated temperatures on arthropod communities in intensively managed pastures on the volcanic island of Terceira, Azores (Portugal), using a functional trait approach. Open Top Chambers (OTCs) were employed to simulate increased temperatures, and the functional traits of ground dwelling arthropods were analyzed along a small elevation gradient (180-400 m) during winter and summer. Key findings include lower abundances of herbivores, coprophagous organisms, detritivores, and fungivores at high elevations in summer, with predators showing a peak at middle elevations. Larger-bodied arthropods were more prevalent at higher elevations during winter, while beetles exhibited distinct ecological traits, with larger species peaking at middle elevations. The OTCs significantly affected the arthropod communities, increasing the abundance of herbivores, predators, coprophagous organisms, and fungivores during winter by alleviating environmental stressors. Notably, iridescent beetles decreased with elevation and were more common inside OTCs at lower elevations, suggesting a thermoregulatory advantage. The study underscores the importance of considering functional traits in assessing the impacts of climate change on arthropod communities and highlights the complex, species-specific nature of their responses to environmental changes.

AB  - Biomes of the world have long been assumed to be determined by climate. Major disparities, where open low biomass systems occurred in the same climate zone as closed forests have been dismissed as products of deforestation. Many of these open ecosystems of the world, have been shown to be of ancient origins, stable alternatives to forests, and typically maintained by disturbance regimes. Open ecosystems include some of the most biodiverse regions in the world. They are often consumer-controlled by large mammal herbivores or fire. Mosaics of closed forest and open ecosystems have been interpreted as alternative stable states with each state maintained by positive feedbacks to environmental conditions that maintain that state. For example, flammable grasses maintain fires which consume woody plants, while closed forests exclude flammable grasses by shading them out. Understanding open ecosystems may therefore require some radical revision of familiar ecological concepts, starting with the hypothesis that climate largely determines world vegetation patterns. Open ecosystems function differently from forests in an earth system context affecting the hydrological cycle, rates of rock weathering, and presenting a different planetary surface to solar radiation reaching the earth's land surface. Open ecosystems require explicit attention in conservation policy and management.

AB  - Understanding and predicting animal movement is fundamental to ecology and conservation management. Models that estimate and then predict animal movement and habitat selection parameters underpin diverse conservation applications, from mitigating invasive species spread to enhancing landscape connectivity. However, many predictive models overlook fine-scale temporal dynamics within their predictions, despite animals often displaying fine-scale behavioural variability that might significantly alter their movement, habitat selection and distribution over time. Incorporating fine-scale temporal dynamics, such as circadian rhythms, within predictive models might reduce the averaging out of such behaviours, thereby enhancing our ability to make predictions in both the short and long term. We tested whether the inclusion of fine-scale temporal dynamics improved both fine-scale (hourly) and long-term (seasonal) spatial predictions for a significant invasive species of northern Australia, the water buffalo Bubalus bubalis. Water buffalo require intensive management actions over vast, remote areas and display distinct circadian rhythms linked to habitat use. To inform management operations we generated hourly and dry season prediction maps by simulating trajectories from static and temporally dynamic step selection functions (SSFs) that were fitted to the GPS data of 13 water buffalo. We found that simulations generated from temporally dynamic models replicated the buffalo crepuscular movement patterns and dynamic habitat selection, resulting in more informative and accurate hourly predictions. Additionally, when the simulations were aggregated into long-term predictions, the dynamic models were more accurate and better able to highlight areas of concentrated habitat use that might indicate high-risk areas for environmental damage. Our findings emphasise the importance of incorporating fine-scale temporal dynamics in predictive models for species with clear dynamic behavioural patterns. By integrating temporally dynamic processes into animal movement trajectories, we demonstrate an approach that can enhance conservation management strategies and deepen our understanding of ecological and behavioural patterns across multiple timescales.Keywords: circadian, fine-scale dynamics, harmonics, landscape-scale distributions, simulated trajectories, temporal dynamics

AB  - Animal behaviour is shaped by the ability to identify risks and profitably balance the levels of risks encountered with the payoffs experienced. Anthropogenic disturbances like roads generate novel risks and opportunities that wildlife must accurately perceive and respond to. Basic concepts in predator-prey ecology are often used to understand responses of animals to roads (e.g. increased vigilance, selection for cover in their vicinity). However, prey often display complex behaviours such as modulating space use given varying risks and rewards, and it is unclear if such dynamic balancing is used by animals in the context of road crossings.We tested whether animals dynamically balance risks and rewards relative to roads using extensive field-based and GPS collar data from elk in Yoho National Park (British Columbia, Canada), where a major highway completely bisects their range during most of the year.We analysed elk behaviour by combining hidden Markov movement models with a step-selection function framework. Rewards were indexed by a dynamic map of available forage biomass, and risks were indexed by road crossings and traffic volumes.We found that elk generally selected intermediate and high forage biomass, and avoided crossing the road. Most of the time, elk modulated their behaviour given varying risks and rewards. When crossing the highway compared with not crossing, elk selected for greater forage biomass and this selection was stronger as the number of highway crossings increased. However, with traffic volume, elk only balanced foraging rewards when they crossed a single time during a travel sequence.Using a road ecology system, we empirically tested an important component of predator-prey ecology-the ability to dynamically modulate behaviour in response to varying levels of risks and rewards. Such a test articulates how decision-making processes that consider the spatiotemporal variation in risks and rewards allow animals to successfully and profitably navigate busy roads. Applying well-developed concepts in predator-prey theory helps understand how animals respond to anthropogenic disturbances and anticipate the adaptive capacity for individuals and populations to adjust to rapidly changing environments.

AB  - Invasion of nonindigenous species is considered one of the most urgent problems affecting native ecosystems and agricultural systems. Mechanistic models that account for short-term population dynamics can improve prediction because they incorporate differing demographic processes that link the environmental conditions of a spatial location explicitly with the invasion process. Yet short-term population dynamics are rarely accounted for in spatial models of invasive species spread.Accounting for transient (short-term) population dynamics that arise from the interaction of age structure and vital rates, we predict the stochastic population growth rate and establishment probability of wild pigs following introduction into any location in North America. Established ecological theory suggests that the rate of spatial spread is proportional to population growth rate. Using observed geographic distribution data for wild pigs we calculated geographic spread rates (watersheds/year) from 1982 to 2021. We investigated if observed spread rates increased in watersheds with higher stochastic population growth rates. Stochastic population growth rate and establishment probability of wild pigs increased with increasing initial population (propagule) size and length of establishment time. Areas along the Mississippi, Ohio, and lower portions of the Missouri river drainages had the highest probability of wild pig establishment with many regions having probabilities close to 1. Spread rates demonstrated strong spatial heterogeneity with the greatest rates of spread (5.8 watersheds/year) occurring from 2008 to 2013 prior to the establishment of a National wild pig control program in 2013. Spread rates declined 82% (0.57 watersheds/year) in the period from 2013 to 2021 compared to the period from 1982 to 2013. We found significant positive associations among stochastic population growth rate and observed geographic rates of spread. Stochastic population growth rate explained a large amount of variation (79.3-92.1%) in annual rate of watershed spread of wild pigs. Our predicted probabilities of establishment and population growth can be used to inform surveillance and control efforts to reduce the potential for establishment and spread of wild pigs.

AB  - Bird colonies on islands sustain elevated productivity and biomass on adjacent reefs, through nutrient subsidies. However, the implications of this localized enhancement on higher and often more mobile trophic levels (such as sharks and rays) are unclear, as spatial trends in mobile fauna are often poorly captured by traditional underwater visual surveys. Here, we explore whether the presence of seabird colonies is associated with enhanced abundances of sharks and rays on adjacent coral reefs. We used a novel long-range water-landing fixed-wing unoccupied aerial vehicle (UAV) to survey the distribution and density of sharks, rays and any additional megafauna, on and around tropical coral islands (n = 14) in the Chagos Archipelago Marine Protected Area. We developed a computer-vision algorithm to distinguish greenery (trees and shrubs), sand and sea glitter from visible ocean to yield accurate marine megafauna density estimation. We detected elevated seabird densities over rat-free islands, with the commonest species, sooty tern, reaching densities of 932 +/- 199 per km(-2) while none were observed over former coconut plantation islands. Elasmobranch density around rat-free islands with seabird colonies was 6.7 times higher than around islands without seabird colonies (1.3 +/- 0.63 vs. 0.2 +/- SE 0.1 per km(2)). Our results are evidence that shark and ray distribution is sensitive to natural and localized nutrient subsidies. Correcting for non-sampled regions of images increased estimated elasmobranch density by 14%, and our openly accessible computer vision algorithm makes this correction easy to implement to generate shark and ray and other wildlife densities from any aerial imagery. The water-landing fixed-wing long-range UAV technology used in this study may provide cost effective monitoring opportunities in remote ocean locations.

AB  - Adjustments or complete withdrawal of livestock grazing are among the most common conservation actions in semiarid uplands, but outcomes can vary considerably with ecological context. Invasion by exotic annual grasses and the excessive wildfire they promote are increasing threats to semiarid shrub-steppe, and plant-community response to livestock exclusion in these areas may be complicated by the rapid colonization ability of invaders. We evaluated vegetation-community changes over 14-year interval (2007-2021) in a shrub-steppe landscape where a >100-year history of livestock grazing had been terminated in 1996. Field surveys revealed that bare-soil exposure decreased >20% over the 14 years owing to biomass accumulation, but this was primarily due to large increases in exotic annual "cheatgrass" (Bromus tectorum, +1.8-fold) and the litter it produces (+1.5-fold). Soil biocrusts increased 11.9% and perennial bunchgrasses increased 3% over the 14 years. These community changes varied at the patch scale and entailed inverse relationships of (1) both cheatgrass and biocrusts to plant-community basal cover, (2) cheatgrass to both biocrusts and perennial grasses, and (3) biocrusts to cheatgrass and litter. The spatiotemporal variability in vegetation constituted changes in plant-community states, according to cluster analysis. The modeled probability of a community transitioning to a cheatgrass state was (1) strongly and positively related to the initial (2007) cover of cheatgrass in hotspots where initial cheatgrass cover was >20%, and (2) negatively related to biocrust cover where initial biocrust cover was >4% of ground area. The decision space for this landscape can be framed as a shifting from acceptance towards resisting further degradation by removing livestock and their trampling of soil surfaces and utilization of perennial herbs. However, cheatgrass appears to be the most impactful agent of change and continued invasion appears imminent. Active restoration may help resist further degradation and direct change towards tolerable conditions.

AB  - In 2015, we initiated a country-wide coral reef ecosystem-monitoring program in the Dominican Republic (DR) to establish biodiversity baselines against which trends in the most important components of coral reef ecosystem's structure and function could be tracked. Replicate transects were set at a 10 m depth at each of the 12 coral reef sites within 6 DR regions in 2015, 2017, 2019, and 2022. We quantified the species-level abundances of adult and juvenile corals, reef fishes, sea urchins, lionfishes, and algal functional groups. Country-wide, coral cover and reef fishes have declined. The steepest declines occurred for reefs that had been among the best in the Caribbean in 2015. However, by 2022, adult and juvenile coral, parrotfish, and other herbivores had declined, and macroalgae had increased. The declines in north-shore coral abundance corresponded with the observed disturbances from coral bleaching, hurricanes, and disease. The capacity of reefs to recover from such disturbances has been compromised by abundant and increasing macroalgae that have likely contributed to north-shore declines in juvenile corals. Country-wide, the abundance of all reef fish species has declined below those of other regions of the Caribbean. Improved management of fishing pressure on coral reefs would likely yield positive results.

AB  - In recent decades, agricultural intensification has led to a loss of biodiversity and associated ecosystem services such as natural pest control. Conservation biological control addresses this problem by generally extensifying farming and/or providing alternative habitats and food sources for natural enemies of pest species. However, farmers implement conservation biological control sparingly, in part because of the confusing variety of measures with inconsistent effects. To shed some light on the effectiveness of conservation biological control measures in apple production, we conducted four meta-analyses to identify patterns of local measures on (i) insect pest abundance, (ii) natural enemy abundance, (iii) biological control, and (iv) fruit quality. Across the 54 studies, we found an overall significant, positive effect of local interventions on natural enemy abundance. Among our established intervention categories (flowers, ground cover, extensification), ground covers promoted natural enemies the most and tended to reduce pest insects. Likewise, providing flowers promoted natural enemies without affecting fruit quality. In contrast, extensification of orchard management alone, such as reducing agrochemical use and/or less disturbance, had no significant effect on the abundance of natural enemies, but showed a tendency to increase populations of pest insects and reduce fruit quality. Our results demonstrate that more floral resources and ground covers in apple orchards can reduce pesticide use while maintaining fruit quality.

AB  - The aim of this study was to assess the impact of short grazing periods with high-stocking density on vegetation during weather conditions favorable to plant growth. Continuous grazing is widely practiced in Tunisian arid rangelands and across most drylands and deserts of the Middle East and North Africa. In the early 1990s, the Tunisian government combined a variety of incentives and restrictions on rangeland grazing practices and initiated a national strategy for rangeland improvement. The strategy emphasizes grazing exclusion for three consecutive years, a practice known locally as gdel. At the end of this period, grazing is allowed with no restrictions or with some guidelines. However, these regulations created discontent among pastoral communities, mainly when local rainfall conditions result in a considerable quantity of green biomass. High stocking-density grazing for a short period would help satisfy pastoralist concerns and achieve the government's strategic goal. This study was implemented in three arid rangeland types of southern Tunisia that have been under restricted grazing for 2 years. Each area in the study was grazed for short periods in late May (about 7 days) with a flock of 150 head of sheep. Measurements of vegetation cover, forage productivity, density, and species richness were taken before and after grazing. Our results suggest that perennial vegetation is more stable under grazing than annual vegetation. The presence of annual species would enhance rangeland vegetation cover and diversity and at the same time offers an opportunity for livestock to select a high-quality diet rich in protein. Opportunistic grazing, applied to heterogeneous rangelands in late spring and the beginning of the annual temperature increase, encouraged animals to select annual plants due to their higher palatability, higher digestibility, and water content rather than heavily grazing perennial species. Perennial biomass materials that die and do not fall through rapid biological decay tended to decline with increased period of placement, resulting in further oxidation to CO2 which affects photosynthetic performance negatively and may eventually cause plant death. Trampling from high-density stocking enhances the litterfall rates and removes the oxidized plant material. These findings may contribute to strategies for addressing the extreme climatic variations that threaten rangeland and livestock sustainability.

AB  - For species of conservation concern, long-term monitoring is vital to properly characterize changes in population distribution and abundance over time. In addition, long-term monitoring guides management decisions by informing and evaluating the efficacy of management actions. A long-term monitoring initiative for the federally threatened Stephens' Kangaroo rat (Dipodomys stephensi, SKR) was established in 2005, across 628 hectares within Marine Corps Base Camp Pendleton (MCBCP), San Diego, California, USA. From 2005 to 2018, we tracked trends in area occupied by SKR, trends in relative SKR densities within occupied habitat, and modeled probabilities of SKR occupancy, colonization, extinction, with habitat, climate, and disturbance covariates. Area occupied by SKR increased almost 2-fold from 2005 to 2018 on MCBCP, while density in occupied habitat increased almost 3-fold. Increased area occupied was correlated with increases in estimated density among years, indicating SKR population growth occurs by expansion into suitable habitat patches, as well as increases in numbers within occupied habitat. SKR occupancy was positively associated with gentle slopes (<10%) and moderate open ground (40-80%) and forb cover (>40%). They were more likely to colonize previously unoccupied habitat when there were moderate levels of open ground (40-80%) and low shrub cover (<20%), while more likely to go locally extinct in areas with high slopes (>10%), less open ground (<20%), and increased non-native grass cover (>40%). Additionally, probabilities of SKR occupancy and colonization were higher in areas with moderate levels of disturbance, which was positively associated with open ground and forb cover. We conclude that long-term occupancy and density monitoring is effective in informing status and trends of spatially dynamic species and that moderate habitat-based disturbance is compatible with the management of SKR.

AB  - The woody plant communities found on residential properties constitute an integral component of cities' green infrastructure and serve as a nexus between urban residents and the natural world. Despite this importance, residential landscapes are infrequently designed with principles of sustainability in mind, resulting in the extensive use of pesticides to suppress a diverse array of plant pests. In this study, we ask whether ecological theory can inform the sustainable design and management of woody plant communities on urban residential properties. The associational resistance and dilution effect hypotheses are analogous hypotheses, which posit that increasing biodiversity can inhibit the abundance of herbivores and pathogens, respectively. Importantly, theory suggests that it might not just be diversity that matters, but the right kind of diversity (i.e., community composition). Previous studies have demonstrated that herbivore abundance can be greater on native plants compared to exotic plants in residential landscapes. However, little is known regarding whether this translates into greater numbers of interventions to reduce damage associated with plant pests on native plants. To test these hypotheses, we utilized a multi-year, commercial plant health care program dataset. We examined, at the residential property scale, the relationships between woody plant diversity, the percentage of plants that were native, and pest management interventions. We found that the number of pest management interventions targeting phytophagous arthropods, but not plant pathogens, was negatively related to woody plant biodiversity. The percentage of native plants on a property had no relationship with the number of pest management interventions that occurred. Consequently, efforts to increase woody plant biodiversity in residential landscapes could result in increased phytophagous arthropod pest suppression, thereby reducing the need for pesticide applications and their associated adverse effects.

AB  - Human activities can globally modify natural ecosystems determining ecological, demographic and range perturbations for several animal species. These changes can jeopardize native gene pools in different ways, leading either to genetic homogenization, or conversely, to the split into genetically divergent demes. In the past decades, most European wild boar (Sus scrofa) populations were heavily managed by humans. Anthropic manipulations have strongly affected also Italian populations through heavy hunting, translocations and reintroductions that might have deeply modified their original gene pools. In this study, exploiting the availability of the well-mapped porcine genome, we applied genomic tools to explore genome-wide variability in Italian wild boar populations, investigate their genetic structure and detect signatures of possible introgression from domestic pigs and non-native wild boar. Genomic data from 134 wild boar sampled in six areas of peninsular Italy and in Sardinia were gathered using the Illumina Porcine SNP60 BeadChip (60k Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms - SNPs) and compared with reference genotypes from European specimens and from domestic pigs (both commercial and Italian local breeds), using multivariate and maximum-likelihood approaches. Pairwise F-ST values, multivariate analysis and assignment procedures indicated that Italian populations were highly differentiated from all the other analyzed European wild boar populations. Overall, a lower heterozygosity was found in the Italian population than in the other European regions. The most diverging populations in Castelporziano Presidential Estate and Maremma Regional Park can be the result of long-lasting isolation, reduced population size and genetic drift. Conversely, an unexpected similarity was found among Apennine populations, even at high distances. Signatures of introgression from both non-Italian wild boar and domestic breeds were very limited. To summarize, we successfully applied genome-wide procedures to explore, for the first time, the genomic diversity of Italian wild boar, demonstrating that they represent a strongly heterogeneous assemblage of demes with different demographic and manipulation histories. Nonetheless, our results suggest that a native component of genomic variation is predominant over exogenous ones in most populations.

AB  - Land use and climate change are driving new dynamics for wildfires and ecosystems globally. In Europe, these drivers contribute to changes in fuel structures which affect the behavior, impact, and recurrence interval of wildfires. In response, there is interest in restoring historic fuel-relevant land management strategies and fire regimes which impact the condition and arrangement of fuels. Simultaneously, ecosystem function (e.g., carbon storage and biodiversity) is a cornerstone for European sustainability and climate adaptation policies such as the Green Deal. Thus, a nuanced approach to landscape management is needed which addresses wildfires concerns while also conserving ecosystem function. Research evaluating the interaction between wildfire and ecological function in Europe has largely been limited to local or regional assessments which can be difficult to translate to European-wide policy initiatives. Our study takes a continental perspective to map areas in which ecosystem function and wildfire may be interacting using data on recent fire activity, aboveground carbon, and biodiversity. We synthesize policy-level considerations for mindfully navigating fire and conservation goals and propose areas which may be suitable for herbivory, mechanical removal, and prescribed burn to manage fuels. Our results highlight several countries, especially in eastern Europe and the Mediterranean, with both high ecosystem function and high fire activity which must be carefully managed to avoid intense and destructive fires in areas of high ecosystem function. Conversely, we identify areas with high fire activity and low carbon storage or biodiversity which may be good candidates for more intensive fuel management with fewer negative ecological consequences. As Europe continues to look to its landscapes to provide a wide range of services, policymakers will need to carefully consider services provided by landscapes to safeguard environmental objectives while managing the deleterious consequences of wildfires.

AB  - Context African lion (Panthera leo) populations are declining throughout Africa, but the problem is particularly acute in southern Kenya, where human-lion conflict is common.
   Aims Using the Kuku Group Ranch (KGR) in southern Kenya as a case study, we investigated lion diet and the potential drivers of temporal variation in cattle depredation.
   Methods Using GPS clusters, we investigated the main prey species consumed by lions to determine lion diet. Prey preference of lions in relation to prey availability was then assessed using a Jacobs index to determine whether cattle or wild prey were preferred. We used reported depredation events recorded by verification officers over 36 months (2016-2018) to investigate whether temporal variation in cattle depredation by lions was linked to variation in lag rainfall, normalised difference vegetation index (NDVI) or availability of the most important large non-domestic prey items.
   Key results Six prey species (cattle, Bos taurus; Burchell's zebra, Equus quagga; Coke's hartebeest, Alcelaphus cokeii; Maasai giraffe, Giraffa tippelskirchi; blue wildebeest, Connochaetes taurinus; and eland, Tragelaphus oryx) made up 92% of the biomass consumed by lions on KGR. Cattle are the most consumed prey item and contribute the second most to consumed biomass after giraffe. However, once prey availability is considered, lions preferred wild prey. Verification officers identified 330 cattle depredation events over 3 years, and we show that the most important predictor of monthly cattle depredation by lions was cumulative rainfall in the preceding 3 months.
   Conclusions Our results on cattle depredation by lions showed that rainfall and its influence on the environment are important drivers of cattle depredation. Understanding the mechanistic link between lion depredation and rainfall enables us to predict when depredation events may increase and allows hypotheses on the reason why this spike in depredation takes place to be explored.
   Implications Given that climate-change models indicate that East Africa will experience prolonged and increased seasonal rainfall, we predict that periods when cattle are vulnerable to lion depredation may increase. Therefore, it is imperative to ensure that cattle husbandry is improved during these wetter periods to minimise the risk of conflict and retaliatory killing of lions.

AB  - The activity of small mammalian herbivores influences grassland ecosystem services in arid and semi-arid regions. Plateau pika (Ochotona curzoniae) was considered to be a focal organism to investigate the effect of small mammalian herbivores on meadow ecosystem services in alpine regions. In this study, a home-range scale was used to measure the forage available to livestock, water conservation, carbon sequestration and soil nutrient maintenance (total nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium) in the topsoil layer, and a quadrat scale was used to assess the biodiversity conservation of alpine meadows. This study showed that the forage available to livestock and water conservation was 19% and 16% lower in the presence of plateau pikas than in their absence, and biodiversity conservation, carbon sequestration, soil nitrogen and phosphorus maintenance was 15 %, 29 %, 10% and 8.9% higher in the presence of plateau pikas than in their absence. In contrast, it had no impact on soil potassium maintenance of meadow ecosystems in alpine regions. The forage available to livestock, biodiversity conservation and soil nutrient maintenance of meadow ecosystems in alpine regions had maximum values as the disturbance intensity of plateau pikas increased; the water conservation tended to decrease linearly with the increasing disturbance intensity of plateau pikas. These results present a pattern of plateau pikas influencing the ecosystem services of meadow ecosystems in alpine regions, enriching our understanding of the small mammalian herbivores in relation to grassland ecosystem service.

AB  - Plant diversity is a known indicator of healthy ecosystems, therefore understanding interspecific relationships that structure plant communities is critical for invasive species management. A cryptic introduction of invasive macrophyte water chestnut (Trapa bispinosa var. iinumai) into the northeastern United States prompted investigation into potential competitive interactions between it and two common submersed species in the Chesapeake Bay watershed, Vallisneria americana and Hydrilla verticillata. Because the congeneric invader Trapa natans co-occurs in the same watershed with a documented history of negative environmental impacts, it was included for comparison. Reciprocal pairwise competitive effects between water chestnut and resident species were determined by additive reciprocal design, plants were grow in monoculture and biculture under controlled greenhouse conditions for one year. Competitive reciprocal effects between species were evident. Vallisneria americana produced 1.7 X more ramets in monoculture than in combination with Trapa spp. and tuber production was reduced by 37 % in biculture, independent of Trapa competitor. Trapa bispinosa var. iinumai fruit production was reduced by 80 % when grown in biculture with V. americana, and no fruits were produced when grown with H. verticillata. Biculture T. natans fruit production was impacted with less production observed for H. verticillata (54 %) than V. americana (25 %). Trapa bispinosa var. iinumai produced nearly 150 % more biomass in monoculture than T. natans, suggesting increased impacts in species-poor or disturbed areas. Findings suggest established monocultures of V. americana and H. verticillata may be vulnerable to invasion by either species of Trapa, but long-term competitive effects of invasion may not preclude co-existence.

AB  - The study was conducted to determine the population size of endangered Oryx beisa (R & uuml;ppell, 1835), and near-threatened Litocranius walleri (Brooke, 1878) of uncertain global population estimates in Geralle National Park, southeastern Ethiopia. Systematic line transects were established with a transect length range of 2.3 to 6.8 km long (a total of 165.4 km long with a sighting distance of 150 m after truncation). The combination of AIC and chi-square p-values was used as model selection criteria for density/population size estimation in distance sampling software. The lowest AIC, triangle AIC (close to zero), and Chi-square tests (p-value > .05) were selected with adequate model fit. The minimum observation was 67 individuals of beisa oryx in the dry season. The maximum observation was 349 individuals of gerenuk during the wet season. The minimum detection probability of oryx was in the wet season (p(& acirc;) = 76 +/- 26), and the minimum detection probability of gerenuk was (p(& acirc;) = 75 +/- 1) in both seasons. The two-season pooled density analyzed for studied species indicated (0.85 +/- 0.34, 1.24 +/- 0.47, beisa oryx/km(2)), and (3.82 +/- 0.6, 4.88 +/- 0.7 gerenuk/km(2)) in dry and wet seasons, respectively. It can be concluded from the results of the study that GNP is home to previously undiscovered healthy populations of the endangered beisa oryx and near-threatened gerenuk. So it is recommended to undergo in-depth population studies, including other species available in the national park and their habitat components, so as to design sound, sustainable conservation measures for the wildlife resources in the area.

AB  - Tree diversity promotes predator abundance and diversity, but evidence linking these effects to increased predation pressure on herbivores remains limited. In addition, tree diversity effects on predators can vary temporally as a function of environmental variation, or due to contrasting responses by different predator types. In a multi-year study, we assessed temporal variation in tree diversity effects on bird community abundance, diversity, and predation rates as a whole and by functional group based on feeding guild (omnivores vs. insectivores) and migratory status (migrant vs. resident). To this end, we conducted bird point counts in tree monocultures and polycultures and assessed attacks on clay caterpillars four times over a 2-year period in a tree diversity experiment in Yucatan, Mexico. Tree diversity effects on the bird community varied across surveys, with positive effects on bird abundance and diversity in most but not all surveys. Tree diversity had stronger and more consistent effects on omnivorous and resident birds than on insectivorous and migratory species. Tree diversity effects on attack rates also varied temporally but patterns did not align with variation in bird abundance or diversity. Thus, while we found support for predicted increases in bird abundance, diversity, and predation pressure with tree diversity, these responses exhibited substantial variation over time and the former two were uncoupled from patterns of predation pressure, as well as contingent on bird functional traits. These results underscore the need for long-term studies measuring responses by different predator functional groups to better understand tree diversity effects on top-down control.

AB  - Effective species management relies on evidence-based goals that address the processes influencing population demography. These goals therefore require understanding how stressors affect the species of interest, and the food web within which the focal species is embedded. For woodland caribou, a conservation priority across much of its range, habitat loss and alteration is a primary cause of decline. Governments have identified maximum disturbance targets whereby a maximum of 35% total disturbance provides a 60% likelihood of self-sustaining caribou populations, but targets specific for linear features such as roads and seismic lines - which play a key role in altering ecological processes and are a primary focus for habitat restoration - have not been established. We created a framework to conceptually link stressors (linear features) to caribou declines via ecological mechanisms, and used this framework to guide a literature review to support the development of a linear feature-based management target for Southern Mountain Caribou. Despite the vast amount of research investigating the mechanisms leading to the negative relationship between caribou demography and linear features, our review of 54 peer-reviewed manuscripts and 99 grey-literature reports found little to no evidence of a threshold in these relationships in which to inform a linear feature-based management target for caribou population growth. Most studies evaluated how linear features modify space use of caribou, their predators, and the primary prey of those predators, whereas few mechanistically linked linear features to caribou demography. Our work provides a foundation in which other systems can conceptualize how stressors are linked to species declines, and to support the development of evidence-based management goals.

AB  - Simple Summary
   Tropical forests are one of the most impacted habitats in the world due mostly to anthropogenic pressures. Mammal communities are threatened by many human activities but most of the time knowledge of the status of wildlife populations is lacking. In this study, we investigated two mammal communities, in the poorly studied country of Myanmar, characterized by similar environmental conditions but different levels of human pressure and habitat degradation. We found that the disturbed area hosted a community with a lower mammal diversity (species richness) but not altered in its functional composition (trophic niches and body mass) except for the lack of apex predators. There were also differences in the probability of occurrence of two species (Northern red muntjak and clouded leopard) with significantly lower values in the degraded area. The former being the target of hunting for bushmeat consumption and the latter vulnerable and threatened by human activities. These results increase our knowledge on the direct and indirect effects of human disturbance in tropical forest areas in Myanmar and give us important tools for future conservation actions.
   Tropical forests comprise a critically impacted habitat, and it is known that altered forests host a lower diversity of mammal communities. In this study, we investigated the mammal communities of two areas in Myanmar with similar environmental conditions but with great differences in habitat degradation and human disturbance. The main goal was to understand the status and composition of these communities in an understudied area like Myanmar at a broad scale. Using camera trap data from a three-year-long campaign and hierarchical occupancy models with a Bayesian formulation, we evaluated the biodiversity level (species richness) and different ecosystem functions (diet and body mass), as well as the occupancy values of single species as a proxy for population density. We found a lower mammal diversity in the disturbed area, with a significantly lower number of carnivores and herbivores species. Interestingly, the area did not show alteration in its functional composition. Almost all the specific roles in the community were present except for apex predators, thus suggesting that the effects of human disturbance are mainly effecting the communities highest levels. Furthermore, two species showed significantly lower occupancies in the disturbed area during all the monitoring campaigns: one with a strong pressure for bushmeat consumption and a vulnerable carnivore threatened by illegal wildlife trade.

AB  - Sport hunting of ungulates is a predominant recreational pursuit and the primary tool for managing their populations in North America and beyond, given its influence on ungulate distributions, social organization, and population performance. Similarly, land management, such as motorized vehicle access, influences ungulate distributions during and outside hunting seasons. Although research on ungulate responses to hunting and land use is widespread, knowledge gaps persist about space use of hunters and what landscape features discriminate among hunt types and between successful and unsuccessful hunters. We used telemetry location data from hunters (n=341) to estimate space use from 2008-2013 during 3 types of controlled, 5-day hunts for antlered mule deer (Odocoileus hemionus) and elk (Cervus canadensis) in northeastern Oregon, USA: archery elk, rifle deer, and rifle elk. To evaluate space use, we developed utilization distributions for each hunter, created core areas (50% contours) for groups of hunters, and derived several metrics of space-use overlap between successful and unsuccessful hunters. We also modeled predictors of space use using resource utilization functions with beta regression and stepwise model building. Hunter space use was compressed, with even the largest core area (unsuccessful rifle elk hunters) encompassing <16% (1,178 ha) of the area. We found strong similarities in space use of rifle hunters compared to archers, and core areas of successful hunters were markedly smaller than those of unsuccessful hunters (e.g., <(x)over bar> = 104 ha vs. 681 ha, respectively, for archers). Percentage cover and distance from open roads were the most consistent covariates in the 6 final models (successful vs. unsuccessful for each of 3 hunts) but with different signs. For example, predicted use of archery and rifle elk hunters increased with cover but decreased for rifle deer hunters. Although the same covariates were in the final models for unsuccessful and successful rifle elk hunters, their negligible spatial overlap suggested they sought those features in different locales, a pattern also documented for rifle deer hunters. Our models performed well (Spearman's rank correlation coefficients=0.99 for 5 of 6 models), reflecting their utility for managing hunters and landscapes. Our results suggest that strategic management of open roads and forest cover can benefit managers seeking to balance hunter opportunity and satisfaction with harvest objectives, especially for species of special concern such as mule deer, and that differences in space use among hunter groups should be accounted for in hunting season designs.

AB  - Although conversion of natural forest to agriculture can negatively impact biodiversity in many ways, some affected species may respond by dispersing across the forest-farmland eco-zone, thereby facilitating functional connections through food-web interactions beneficial to crop production and forestry. This study examined patterns of Lepidoptera (butterflies and moths), Hemiptera (bugs), and Coleoptera (beetles) herbivory, and insectivorous bird predation within forest-adjacent farms in western Kenya, and how these processes trophically connect the two ecosystems to promote pest biocontrol. Through d(13)C and d(15)N stable isotope analyses, proportions of maize, farmland legumes and forest trees in pest diets, and pest-prey in bird's diets were estimated. Birds' habitat associations and diet specializations' influence on pest consumption and basal plant carbon levels in birds' tissues were determined to evaluate birds' pest-biocontrol potential. Maize was the mostly consumed plant especially by Lepidoptera, but forest trees were peimarily consumed by Coleoptera and Hemiptera. In turn, Lepidoptera were mainly consumed by forest-associated birds, whereas Hemiptera and Coleoptera were mostly consumed by farmland-associated birds. Thus, birds showed cross-habitat pest consumption tendencies, though diet-specialization was unimportant in predicting those tendencies. Muscicapidae (flycatchers and allies); Hirundinidae (swifts and swallows); Motacillidae (pipits and wagtails); and Ploceidae (weavers) birds showed the highest contributory potential for pest biocontrol of Lepidoptera pests, but Estrildidae (manikins and waxbills), Muscicapidae, and Malaconotidae (boubous and gonoleks) birds showed the best potential against Hemiptera and Coleoptera. Furthermore, more maize basal carbon was assimilated by forest-associated compared to farmland-associated birds, whereas most basal carbon from farmland legumes and forest trees were assimilated by farmland birds, suggesting that unlike pest-prey choice, basal plant carbon pathways to avian insectivorous consumers did not strongly mirror birds' habitat associations. Lepidoptera and Hemiptera were potentially the most significant interhabitat trophic connector arthropods, and for birds, Muscicapidae, Ploceidae, and Estrildidae. These findings show that such functional connectivity may be enhanced through increasing structural cover elements that promote insectivorous birds' dispersal between farmland and adjacent forests to boost their pest-regulation ecosystem service contribution. The results serve to inform effective management practices by agronomists, foresters, and land-use planners toward promoting landscape-scale-integrated pest management for sustainable agriculture and biodiversity conservation.

AB  - Restoration of nonnative grasslands to native early successional plant communities has been a conservation focus throughout the United States for several decades. In the eastern US, where precipitation exceeds 1 0 0 0 mm per year, disturbance is necessary following restoration to prevent early successional communities from progressing into woody-dominated midsuccessional communities. Resulting plant composition may vary among disturbance practices, and knowledge of such effects will help direct maintenance of restored native early seral plant communities. We evaluated the effects of the two most common disturbance practices, prescribed fire and mowing, following restoration of nonnative grasslands to native plant communities via two methods: 1) planting native grasses and 2) forbs and seedbank response without planting, across 11 replicated sites in Tennessee and Alabama, 2018-2020. Specifically, we evaluated how disturbance altered vegetation composition following four treatment combinations (planted mowed, planted burned, seedbank mowed, and seedbank burned) and tall fescue ( Schedonorus arundinaceus) control from predisturbance conditions. Grass coverage increased in all treatment units, but tended to increase more in mowed treatments than burned treatments. Forb coverage declined in all treatments except seedbank burned, where it increased. Similarly, spring-, summer-, and fall-flowering forbs, which are the focus of conservation programs designed to enhance habitat for pollinators, increased most in seedbank burned. Species richness decreased across all treatments and control, except seedbank burned, where it increased. The species evenness did not differ by treatment. Our results provide insight into how disturbance techniques may alter plant community composition soon after restoration. We recommend managers use prescribed fire instead of mowing if increased forb coverage is important to meet objectives. Furthermore, our results highlight how planting native grasses and forbs is not necessary to restore native early successional plant communities on most sites dominated by nonnative grasses in the eastern United States, where precipitation is not limiting succession.

AB  - The factors that influence population structure and connectivity are unknown for most terrestrial invertebrates but are of particular interest both for understanding the impacts of disturbance and for determining accurate levels of biodiversity and local endemism. The main objective of this study was to determine the historical patterns of genetic differentiation and contemporary gene flow in the terrestrial snail, Austrochloritis kosciuszkoensis (Shea & O. L. Griffiths, 2010). Snails were collected in the Mt Buffalo and Alpine National Parks in Victoria, in a bid to understand how populations of this species are connected both within continuous habitat and between adjacent, yet separate environments. Utilising both mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) and single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) data, the degree of population structure was determined within and between sites. Very high levels of genetic divergence were found between the Mt Buffalo and Alpine snails, with no evidence for genetic exchange detected between the two regions, indicating speciation has possibly occurred between the two regions. Our analyses of the combined mtDNA and nDNA (generated from SNPs) data have revealed patterns of genetic diversity that are consistent with a history of long-term isolation and limited connectivity. This history may be related to past cycles of changes to the climate over hundreds of thousands of years, which have, in part, caused the fragmentation of Australian forests. Within both regions, extremely limited gene flow between separate populations suggests that these land snails have very limited dispersal capabilities across existing landscape barriers, especially at Mt Buffalo: here, populations only 5 km apart from each other are genetically differentiated. The distinct genetic divergences and clearly reduced dispersal ability detected in this data explain the likely existence of at least two previously unnamed cryptic Austrochloritis species within a 30-50 km radius, and highlight the need for more concentrated efforts to understand population structure and gene flow in terrestrial invertebrates.

AB  - The Fund & atilde;o dam breach is considered one of the most severe environmental mining disasters globally, causing widespread changes to the soils of the Rio Doce watershed, one of Brazil's most important catchments. Given the ecological importance of earthworms to soil structure and dynamics, we investigated the richness, abundance, and biomass of both native and invasive earthworm species in riparian zones along the Rio Doce to understand their responses to the altered soil conditions. Sampling was conducted in reference and impacted sites across five municipalities in Minas Gerais: Mariana, Rio Casca, Ipatinga, Conselheiro Pena, and Aimor & eacute;s. We identified eight species-two invasive (Amynthas gracilis and Pontoscolex corethrurus) and six native (two Rhinodrilus, three Righiodrilus, including at least two undescribed species, and one Ocnerodrilidae species)-with native biomass approximately five times lower in impacted sites compared to reference sites. Furthermore, the new tailings environment altered the relationships between soil properties and earthworm abundance for both native and invasive species. These findings indicate that native earthworms are less tolerant of the disturbed soil conditions than invasive species, which may contribute to shifts in community composition. The disruption of soil-fauna interactions underscores the long-term ecological consequences of mining-related disturbances and highlights the need for restoration efforts that consider belowground biodiversity.

AB  - Foraging is essential for animal survival, as it provides the nutritional resources to sustain metabolism and all activities that animals undertake. Communal latrines are sites where multiple individuals of the same species defecate and can have multiple functions. Latrine behavior has been recorded in many animal species, including lowland tapirs (Tapirus terrestris), which consume a wide variety of plants and fruits and defecate large piles of dung, sometimes containing many seeds. Due to the concentration of seeds and other defecated material, latrines may thus serve as direct sources of food for other vertebrates, including insectivores feeding on invertebrates attracted to dung. Here, we studied which vertebrate animals were recorded foraging in tapir latrines, how long they spent foraging on latrines, and how their foraging behavior varied with the time of day and days since tapir defecation. Since tapirs are generalist foragers with a large diet breadth, we expected that their feces might attract vertebrate foragers with a variety of dietary habits (e.g., frugivores, granivores, omnivores, insectivores) in distinct foraging periods within a day. We also expected that the foraging events would be greatest in the days immediately following tapir defecation. We monitored 27 tapir latrines with camera traps for six months, recording foraging vs. non-foraging behaviors. We observed nine vertebrate species foraging in tapir latrines with five frequent foragers: the frugivores Guerlinguetus brasiliensis (50% of total foraging records) and Tinamus solitarius (16%, also a granivore) and the omnivores Turdus albicollis (18%), Chamaeza campanisona (10%) and Odontophorus capueira (6%). Foraging and nonforaging events throughout the day differed significantly for G. brasiliensis (p= 0.006), T. solitarius (p= 0.01), and C. campanisona (p= 0.001), and all species were diurnal, foraging between 05:00 h and 18:00 h. The foraging probability of C. campanisona and T. albicollis was affected by the time lapse since tapir defecation. Our study highlights that communal latrines such as those maintained by lowland tapirs can be an important resource supply for some

AB  - Endemic species comprise 16% of the floral species on Guadalupe Island, including three arboreal species. Almost 96% of the forest coverage was lost due to impacts related to feral goats and wildfires. To date, goats have been eradicated and the restoration of the native vegetation communities is underway. The purpose of this study was to develop a 3D Structural Classification Method (3D-SCM) using Terrestrial Laser Scanner (TLS) for mapping the vertical structure of the forest and to automatically characterize its physical attributes. Several TLS scans were performed in July 2016 to assess this recovery, particularly the succession progression. The 3D-SCM used the Forest Condition Classification (FCC) based on radiometric intensity and height values, and the Individual Shape Index (ISI) based on geometry and intensity parameters. It was designed to classify vegetation by stratum using a trial-and-error model to semi-automatically identify impacted areas and succession. The 3D-SCM was able to differentiate the vegetation strata by each forest community at the stand level with a precision of 93% as well as the tree structure parts (stem, branches, and leaves) with a precision of 97%, it also fits the best characteristic shape for the Guadalupe cypress (decagon) and for the pine (droplet). The resulting 3D-SCM provide precise physical specifications, demonstrates a high correlation R-2 = 0.949 for (Diameter Breast Height) DBH, R-2 = 0.974 for the crown and R-2 = 0.97 for heights between maximum laser pulse of tree heights and crowns with respect to field measurements. Mapping 3D vertical forest measurements are important for quantifying the success of management practices and to assist future restoration actions, as it will allow quantification of forest dynamics and carbon sequestration on this island.

AB  - In order to generate strategies for the use of native species for ecological restoration, this paper presents the effects resulting from planting with facilitating tree species, in different proportions, after 13 years of forest restoration, in an area previously used for cattle buffaloes. The implantation was carried out in the Ombrophilous Dense Forest in the Lowlands, in the Atlantic Rainforest biome of the coastal plain of the state of Parana and consisted of the plantation of 10 native species, distributed in two treatments: equal (A) and unequal (B) proportions of trees per species. After conducting a forest census, it was identified that the silvicultural expression of the facilitating tree species in the treatments differed significantly, and proportion A contributed to a scenario with greater silvicultural heterogeneity in the areas, which may be beneficial to the evolution of the ecological dynamics of the forest restoration process. In addition, the monitoring of Alchornea glandulosa, Inga edulis, and Myrsine coriacea expressed better development in the area and high resilience to the environmental adversities arising from the cattle ranching activity previously carried out, especially in relation to invasive grasses; therefore, they are recommended for use in the forest restoration of associated ecosystems.

AB  - Vegetation change in eastern Africa during the Pliocene would have had an important impact on hominin adaptation and ecology, and it may have been a key driver of hominin macroevolution, including the extinction of Australopithecus and the emergence of Paranthropus and Homo . The Pliocene paleoanthropological site of Laetoli in Tanzania provides an opportunity to investigate the relationship between vegetation change and hominin turnover because it encompasses the time period when grass cover was spreading across eastern Africa and because hominin species turnover occurred locally at Laetoli, with Paranthropus aethiopicus in the Upper Ndolanya Beds (UNB) replacing Australopithecus afarensis in the Upper Laetolil Beds (ULB). However, it remains unresolved how the vegetation of the UNB and the ULB differed from each other. To examine differences between the two stratigraphic units, multiple proxies-hypsodonty, mesowear, and stable carbon isotopes of tooth enamel ( d 13 C enamel )-are used to infer the diets of large herbivores and compare the dietary guild structure of the large herbivore communities. All three proxies indicate an increase in the abrasiveness and C 4 -content in the diets of the large herbivores in the UNB relative to those in the ULB. After inferring the diets of species based on all three proxies, the large herbivore community of the UNB had a greater proportion of grazers and a smaller proportion of mixed feeders than in the ULB but maintained a similar proportion of browsers and frugivores. The ULB community has few modern-day analogs, whereas the UNB community is most closely analogous to those in modern African grasslands. Thus, hominin turnover at Laetoli is associated with an increase in grass cover within a woodland -grassland mosaic and is part of a broader transformation of the herbivore community structure.

AB  - The artificial structures, increased pollution levels and hotter temperatures found in urban environments disrupt trophic interactions by impoverishing biotic communities and favouring organisms with high mobility, thermal and pollution tolerance. Yet, we still know little about the impacts of urbanization on the trophic interaction of organism in tropical urban ecosystems. In this study, we evaluated biotic and abiotic factors that potentially affect the association between stem galls and their host plant in a Brazilian tropical city. The abundance of galls varied with landscape characteristics and key predictors for their occurrence were plant height, herbivory, and impervious surface. The strong positive association between occurrence of galls and herbivory is noteworthy and suggestive that galls mediate the occurrence of other herbivorous arthropods. The landscape-level shifts toward highly urbanised areas reduce occurrence of galls, while increases the occurrence of the host plant. Although physical barriers could be a key driver for decrease in galls occurrence, we found plants harbouring galls even in highly urbanized sites suggesting gall-makers might cross physical barriers. The increased built-up cover disrupts this trophic interaction, yet it is challenging to pinpoint the key drivers. Galling insects are extreme resource specialists and host plant parts cut due to management practices (mowing) could reduce habitat availability and may have contributed to their decline in highly urbanised sites. As the world became more urbanised the understanding of the drivers that shape trophic interaction in urban environment becomes increasingly important.

AB  - Prey-predator interactions hold significant importance, widely acknowledged as crucial processes within ecosystems. Yet, there is a scarcity of empirical data that effectively illustrates the influence of urbanization on such interactions. We performed a common garden experiment utilizing 1250 clay models to assess the predation risks faced by herbivorous and carnivorous prey in an urban agroecosystem in the southern Philippines. Our findings revealed significant differences in attack risks between the trophic levels, with herbivorous caterpillars (n = 246; 53.25%) experiencing higher predation rates compared to carnivorous lizards (n = 216; 46.75%). Interestingly, while the trophic level of the prey did not directly predict predation risk, the presence of predators showed significant effects. Arthropods emerged as the dominant predators of herbivorous prey compared to other predators, whereas mammalian predators predominantly attacked carnivorous prey. The landscape variable also had a strong influence on the risk of predation. We found that increasing tree cover was significantly related to increased predation risk, while built-up showed the opposite. Our research findings support the 'increasing disturbance hypothesis', suggesting that rising urbanization rates reduce predator diversity, resulting in a decrease and loss of predation pressure.

AB  - Translocated animals typically find themselves in a novel environment in which they must establish a home range in a manner that will maximize their fitness. We hypothesized that the initial establishment of a home range is followed by adjustments expressed as home range shifting, and occurs as familiarity with the landscape increases, until the home range is stabilized. We studied the process of home range shifting in 42 female Persian fallow deer (Dama mesopotamica) reintroduced into the Galilee, Israel over a period of 2-5 years. We used changes in the degree of home range overlap between consecutive years as an indicator of stabilization. We then compared how the mean percent cover of the key vegetation types (woodland, scrubland and open pastures) differed between the areas abandoned in the first year's home range and the areas added to the last year's home range relative to the first (using a weighted paired t-test). We also compared the distribution (using chi(2) test of independence and Levene's test for homogeneity of variance) of %cover of the 3 vegetation types between the first and last year's home range. The average home range overlap increased over the 5 years following the first release. During the first-year post release, deer avoided open pastures and preferred woodland. In later years deer increase in the % open pastures (weighted t-test: p < 0.001) and decreased the % woodland cover (weighted t-test: p = 0.07) by abandoning areas with little open pasture and steeper terrain and moving into areas with more open pasture and moderate terrain. Variance of the cover types across individuals increased with time. We conclude that the home ranges of the reintroduced deer stabilized with time. The changes in vegetation and slope are driven by time-dependent changing needs reflecting a tradeoff between safety (refuge) and foraging. Our findings suggest that using the initially established home range to determine species preferences can create a misleading picture of what the optimal home range of the species really is. Individual variation in term of preferences can take a few years to be expressed due to the initial high-risk perceived by individuals in a novel environment.

AB  - Birds play key roles in forest dynamics, favoring the resilience of forests to cattle ranching. Generalist species may benefit from changes in the vegetation structure caused by cattle grazing while specialist species are usually negatively affected. Therefore, studying changes in taxonomic and functional bird diversity can provide valuable information in order to propose the sustainable cattle management practices. Here, we study the influence of different cattle management practices (Cattle Exclusion: FCE; Continuous grazing: FCG; Rotational grazing: FRG; Seasonal grazing: FSG) on the understory vegetation structure, and the bird taxonomic and functional diversity in humid Chaco forests of Argentina. Forests under grazing had an open (FCG) or semi-open (FRG and FSG) understory, whereas FCE presented a closed understory with higher plant richness. Generalized linear models revealed a decrease in bird richness and abundance under most cattle management practices compared to FCE. However, FRG was most similar to FCE in terms of vegetation structure and showed no differences in bird richness. FCE presented the lowest values of functional diversity while FCG and FRG showed the highest values. A fourth-corner analysis showed that FCE was associated with insectivorous species which forage and nest in the shrub layer, reflecting a possible loss of ecosystem services in forests with cattle grazing. We propose FRG as the most appropriate cattle management option and the least detrimental to bird assemblages. However, maintaining protected areas that exclude cattle ranching activities will be key to strike a balance between the conservation of most specialist species and beef production.Abstract in Spanish is available with online material.
   Las aves desempenan un rol clave en la dinamica de bosques, favoreciendo la resiliencia de los bosques al pastoreo del ganado vacuno. Las especies generalistas pueden beneficiarse de los cambios en la estructura de la vegetacion causados por el pastoreo del ganado, mientras que las especies especialistas suelen verse afectadas negativamente. En este sentido, estudiar los cambios en la diversidad taxonomica y funcional de las aves puede proporcionar informacion valiosa para proponer practicas de manejo ganadero sustentables. Aqui, estudiamos la influencia de diferentes practicas de manejo ganadero (Exclusion de ganado: FCE; Pastoreo continuo: FCG; Pastoreo rotacional: FRG; Pastoreo estacional: FSG) sobre la estructura de la vegetacion del sotobosque y la diversidad taxonomica y funcional de las aves en los bosques humedos del Chaco de Argentina. Los bosques bajo pastoreo tuvieron un sotobosque abierto (FCG) o semiabierto (FRG y FSG), mientras que los FCE presentaron un sotobosque cerrado con mayor riqueza de la vegetacion. Los modelos lineales generalizados revelaron una disminucion en la riqueza y abundancia de aves bajo la mayoria de las practicas de manejo ganadero en comparacion con FCE. Sin embargo, FRG fue mas similar a FCE en terminos de la estructura de la vegetacion y no mostro diferencias en la riqueza de aves. FCE presento los valores mas bajos de diversidad funcional mientras que FCG y FRG mostraron los valores mas altos. El fourth corner analisis mostro que el FCE estaba asociado con especies insectivoras que se alimentan y anidan en el estrato arbustivo, lo que refleja una posible perdida de servicios ecosistemicos en bosques con pastoreo de ganado. Proponemos el FRG como la opcion de manejo ganadero mas adecuada y la menos perjudicial para la comunidad de aves. Sin embargo, mantener areas protegidas que excluyan las actividades ganaderas sera clave para lograr un equilibrio entre la conservacion de la mayoria de las especies especializadas y la produccion de carne vacuna.

AB  - Ants benefit myrmecophytic plants by two main activities defending them from herbivores and offering nutrients. Ants' territorial defence behaviour also benefits their myrmecophytic plants; in the case of trees, this behaviour includes eliminating structural parasites (epiphytes and lianas). These benefits could also occur with myrmecophytic epiphytes by decreasing the abundance of competing epiphytes. In two subunits of a tropical dry forest in the centre of Mexico, we (i) recorded the diversity of ants associated with the myrmecophyte Tillandsia caput-medusae, and experimentally tested: (ii) the effect of the ants associated with the myrmecophyte in the removal of its seeds and the seeds of other sympatric non-myrmecophyte species of Tillandsia; and (iii) if seed remotion by ants corresponds with epiphyte load in the preferred (Bursera copallifera) and limiting phorophyte species (B. fagaroides, Ipomoea pauciflora and Sapium macrocarpum). In five trees per species, we tied seed batches of T. caput-medusae, T. hubertiana, T. schiedeana and T. recurvata. One seed batch was close, and the other far away from a T. caput-medusae with active ants. Between forest subunits, ant richness was similar, but diversity and evenness differed. Ants diminish seed establishment of all the Tillandsia species; this effect is stronger in the forest subunit with a large ant diversity, maybe because of ant competition. Seed remotion by ants is independent of phorophyte species identity. Although ants can provide benefits to T. caput-medusae, they also could be lowering their abundance.

AB  - Intertidal communities are predictably affected by both physical and biological factors, with herbivory as a particularly important factor. Instead of dense beds of macroalgae, which typically characterise the mid-eulittoral zone along the south coast of South Africa, at Kalk Bay this zone is dominated by a generalist grazer, the goat's eye limpet Cymbula oculus. Despite its voracious grazing behaviour, this species of true limpet (family Patellidae) appears to positively influence macroalgal richness through epibiotic interactions. This study aimed to determine the role of C. oculus as an alternative settlement substrate for several macroalgal species that would otherwise be consumed by this grazer. Additionally, we wanted to determine whether the limpet's density was on the increase, and, if so, what such an increase might mean for a future scenario at the site. Data collection and sampling took place within quadrats along transect lines. The quadrats were photographed to determine macroalgal cover on the limpet shells and on the surrounding primary rocky substrate, and analysed using ImageJ software. Additionally, C. oculus density was estimated, as well as macroalgal biomass on both the limpet shells and the primary rocky substrate. It was found that C. oculus shells are an important secondary substrate for macroalgae, and that species of foliose and turfy macroalgae benefit more than encrusting macroalgal species. The mean density of C. oculus, at 20 (SE 2.22) ind. m-2, was significantly greater than that reported two decades ago. The potential exists for increased cover abundance of chemically and morphologically defended macroalgae on the primary rocky substrate, a future scenario that seems increasingly possible given the increased C. oculus densities.

AB  - Takin (Budorcas tibetanus) is an endangered ungulate listed as a first-class national protected animal in China. Investigating the spatio-temporal variations in Takin habitats is necessary for its scientific and efficient conservation and management. Using Takin occurrence points obtained during the third (1999-2001) and fourth national survey (2011-2014) for the giant panda (Ailuropoda melanoleuca), the spatio-temporal variations in Takin habitats and the driving factors in the five mountains of Sichuan province (Minshan, Qionglai, Daxiangling, Xiaoxiangling and Liangshan) were analysed. During the past decade, the enhancement of human activity resulted in a reduction of the Takin's habitat from 29925 km(2) to 24400 km(2) in the study area, with indices reflecting the continuity and aggregation of Takin habitats increased. During the fourth survey, the Takin habitats were primarily distributed in the Qionglai and Minshan Mountains, accounting for 47% and 35% of the total Takin habitat. In contrast, Liangshan Mountains have the least habitat area, with a percentage of only 0.1% (25 km(2)), which was too small to ensure a sustainable Takin population. Human activities, combined with the percentage of Broadleaf forests, play an essential role in determining the distribution of Takins. The differentiation of Takin habitats within the five Sichuan mountains highlights the importance of analyzing spatio-temporal dynamics of distribution patterns of target species for guiding conservation and management strategies.

AB  - Simple Summary
   Whereas vertebrate scavengers have a higher diversity reported at randomly placed carcasses, the drivers of insect diversity on carrion, such as the exposure type (fixed versus random) or the carrion species, are still incompletely understood. We analyzed beetle diversity at differently exposed carcasses in the low-range mountain forest of the Bavarian Forest National Park in Germany. We tested if scavenging beetles, similarly to vertebrate scavengers, show a higher diversity at randomly placed carcasses compared to easily manageable fixed places. Ninety-two beetle species at 29 exposed wildlife carcasses (roe, red deer, and red foxes) were detected. Beetle diversity was higher at fixed locations possessing extended highly nutrient-rich cadaver decomposition islands as important refuges for threatened red-listed species, such as Necrobia violacea (Coleoptera: Cleridae). Particularly noticeable in our insect traps were the following two rare species, the "primitive" carrion beetle Necrophilus subterraneus (Coleoptera: Agyrtidae) and the false clown beetle Sphaerites glabratus (Coleoptera: Sphaeritidae). In Europe, only the species S. glabratus out of the genus Sphaerites is present. This emphasizes the importance of carrion for biodiversity conservation. We clearly show the relevance of leaving and additional providing wildlife carcasses in a dedicated place in protected forests for preserving very rare and threatened beetle species as essential members of the decomposing community.
   In contrast to other necromass, such as leaves, deadwood, or dung, the drivers of insect biodiversity on carcasses are still incompletely understood. For vertebrate scavengers, a richer community was shown for randomly placed carcasses, due to lower competition. Here we tested if scavenging beetles similarly show a higher diversity at randomly placed carcasses compared to easily manageable fixed places. We sampled 12,879 individuals and 92 species of scavenging beetles attracted to 17 randomly and 12 at fixed places exposed and decomposing carcasses of red deer, roe deer, and red foxes compared to control sites in a low range mountain forest. We used rarefaction-extrapolation curves along the Hill-series to weight diversity from rare to dominant species and indicator species analysis to identify differences between placement types, the decay stage, and carrion species. Beetle diversity decreased from fixed to random locations, becoming increasingly pronounced with weighting of dominant species. In addition, we found only two indicator species for exposure location type, both representative of fixed placement locations and both red listed species, namely Omosita depressa and Necrobia violacea. Furthermore, we identified three indicator species of Staphylinidae (Philonthus marginatus and Oxytelus laqueatus) and Scarabaeidae (Melinopterus prodromus) for larger carrion and one geotrupid species Anoplotrupes stercorosus for advanced decomposition stages. Our study shows that necrophilous insect diversity patterns on carcasses over decomposition follow different mechanisms than those of vertebrate scavengers with permanently established carrion islands as important habitats for a diverse and threatened insect fauna.

AB  - Effects of climate warming on trophic cascades are increasingly reported for large herbivores occupying northern latitudes. During the last 40 years, moose (Alces alces) in northeast China have lost nearly half of their historical distribution through their habitat shifting northwards. There are many possible causes of bottom-up and topdown effects of temperature and for moose in northeast China they are poorly understood. Of particular relevance are the effects of extrinsic environmental factors on gene flow, nutritional adaptions, and gut microbiota that occur as moose populations retreat northwards. We combined molecular biology, nutritional ecology and metagenomics to gain deeper mechanistic insights into the effects of temperature on moose populations. In this study, we revealed that the direction and intensity of gene flow is consistent with global warming driving retreats of moose populations. We interpret this as evidence for the northward movement of moose populations, with cooler northern populations receiving more immigrants and warmer southern populations supplying emigrants. Comparison across latitudes showed that warmer late spring temperatures were associated with plant community composition and facilitated related changes in moose protein and carbohydrate intake through altering forage availability, forage quality and diet composition. Furthermore, these nutrient shifts were accompanied by changes in gut microbial composition and functional pathways related to nutrient metabolism. This study provided insights into mechanisms driving effects of spatial heterogeneous warming on genetic, nutritional and physiological adaptions related to key demographic rates and patterns of survival of heat-sensitive ungulates along a latitude gradient.

AB  - Herbivorous ungulates are vital elements of forest ecosystems, yet their impact on tree regeneration and forest dynamics is challenging to assess. Despite their significant influence, few studies measure browsing pressure independently of precise ungulate population data. This study aimed to determine the regeneration mechanisms of palatable tree species in natural forest ecosystems by measuring the forage abundance from young trees of focal species and estimating the browsing pressure exerted by ungulates. We analyzed an extensive dataset of 2,838 tree saplings in two national parks in Poland to examine relationships between variables using a zero-intercept linear regression, and multiple linear regression models, and performed parametric and nonparametric tests. We found that the browsing intensity index (BI) is a good predictor of browsing pressure. Both total abundance and twig dry mass loss due to ungulate browsing were more pronounced in shorter saplings, with these effects decreasing as sapling height increased. Picea abies was the most abundant browse source in the Tatra National Park (TNP), whereas Fagus sylvatica dominated in the Roztocze National Park (RNP). Acer pseudoplatanus and Sorbus aucuparia experienced significantly higher browsing pressure in the TNP, whereas Carpinus betulus was more heavily browsed than other species in the RNP. The increase in browse abundance rapidly reduced ungulate browsing pressure on highly palatable tree species. We conclude that despite the high browsing pressure on the palatable species, the contribution of browse from focal species helps to mitigate this pressure and supports their regeneration in the forest canopy. Therefore, this finding provides valuable insights for managing and conserving tree species vulnerable to ungulate browsing in natural forest ecosystems. In addition, the method we used in this study is novel to estimate browsing pressure and assess the recruitment potential of vulnerable tree species; hence, it can be applied in large-scale studies with similar scenarios.

AB  - Urban gardening is becoming increasingly popular in the U.S., in metro and nonmetro communities alike, to address rapid urbanization and food insecurity. Urban gardens are incredibly diverse systems, and likely have equally diverse invertebrate communities. To support this growing trend, more information is needed on invertebrate communities that impact crop production. The primary objective of this study was to describe invertebrate community composition at 10 urban community gardens across two counties in Indiana. We also aimed to identify possible mechanisms that determine community assemblages, such as garden size, surrounding land use, ground cover management, and crop diversity. Using pitfall traps, sticky cards, and in-situ visual assessments, we determined that herbivores represent the dominant feeding guild at community gardens, and herbivore counts were highest on zucchini and tomato. However, sentinel prey releases suggested that predators and parasitoids are important regulators of pest populations. Overall, the assemblage of feeding guilds was similar across sites, suggesting a common metapopulation present in the surrounding landscape. On-farm practices that had the greatest influence on insect diversity were crop diversity, the presence of floral resources, and ground cover management. Insect diversity was positively correlated with crop diversity, and pollination activity was associated with flowering crops, namely dill. Parasitoid counts on sticky cards were often associated with sites that had more ground cover, such as straw mulch. This study provides useful insights on the dominant invertebrate groups present at urban community gardens in Indiana and accessible on-farm practices to improve farm biodiversity.

AB  - 1. Gastrointestinal nematode (GIN) parasites play an important role in the ecological dynamics of many animal populations. Recent studies suggest that fine scale spatial variation in GIN infection dynamics is important in wildlife systems, but the environmental drivers underlying this variation remain poorly understood.2. We used data from over two decades of GIN parasite egg counts, host space use, and spatial vegetation data from a long term study of Soay sheep on St Kilda to test how spatial autocorrelation and vegetation in an individual's home range predict parasite burden across three age groups. We developed a novel approach to quantify the plant functional traits present in a home range to describe the quality of vegetation present.3. Effects of vegetation and space varied between age classes. In immature lambs, strongyle parasite faecal egg counts (FEC) were spatially structured, being highest in the north and south of our study area. Independent of host body weight and spatial autocorrelation, plant functional traits predicted parasite egg counts. Higher egg counts were associated with more digestible and preferred plant functional traits, suggesting the association could be driven by host density and habitat preference.4. In contrast, we found no evidence that parasite FEC were related to plant func- tional traits in the host home range in yearlings or adult sheep. Adult FEC were spatially structured, with highest burdens in the north east of our study area, while yearling FEC showed no evidence of spatial structuring.5. Parasite burdens in immature individuals appear more readily influenced by fine scale spatial variation in the environment, highlighting the importance of such heterogeneity for our understanding of wildlife epidemiology and health. Our findings support the importance of fine scale environmental variation for wildlife disease ecology and provides new evidence that such effects may vary across demographic groups within a population.

AB  - To examine the tree regeneration and forest structure under sika deer pressure, we established a 1.08 ha plot, including a 0.0176 ha fenced area, and measured DBH (diameter at breast height) and/or height of trees in 2005-2006 and 2015-2016 in a mixed forest in the Ohmine Mountains, Central Japan. Small trees (<10 cm in DBH) were few or none for most species, but for Pieris japonica. Densities of sapling trees (50 cm <= height < 130 cm) were not significantly different between fenced and non-fenced areas in 2005, and were significantly different in 2015. Owing to the treefalls of large trees by wind disturbances, the total basal area decreased by 1.6% from 53.3 m(2)/ha in 2005 to 52.5 m(2)/ha in 2015. In the non-fenced area, the annual mortality of the other trees (11.7%/year) than P. japonica was significantly greater than that of P. japonica (5.7%/year). The annual recruitment densities of saplings showed a great difference between fenced (1,670.5 stems/ha/year) and non-fenced areas (56.5 stems/ha/year). Although the light condition was improved by wind disturbance, sapling tree survival and growth, except for non-preferred P. japonica, had been inhibited through effects of sika deer pressure, resulting in the decrease in the saplings of preferred tree species and an increase in the saplings of non-preferred P. japonica at this study site.

AB  - Eastern Africa is home to the largest terrestrial migrations on Earth. Though these migratory systems have been well studied for decades, little is known of their antiquity and evolutionary history. Serially sampled strontium stable isotopes (87Sr/86Sr) from tooth enamel can be used to track migration in mammals. Here we analyse 87Sr/86Sr for 79 bovid and equid individuals representing 18 species from four localities in Kenya to characterize prehistoric migratory systems during the Last Glacial Period (115-11.7 ka). Of the species analysed, 16 lack definitive evidence for migration, including blue wildebeest (Connochaetes taurinus), Thomson's gazelle (Eudorcas thomsonii) and plains zebra (Equus quagga), which are long-distance migrants today in the Greater Serengeti Ecosystem and historically in the Athi-Kapiti Plains. Only two species, the extinct wildebeests Rusingoryx atopocranion and Megalotragus sp., were migratory. These findings suggest a possible alternative narrative about ecosystem dynamics during the Last Glacial Period and shed light on the behaviour of both extant and extinct species at this time. In particular, these results indicate that migratory behaviour in extant species either emerged during the Holocene or was more spatiotemporally constrained in the past. Our results contribute to a growing body of evidence suggesting that the structure and function of geologically recent large mammal communities in eastern Africa differed considerably from those observed in the present day.
   Analysing strontium isotope ratios for individuals of 18 bovid and equid species dating to the Last Glacial Period (115-11.7 ka), the authors find that 16 of these species lack definitive evidence of migration, even those species that are long-distance migrants today.

AB  - Land use in the uplands can substantially impact the biological community in stream ecosystems, but how the trophic structure of aquatic communities within riverine food webs respond to catchment land use changes within their respective catchment remains unclear. Here, we investigated the impact of land use on aquatic communities in two streams in subtropical China. We measured isotopic compositions of basal resources, four macroinvertebrate functional feeding groups (scrapers, collectors, shredders, and predators with 132 taxa), and three fish functional feeding groups (herbivores, omnivores, and piscivores with 26 species) in three land uses (woodland, agricultural, and urban). Isotopic values of delta C-13 and delta N-15 were used to estimate the dietary proportions of consumers (macminvertebrates and fish) and community-level metrics (niche width and tmphic diversity). We found that isotopic values of basal resources, macroinvertebrates, and fish varied significantly among sampling sites adjacent to the three land uses. Dietary analysis showed that terrestrial resources contributed relatively less (similar to 20%) than aquatic resources to consumers (macroinvertebrates and fish) in higher trophic levels, especially in the urban sites. Compared to woodland sites, food webs in the urban sites had lower niche width and higher trophic redundancy, and agricultural sites had higher trophic length and lower niche width. Tmphic structure alterations in response to land use primarily resulted from availability and variability of basal resources in the upstream river channel and the riparian zone, and also the feeding plasticity of macroinvertebrates and/or fish. These empirical findings indicate the importance of diversity across all tmphic levels in the management of stream ecosystems in urban and agricultural landscapes.

AB  - The activity synchronization rhythm is an important aspect of measuring interspecific interactions between predators and prey, and crucial for large carnivores conservation. However, little is known about what factors relate their activity synchronization dynamics. With the climate change and human society development, the spatial-temporal distribution and activity synchronized rhythm of large carnivores and their prey would inevitably be affected, which would further affect the adaptability of large carnivores and bring new challenges to their conservation. In this study, we hypothesized the ambient temperature and human activity would influence the activity synchronization intensity among Amur tiger, Amur leopard and ungulates (roe deer, sika deer and wild boar) through cross-correlation function and temporal niche overlap model based on the camera traps data. The result show that the activity rhythms of the five target species showed species and seasonal differences, the temporal niche overlaps between ungulates were normally higher than that between the cats and prey, the weakest overlap was observed between the two big cat species, and time-lags of similar rhythmic activity can reduce the temporal overlap pressures of species. Furthermore, we found that ambient temperature relate interspecific synchrony of roe deer-sika deer and roe deer-wild boar pairs at the daily scale. And at hourly scale, temperature and human activities exerted significantly positive or negative stresses on the interspecific activity synchronization of all target species, observed in all three seasons. Our study provides new insights on our understanding of the mechanisms by which sympatric predators and ungulate prey coexist and interact in view of temporal niche overlap, as well as how wildlife managers can manage the mammal assembly effectively. As the Amur tiger and leopard populations in China are being recovered quickly, the rapidly increasing predation pressure and limited environmental resources could have profound implications for the interaction and coexistence among these two large carnivores and their ungulate prey. Managers should strengthen the monitoring, and understand its causes and consequences, so as to develop effective protective measures.

AB  - Understanding environmental drivers of species diversity has become increasingly important under climate change. Different trophic groups (predators, omnivores and herbivores) interact with their environments in fundamentally different ways and may therefore be influenced by different environmental drivers. Using random forest models, we identified drivers of terrestrial mammals' total and proportional species richness within trophic groups at a global scale. Precipitation seasonality was the most important predictor of richness for all trophic groups. Richness peaked at intermediate precipitation seasonality, indicating that moderate levels of environmental heterogeneity promote mammal richness. Gross primary production (GPP) was the most important correlate of the relative contribution of each trophic group to total species richness. The strong relationship with GPP demonstrates that basal-level resource availability influences how diversity is structured among trophic groups. Our findings suggest that environmental characteristics that influence resource temporal variability and abundance are important predictors of terrestrial mammal richness at a global scale.
   We determined the total and relative species richness of terrestrial mammals within different trophic groups (i.e. predators, omnivores and herbivores) at a global scale. We used random forest models to identify environmental drivers that explain species richness within the three trophic groups. We found that precipitation seasonality was the most important driver of raw species richness for all three trophic groups, while GPP was the most important driver of the relative contribution of each trophic group to total species richness.image

AB  - Although prominent examples exist of non-native species causing substantial ecological harm, many have neutral or positive effects, including filling surrogate roles once performed by extinct native organisms. We tested the ecological roles of two non-native mammals as seed dispersers or seed predators in Guahan, which, due to invasive brown tree snakes (Boiga irregularis), is devoid of native seed dispersers-birds and bats. We conducted feeding trials with captive rats (Rattus spp.), which are present but uncommon due to predation by snakes, and pigs (Sus scrofa), which are abundant. We examined if and how they interacted with common forest fruits. We then compared how any gut-passed or animal-handled seeds germinated compared to seeds left in whole fruit or depulped seeds. Rats and pigs interacted with most of the fruits and seeds (>80%) that they were fed. Of those, most seeds were destroyed-78% for rats and 90% for pigs, across both native and non-native plant species. Compared to seeds germinating within whole fruits, rats improved germination of the seeds that they handled without ingesting, while pigs diminished the germination of seeds that they handled. The small percentage of seeds (approximately 1.5% for rats and 5% for pigs) that survived gut passage germinated in higher proportions than those in whole fruits. Percentages of seed survival to germination are lower than found in similar studies with native avian frugivores. Our results indicate that pigs and rats have mixed effects on seeds, but are not suitable surrogates for native seed dispersers.

AB  - Prescribed fire is a critical forest management tool, the frequency and size of which can alter the composition of wildlife communities. In the longleaf pine ecosystem of the southeastern United States, frequent prescribed fire (1-3 year fire interval) is used to replicate natural processes that prevent woody encroachment and transition to alternate states. However, we have little understanding of how different scales and frequencies of fire influence medium and large mammals. To address this knowledge gap, we assessed the homogenizing influence of prescribed fire on mammal community composition at different fire frequencies and scales. We set 110 camera trap grids containing 990 individual camera points across conservation lands in north Florida and the Florida panhandle. We used a Bayesian multi-species occupancy modeling approach to assess the relationship between fire frequency and the occurrence of 11 mammal species across three spatial scales (0.2 ha, 12.57 ha, and 176.71 ha). Species richness was negatively associated with increased burn frequency at all scales and community occurrence was negatively associated with increased burn frequency at the two largest scales. Non-native ninebanded armadillos were negatively associated with increased burn frequency at all scales and non-native feral hogs were negatively associated with increased burn frequency at the two largest scales. Raccoons and opossums, both known nest predators, were negatively associated with increased burn frequency at the two largest scales. Our results indicate that prescribed fire applied at 1-3 year intervals could be used to reduce the occurrence of most non-native mammals and several prolific nest predators in longleaf pine sandhills, particularly at larger scales. However, these perceived benefits must be weighed against the concurrent loss of the ecosystem services and functions native generalist species provide.

AB  - Ecological impacts of linear anthropogenic disturbances may be underestimated due to edge effects extending into adjacent forests. Seismic lines are the most pervasive linear disturbance associated with oil and gas development in the boreal forests of western North America. The width and orientation of seismic lines may influence microclimatic edge effects that could alter biotic responses, including tree recruitment. We examined light intensity, air temperature, relative humidity, and tree regeneration within seismic lines and adjacent forests to: (1) compare abiotic conditions between wide (6?8 m) and narrow (3?4 m) seismic lines; (2) quantify microclimatic edge effects of seismic lines of different widths and orientations; and (3) relate patterns in tree regeneration density to local patterns in the abiotic environment. We sampled interior forests and 24 seismic lines that were wide or narrow and orientated east-west or north-south in poor mesic ecosites of northeast Alberta, Canada. Microclimatic conditions in seismic line centres were generally intermediate between interior forest and well pads, with narrow seismic lines more similar to interior forest and wide seismic lines more similar to well pads. Light intensity on wide seismic line centres was at least 1.5 times higher than on narrow seismic line centres and up to 3.8 times higher than interior forest. Edge effects on light intensity extended up to 10 m into the forest adjacent to wide lines, but were restricted to the forest edge (at the interface) of narrow lines. Compared to interior forest, day temperature was up to 2.8 ?C and 0.8 ?C higher at edges of wide and narrow seismic lines, respectively. Relative humidity during the day was up to 7.3% and 3% lower at the edges of wide and narrow seismic lines, respectively, as compared to interior forest. At night, wide seismic line centres were up to 1.7 ?C cooler and up to 8.2% more humid than narrow seismic line centres. Tree regeneration was highest where light intensity was highest (the centre of wide north-south seismic lines) and a 10-fold increase in light intensity resulted in 5.8 times more regenerating trees. This study reveals that seismic line width and orientation affect abiotic factors within the linear disturbance and up to 10 m into the adjacent forest. Edge effects on the microclimate of seismic lines were most pronounced in wider seismic lines and along north (south-facing) forest edges. These findings provide a better understanding of the abiotic factors influencing biotic responses to linear anthropogenic disturbances.

AB  - Muskox (Ovibos moschatus) and caribou (Rangifer tarandus groenlandicus) are wild ruminants that inhabit the Greenland tundra. They are part of the diet of many Greenlanders, being important sources of protein and micronutrients such as iron. The objective of this study is to analyse the element profiles of three tissues from these species: skeletal muscle, liver and adipose tissue, and to determine if they are affected by species and sex (male vs. female). Samples were obtained from annual hunts in two different regions of West Greenland. Element profiles were analysed using inductively-coupled plasma-optical emission spectrometry. The interaction between species and sex was only detected in Na (sodium) in the muscle and adipose tissue, where male and female caribou had the highest concentrations, respectively. The effect of sex was not statistically significant in the liver samples and only occasionally in the other tissues. Species was the most relevant factor in element profiles found in this study. Caribou had higher concentrations of K (potassium) and S (sulphur) in the muscle and liver. Fewer differences were detected between species in the adipose tissue, compared to the other tissues. These differences may reflect the feeding behaviour and the geographical location of both species. This study contributes to evaluate the element composition of the edible tissue of these wild ungulate species, as well as evaluating the factors of sex and species that could differentiate their composition.

AB  - Intra-continental range-expansion of native species tracking human-induced environmental changes has become an important phenomenon, and recently has been suggested to be recognized as a distinct biogeographic category, namely neonative. However, it remains difficult to analyze how range-expansions are triggered by certain environmental changes and which biological and ecological species attributes are involved. We compared biological and ecological attributes and the performance in different test environments during the entire life cycle of a range-expanding neonative in Romania, Xeranthemum cylindraceum, with a congeneric resident native, X. annuum, through a series of controlled experiments. Both species proved to share several biological and ecological attributes, e.g. high potential for long-distance dispersal by multiple vectors, biochemical defense against herbivores by means of cyanogenic compounds, and surprisingly, they were found to have similar germination and performance niches throughout the range of climatic environments tested by us. Differences between the two species, a broader climatic and habitat niche, higher germination rate and viability of seeds can give explanation to the successful spread beyond the historical range of X. cylindraceum. However, based on shared biological attributes between the two species, which confer the potential to spread, and the considerably higher seed output found in the case of the resident native, X. annuum is equally prepared to expand its range. With changing climate and persisting human-induced disturbance, in this case intensive grazing by sheep, we may expect the spread of this species after passing the presumed migration lag phase.

AB  - In forest ecosystems, the browsing activity of large wild herbivores (LWH) often leads to reduced tree and plant diversity, diminished biomass production, and challenges in achieving forest management objectives. Our case study focuses on assessing the impact of LWH browsing during the initial stages of forest growth by comparing fenced plots (F plots) with excluded LWH and control plots (C plots) with the presence of LWH. The experiment took place at the Hukavsk & yacute; Gr & uacute;& ncaron; research site in the Po & lcaron;ana Mts., characterized by a high red deer (Cervus elaphus L.) population. Fifteen F plots and fifteen C plots, all situated within mixed maternal forests, were established in the 2023 growing season. Thus, circular plots with a radius of 2.5 m were utilized, and comprehensive data were collected on young trees (excluding those under 10 cm in height), covering tree species, positions, heights, and stem diameters. Species-specific allometric relations were employed to calculate the aboveground biomass of each tree, contributing to the overall biomass stock on a plot basis. A comparison between F and C plots revealed a prevalence of silver fir (Abies alba Mill.) in F plots, while European beech (Fagus sylvatica L.) dominated C plots. F plots exhibited higher tree species diversity (4.5 species), contrasting with the lower diversity (2.0 species) and absence of silver fir in C plots. The F plots also demonstrated greater tree density and sizes, resulting in substantial differences in aboveground biomass stocks. Browsing in C plots predominantly affected tree height rather than stem diameter, leading to a bigger height-to-diameter ratio in F plots compared to C plots. We suggest that fencing as a method to exclude LWH might be economically expensive and provide a temporary solution limited by the functionality of the fence. Therefore, the primary strategy for safeguarding the future of silver fir may lie in regulating LWH populations to a reasonable threshold.

AB  - Our study addressed the regeneration dynamics of the patch mosaic of monospecific woodland groves in the floodplains of the Luvuvhu and Limpopo rivers following the removal of human settlements to create the Makuleke Contractual Park falling within the northern Kruger National Park. We anticipated that subsequent increases by elephants and meso-browsers like impalas would deflect or even prevent the re-establishment of these groves through the damage that they inflicted on plants. We compared the responses exhibited in groves of fever trees (Vachellia xanthophloea) associated with layered clay alluvium with those of ana trees (Faidherbia albida) associated with deep sandy deposits. Multi-decadal changes in the woodland mosaic were identified using aerial photographs and Google Earth imagery supported by onsite inspections and related to flood events and soil features. Woodland regeneration following recent major floods was tracked using onsite inspections over five years recording sapling growth and disappearance along with the break-age, bark removal and defoliation imposed by elephants, medium-sized browsing ruminants and porcupines. Fever trees were concentrated near the confluence of the two rivers where floodwaters inundated this region. Extreme floods carried away flanking ana trees while leaving sandy deposits open for recolonization. Elephants pushed over tall fever trees but not the ana trees, while regenerating saplings of both tree species were broken or uprooted. Browsing impalas defoliated juvenile trees contributing to their demise. These impacts contributed to the contraction or even disappearance of some fever tree groves and suppressed the growth and establishment of ana tree saplings. While these herbivores contributed to the shifting patch mosaic of these monospecific woodlands, the local distribution of these woodlands was associated with the soil features that they favoured.(c) 2022 SAAB.

AB  - The concept of rewilding, which focuses on managing ecosystem functions through self-regulation by restoring trophic interactions through introduced animal species with little human intervention, has gained increasing attention as a proactive and efficient approach to restoring ecosystems quickly and on a large scale. However, the science of rewilding has been criticized for being largely theory-based rather than evidence-based, with available data being geographically biased towards the Netherlands and Scandinavian countries, and a lack of objective data on rewilding effects on soil processes and C sequestration. In response to a call for data -driven experimental rewilding projects focused on national contexts, we collected unique data on the effects of large herbivore rewilding on soil properties from eight sites in the Czech Republic. These include sites with a wide range of edaphic characteristics that were grazed by Exmoor ponies, European bison, and back -bred Bos primigenius cattle (singly or in combination) for 2-6 years on areas ranging from approximate to 30 to approximate to 250 ha. Despite the relatively short duration of rewilding actions and considerable variability in the response rate of soil properties to grazing, our results indicate improved nutrient availability (evidenced by higher nitrification rate or higher soluble nitrogen concentration) and accelerated ecosystem metabolism (higher soil microbial biomass and dissolved carbon content). On longer-grazed pastures, rewilding contributed to soil carbon sequestration associated with increased water holding capacity and improved soil structure. However, other soil properties (reduced dissolved P concentration or total P content) showed signs of low P availability in the soils of the rewilding sites. Therefore, carcass retention should be considered where possible. Our data, although limited in number and geographic coverage, allow us to conclude that large ungulate rewilding has the potential to enhance soil carbon sequestration and related ecosystem services in rewilding areas. At the same time, we urge similar monitoring as an essential part of other rewilding projects, which will ultimately allow much more robust conclusions about the effects of this management on soils.

AB  - Climate warming in the North could lead to lichen decline within critical woodland caribou habitat. We used repeat measurements of sixty-nine plots over ten years (2007-2008 and 2017-2018) to assess lichen biomass changes under a warming climate along a latitudinal/climatic gradient in northwestern Canada. We compared lichen biomass on sensitive landscape features, including peat plateaux (permafrost-containing bogs), areas of permafrost thaw within the peat plateaux (collapse scars), and low-productivity upland forests occurring on mineral soils. Field-based measures of lichen cover and height were coupled with samples of lichen biomass to develop biomass prediction equations. The optimal model incorporated both cover and height, with landscape feature as a covariate. Although height significantly improved the equation fit, models were successfully developed with cover alone. Modeled lichen biomass differed significantly between landscape features, declining from peat plateau (502 g m(-2)) to upland forest (54.0 g m(-2)) and collapse scar (0.690 g m(-2)) environments. In the absence of permafrost collapse at any monitoring location, lichen biomass declined significantly over the ten years for peat plateaux (-75.6 g m(-2)) and upland forests (-17.5 g m(-2)). These results will be important for quantifying landscape-level lichen biomass changes under climate warming in boreal and subarctic environments.

AB  - Conservation of competitively subordinate carnivores presents a difficult challenge because they are limited by dominant competitors. Prey depletion is one of the leading causes of large carnivore decline worldwide, but little is known about the net effect of prey depletion on subordinate carnivores when their dominant competitors are also reduced. African wild dogs are often limited by high densities of dominant competitors, particularly lions. We measured African wild dog density and survival, using mark-recapture models fit to 8 years of data from 425 known individuals in the Greater Kafue Ecosystem, Zambia. The GKE is affected by prey depletion, particularly of large herbivores, and thus the density of lions is significantly lower than ecologically comparable ecosystems. Counter to expectations from mesopredator release theory, wild dog density in GKE was far lower than comparable ecosystems with higher lion and prey density, though annual survival rates were comparable to large and stable populations. Average pack size was small and home range size was among the largest recorded. Our results show that low lion density did not competitively release the GKE wild dog population and we infer that the low density of wild dogs was a product of low prey density. Our results suggest that there is an optimal ratio of prey and competitors at which wild dogs achieve their highest densities. This finding has immediate implications for the conservation of the endangered African wild dog, and broad implications for the conservation of subordinate species affected by resource depletion and intraguild competition.

AB  - Urbanization and urban sprawl generally degrade and diminish wildlife habitat, threatening to extirpate local populations. However, certain synanthropic species (e.g., coyotes, white-tailed deer, and squirrels) are able to persist in urban environments and may even occur at greater densities than they do in their natural habitats. Eastern fox squirrels (Sciurus niger) are large tree squirrels that are known to be present in greater densities within urban areas. To determine how landscape characteristics may affect fox squirrel presence, we conducted line-transect surveys along sidewalks on the Texas A&M University-College Station campus to record presence of fox squirrels and nearest tree species. We calculated Jacobs' index of selectivity (D) for use of trees by fox squirrels along the transects. Squirrel density was calculated for all transects and modeled using linear regression with environmental (e.g., tree density) and survey (e.g., transect distance) variables. Fox squirrels preferred only a small number of the available tree species, primarily Quercus and Ulmus species. Observed fox squirrel density significantly increased with time of day, temperature, density of oaks (Quercus spp.), and density of all trees, and decreased with distance and area of the transect. These results suggest that even when urban areas contain suitable habitat, use of urban environments by wildlife is still highly selective and dependent on specific habitat requirements.

AB  - In seasonal environments, the winter months can drive the structure and dynamics of vertebrate communities. Most ecological studies have focused on species above the snow, overlooking those within the subnivium (below-snow environment). The Great Lakes region of North America is characterized by seasonal snow cover and a diverse assemblage of small mammals, both of which are changing rapidly in response to a changing climate. To study the seasonal dynamics of small mammals, we sampled communities in three forest types (hardwood, hemlock-cedar, and spruce bog) in summer and winter over 2 years. We hypothesized that seasonal differences in communities would be moderated by forest structure in summer and snow in winter. We assessed community dominance via species diversity and the abundances of deer mice (Peromyscus maniculatus), white-footed mice (P. leucopus), and southern red-backed voles (Myodes gapperi). We estimated a Community Temperature Index (CTI; a metric of the balance between warm- and cold-adapted species in a community) and tested seasonal drivers of CTI. Species diversity was highest in spruce bogs in winter due to increased species evenness, but diversity was consistent year-round in hardwood and hemlock-cedar forests due to unchanging species dominance. Spruce bogs supported the coldest CTI in summer, but CTIs converged across forest types in winter. In summer, forest structure drove CTI; in winter, colder CTIs were associated with deeper snow and a warmer subnivium. Our work reveals that snow is a critical habitat and filter for cold-adapted species that ultimately structures small mammal communities. Given rapid changes in snow conditions due to climate change, we predict continued range contractions for subnivium-adapted species.

AB  - Carrion is a valuable resource in forests, providing sustenance for vertebrate and invertebrate scavenger communities and contributing to ecosystem functions, such as nutrient cycling. Intensive ungulate hunting, and thereby extraction of carcasses, removes large quantities of potential carrion from the system, denying a valuable resource from scavenger fauna. It may be possible to reduce the loss and negative consequences to forest biodiversity by retaining evisceration residues from hunted deer, where full carcasses cannot be retained. However, what roll evisceration residues play as a resource for scavengers in temperate forests is not well understood. In this study, we exposed 47 carrion samples from hunted roe deer, in front of triple sets of camera traps, to examine how hunting remains are removed and fed upon by vertebrate scavengers. Overall, 70% of the samples were completely removed from experimental sites by vertebrates. We detected twelve vertebrate taxa feeding on evisceration residues, including martens (Martes spp.), red kites Milvus milvus and garden dormice Eliomys quercinus. Common buzzards Buteo buteo and Eurasian jays Garrulus glandarius were the most frequent feeders on carrion samples, while red foxes Vulpes vulpes displaced the largest proportion of samples. Finally, we found a range of insectivorous bird and mammal species using hunting remains as a source for invertebrate prey, while not scavenging on the remains directly. We demonstrate that evisceration residues can be a valuable resource for a wide range of taxa and suggest that viscera retention from hunted game may contribute to resource provisioning for scavengers in forest ecosystems.

AB  - Simple Summary
   Multiple factors, both natural and anthropogenic, are driving most of the wild species to the verge of extinction across the globe. In order to conserve these threatened species, various conservation interventions and strategies are adopted, among which is re-introduction of captive stocks of species into the wild habitats where they vanished from. Captive breeding is one of the promising tools for endangered species preservation. Providing social enrichment to the captive stocks is an important step in the management, in particular for stocks, which are aimed for re-introduction. The subject species of this study, i.e., Punjab urial (Ovis vignei punjabiensis) and Indian gazelle (Gazella bennettii) are being reared in captivity with the aim of re-introduction. As there is scarcity of information regarding the behavioral aspects of captive species, especially ungulates, this study aimed at understanding the dynamics of their interactions. The current study reported that Punjab urial, being the dominant species, exerts itself on the submissive and subordinate species, the Indian gazelle. This negative interference can possibly lead to negative ramifications in the form of stress and injuries in the short term, while negative effects on population growth in the long term. Thus, this study recommends separate rearing of these species to eliminate the hazardous competition between them.
   Natural wildlife habitats are regularly subjected to anthropogenic pressures for different purposes, which are heading the biodiversity towards drastic decline. Several endangered wild species are raised in captivity with the aim of re-introduction. In some instances, mixed herds' rearing approach in captivity is adopted for providing social enrichment to captive stocks; however, the impacts of species on each other are least documented. We tested our prediction that keeping mixed herds of captive wild sheep and antelopes provides adequate social enrichment to the captive stocks: if interspecific interactions are balanced. In the current study, we studied the interspecific competition between mixed herds of captive Punjab urial (Ovis vignei punjabiensis) and Indian gazelle (Gazella bennettii) at Manglot Wildlife Park, Nowshera District, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Province, Pakistan. We documented the negative effects of behavioural interference by Punjab urial on the feeding behaviour of Indian gazelle. The outcome of the current study revealed that Punjab urial are highly intolerant towards Indian gazelle, with high interference during feeding. Out of the total aggressive events, 77% (N = 1259) of events ended up with win/loss, in which Punjab urial dominated the Indian gazelle 3.5 times. Moreover, lopsided dominance by Punjab urial resulted in increased intraspecific competition among Indian gazelle (p < 0.001). Current study divulged Indian gazelle to be the subordinate species, with less intake of food. Instead of providing social enrichment by heterospecifics, the Punjab urial is negatively affecting the Indian gazelle, therefore, the results of our study discourage the practice of admix captive breeding for wild sheep and antelopes.

AB  - Livestock grazing often intensifies around herder camps, which can lead to degradation, particularly in arid areas, where vegetation is scarce. In Mongolia, nomadic herders have covered long distances between camps and changed camps regularly for centuries. However, changing socioeconomics, rising livestock numbers, and climatic change have led to growing concerns over rangeland health. To understand travel mobility and livestock grazing patterns, we combined Global Positioning System tracking data of goats, remotely sensing pasture productivity, and ground-based vegetation characteristics in the Great Gobi B Strictly Protected Area, Mongolia. We assessed herder preferences for camp selection, followed 19 livestock herds over 20 months, determined use and nutrient contents of the most dominant plant communities, and estimated plant species richness, vegetation cover, and biomass within different grazing radii around camps. Biomass availability was key for herder decisions to move camps, but in winter, other factors like shelter from wind were more important. Camps were mainly located in Stipa spp. communities, agreeing with herder preferences for this highly nutritious species, and its dominance around camps. Herders changed their camp locations on average 9 times yearly, with a maximum distance of 70-123 km between summer and winter camps, and an average visitation period of 25-49 d per camp, depending on season. Small livestock spent > 13-17 h daily within a radius of 100 m from camp, and livestock use intensity decreased steeply with distance from camp but was remarkably similar around spring, autumn, and winter camps on the Gobi plains. However, we found little evidence for a corresponding gradient in plant species richness, biomass, and cover on the Gobi plains. The high mobility of local herders and the overriding impact of precipitation on pasture dynamics contribute to a sustainable vegetation offtake by livestock in the nonequilibrium rangelands of the Dzungarian Gobi.

AB  - As global conservation actions become more urgent, informed decision-making requires robust analyses of the costs and benefits of policy options, based on available evidence. Recovery planning for threatened or endan-gered species must assume a cause-and-effect relationship between proposed management interventions and population responses. However, a significant portion of current knowledge about threatened or endangered species is derived from observational studies because experiments that fully meet random and controlled design criteria are largely infeasible or unethical. Large-scale field experiments are becoming more common, yet the greater uncertainty generated by what remain fundamentally observational studies can lead researchers to weak inferences about causal mechanisms, creating debate and confusion among decision-makers, planners and stakeholders. This has been an acute problem facing conservationists and governments as they struggle with the successful recovery of species in decline. In other domains where experimental evidence is difficult to collect, causal modelling has been adopted to identify causal relationships from observational data, based on a set of strong assumptions and identification rules. In Canada, significant and ongoing efforts have had limited success in reversing the population decline of woodland caribou (Rangifer tarandus caribou). We examine the scientific framework for woodland caribou recovery efforts through the lens of causal modelling, highlighting feasible steps that could be taken to improve the rigour of causal inferences.

AB  - Population monitoring is critical to wildlife conservation, but density estimation is difficult for wide-ranging, unmarked species inhabiting remote habitats. Furthermore, recent investigations into density estimation with camera trap data has revealed unmarked models to be potentially unreliable, prompting cautious application and continued model development. Two related approaches with increasing appeal include spatial count (SC), which infer latent identities from the spatial pattern of detections, and spatial partial identity models (SPIM), which additionally leverage partial identity covariates (e.g., sex, antler point count, and presence of GPS/radio collar). To assess the performance of unmarked density models, we applied SC and SPIM to camera trap data of threatened boreal caribou in Canada, which are declining but have few rigorous density estimates across their broad distribution to inform conservation efforts. In particular, we focused on two spatially proximate caribou ranges in northern Alberta, Canada that differ in estimated caribou demographic trends, disturbance histories, and abundances of caribou predators and apparent competitors. Estimates of caribou density varied over a 4 year period (2016 ??? 2019), and were higher in the region with more stable reported growth rates and less anthropogenic disturbance (mode SPIM estimates: 155 ??? 225/1000 km2 vs. 19 ??? 96/1000 km2). However, density estimates differed by modeling approach and had low and variable precision, hindering inferences about population status and trajectories. Simulations suggest that SPIM estimates may have been less biased and more precise. SC models likely underestimated density by mistaking detections of neighboring individuals as recaptures of a single individual, although SPIM may also have overestimated density by inflating assignment probabilities of detections to non-existent individuals. Findings highlight the need to explore how grouping dynamics and nonindependent movement violate assumptions and reduce the ability to distinguish individuals. We advocate continued investigation into the accuracy of unmarked density estimation approaches, the ecological and sampling conditions appropriate for different unmarked density models, and coordination across sampling efforts and analyses to improve population inferences.

AB  - The overall increase of ungulate populations in modern Europe has contributed to conflicts in national economies, particularly between game management and the forestry sector. This study assessed damage risks to young pine (Pinus sylvestris L.), spruce (Picea abies (L.) H. Karst.) and aspen (Populus tremula L.) stands at two spatial scales. One level assessed the interaction between sex-age structure of cervid populations, measured by pellet group density, and forest damages measured as the percentage of heavily browsed trees in 2040 stand surveys distributed proportionally throughout the country. The second level compared pellet counts and trail-camera-based records of moose (Alces alces L.) and red deer (Cervus elaphus L.) presence in a pilot study area. We examined whether 1) there is a correlation between damage amount and ungulate population structure and 2) are the data from trail cameras suitable for wider use in monitoring ungulate population structure. The study confirmed significantly higher moose pellet group densities in pine than in spruce and aspen stands. Pine damages were greater in stands with higher moose pellet group density, especially with female moose prevailing over male moose density index. The red deer pellet group densities were significantly higher in heavily damaged pine and spruce stands, regardless of sex-age structure. In most cases, there were no statistically significant differences between the two survey methods of ungulate population structure by using pellet count transects and trail camera fixations. Both methods provide comparable data on sex-age structure in moose and red deer populations if seasonal and habitat-predicted biases are considered. However, trail cameras are more widely applicable and easier to use by hunters than pellet counts.

AB  - Parasites can alter a wide range of host behaviors resulting in changes in organisrnal interactions and ecosystem processes. One of the most important behaviors that controls food web dynamics is herbivore grazing because an alteration in grazing behavior leads to changes in trophic dynamics and ecosystem processes by changing the abundance and diversity of primary producers. To test whether parasite load can alter host grazing levels and choices, feeding trials were conducted using the keystone species, the rusty crayfish Faxonius rusticus (Girard, 1852), grazing on a selection of macrophyte species. The rusty crayfish is a keystone species because its grazing significantly alters the abundance of macrophytes in freshwater ecosystems. We used a total of 165 wild-caught, naturally-infected crayfish individuals with a wide range of parasite loads by species of the digenetic trematode Microphallus Ward, 1901. Crayfish were presented with 1 g each of the macrophytes Elodea canadensis (Michaux), Ceratophyllum demersum (I.), Chara sp., and Potamogeton richardsonii (A. Benn) in a 23-hr foraging assay. Subsequently, crayfish were dissected, and parasite loads were calculated. Mixed models were then utilized to determine how parasite load affected consumption. As infection of Microphallus increased in the crayfish hepatopancreas, consumption of all four macrophytes significantly decreased. Melanization of Microphallus spp. within the hepatopancreas, the immune response to. infection, did not significantly reduce crayfish macrophyte consumption. These results indicate that macrophyte consumption in the crayfish was affected by Microphallus. This impact on crayfish grazing could alter macrophyte abundances in aquatic ecosystems. Because of the many ecosystem functions macrophytes play, an alteration in their abundances could lead to community-level ramifications by impacting nutrient flow and organismal abundances in aquatic ecosystems.

While forest harvest impacts on wildlife are well-documented, silvicultural treatment effects remain unclear.ObjectivesWe investigated how forest harvest and silviculture shape predator and ungulate distributions and interactions, providing ecological insights for forest management.MethodsWe deployed two camera arrays in extensively harvested North American landscapes to evaluate relationships between forest harvest, silviculture, and predator and ungulate occurrences.ResultsForest harvest, silviculture, and predator/prey activity shape wildlife occurrences. Wolf (Canis lupus), influenced by moose (Alces alces), decreased with regenerating (9-24 years) clearcuts, new (0-8 years) clearcuts with reserves, and fertilized cutblocks. Wolves increased with regenerating/older (25-40 years) clearcuts with reserves. Coyote (C. latrans) increased in manually or chemically brushed cutblocks at high or low deer occurrence, respectively. Black bear (U. americanus), influenced by prey, increased with regenerating prepared cutblocks and fewer new prepared cutblocks. Prey elevated lynx (Lynx canadensis) occurrence with regenerating prepared or older unprepared cutblocks. Depending on predators, mule deer (Odocoileus hemionus) decreased with regenerating and older prepared cutblocks; white-tailed deer (O. virginianus) decreased with selection- and new even-aged cutblocks. Harvest age and wolves best explained moose, although silviculture mattered seasonally.ConclusionsSilviculture shapes wildlife distributions and interactions. Integrating these effects into research and forest management is essential for meeting ecological objectives.

Moose (Alces alces) and white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) are primary gray wolf (Canis lupus) prey and important subsistence species for Indigenous communities. We hypothesized wolves would increase use of ungulate migration corridors during migrations and predicted wolf distributions would overlap primary available prey. Methods We examined seasonal gray wolf, moose, and white-tailed deer movements on and near the Grand Portage Indian Reservation, Minnesota, USA. We analyzed GPS collar data during 2012-2021 using Brownian bridge movement models (BBMM) in Migration Mapper and mechanistic range shift analysis (MRSA) to estimate individual- and population-level occurrence distributions and determine the status and timing of range shifts. We estimated proportional overlap of wolf distributions with moose and deer distributions and tested for differences among seasons, prey populations, and wolf sex and pack affiliations. Results We identified a single migration corridor through which white-tailed deer synchronously departed in April and returned in October-November. Gray wolf distributions overlapped the deer migration corridor similarly year-round, but wolves altered within-range distributions seasonally corresponding to prey distributions. Seasonal wolf distributions had the greatest overlap with deer during fall migration (10 October-28 November) and greatest overlap with moose during summer (3 May-9 October). Conclusions Gray wolves did not increase their use of the white-tailed deer migration corridor but altered distributions within their territories in response to seasonal prey distributions. Greater overlap of wolves and white-tailed deer in fall may be due to greater predation success facilitated by asynchronous deer migration movements. Greater summer overlap between wolves and moose may be linked to moose calf vulnerability, American beaver (Castor canadensis) co-occurrence, and reduced deer abundance associated with migration. Our results suggest increases in predation pressure on deer in fall and moose in summer, which can inform Indigenous conservation efforts. We observed seasonal plasticity of wolf distributions suggestive of prey switching; that wolves did not exhibit migratory coupling was likely due to spatial constraints resulting from territoriality.

AB  - A low-cost, small-boat, rapid assessment survey was conducted on the waters off the southern Peninsula of Bali. The objectives were: (1) to conduct an inventory of cetacean species in the study area; (2) to map cetacean distribution to inform the design of the Badung MPA; (3) to estimate relative abundance of cetaceans and record information on presence and distribution of other marine megafauna; and (4) to train observers in the use of distance sampling methods. The survey adopted a "training while doing" approach to build local capacity for marine biodiversity monitoring, while collecting a snapshot of data to assess species richness and distribution. The survey accomplished its first two objectives, but due to violation of underlying assumptions, had mixed success with the third objective. Our survey revealed that the waters off the southern Peninsula of Bali support a rich cetacean fauna, with at least seven cetacean species, other marine megafauna, and avian species. Seven cetacean species found on our survey include: spinner dolphin (Stenella longirostris), pantropical spotted dolphin (Stenela attenuata), Fraser's dolphin (Lagenodephis hosei), Risso's dolphin (Grampus griseus), bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops sp.), Bryde's whale (Balaenoptera edeni), and sperm whale (Physeter macrocephalus). Density estimates were low for all whales combined, but seem implausibly high for dolphins; likely due to violation of assumptions of distance sampling methods. Future surveys should include sufficient time for training to generate reliable abundance estimates. A dedicated bycatch study is needed to understand sustainability of bycatch mortality relative to reliable abundance estimates.

AB  - Gene flow is crucial for maintaining population genetic diversity and increasing the adaptive potential of species. Therefore, identifying factors affecting gene flow is important for conservation planning, especially for threatened mammals in complex mountain system. In this study, we conducted a microgeographic-scale landscape genetic analysis for the endangered and ecologically isolated Alashan red deer (Cervus elaphus alxaicus) for the first time. Using data from 329 individuals for 11 microsatellite loci, we assessed how the environmental factors in the Chinese Helan Mountains affect the gene flow of this species. Three genetic clusters were identified by both Bayesian (STRUCTURE and GENELAND) and non-Bayesian (DAPC) methods, revealing clear spatial genetic structure within a limited geographic range. Landscape genetic analysis based on causal modelling and linear mixed-effect modelling revealed that gene flow was primarily restricted by topographic factors, including topographic complexity, aspect, altitude and slope, rather than geographical distance or anthropogenic barriers. Based on these results, we identified two important corridors that can potentially facilitate gene flow within the complex landscape of the Helan Mountains. Our results highlight the role of natural landscape features on Alashan red deer's population genetic structure and functional connectivity. This differs from findings regarding red deer populations in other regions, indicating that landscape genetic patterns are not homogenous across the range of a species, but rather differ among specific landscapes.

AB  - Sanitja Island, the northernmost land of the Balearic Islands, is occupied by a population of Lilford's Wall Lizard, Podarcis lilfordi, under extreme environmental conditions. It is an islet of less than 10 hectares, with low plant diversity and a complete absence of shrubs. During long-term monitoring, we studied lizard abundance over a period of approximately 40 years. Throughout several years, a group of domestic goats were introduced into the islet, leading to a collapse of the lizard population, with important collateral effects on their trophic ecology. On Sanitja Island, we observed the only case of a population of P. lilfordi in which the trend of the time series of abundance was significantly negative. The analysis of the time series indicated a lack of effect of the abiotic factors. The only factor that had a detectable effect on the population was the presence of goats. The introduction of goats caused the impoverishment of trophic resources for lizards and the change to a more diverse diet, with significantly lower consumption of plant matter. The removal of goats resulted in a partial recovery of lizard density, the recovery of a more specialized diet and the restoration of foraging behaviour on the dominant vascular plant, the sea fennel Crithmum maritimum. This foraging behaviour allows the pollination syndrome between the sea fennel and P. lilfordi. This study shows the dramatic effect of the introduction of an herbivorous competitor in an insular lizard population.

AB  - In Dickie et al. (2024), we contrasted the effects of climate and habitat alteration on white-tailed deer density, recognizing the role of both these factors. Barnas et al.'s (2024) critique raised concerns about data transformations, model overfitting, and inference methods, but our analysis demonstrates that these criticisms are either unfounded or align with our original conclusions. We reaffirm that while both climate and habitat alteration contribute to deer densities, management decisions cannot ignore the strong role of climate, which is only predicted to increase in coming decades.image

AB  - Where they occur at high densities, herbivores are likely to impact ecosystems by functioning as nutrient vectors that shift nutrients from areas where they graze to other locations. Such lateral shifts in nutrients are important to understand as they can alter the balance of species interactions and composition of ecological communities. In arid Australia, kangaroo (Macropus spp.) populations have irrupted due to suppression of their chief predator and their presence can have marked impacts on vegetation and soils in areas where they graze. Kangaroos are hypothesised to facilitate the transport of nutrients by ingesting organic material and depositing it in the form of faecal matter and urine under the shade of trees where they rest during the day. Here, we investigate the role that kangaroos and shade play as nutrient vectors and nutrient sinks, respectively. We compared kangaroo visitation and soil nutrients under experimental shades with unshaded areas in an arid landscape with little natural shade. Kangaroo visitation was greatest at shaded plots. Dung accumulation was greater at shaded plots than unshaded plots. Total carbon (TC) was greater in soils within shaded plots than control plots; however, there was no difference in TC between shaded plots and procedural control plots. There was no difference in total nitrogen and plant available phosphorus between shaded, control and procedural control plots. Our findings demonstrate that the presence of shade in an arid landscape influences the microhabitat choice of kangaroos, but only partially supports the hypothesis that nutrients concentrate within the soil under shade.

AB  - Invasive alien species (IAS) can act as vectors for the introduction of pathogens in ecosystems and their transmission to threatened native species (TNS), leading to biodiversity loss, population reductions and extinctions. We assessed pathogens potentially occurring in a set of IAS in the Southern Cone of South America and identified TNS potentially vulnerable to their effects. Also, we assessed how risk analysis systems proposed or adopted by national authorities in the study region value the importance of pathogens. We identified 324 pathogens in the selected IAS, which could potentially affect 202 TNS. Wild boar (Sus scrofa) was the IAS with the largest number of pathogens (91), followed by domestic dog (Canis familiaris) (62), red deer (Cervus elaphus) (58), rock dove (Columba livia) (37), American vison (Neovison vison) (18), European hare (Lepus europaeus) (17), common starling (Sturnus vulgaris) (12), common slider (Trachemys scripta) (6), and American bullfrog (Lithobates catesbeianus) (2). Most TNS were in the "vulnerable" IUCN category, followed by "endangered" and "critically endangered" species. Bacteria were the most frequently represented pathogens (112), followed by ectoparasites (78), viruses (69), protozoa and other (65). The direct effects of IAS on native wildlife are beginning to be addressed in South America, and their potential impact as pathogen spreaders to native wildlife has remained largely unexplored. Risk analysis systems associated with the introduction of IAS are scarce in this region. Although the existing systems contemplate hazard analyses for the co-introduction of pathogens, they underestimate the potential impact of diseases on TNS. Conservation efforts in the region would benefit from systems which give pathogen risk a relevant place, and from government agencies promoting targeted disease surveillance in IAS and wildlife.

AB  - Desert mule deer (Odocoileus hemionus eremicus) populations throughout the arid Southwestern USA and Mexico have declined; hence, it is important to identify habitats that provide for their requirements to inform habitat management. We used resource-area-dependence analysis (RADA), which relates home range size to composition of home ranges, to determine habitats most associated with decreasing home range sizes (i.e., increasing quality) for adult male and female mule deer in the San Andres Mountains (SAM) of south-central New Mexico, USA. Pinyon-juniper woodland and oak-mountain mahogany shrubland were the habitats most associated with home range quality for both lactating and dry females, likely because they provided the highest quantity and diversity of browse and the best cover attributes of habitat types in the SAM. Grama grassland was the only habitat associated with male home range size; despite the lack of cover, grama grassland provided more forbs than other habitats in the SAM, and males are less tied to cover than females. Management actions that increase diversity and retard successional status of woodlands and shrublands while retaining cover could increase habitat quality for female mule deer. Actions that favor forbs and increase cover in grasslands would similarly increase habitat quality for males.

AB  - Ecological stability in plant communities is shaped by bottom-up processes like environmental resource fluctuations and top-down controls such as herbivory, each of which have demonstrated direct effects but may also act indirectly by altering plant community dynamics. These indirect effects, called biotic stability mechanisms, have been studied across environmental gradients, but few studies have assessed the importance of top-down controls on biotic stability mechanisms in conjunction with bottom-up processes. Here we use a long-term herbivore exclusion experiment in central Kenya to explore the joint effects of drought and herbivory (bottom-up and top-down limitation, respectively) on three biotic stability mechanisms: (1) species asynchrony, in which a decline in one species is compensated for by a rise in another, (2) stable dominant species driving overall stability, and (3) the portfolio effect, in which a community property is distributed among multiple species. We calculated the temporal stability of herbaceous cover and biotic stability mechanisms over a 22-year time series and with a moving window to examine changes through time. Both drought and herbivory additively reduced asynchronous dynamics, leading to lower stability during droughts and under high herbivore pressure. This effect is likely attributed to a reduction in palatable dominant species under higher herbivory, which creates space for subordinate species to fluctuate synchronously in response to rainfall variability. Dominant species population stability promoted community stability, an effect that did not vary with precipitation but depended on herbivory. The portfolio effect was not important for stability in this system. Our results demonstrate that this system is naturally dynamic, and a future of increasing drought may reduce its stability. However, these effects will in turn be amplified or buffered depending on changes in herbivore communities and their direct and indirect impacts on plant community dynamics.

AB  - Questions: Human activities are increasing the density of domestic grazers and global nutrient loads, modifying the main determinants of vegetation community dynamics. Grazing (top-down control) and nutrient availability (bottom-up control) may interactively modify plant biomass, which is particularly important in grasslands devoted to livestock production. Here, we aim to understand the interactive effects of grazing and fertilization on grassland plant biomass. We hypothesized that the joint effects of nutrient addition and domestic grazing on above-ground plant biomass are not additive, but they modify each other through changes in ground-level light, leaf nutritional quality, above-ground net primary productivity (ANPP), and below-ground plant allocation.
   Location: Flooding Pampa (Buenos Aires, Argentina).
   Methods: We carried out a factorial experiment of grazing exclusion and fertilization with nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium + micronutrients during several years in a mesic grassland devoted to livestock production.
   Results: After four years, grazing reduced live above-ground plant biomass by 52%, and when combined with fertilization this reduction was 70%. Nutrient addition in the grazed grassland increased ANPP and leaf nutrient concentration. These changes in turn intensified grazing pressure and cattle's plant consumption. By contrast, fertilization did not produce any significant effect on plant biomass or ANPP inside the exclosures, where ground-level light was low. A structural equation model revealed that the increase in ANPP fostered above-ground and reduced below-ground plant biomass.
   Conclusions: This is the first study conducted in the Pampas grasslands that evaluated the effect of cattle grazing and fertilization on plant communities under field conditions over several years. Grazing and nutrient addition synergistically controlled grassland plant biomass, as the reduction in above-ground biomass by cattle consumption was greater in fertilized plots. Our results provided empirical evidence that leaf nitrogen and ANPP modulated plant biomass dynamics in grasslands devoted to livestock production in the context of increased nutrient loads in terrestrial ecosystems.

AB  - As the dominant large herbivore in midcontinent North America since the terminal Pleistocene, bison (Bison spp.) have been a fundamental component of ecosystems and economies. Despite the importance of bison in late Quaternary North America, large-scale (regional to continental) patterns of bison biogeography are not well understood. Here we integrate archaeological and paleontological bison occurrence data with simulated climate data to better understand long-term drivers of bison distribution and abundance in North America. We used these records to model bison distribution and abundance over the past 20 thousand years at 1-thousand-year intervals. Our results show that late Quaternary changes in the distribution and abundance of bison were influenced by large-scale trends in temperature and precipitation. The distribution of bison since the BollingeAllerod Interstadial (ca. 14 ka) is primarily explained by seasonal temperature patterns (mean temperature of the coldest quarter is the most important variable for 12 of the 14 1-thousand-year intervals). The modeled climate of bison distributions progressively narrowed since the Last Glacial Maximum (ca. 20 ka) as bison populations retracted from disjunct Pleistocene refugia and congregated in midcontinent rangelands. Through the Pleistocene Holocene transition, bison experienced rapidly warming summer temperatures that increased faster in midcontinent North America than other regions and the continent as a whole. Model results suggest that Holocene bison abundance was influenced by hydroclimatic shifts that affected the quality and availability of forage. Bison abundances decreased through the dry early and mid-Holocene and increased when moisture availability improved in the late Holocene. We infer that bison have thrived under a broad range of environmental conditions since the Last Glacial Maximum and that the climatic and biogeographic space occupied by bison narrowed in recent millennia. 0 2022 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Climate, forest successional stage, and soil substrate age can alter herbivore communities and their effects on biogeochemical cycling, but the size and spatial variability of these effects are poorly quantified. To address this knowledge gap, we established a globally distributed network of 50 broadleaved old-growth forests across six continents, encompassing well-constrained local-scale gradients in mean annual temperature (MAT), mean annual precipitation (MAP), succession, and soil substrate age. We used this network to investigate how these variables impact insect foliar herbivory and the associated carbon, nitrogen, phosphorus, and silica fluxes in forest ecosystems. Over 1 to 2 years, we measured stand-level foliar biomass production, leaf-level herbivory, and foliar element concentrations. At the global scale, insect herbivores liberated higher amounts of elements from the canopies of warmer and drier sites than those of cooler and wetter sites with patterns for phosphorus being most pronounced. MAT exerted a stronger influence over insect-mediated element fluxes than MAP. Foliar biomass production and leaf-level herbivory responses to MAT and MAP were mainly responsible for the observed changes in insect-mediated element fluxes; we also observed minor effects of foliar phosphorus concentration on phosphorus fluxes. Local-scale trends were mixed and successional stage or soil substrate age did not appear to influence insect herbivore-mediated element fluxes. These results demonstrate that climate effects on plant-herbivore interactions are stronger at large than small scales, at which herbivory rates and nutrient fluxes appear to be more strongly affected by a diversity of non-climate factors.

AB  - As large migratory caribou herds decline globally and regional climate trends point to a warmer future, there is a need and a legislative requirement to ensure impacts of industrial development are fully assessed, particularly with respect to cumulative effects. In this paper we use a current proposal, the potential leasing of the 1002 lands on the Alaskan Arctic coastal plain of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge for hydrocarbon development, to project the potential cumulative effects on the international Porcupine Caribou Herd. Using the caribou cumulative effects model, an existing decision support tool, we evaluate six alternative development scenarios for the 1002 lands, ranging from no leasing to full leasing with standard mitigation conditions. Compared to the no leasing option, at the current population size (218,000 caribou), our analysis projected that the likelihood of a herd decline over a 10-year period would increase from 3% to 19% depending on the leasing scenarios analyzed. This compares to an increased probability of decline from 11% to 26% if the starting population was 100,000, indicative of population estimates in the early 1970s. Our approach accomplishes one of the main steps in a comprehensive cumulative effects assessment, namely the quantification of past, present, and foreseeable future projects on a valued ecosystem component, the Porcupine Caribou Herd. We suggest the testing of underlining assumptions and refinements of the model required to more fully estimate the impacts of development. The use of transparent, quantitative decision support tools in assessing industrial development impacts on Arctic wildlife becomes more critical as climatic changes to Arctic landscapes accelerate.

AB  - Understanding patterns of animal space use and range fidelity has important implications for species and habitat conservation. For species that live in highly seasonal environments, such as mountain goats (Oreamnos americanus), spatial use patterns are expected to vary in relation to seasonal changes in environmental conditions and sex- or age-specific selection pressures. To address hypotheses about sex, age, and seasonality influence on space-use ecology, we collected GPS location data from 263 radio-collared mountain goats (males, n = 140; females, n = 123) in coastal Alaska during 2005-2016. Location data were analyzed to derive seasonal and sex-specific fixed-kernel home range estimates and to quantify the degree of seasonal range and utilization distribution overlap. Overall, we determined that home range size was smallest during winter, expanded coincident with the onset of green-up and parturition, and was largest during summer. Home range size of males and females did not differ significantly during winter, but females had larger home ranges than males during summer, a relationship that was switched during the mating season. Pairwise comparisons involving individual females across subsequent years indicated home ranges were significantly smaller during years when they gave birth to offspring. Mountain goats exhibited a strong degree of range fidelity, and 99% (n = 138) of individual animals returned to their previous year's seasonal range with an average annual Bhattacharyya's affinity utilization distribution overlap index of 68%. Similarity of seasonal home range utilization distributions varied in relation to sex and season in some respects. Home range overlap was highest during the summer vegetation growing season, particularly among females. These findings advance our understanding about how environmental variation and sex- and age-related reproductive constraints influence space use and range fidelity among alpine ungulates. Documentation of the high degree of range fidelity among mountain goats has important conservation implications in landscapes increasingly altered by anthropogenic activities.

AB  - center dot Background and Aims Kelps are the primary foundation species in temperate subtidal rocky shores world-wide. However, global change is causing their decline with consequences for the organisms that rely on them. An accurate assessment of these consequences may depend on which attributes of the associated community are considered. This study shows that conventional alpha-diversity approaches may overlook some of these consequences compared to spatially explicit approaches such as with beta-diversity.center dot Methods A 1-year seasonal study was conducted to compare the macroalgal understorey between healthy reefs with a Laminaria ochroleuca canopy and degraded reefs where the canopy collapsed years ago due to excessive fish herbivory. At each reef, the understorey seaweed assemblage was recorded in five replicate quad-rats to estimate alpha-diversity (total richness, species density, Shannon index) and beta-diversity (intra-and inter-reef scale).center dot Key Results The understorey assemblage exhibited a distinct seasonal dynamic in both healthy and degraded reefs. alpha-Diversity attributes increased in spring and summer; turf-forming algae were particularly dominant in degraded reefs during summer. beta-Diversity also showed seasonal variability, but mostly due to the changes in degraded reefs. None of the alpha-diversity estimates differed significantly between healthy and degraded reefs. In contrast, spatial beta-diversity was significantly lower in degraded reefs.center dot Conclusions Although the loss of the kelp canopy affected the composition of the macroalgal understorey, none of the conventional indicators of alpha-diversity detected significant differences between healthy and degraded reefs. In contrast, small-scale spatial beta-diversity decreased significantly as a result of deforestation, suggesting that the loss of kelp canopy may not significantly affect the number of species but still have an effect on their spatial arrangement. Our results suggest that small-scale beta-diversity may be a good proxy for a more comprehensive as-sessment of the consequences of kelp forest decline.

AB  - Reintroduction programs have increased amid unprecedented biodiversity loss, yet the success of these programs lag. A prominent reason for program failure is dispersal beyond the planned range of the population. Management techniques, such as hazing, can be used to prevent movement beyond set boundaries, but to be effective long-term, the animals must learn to avoid the areas where they are hazed. Although concepts of animal learning have been used to improve reintroduction programs, learning is not often explicitly tested or used as an indicator of program success. We used a conservation behavior framework to evaluate how a range of management techniques influenced learning in a reintroduced population of bison in Banff National Park, Canada. We hypothesized exposure to stronger negative stimuli would enhance learning, leading to more pronounced behavioral responses. Specifically, we tested the degree to which management actions (i.e., drift fence encounters, foot, horseback, helicopter, and combined hazing) elicited behavioral responses and how they facilitated learning. Consistent with our predictions, drift fence interactions and foot and horseback hazing elicited fewer behavioral responses of a smaller magnitude than helicopter hazing or combined methods, suggesting these techniques cause less disturbance to the bison. Bison continually returned to locations where they encountered management actions that caused the least disturbance, demonstrating a lack of associative learning. Bison appeared to form negative associations with locations where they were hazed via helicopter or combined methods, however, and rarely returned to these locations. Evaluating management techniques is essential for improving conservation success. We demonstrate that by bridging the fields of conservation biology and animal learning, we can understand how management techniques influence learning and behavior thereby facilitating effective conservation plans that incorporate disruption levels of the animals, financial costs, and overall effectiveness. Effective conservation plans, in turn, improve our likelihood of successfully managing and recovering species.

AB  - Marine protected areas (MPAs) represent a useful tool for resource management, as well as to conserve and/or restore biological communities. The level of protection is key factor influencing the marine biodiversity, where a more enforced protection is expected to drive positive outcomes. In 2008, a large MPAs network (-11,380 km(2)) was established in one of off the most populated and industrialized areas in the world (i.e., Sao Paulo State coast, southeast Brazil). Given many goods and services provided by marine ecosystems, this MPA network represents the most challenging marine conservation initiative in Brazil. Harboring areas with different socio-ecological contexts and management regimes, this MPA network provides a unique opportunity to investigate the effects of cumulative impacts. We contrasted the biomass and size structure of reef fish in three subtropical islands under different levels of enforcement. We analyzed the influence of variables as island size, benthic cover, depth, topographic complexity, wave exposure, and protection level on the biomass of reef fish assemblages. Protection level was the main attribute responsible to explain the high biomass of fish target species and small territorial herbivores. In sites sheltered from the waves, the biomass of groupers was -1600% higher within enforced area than that from open-access area. Beyond the idea of positive effects of enforcement on reef fish biomass and size, we add evidences that even under multiple stressors, the area-based management is still a strong tool to marine conservation.

AB  - Species distribution and activity patterns vary across regions, and these patterns reveal key information about the biology of a given species. However, such data in Niubeiliang National Nature Reserve located in the Qinling Mountains, Shaanxi Province, China, are inadequate due to limited monitoring studies. From September 2017 to December 2019, 57 infrared cameras were installed to monitor species distribution relative to distance from National Highway 210, and spatial and temporal activity patterns in Niubeiliang National Nature Reserve (elevation range 1,100 to 2,802 m). Sixteen species of mammals were recorded in our survey. The 4 most frequently detected species were Reeves's Muntjac (Muntiacus reevesi), Wild Boar (Sus scrofa), Pere David's Rock Squirrel (Sciurotamias davidianus), and Golden Takin (Budorcas taxicolor bedfordi). Daily patterns of these species indicated that Reeves's muntjacs and golden takins were more active at dawn and dusk, whereas wild boars and Pere David's rock squirrels were more active during the day. The relative abundance index of these mammals varied seasonally. Wild boars and Pere David's rock squirrels showed no obvious preference in elevation distribution, Reeves's muntjacs preferred low-elevation habitats (1,300 to 1,600 m), and golden takins mainly inhabited high-elevation areas (1,900 to 2,100 m). Golden takins showed obvious avoidance of roads, with avoidance distance from the road of >300 m. In contrast, Reeves's muntjacs were remarkably abundant within 200 m of the road. For both wild boars and Pere David's rock squirrels, there was no significant difference in RAI among 5 highway ranges. These findings help describe the distribution and activity patterns of these species in Qinling, to monitor their population dynamics, and to develop tailored conservation strategies for the 4 species and sympatric wildlife.

AB  - Land managers interested in maintaining species diversity often face difficult decisions when managing cattle grazing. Choosing a successful stocking regime and intensity for a particular region can be difficult. Landowners in the southern Texas region face challenges identifying successful stocking regimes or grazing intensity because of high temperatures from April through October and frequent droughts that often last up to or longer than 3 years. Cattle grazing is a major southern Texas agricultural industry that can have profound impacts that alter the diversity and structure of vegetation. Small mammals are an appropriate focal group for understanding ecosystem changes because of their rapid reproductive cycles and successful use in monitoring ecosystem conditions. From 2015 to 2020, we conducted a small mammal mark-recapture study to understand the impacts of grazing, along with variability in temperature and rainfall, on small mammal abundance in southern Texas. Sampling occurred within four different cattle grazing treatments to provide insight on cattle interactions with small mammals. We analyzed changes in small mammal abundance between three groups based on their food preferences: omnivores, granivores, and herbivores. For all three groups, there was a negative influence of temperature, but not precipitation and year, on abundance. With landscapes changing with time, land managers could use these data as a baseline for monitoring small mammal abundance in this region and potentially other similar native rangelands.

AB  - Zooarchaeological analysis is a useful means of exploring faunal palaeoecology, paleoclimate and past human behaviours. The Middle Pleistocene archaeological site Lazaret Cave, located in modern-day Nice, France, features a vast assemblage of faunal remains pertinent to the understanding of early Neanderthal subsistence behaviours as well as red deer (Cervus elaphus) ecology during MIS 6. This pilot study examines materials from archaeological layer UA25, a short-term occupation layer at Lazaret dating to similar to 150,000 years ka, which has revealed 28 early Neanderthal remains as well as thousands of faunal bones, of which red deer and ibex (Capra ibex) are most abundant. Molars from three red deer mandibles and a single ibex were analysed for strontium (Sr-87/Sr-86) isotopic analysis using laser ablation mass spectrometry to determine animal movements during tooth formation, combined with intra-tooth oxygen (delta O-18) isotope analysis to determine seasonality. The isotope data was modelled within a local Sr-87/Sr-86 isoscape and computational spatial assignment was undertaken to reconstruct potential summer and winter ranges of red deer. Results from this pilot study show seasonal mobility within 20 km of Lazaret, identifying two possible summer and winter ranges for the red deer excavated from UA25. Both possible summer ranges are located at higher elevations further from Lazaret while winter ranges have been assigned to lower elevations closer to the coastline and closer to Lazaret. The ibex shows no Sr-87/Sr-86 variation throughout the first, second and third molar and the spatial assignment indicates it lived proximal to the site during the period of tooth formation. In addition to providing the first evidence of red deer spatial ecology in southern France during MIS 6, we also infer from the faunal isotope data that hominins at Lazaret Cave were likely hunting red deer in autumn and winter when they were closer to the cave site, while hunting in summer would have required up to 20 km of travel.

AB  - Biologists often manage abundant invasive Common Carp (Cyprinus carpio) populations for suppression below population density or biomass thresholds via commercial harvest that also removes large numbers of native Bigmouth Buffalo (Ictiobus cyprinellus). Thus, biologists need population estimates to monitor abundance but often avoid them due to the time and effort required to produce population estimates and pervading estimate imprecision. While population abundance of these fishes can be challenging to estimate, commercial fishers harvest large numbers of fish that could improve population estimates with less effort from biologists. Yet, how population estimates from fishery-dependent and fishery-independent data sources compare is unknown. We compared the precision of Schnabel fishery-independent (electrofishing) and Lincoln-Petersen fishery-dependent (commercial harvest) population estimates for Common Carp and Bigmouth Buffalo in seven northwest Iowa lakes. We then assessed how sampling effort and environmental factors affected the number of fish recaptured by electrofishing and how the number of fish marked and recaptured affected estimate variability. Lincoln-Petersen estimates were more precise and provided similar abundance estimates compared with Schnabel estimates for Bigmouth Buffalo, while both models provided comparable population estimates and precision for Common Carp. Common Carp electrofishing recaptures were positively related to electrofishing effort, number of fish tagged, lake size, and water temperature. Bigmouth Buffalo recaptures were positively related to number of fish tagged and negatively related to lake area and water temperature. Coefficient of variation for fishery-dependent estimates declined with number of fish tagged and recaptured; 750 Common Carp and 150 Bigmouth Buffalo needed to be marked at large to obtain precision of CV <= 0.25. Our results suggest Lincoln-Petersen estimates with fishery-dependent data represent an improvement over fishery-independent estimates for Bigmouth Buffalo while both techniques provided comparable estimates for Common Carp. Incorporating harvest data into population estimates can reduce sampling effort while improving or maintaining precision.

AB  - 1. The food chain length represents how much energy reaches different trophic levels in food webs. Environmental changes derived from human activities have the potential to affect chain length.
   2. We explore how habitat area and edges affect chain length through: (1) a bottomup effect of abundance ('pyramid hypothesis'); (2) the truncation of the highest trophic level ('trophic-rank hypothesis'); and (3) changes in species connectivity patterns ('connectivity hypothesis').
   3. We built plant-leaf miner-parasitoid food webs in 19 remnants of a fragmented Chaco forest from central Argentina. On each remnant, we constructed food webs from different locations at the forest interior and edges. For each food web, we registered the abundance of species, the species richness of each trophic level, estimated the connectivity of their networks, and the average food chain length. We used structural equation models to evaluate the direct and indirect effects of habitat area and edge/interior location on food chain length mediated by species richness, abundance and connectivity.
   4. We found no direct effects of habitat area on chain length but chains were longer at forest edges than at their interior. The three mechanisms were supported by our results, although they showed different strengths. First, we found that the interior favours a bottom-up abundance effect from herbivores to parasitoids that positively affected chain length; second, we found that the forest area positively affects plant richness, which has a strong effect on the number of resources used by consumers, with a positive effect on chain length. Third, the remnant area and interior position favoured plant richness with a negative effect on the abundance of parasitoids, which had a positive effect on chain length. In general, the strongest effects on chain length were detected through changes in abundance rather than species richness although abundance was less affected by habitat fragmentation.
   5. We evaluated for the first time the effects of human- driven habitat fragmentation on the length of trophic chains in highly diverse plant-herbivore- parasitoid networks. Despite the loss of species, small habitat fragments and edges embedded in the agricultural matrix can support interaction networks, making them conservation targets in managed landscapes.

AB  - Remotely sensed images with low resolution can be effectively used for the large-area monitoring of vegetation restoration, but are unsuitable for accurate small-area monitoring. This limits researchers' ability to study the composition of vegetation species and the biodiversity and ecosystem functions after ecological restoration. Therefore, this study uses LiDAR and hyperspectral data, develops a hierarchical classification method for classifying vegetation based on LiDAR technology, decision tree and a random forest classifier, and applies it to the eastern waste dump of the Heidaigou mining area in Inner Mongolia, China, which has been restored for around 15 years, to verify the effectiveness of the method. The results were as follows. (1) The intensity, height, and echo characteristics of LiDAR point cloud data and the spectral, vegetation indices, and texture features of hyperspectral image data effectively reflected the differences in vegetation species composition. (2) Vegetation indices had the highest contribution rate to the classification of vegetation species composition types, followed by height, while spectral data alone had a lower contribution rate. Therefore, it was necessary to screen the features of LiDAR and hyperspectral data before classifying vegetation. (3) The hierarchical classification method effectively distinguished the differences between trees (Populus spp., Pinus tabuliformis, Hippophae sp. (arbor), and Robinia pseudoacacia), shrubs (Amorpha fruticosa, Caragana microphylla + Hippophae sp. (shrub)), and grass species, with classification accuracy of 87.45% and a Kappa coefficient of 0.79, which was nearly 43% higher than an unsupervised classification and 10.7-22.7% higher than other supervised classification methods. In conclusion, the fusion of LiDAR and hyperspectral data can accurately and reliably estimate and classify vegetation structural parameters, and reveal the type, quantity, and diversity of vegetation, thus providing a sufficient basis for the assessment and improvement of vegetation after restoration.

AB  - Ecosystem functioning may directly or indirectly-via change in biodiversity-respond to land use. Dung removal is an important ecosystem function central for the decomposition of mammal faeces, including secondary seed dispersal and improved soil quality. Removal usually increases with dung beetle diversity and biomass. In forests, dung removal can vary with structural variables that are, however, often interrelated, making experiments necessary to understand the role of single variables on ecosystem functions. How gaps and deadwood, two main outcomes of forest management influence dung removal, is unknown. We tested if dung removal responds to gap creation and deadwood provisioning or if treatment effects are mediated via responses of dung beetles. We expected lower removal rates in gaps due to lower dung beetle biomass and diversity. We sampled dung beetles and measured dung removal in a highly-replicated full-factorial forest experiment established at 29 sites in three regions of Germany (treatments: Gap, Gap + Deadwood, Deadwood, Control). All gaps were experimentally created and had a diameter of around 30 m. Dung beetle diversity, biomass and dung removal were each lower in gaps than in controls. Dung removal decreased from 61.9% in controls to 48.5% in gaps, irrespective of whether or not the gap had deadwood. This treatment effect was primarily driven by dung beetle biomass but not diversity. Furthermore, dung removal was reduced to 56.9% in the deadwood treatment. Our findings are not consistent with complementarity effects of different dung beetle species linked to biodiversity-ecosystem functioning relationships that have been shown in several ecosystems. In contrast, identity effects can be pronounced: gaps reduced the abundance of a large-bodied key forest species (Anoplotrupes stercorosus), without compensatory recruitment of open land species. While gaps and deadwood are important for many forest organisms, dung beetles and dung removal respond negatively. Our results exemplify how experiments can contribute to test hypotheses on the interrelation between land use, biodiversity and ecosystem functioning.

AB  - Uptake and use of energy are of key importance for animals living in temperate environments that undergo strong seasonal changes in forage quality and quantity. In ungulates, energy intake strongly affects body mass gain, an important component of individual fitness. Energy allocation among life-history traits can be affected by internal and external factors. Here, we investigate large-scale variation in body growth patterns of Alpine chamois Rupicapra rupicapra rupicapra, in relation to sex, age, temperature, and habitat variations across 31 (sub)populations in the Central European Alps. Taking advantage of an exceptionally large dataset (n = 178,175) of chamois hunted over 27 consecutive years between 1993 and 2019 in mountain ranges with different proportions of forest cover, we found that (i) patterns of body mass growth differ between mountain ranges, with lower body mass but faster mass growth with increasing proportion of forest cover and that (ii) the effect of spring and summer temperatures on changes in body growth patterns are larger in mountain ranges with lower forest cover compared to mountain ranges with higher forest cover. Our results show that patterns of body mass growth within a species are more plastic than expected and depend on environmental and climatic conditions. The recent decline in body mass observed in Alpine chamois populations may have greater impacts on populations living above the treeline than in forests, which may buffer against the effects of increasing temperatures on life-history traits.

AB  - Ecosystems can respond in a variety of ways to the same agent of disturbance. In some contexts, fire causes large and long-lasting changes to ecological communities. In others, fire has a limited or short-lived impact on assemblages of animals and plants. Understanding why this occurs is critical if we are to manage these kinds of disturbances across the globe. A recent synthesis proposed that these seemingly idiosyncratic responses to fire can be understood in the context of habitat openness pre-disturbance. Assemblages in open habitats should respond less to a single fire event that those in closed habitats. We provide a test of this hypothesis by examining the response of ant (Hymenoptera: Formicidae) communities to large-scale fire events in three habitats of different natural canopy openness on the Peloponnese peninsula in Greece. We also test the hypothesis that assemblage responses to fire are trait dependent. Fire simplifies the physical structure of the environment, increases insolation, and limits opportunities for ants to exploit herbivorous feeding strategies. Consequently, we predict that ants will face a strong environmental filter between unburnt and recently burnt plots, which will be reflected in their functional morphology. Our analysis shows that burnt plots have more individual ants, more species and an almost complete compositional change relative to unburnt plots. These changes do not depend on initial canopy openness. Rather, we suggest that openness must be interpreted relative to the study taxon; for ants, openness should be measured closer to the ground level. In our study, ground-level openness does not vary across the plots, which may explain the results. Furthermore, ants in burnt plots are significantly larger, have relatively longer legs, relatively longer mandibles, and more elongate heads. This morphotype fits with our prediction of ants that can move and feed successfully in the burnt micro-landscape. Ultimately, more work is needed to fully explore the relationship between habitat openness and the response to fire. Our results showing a filtered set of ant morphologies in burnt environments suggest that ant traits may offer a further way forward to understand the faunal response to fire and disturbance in general.

AB  - Bioturbation caused by herbivorous fossorial mammals creates extensive bare patches through their burrowing activities. Understanding changes in plant-soil carbon (C), nitrogen (N), and phosphorus (P) stoichiometry during the vegetation recovery of these bare patches is crucial for elucidating the restoration mechanisms of disturbed grassland ecosystems. This study considered plateau pika (Ochotona curzoniae) as the focal species and categorized the bare patches into short-term and long-term bare patches using a spatial substitution strategy, with surrounding vegetated surfaces in disturbed alpine meadows as controls. Results showed that P concentration in plant roots was 32.58% higher in long-term bare patches compared to short-term bare patches. However, no significant changes were observed in C and N concentrations in either plant shoots or roots during vegetation recovery process. Soil N concentrations were 38.78% lower in short-term bare patches and 36.65% lower in longterm bare patches compared to vegetated surfaces. The C:N ratio in plant shoots was 18.26% lower in short-term bare patches than in vegetated surfaces, whereas the soil C:N ratio was 39.42% higher in long-term bare patches compared to vegetated surfaces. However, no changes were observed in the C:P and N:P ratio of both plant and soil during vegetation recovery process of bare patches. These findings indicate that P concentration in plant roots can serve as a reliable indicator of the vegetation recovery process of bare patches caused by plateau pikas. Furthermore, plants in short-term bare patches prioritize rapid growth through resource allocation, while in long-term bare patches, they enhance nutrient use efficiency to achieve greater stability and resilience. These insights into plant-soil nutrient dynamics provide a deeper understanding of ecosystem resilience and recovery processes in disturbed alpine meadows, offering a valuable foundation for more targeted grassland management strategies.

AB  - Once widespread across the Holarctic region, the iconic and pre-historic muskox (Ovibos moschatus) has seen a significant range reduction, with endemic populations now restricted to North America and scattered populations introduced throughout Eurasia. In 1971, five individuals from the introduced Norwegian population migrated across the border into Sweden and re-established a natural Swedish muskox population in Harjedalen. While the size of this population has since fluctuated, up-to-date knowledge on the population size and status has been missing. In the summer of 2024, we therefore conducted a population survey and estimated the current population size to eight individuals. Although the population remains small and despite the absence of a formal wildlife management plan, the presence of a sub-adult and calf still shows an ongoing reproduction and suggests a viability and long-term local continuity of muskoxen in the area. Compared to the well-studied populations in North America and Greenland, little is known about the foraging ecology, habitat selection and ecological role of muskoxen in Scandinavia. Synthesizing published research from other regions, we explore the potential ecological services of the Swedish muskoxen, such as mitigating climate-induced changes like shrubification. We also report the results of our count of the population-eight individuals, including a calf and a sub-adult-and discuss its future prospects in Sweden, arguing that the environmental conditions in Scandinavia are indeed capable of supporting muskox populations.

AB  - Soil erosion by water is known to be a major driver of land degradation. Splash erosion is the initial stage of water erosion and directly contributes to the detachment of soil particles on sloping land. Splash erosion may be exacerbated or mitigated by ongoing land use/cover change. To estimate the effects of various land use and management systems on splash erosion in the humid tropics, we measured the actual splash erosion under natural rainfall conditions in a tropical rainforest (TR), rubber monoculture (RM), and four rubber agroforestry ecosystems in Xishuangbanna, Southwestern China. The average cumulative splash mass in the RM was 48.7 times higher compared to that in the TR, indicating that the replacement of TR by RM results in severe splash erosion. In the rubber agroforestry systems, the throughfall kinetic energy and splash mass were 34-76% and 86-97% lower, respectively, than that in the RM, indicating that intercropping crops with rubber trees can effectively alleviate erosive power of throughfall and thus splash erosion. Under all land use regimes, in the plots where the litter layer was removed, splash erosion was significantly (2.0-12.1 times) higher and more spatially heterogeneous than in those with litter cover. This highlighted the key role of the forest litter layer in protecting the soil from raindrop detachment. In the study area, the actual splash erosion was strongly correlated with the conditions of precipitation (amount and intensity (I10) of rainfall) and the vegetation structure (especially the crown base height, leaf area index, and canopy cover), but weakly correlated with the soil properties. Given the importance of near-ground intercrops (height <5 m) for improving the vegetation structure, surface cover, and soil conditions, the intercropping of Camellia sinensis and Theobroma cacao with rubber trees is a promising approach for controlling splash erosion and also has benefits on the sustainable development of rubber plantation.(c) 2022 International Research and Training Center on Erosion and Sedimentation, China Water and Power Press, and China Institute of Water Resources and Hydropower Research.

AB  - Copepods form the bulk of secondary production in marine ecosystems and are a major resource for higher trophic levels. Copepods are highly sensitive to environmental changes as they are ectotherms with a short life span whose metabolism and development depend on abiotic conditions. In turn, changes in their functional structure (i.e. functional trait composition) can have impacts on ecosystems. We examined changes in the copepod functional community in the North Sea over the past five decades, using a trait-based approach. We observed a shift around 1986-1988: the copepod community was initially dominated by larger herbivores, with a long development time, diapause ability, and highest abundances in summer. This community changed abruptly after 1986-1988, to a dominance of smaller carnivore taxa, with shorter development times, less ability to enter diapause, and that display higher abundances in autumn. This rapid reorganization could be driven by higher water temperatures, lower dinoflagellate abundances, and lower nutrient concentrations. These changes could impact adjacent trophic levels, such as phytoplankton on which several species graze or fish larvae, leading to a mismatch situation with consequences for fish recruitment. Our results emphasize the impact that global and regional changes could have on coastal ecosystems through the role played by copepods.

AB  - Knowledge of the diet ecology of apex predators in insular island ecosystems has direct applications to the conservation of endemic species at risk of extinction. We used stable isotopes of carbon and nitrogen to infer resource-use strategies of an indigenous predator, the Pacific marten (Marks caurina (Merriam, 1890)), in a highly modified ecosystem on Haida Gwaii, British Columbia, Canada. We used Bayesian isotopic mixing models to estimate the relative contributions of different food sources to marten diet across seasons and during overall lifetime, and to determine how diet varied with different levels of access to marine resources. Isotopes of carbon and nitrogen measured in hair and muscle tissue suggested that marten consumed salmon (3%-17%) and berries (25%-37%) seasonally; these diet groups were relatively minor components of the lifetime diet. Analysis of bone collagen suggested that terrestrial fauna - including birds, deer, small mammals, and invertebrates - contributed the most to diet (41%-55%), and marine invertebrates (38%-48%), not salmon (0%-3%), were the main allochthonous marine nutrient subsidy to lifetime diet. Plasticity in foraging ecology, combined with a broad dietary niche, introduced prey, notably the invasive Sitka black-tailed deer (Odocoileus hemionus sitkensis Merriam, 1898), as well as abundant marine resources, may allow marten to outcompete other indigenous and endemic carnivores on Haida Gwaii.

AB  - Marine heatwaves are becoming more frequent and intense as climate change progresses, with potential consequences for the functioning of marine ecosystems, particularly macroalgal beds and their associated mesoherbivores. While the direct effects of heatwaves on macroalgae have been well studied, the interactions between species at different trophic levels that affect ecosystem functioning remain underexplored. The aim of this study was to investigate how marine heatwaves affect primary and secondary productivity in marine ecosystems. We conducted a mesocosm experiment combining the macroalga Sargassum filipendula and the mesoherbivore amphipod Cymadusa filosa under two temperature scenarios: a current summer temperature (27 degrees C) and a heatwave scenario (32 degrees C), with and without herbivores. The experiment lasted 30 days, with 5 days of marine heatwave. All replicates were kept at 27 degrees C for ten days. Then, the 'heatwave' treatment replicates were exposed to 32 degrees C for five days. Subsequently, all replicates were returned to 27 degrees C and maintained for 15 days until the end of the experiment. We evaluated the variation in macroalgal biomass and the variation in amphipod biomass and abundance. The results showed that heatwaves reduced primary and secondary productivity, with the greatest effects observed on primary producers. The reduction in primary productivity suggests that these extreme events may compromise the ability of macroalgae to support the base of the coastal food web and facilitate the occurrence of an abundant and diverse associated fauna. Thus, changes in mesoherbivore biomass may have significant implications for higher trophic levels, affecting the dynamics and stability of marine ecosystems. These results suggest that marine heatwaves affect the functioning of marine ecosystems by reducing productivity, potentially altering the flow of energy and matter along the food web, and affecting ecosystem services such as carbon storage by algae.

AB  - The human footprint is rapidly expanding, and wildlife habitat is continuously being converted to human residential properties. Surviving wildlife that reside in developing areas are displaced to nearby undeveloped areas. However, some animals can co-exist with humans and acquire the necessary resources (food, water, shelter) within the human environment. This ability to coexist may be particularly true when development is low intensity, as in residential suburban yards. Yards are individually managed "greenspaces" that can provide a range of food (e.g., bird feeders, compost, gardens), water (bird baths and garden ponds), and shelter (e.g., brush-piles, outbuildings) resources and are surrounded by varying landscape cover. To evaluate which residential landscape and yard features influence the richness and diversity of mammalian herbivores and mesopredators; we deployed wildlife game cameras throughout Northwestern Arkansas, USA in 46 residential yards in summer 2021 and 96 yards in summer 2022. We found that mesopredator diversity had a negative relationship with fences and was positively influenced by the number of bird feeders present in a yard. Mesopredator richness increased with the amount of forest within 400 m of the camera. Herbivore diversity and richness were positively correlated to the area of forest within 400 m surrounding yard and by garden area within yards, respectively. Our results suggest that while landscape does play a role in the presence of wildlife in a residential area, homeowners also have agency over the richness and diversity of mammals using their yards based on the features they create or maintain on their properties.

AB  - Conspecific negative density dependence (CNDD) is an important driver of stand-level tree diversity in temperate forests. CNDD can occur via two main processes. First, soil pathogens and herbivores form a halo of high enemy density surrounding established trees at local spatial scales. As a result, seedlings and saplings residing within this halo experience reduced growth and survival. Second, intraspecific competition can lead to local depletion of resources, reducing the performance of conspecific seedlings and saplings, and encouraging spatial mixing of tree species. While seedlings and saplings respond to nearby conspecific adults, they are simultaneously responding to local environmental conditions. Solar radiation, soil moisture, and soil nutrients can all influence tree recruitment patterns. Furthermore, these environmental factors can influence densities and activities of soil pathogens, as well as seedling and sapling carbon balance. As a result, we expect small-scale variation in the abiotic environment to influence the magnitude of CNDD, although this expectation has thus far received little attention. We combined tree stem and environmental data from a mapped oak-hickory forest plot to evaluate whether the local environment modulates the direction or magnitude of negative density dependence. We tested for the interaction between conspecific and heterospecific basal area within a sapling's neighborhood and each of five environmental covariates: index of canopy gaps, soil organic matter, soil cations, topographic curvature, and topographic slope/aspect. We found that increasing local conspecific and heterospecific basal areas reduced sapling growth and that the conspecific basal area reduced sapling growth more so than did heterospecific basal area. Furthermore, we observed significant interactions between adult tree density and all environmental covariates that differed depending on the category of nearby adults (i.e., conspecific vs. heterospecific), and this effect was most important with variations in soil organic matter, soil cations, and topographic slope/aspect. We conclude that tree basal area not only interacts with environmental conditions to influence sapling growth, but more importantly, that small-scale environmental conditions interact with the density of nearby conspecifics to modulate sapling growth. Thus, if this result proves general, a central mechanism underlying the maintenance of diversity can be modified by small-scale environmental conditions.

AB  - Fences are an important tool for anchoring reintroduced species to a target area, and there is a need to understand their effect on other wildlife species. However, little is understood about the response of wildlife to newly constructed fences over time. We evaluated fences used in the reintroduction of plains bison Bison bison to Banff National Park, Canada. These fences were designed to contain reintroduced bison while allowing for the free passage of other wildlife. In 2020, we provided an assessment of the permeability of several fence designs. Here, we investigated longer-term fence effects and addressed the emerging question of whether wildlife adapt their behaviours to navigate fences more effectively over time. We used an expanded array of remote cameras and a before-after-control-impact design to evaluate changes in detection probability for 12 species. Next, we tested for changes in crossing rates and travel speeds of migratory elk Cervus canadensis using 22 years of GPS collar data. Finally, we examined whether species detections or elk movements changed over time after fences were constructed. Changes in detection probability near fences were inconsistent between species. Elk fence crossing rates decreased after fence construction, and travel speeds slowed by a negligible amount. However, these effects were temporary - wildlife learned to cross fences more efficiently over time. Elk movement metrics followed a non-linear pattern after the appearance of fences and began returning to pre-fence states after approximately two years. Our study provides new information on the implementation of fences for conservation objectives while minimizing impacts on sympatric wildlife.

AB  - Linking the species interactions occurring at the scale of local communities to their potential impact at evolutionary timescales is challenging. Here, we used the high-resolution fossil record of mammals from the Iberian Peninsula to reconstruct a timeseries of trophic networks spanning more than 20 million years and asked whether predator-prey interactions affected regional extinction patterns. We found that, despite small changes in species richness, trophic networks showed long-term trends, gradually losing interactions and becoming sparser towards the present. This restructuring of the ecological networks was driven by the loss of medium-sized herbivores, which reduced prey availability for predators. The decrease in prey availability was associated with predator longevity, such that predators with less available prey had greater extinction risk. These results not only reveal long-term trends in network structure but suggest that prey species richness in ecological communities may shape large scale patterns of extinction and persistence among predators.
   We used the Iberian fossil records to reconstruct mammalian food webs throughout millions of years. We found that trophic networks became sparser and less connected towards the present and that a higher number of prey species buffered predators against extinction.image

AB  - Context The > 25,000 km(2) Flint Hills ecoregion in eastern Kansas and northeastern Oklahoma, USA, is an economically and ecologically important area encompassing the largest remaining tallgrass prairie ecosystem in North America. Prescribed fires are used routinely to control invasive woody species and improve forage production for the beef-cattle industry. However, burning releases harmful pollutants that, at times, contribute to air quality problems for communities across a multi-state area. Objectives Establish a modeling framework for synthesizing long-term ecological data in support of Flint Hills tallgrass prairie management goals for identifying how much, where, and when rangeland burning can be conducted to maximize ecological and economic benefits while minimizing regional air quality impacts. Methods We used EPA's VELMA ecohydrology model to synthesize long-term experimental data at the 35 km(2) Konza Prairie Biological Station (KPBS) describing the effects of climate, fire, grazing, topography, and soil moisture and nutrient dynamics on tallgrass prairie productivity and fuel loads; and to spatially extrapolate that synthesis to estimate grassland productivity and fuel loads across the nearly 1000 times larger Flint Hills ecoregion to support prescribed burning smoke trajectory modeling using the State of Kansas implementation of the U.S. Forest Service BlueSky framework. Results VELMA provided a performance-tested synthesis of KPBS data from field observations and experiments, thereby establishing a tool for regionally simulating the combined effects of climate, fire, grazing, topography, soil moisture, and nutrients on tallgrass prairie productivity and fuel loads. VELMA's extrapolation of that synthesis allowed difficult-to-quantify fuel loads to be mapped across the Flint Hills to support environmental decision making, such as forecasting when, where, and how prescribed burning will have the least impact on downwind population centers. Conclusions Our regional spatial and temporal extrapolation of VELMA's KPBS data synthesis posits that the effects of integrated ecohydrological processes operate similarly across tallgrass prairie spatial scales. Based on multi-scale performance tests of the VELMA-BlueSky toolset, our multi-institution team is confident that it can assist stakeholders and decision makers in realistically exploring tallgrass prairie management options for balancing air quality, tallgrass prairie sustainability, and associated economic benefits for the Flint Hills ecoregion and downwind communities.

AB  - The decline of many woodland caribou (Rangifer tarandus caribou) populations is thought to be linked with habitat disturbances resulting from industrial development, including timber harvesting and its network of haul roads. Defining a disturbance-abundance relationship offers a tool to assess and potentially manage for the influence of disturbance on caribou abundance. Defining this relationship is challenged by limited historical land use and abundance data, the choice of a disturbance measure, and variability in the relationship between subpopulations and across core versus matrix habitat. For 12 subpopulations of woodland caribou within the southern mountain population, we linked longitudinal caribou abundance data with historical forestry disturbances simulated from forest harvest data. We compared disturbance measures estimating the proportion of forested area commercially harvested with even-aged, regeneration treatments (cutblocks) and converted to roads for transporting timber within subpopulation-specific core and matrix habitats as predictors of caribou abundance. Non-linear mixed models provided evidence that disturbances in matrix habitats negatively influenced caribou abundance, with the effects in core habitat being variable between subpopulations. Of the disturbance types evaluated, the best predictors included roads buffered by 50 m (R50), cutblocks <= 80 years old, and the cumulation of cutblocks <= 80 years old plus roads buffered by 50 m. The top-ranked model was composed of R50 present in core and in matrix habitats. This model predicted a 42% (95% CI = 33-51%) reduction in caribou abundance for every 1% increase in matrix R50 (holding core R50 constant). Given the lack of pre-forestry abundance data, we failed to directly derive critical disturbance thresholds; however, our models could be used to estimate subpopulation-specific habitat-disturbance thresholds necessary to achieve abundance targets. We recommend that in addition to existing protections of core habitat, few if any new roads should be built in core habitat, and that timber harvest in matrix habitat should be designed to minimize the establishment of associated roads.

AB  - Purpose Human conjunctival myiasis, which is often misdiagnosed or missed clinically, is commonly caused by Oestrus ovis larvae. Here, pathogenic identification was performed for two maggots collected from a patient from China, to provide a clinical scientific basis for diagnosis and treatment. Methods Morphological identification was performed using a microscope. Oestrus mtDNA cox1 and rDNA 28S were selected as target genes for duplex PCR amplification, followed by cloning, sequencing, and identification. Results Morphological examination showed that the maggots were approximately 1.0-1.5 mm long, long-oval-shaped, segmented, and covered with small spines, with a pair of hooks in the scolex and claw-like spines at the telson. Therefore, they were identified as the first-instar larvae of O. ovis. Duplex PCR detected products of approximately 400 and 200 bp, consistent with the size of designed cox1 and 28S D7a gene fragments, respectively. Sequences of cox1 and 28S D7a from the samples in question had 99.5-100.0% and 96.2-100.0% similarity (respectively) to GenBank sequences of O. ovis specimens known to parasitize sheep, goats, and humans. However, some 28S D7a sequences exhibited 89.7-90.6% similarity to GenBank sequences of Oestrus sp. known to parasitize Capra pyrenaica (Artiodactyla: Bovidae) (Iberian ibex). Therefore, we considered that the larvae infecting the patient originated from sheep or goats, not Iberian ibex. The phylogenetic trees supported this conclusion. Conclusion This study implemented the first duplex PCR molecular identification of O. ovis larvae parasitizing human eyes in China as a complementary approach to morphological identification. Our results indicate that molecular tools can be utilized to aid in the diagnosis of opthalmomyiasis.

AB  - Megaherbivores exert strong top-down influence on the ecosystems they inhabit, yet little is known about the foraging impacts of Asian elephants (Elephas maximus) on the structure of Southeast Asia's rainforests. Our goal was to document Asian elephants' dietary composition, selectivity, and foraging impacts in a Sundaic rainforest and test whether these differed between habitats. We conducted controlled direct observations of five wild-born captive elephants feeding on six plant types (bamboo, grass, monocot herbs, palms, lianas, and trees) of different age 2 in two habitats (mature vs. early successional forest) in Krau, Peninsular Malaysia. Palms, trees, and lianas formed the bulk of the elephants' diet. In the mature forest, elephants showed a strong preference for monocots (preference ratio, PR = 5.1), particularly large palms (PR = 5.4), while trees were negatively selected (PR = 0.14). Conversely, in early successional habitats, large tree saplings were positively selected (PR = 1.6). Elephants uprooted (30%) and broke the main stem (30%) of the dicot trees, mainly large saplings, that they handled. Tree saplings broken by elephants had an average diameter of 1.7 & PLUSMN; 1.1 cm (up to 7 cm), with breaks happening at 1.1 & PLUSMN; 0.5 m of height. We estimated that, in a year, an elephant could damage (i.e., either uproot or break) around 39,000 tree saplings if it fed entirely in mature forest, and almost double the number (73,000) if it fed solely in early successional habitats. Assuming a density of 0.05-0.18 elephants/km(2), elephant foraging could damage 0.2-0.6% of the tree sapling population per year. Slow growth rates of understory plants in mature forests could result in negative feedbacks, whereby elephants suppress palms, other monocots, and highly preferred tree species. Alternatively, elephants may initiate positive feedbacks by impeding succession along forest edges and in semi-open environments, thereby increasing the size of gaps and the availability of their preferred foodplants. Overall, our results show that Asian elephants act as ecological filters by suppressing the plants they prefer in Southeast Asia's rainforests.

AB  - Body size is closely related to the trophic level and abundance of soil fauna, particularly nematodes. Therefore, size-based analyses are increasingly prominent in unveiling soil food web structure and its responses to anthropogenic disturbances, such as livestock grazing. Yet, little is known about the effects of different livestock on the body size structure of soil nematodes, especially in grasslands characterized by local habitat heterogeneity. A four-year field grazing experiment from 2017 to 2020 was conducted in a meadow steppe characterized by typical mosaics of degraded hypersaline patches and undegraded hyposaline patches to assess the impacts of cattle and sheep grazing on the body size structure of soil nematodes within and across trophic groups. Without grazing, the hypersaline patches harbored higher abundance of large-bodied nematodes in the community compared to the hyposaline patches. Livestock grazing decreased large-bodied nematodes within and across trophic groups mainly by reducing soil microbial biomass in the hypersaline patches, with sheep grazing resulting in more substantial reductions compared to cattle grazing. The reduction in large-bodied nematode individuals correspondingly resulted in decreases in nematode community-weighted mean (CWM) body size, nematode biomass, and size spectra slopes. However, both cattle and sheep grazing had minimal impacts on the CWM body size and size spectra of total nematodes in the hyposaline patches. Our findings suggest that livestock grazing, especially sheep grazing, has the potential to simplify soil food webs by reducing large-bodied nematodes in degraded habitats, which may aggravate soil degradation by weakening the bioturbation activities of soil fauna. In light of the widespread land use of grasslands by herbivores of various species and the ongoing global grassland degradation of mosaic patches, the recognition of the trends revealed by our findings is critical for developing appropriate strategies for grassland grazing management.

AB  - Increased snow cover and attenuation of light due to shrub expansion can lead to changes in the quantity and nutritional quality of food resources for migratory caribou (Rangifer tarandus). To determine how vegetation is affected by snow accumulation and shade, we conducted an experiment that simulated the light and snow conditions created by increased shrub cover at Deception Bay (Nunavik, Canada), within the summer range of the Riviere-aux-Feuilles caribou herd. We estimated the foliar biomass of two major components of the caribou diet (Betula glandulosa and Carex spp.). We also harvested foliar tissue to conduct chemical composition analyses (nitrogen, fibre, total phenolics). Experimental light attenuation was found to increase the nitrogen concentrations in B. glandulosa and Carex spp. throughout the growing season. Phenolic concentration in B. glandulosa decreased in early summer but was otherwise consistent in response to light attenuation and increased snow cover. Increased snow cover combined with ambient light had a positive effect on the foliar biomass of B. glandulosa. Increased snow cover and shade caused by shrub densification may therefore increase forage quantity and quality for caribou. We suggest investigating the effects of shrub expansion on other components of the caribou diet, such as lichens and forbs.

AB  - Many African large carnivore populations are declining due to decline of the herbivore populations on which they depend. The densities of apex carnivores like the lion and spotted hyena correlate strongly with prey density, but competitively subordinate carnivores like the African wild dog benefit from competitive release when the density of apex carnivores is low, so the expected effect of a simultaneous decrease in resources and dominant competitors is not obvious. Wild dogs in Zambia's South Luangwa Valley Ecosystem occupy four ecologically similar areas with well-described differences in the densities of prey and dominant competitors due to spatial variation in illegal offtake. We used long-term monitoring data to fit a Bayesian integrated population model (IPM) of the demography and dynamics of wild dogs in these four regions. The IPM used Leslie projection to link a Cormack-Jolly-Seber model of area-specific survival (allowing for individual heterogeneity in detection), a zero-inflated Poisson model of area-specific fecundity and a state-space model of population size that used estimates from a closed mark-capture model as the counts from which (latent) population size was estimated. The IPM showed that both survival and reproduction were lowest in the region with the lowest density of preferred prey (puku, Kobus vardonii and impala, Aepyceros melampus), despite little use of this area by lions. Survival and reproduction were highest in the region with the highest prey density and intermediate in the two regions with intermediate prey density. The population growth rate (lambda$$ \lambda $$) was positive for the population as a whole, strongly positive in the region with the highest prey density and strongly negative in the region with the lowest prey density. It has long been thought that the benefits of competitive release protect African wild dogs from the costs of low prey density. Our results show that the costs of prey depletion overwhelm the benefits of competitive release and cause local population decline where anthropogenic prey depletion is strong. Because competition is important in many guilds and humans are affecting resources of many types, it is likely that similarly fundamental shifts in population limitation are arising in many systems.
   This work uses a powerful integrated population model to test what limits populations of endangered African wild dogs. It has long been thought that wild dogs are limited by dominant competitors like lions but not by the availability of prey. With the decline of large herbivores across Africa, prey density has begun to limit wild dogs.image

AB  - Simple Summary We conducted this study in the boreal forest of Quebec, Canada, to compare insect damage on white spruce (Picea glauca) trees within open-canopy, multispecies plantations, and trees naturally regenerated under mature mixed-wood canopies. Our plantation sites were established post-clearcutting and compared with naturally regenerated post-fire sites dominated by trembling aspen. Over two years, observations were made on young trees from ten sites in each environment, focusing on overall rates of herbivory, galls, spruce budworm damage, and sawfly defoliation. Despite a minor increase in spruce budworm damage in under-canopy forests from 2020 to 2021, overall, damage levels remained low, suggesting minimal impact on tree growth or mortality at this early outbreak stage. Contrary to initial assumptions, we found that insect damage was comparably low in both plantation and naturally regenerated environments, casting doubt on the idea that the enhanced sunlight and accelerated growth observed in plantations necessarily increase their susceptibility to pest attacks. In the context of global forest restoration efforts and Canada's pledge to plant 2 billion trees by 2050, the resilience of white spruce plantations to insect damage is of paramount importance. Amidst concerns over increasing pest damage due to climate change, the observed resilience of multispecies plantations underpins the effectiveness of ecosystem-based management in maintaining low insect damage levels without compromising growth. This balance highlights the potential of mixed-species plantations to mimic natural forest conditions, contributing to biodiversity conservation and sustainable forestry practices. This research illuminates the intricate dynamics between tree growth, environmental conditions, and pest vulnerability, offering valuable insights for future forest management and conservation strategies.Abstract In managed boreal forests, both plantations and natural regeneration are used to re-establish a cohort of conifer trees following harvest or disturbance. Young trees in open plantations generally grow more rapidly than under forest canopies, but more rapid growth could be compromised by greater insect damage. We compared insect damage on white spruce (Picea glauca (Moench) Voss, Pinaceae) growing in plantations with naturally regenerated trees under mature forest canopies in boreal forests (Quebec, Canada). We selected ten sites in the naturally regenerated forest and in small, multispecies plantations and sampled ten young trees of 2.5-3 m (per site) in late summer 2020 and again in early and late summer 2021. We compared overall rates of herbivory, galls (adelgids), damage by the spruce budworm (Choristoneura fumiferana, Clemens), and defoliation from sawflies. Overall, insect herbivory damage remained at similarly low levels in both habitats; an average of 9.3% of expanding shoots were damaged on forest trees and 7.7% in plantation trees. Spruce budworm damage increased from 2020 to 2021 and remained higher in under-canopy trees, but damage rates were negligible at this early stage of the outbreak (1.5% in forest vs. 0.78% of buds damaged on plantation trees). While damage due to galls was higher in plantations, the overall low level of damage likely does not pose a significant impact on the growth or mortality of young trees.

AB  - Increased demand for livestock products is exacerbating conflict with predators in many parts of the world, fuelling an increase in predation management practices in many grazing systems. In Australia, exclusion fences are being erected across broad areas to facilitate the sustained eradication of dingoes, an apex predator, prompting concern for possible cascading effects on extant wildlife populations. We experimentally assessed population trends of mammals, reptiles and ground-dwelling birds inside and outside of two large, fenced areas over a five-year period subsequent to the erection of the fences and the removal of dingoes. Wildlife population abundances inside the fences were always higher or the same as outside the fences, and all wildlife species exhibited similar population trends within each treatment over time. The only exception to this was kangaroo populations, which fluctuated widely inside fenced areas but remained relatively low and stable outside fenced areas. Kangaroos exhibited negative relationships with dingoes, although unmeasured variables limited our ability to quantify specific causes for kangaroo population trends. Vegetation trends were virtually identical between treatments, indicating that wildlife population trends are closely linked to vegetation conditions and not predator abundances. These applied, experimental results demonstrate that top-predator removal does not routinely cause trophic cascades (including mesopredator releases) in Australian rangeland ecosystems. We therefore encourage exploration of opportunities for targeted threatened species recovery in predator-free areas on land used for livestock production.

AB  - Marine protected areas (MPAs) in which fishing is limited are a widespread management strategy to protect marine ecosystems. While many studies show clear effects of MPAs on fish biomass, much less is known about how protection influences the strength of ecological processes such as herbivory and predation. We characterised fish assemblages and used feeding assays to contrast rates of herbivory and predation by fish in MPAs (no-take and those with partial protection) and in fished sites in Sydney, Australia's largest city. In no-take MPAs, large fish were more abundant, species richness was greater, and the biomass of predatory, herbivorous and all fish combined was higher. In contrast, sites with partial protection were indistinguishable from fished sites. Predation was higher in no-take MPAs than in partially protected MPAs, while herbivory was less influenced by protection status. These results show that protection from fishing within urbanised reefs can facilitate energy flow to higher trophic levels via increases in predation.

AB  - Simple Summary The nutritional content of food plants can, to a large extent, determine the physical attributes of herbivorous insects, from growth rates to the need for defenses against predators. In forests, tree species richness may influence these plant-mediated effects through increasing variation in the nutritional quality that herbivorous insects encounter. Seasonal progression can also shape the plant-herbivore relationship, with lowered leaf quality in later seasons. It is expected that specialist herbivores fare better than generalists in poorer nutritional-quality host plants, whereas generalists can benefit from dietary mixing in more variable neighborhoods. However, a clear understanding of how these factors interact to influence the diversity and functionality across multiple traits of herbivorous insect communities is lacking. In this study, we found support for the expectation of higher generalism of caterpillars in high-nutrition content trees, which also promoted higher abundance but lowered caterpillar species richness and smaller and less defended individuals. Increasing tree richness led to higher caterpillar species sharing between tree species, decreased trait variation, and increased caterpillar species richness per tree species. Our findings shed light on how leaf traits and changes in tree richness interact to influence the trait composition of key herbivores through fine-scale habitat partitioning in host plant neighborhoods. Nutritional content of host plants is expected to drive caterpillar species assemblages and their trait composition. These relationships are altered by tree richness-induced neighborhood variation and a seasonal decline in leaf quality. We tested how key functional traits related to the growth and defenses of the average caterpillar hosted by a tree species are shaped by nutritional host quality. We measured morphological traits and estimated plant community-level diet breadth based on occurrences from 1020 caterpillars representing 146 species in a subtropical tree diversity experiment from spring to autumn in one year. We focused on interspecific caterpillar trait variation by analyzing presence-only patterns of caterpillar species for each tree species. Our results show that tree richness positively affected caterpillar species-sharing among tree species, which resulted in lowered trait variation and led to higher caterpillar richness for each tree species. However, community-level diet breadth depended more on the nutritional content of host trees. Higher nutritional quality also supported species-poorer but more abundant communities of smaller and less well-defended caterpillars. This study demonstrates that the leaf nutritional quality of trees shapes caterpillar trait composition across diverse species assemblages at fine spatial scales in a way that can be predicted by ecological theory.

AB  - Context. Ungulate populations are subject to fluctuations caused by extrinsic factors and require efficient and frequent surveying to monitor population sizes and demographics. Unmanned aerial systems (UAS) have become increasingly popular for ungulate research; however, little is understood about how this novel technology compares with conventional methodologies for surveying wild populations.
   Aims. We examined the feasibility of using a fixed-wing UAS equipped with a thermal infrared sensor for estimating the population density of wild white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) at the Cedar Creek Ecosystem Science Reserve (CCESR), Minnesota, USA. We compared UAS density estimates with those derived from faecal pellet-group counts.
   Methods. We conducted UAS thermal survey flights from March to April of 2018 and January to March of 2019. Faecal pellet-group counts were conducted from April to May in 2018 and 2019. We modelled deer counts and detection probabilities and used these results to calculate point estimates and bootstrapped prediction intervals for deer density from UAS and pellet-group count data. We compared results of each survey approach to evaluate the relative efficacy of these two methodologies.
   Key results. Our best-fitting model of certain deer detections derived from our UAS-collected thermal imagery produced deer density estimates ((X) over bar = 9.40, 95% prediction interval = 4.32-17.84 deer km(-2)) that overlapped with the pellet-group count model when using our mean pellet deposition rate assumption ((X) over bar = 7.01, 95% prediction interval = 4.14-11.29 deer km(-2)). Estimates from our top UAS model using both certain and potential deer detections resulted in a mean density of 13.77 deer km(-2) (95% prediction interval = 6.64-24.35 deer km(-2)), which was similar to our pellet-group count model that used a lower rate of pellet deposition ((X) over bar = 10.95, 95% prediction interval = 6.46-17.65 deer km(-2)). The mean point estimates from our top UAS model predicted a range of 136.68-273.81 deer, and abundance point estimates using our pellet-group data ranged from 112.79 to 239.67 deer throughout the CCESR.
   Conclusions. Overall, UAS yielded results similar to pellet-group counts for estimating population densities of wild ungulates; however, UAS surveys were more efficient and could be conducted at multiple times throughout the winter.

AB  - Phytoplankton community composition and succession affect aquatic food webs and biogeochemistry. Resource competition is commonly viewed as an important governing factor for community structuring and this perception is imbedded in modern ecosystem models. Quantitative consideration of the physical spacing between phytoplankton cells, however, suggests that direct competition for growth-limiting resources is uncommon. Here we describe how phytoplankton size distributions and temporal successions are compatible with a competition-neutral resource landscape. Consideration of phytoplankton-herbivore interactions with proportional feeding size ranges yields small-cell dominated size distributions consistent with observations for stable aquatic environments, whereas predator-prey temporal lags and blooming physiologies shift this distribution to larger mean cell sizes in temporally dynamic environments. We propose a conceptual mandala for understanding phytoplankton community composition where species successional series are initiated by environmental disturbance, guided by the magnitude of these disturbances and nutrient stoichiometry, and terminated with the return toward a 'stable solution'. Our conceptual mandala provides a framework for interpreting and modeling the environmental structuring of natural phytoplankton populations.

AB  - Environmental drivers can influence animal behaviour, affecting movement patterns and spatial dynamics with a cascading effect. Furthermore, most species adapt their behaviour to ecological factors, such as predation risk. In human-dominated landscapes, most medium-to-large terrestrial mammals are crepuscular or nocturnal, limiting their opportunities for other temporal changes. However, the role of nocturnal illumination and the lunar cycle in these spatiotemporal patterns remains understudied. We used camera trapping data, kernel density estimation, and generalized additive models to analyse the effects of the lunar cycle and moonlight on activity patterns of wolves Canis lupus and their ungulate prey in a Mediterranean area, accounting for cloudiness and habitat. Our results give no support to spatial avoidance by prey, and wolves were spatially synchronized with them. Additionally, we found no evidence of changes in animal activity modulated by moon brightness. Instead, we identified more refined mechanisms driving the relationships between wolves and their prey. Specifically, wolves seemed to exploit darker nights in areas more frequently used by their main prey (i.e. wild boar Sus scrofa and fallow deer Dama dama). Wild boar were more active during the brightest nights in the sites most used by the predator, whereas fallow deer were more active in the sites used in an intermediate way by the wolf and during nights with a middle nocturnal light intensity. Roe deer Capreolus capreolus were slightly more active during darker nights and in more concealed sites. These outcomes suggest that animal activity patterns reflect a trade-off between species-specific physiological features (e.g. poor nocturnal visual acuity in wild boars), the need for foraging, prey availability, vigilance, predation risk, human disturbances, and ambient light levels. Our results contribute to shed light on the underexplored effects of lunar illumination on predator and prey activities and relationships, particularly in ecosystems experiencing the return of apex predators.

AB  - Accurate dietary inference of wild carnivores is essential to understand their impacts on the ecosystem and manage carnivore-livestock conflicts. Diet analysis with fecal DNA metabarcoding technology can help deliver valuable insights with fine-grained resolution. The recovery of wolves in Washington, USA offers an excellent opportunity to study the diet of this iconic carnivore species and explore prey partitioning between sympatric wolves and coyotes. We characterized the diet composition and spatiotemporal dietary variations in each species using fecal DNA metabarcoding technology on 202 fecal samples from wolves (N = 99) and coyotes (N = 103) collected across three wolf pack ranges and two seasons in northeastern Washington. We also quantified the diet niche overlap between these two canid species. In total, 19 different prey items were detected, with most assigned at the species level. Frequency of occurrence (FOO) data showed that wolves primarily preyed upon deer (Odocoileus sp.; 47.5%) and moose (Alces alces; 42.4%). Coyotes also consumed moose (30.1%) and deer (21.4%), but snowshoe hares (Lepus americanus) were the most common prey (61.2%) in the coyote diet. Multiple samples were found to contain DNA from domestic animals, including pig, rabbit, and cow. Results on diet composition using FOO and relative read abundance were qualitatively similar, indicating a strong biological pattern. We found significant spatial variations in the wolf diet composition (p = 0.001) and significant spatio temporal variations in the coyote diet (pack range: p = 0.003; season: p = 0.023). Dietary overlap between these two canid species varied with pack ranges and seasons (O = 0.08-0.74). Our study demonstrates that fecal DNA metabarcoding is an efficient non-invasive tool to characterize high-resolution diet profiles of carnivores and monitor their dietary changes over space and time. Limitations of fecal DNA metabarcoding are also discussed.

AB  - Nutrient enrichment disrupts plant-animal interactions and ecosystem functioning globally. In woodland systems, the mechanisms of bottom-up turnover on plant-herbivore interactions remain understudied. Here, we performed a full-factorial field experiment to evaluate the interactive effects of nutrient addition (nitrogen, phosphorus, and/or potassium) on the assemblage of foliar herbivores and the interaction frequency with Berberis microphylla, a dominant shrub species in Patagonian woodlands. Additionally, we assessed whether these effects could be mediated by changes in vegetative traits and microhabitat characteristics (i.e., canopy cover) that may ultimately influence the foraging behavior of herbivores. The addition of nitrogen reduced the herbivory frequency by 41%, yet this effect was diluted in the presence of potassium. We found no effects of phosphorus addition. Our results suggest that the impact of multiple nutrient additions (N and K) on herbivory patterns could be mediated by changes in two important foliar traits, leaf size and leaf density. This study shows how multiple nutrient addition can change the magnitude of antagonistic plant-animal interactions in woodlands. Since herbivory by arthropods has a relevant role in net primary productivity, our results highlight the importance of buffering human-driven woodland eutrophication to maintain important ecological functions (e.g., herbivory) associated with antagonistic plant-animal interactions and avoiding ecosystem dysfunction.

AB  - In order to investigate what community selection forces are operating on Grime's CSR strategies in different semi-natural grassland habitats that were not subjected to successional processes, a time-series analysis of 2946 Danish grassland plots from an eight-year period with pin-point plant cover data was conducted. Grime's CSR strategies were used for grouping plant species into functional types, which were then treated as dependent variables in a time-series analysis. Across four grassland habitat types, there was significant selection against ruderal plant species during the eight-year period. Furthermore, the monitoring data indicated that the decreasing cover of ruderals may, in part be, due to reduced grazing pressure of large herbivores. As a conse-quence of the findings in this study and others, it may be suggested that increased disturbance, e.g. by large herbivores, is a suitable management strategies for grassland habitats.

AB  - Chilika, a native buffalo breed of the Eastern coast of India, is mainly distributed around the Chilika brackish water lake connected with the Bay of Bengal Sea. This breed possesses a unique ability to delve deep into the salty water of the lake and stay there to feed on local vegetation of saline nature. Adaptation to salinity is a genetic phenomenon; however, the genetic basis underlying salinity tolerance is still limited in animals, specifically in livestock. The present study explores the genetic evolution that unveils the Chilika buffalo's adaptation to the harsh saline habitat, including both water and food systems. For this study, whole genome resequencing data on 18 Chilika buffalo and for comparison 10 Murrah buffalo of normal habitat were generated. For identification of selection sweeps, intrapopulation and interpopulation statistics were used. A total of 709, 309, 468, and 354 genes were detected to possess selection sweeps in Chilika buffalo using the nucleotide diversity (theta pi), Tajima's D, nucleotide diversity ratio (theta pi-ratio), and FST methods, respectively. Further analysis revealed a total of 23 genes including EXOC6B, VPS8, LYPD1, VPS35, CAMKMT, NCKAP5, COMMD1, myosin light chain kinase 3 (MYLK3), and B3GNT2 were found to be common by all the methods. Furthermore, functional annotation study of identified genes provided pathways such as MAPK signaling, renin secretion, endocytosis, oxytocin signaling pathway, etc. Gene network analysis enlists that hub genes provide insights into their interactions with each other. In conclusion, this study has highlighted the genetic basis underlying the local adaptive function of Chilika buffalo under saline environment.

AB  - Rangeland-based livestock production constitutes a primary source of livelihood for many inhabitants of dryland regions. Their subsistence relies heavily on maintaining the productivity, biodiversity and services of these ecosystems. Harsh environmental conditions (e.g., drought) combined with land use intensification (e.g., overgrazing) make dryland ecosystems vulnerable and prone to degradation. However, the interplay between livestock grazing intensity and aridity conditions in driving the conservation and nutritional value of forage in arid and semi-arid rangelands is still not fully understood. In this study, we performed structural equation models (SEM) to assess the simultaneous direct and indirect effects of livestock grazing intensity and aridity level on community structure, diversity, biomass, forage production, forage C:N ratio and forage fiber composition in two semi-arid Mediterranean rangelands, NE Spain. Not surprisingly, we found that higher livestock grazing intensity led to lower community plant cover, especially when combined with higher aridity. However, both increasing grazing intensity and aridity were associated with higher forage production after one year of grazing exclusion. We did not find any adverse effect of livestock grazing on plant diversity, although plant species composition differed among grazing intensity levels. On the other hand, we found an aridity-driven trade-off in regard of the nutritional value of forage. Specifically, higher aridity was associated with a decrease in the least digestible fiber fraction (i.e., lignin) and an increase in forage C:N ratio. More interestingly, we found that livestock grazing modulated this trade-off by improving the overall forage nutritional value. Altogether, our results provide further insights into the management of semi-arid Mediterranean rangelands, pointing out that maintaining traditional rangeland-based livestock production may be a sustainable option as long as rangeland conservation (e.g., community plant cover) is not severely compromised.

AB  - Litter decomposition plays a critical process driving the cycling of carbon (C), nitrogen (N), and phosphorus (P). However, the combined effects of grazing system (GS) and grazing intensity (GI) on litter decomposition remain unclear. In this study, a two-year experiment was conducted to examine effects of two GS (CG - continuous grazing, and RG - rotational grazing) and two GI (0 and 8 sheep ha- 1) on litter decomposition in an alpine meadow on the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau (QTP). GI at 8 sheep ha- 1 increased decomposition rate of litter dry matter (DM) by 78.2 %, C by 8.9 %, N by 110.3 %, and P by 25.6 % compared to no grazing. RG enhanced decomposition rate of DM by 24.9 %, C by 27.0 %, N by 52.4 %, and P by 3.8 % compared to CG. GI exerted a stronger effect on litter decomposition than GS and their interaction (GS x GI). The litter turnover rate was the fastest at GI at 8 sheep ha- 1. RG reduced annual litter decomposition mass per unit area of pasture by 42.7 %, while CG reduced it by 19.6 %. Stoichiometric characteristics of litter contributed 19.0 %, -4.3 %, 22.3 %, and 4.2 % to litter DM, C, N, and P decomposition, respectively. Initial C content, solar radiation, litter allocation coefficient, and solar radiation explained 10.1 %, 12.5 %, 12.0 %, and 10.5 % variance in DM, C, N, and P decomposition, respectively. Grazing decoupled climate effects, thereby promoting litter decomposition. The results suggest that grazing enhances decomposition and turnover of litter in the QTP, providing insights into nutrient cycling under global climate change.

AB  - With evidence of pollinator declines and an increasing focus on restoration, interest is growing in investigating floral resources for native bees. Although native bees forage on shrubs, few studies have explored the pollinator communities of native shrubs and none have examined shrub-pollinator interactions in riparian areas of the northwestern United States. Life history traits of shrubs may make them particularly important resources for bees, especially in early spring-a key point in the lifecycle of many bee species. We conducted extensive hand-net surveys over 2 years in a large riparian restoration project in the Pacific Northwest to understand bee-flowering plant interactions with the aim of guiding future restoration efforts. Although forb blooming stem abundance and richness were higher than that of shrubs in spring, 57% of bees observed foraging were on willow (Salix spp.), a commonly planted riparian shrub. Season-long, bee community composition on shrubs differed from that of forbs. Bee species diversity was highest on wax currant (Ribes cereum) and willow in early spring (April) and on black hawthorn (Crataegus douglasii) and mallow ninebark (Physocarpus malvaceus) later (i.e., June - July). Some bees showed a strong preference for wax currant and black hawthorn, both of which are more resistant to ungulate herbivory than other shrubs. Our results suggest that riparian restoration practitioners could consider using shrubs that provide forage to a diverse community of pollinators and improve stream health by shading and stabilizing banks. Planting bee-friendly shrubs can help accomplish multiple restoration goals and leverage limited restoration funding.

AB  - Tropicalization is rapidly restructuring subtropical marine communities. A key driver for tropicalization is changes in herbivory pressure that are linked with degrading ecosystem stability. Consequently, subtropical algal beds are being displaced by climate-mediated colonisation of coral communities. This process is thought to be aided by the elevated herbivory resulting from tropicalization, but the relative contribution to herbivory by different taxa is not fully understood. Evaluating herbivory pressure and its effect on coral cover and rugosity across a subtropical latitudinal gradient will help predict how these processes may change with further tropicalization and ocean warming. Herbivory pressure exerted by fishes and urchins across this subtropical latitudinal gradient remains unquantified. Using in-situ feeding observations, we quantify fish and urchin herbivory pressure at seven sites across non-accreting coral communities, and warmer accreting coral reefs in southern Japan. We then relate herbivory pressure to respective fish and urchin community structure and coral cover and rugosity. Urchin herbivory is greater on non-accreting coral communities than on true coral accreting reefs; a result which is reversed for fish herbivory. Overall, herbivory pressure is greater on accreting coral reefs than on coral non-accreting communities, but is dependent on reef characteristics as community structures differ more strongly among reefs than between regions. These factors are linked to coral cover and rugosity that differ between reefs, but not between climatic regions, further emphasising the influence of local factors on the benthic cover and the associated fish and urchin community, and thus herbivory pressure. Our findings provide a foundation for understanding how non-accreting coral communities may respond to ongoing tropicalization, given the fish and invertebrate herbivores they host.

AB  - In urbanised areas, marine infrastructure alters natural light regimes, creating habitats that are permanently shaded, affecting the community structure of settling and resident biota. While applications of artificial lights have been suggested to minimise impacts of shading or manipulate community composition for specific aims (e.g. carbon capture, biosecurity), their use has not been evaluated. We used two field experiments to test the effect of artificial light of low (1 x 20,000 lumen light) and high (3 x 20,000 lumen light or 1 x 66,000 lumen light) intensities (7 AM-7 PM on-off cycle) on benthic communities on marine infrastructure. Specifically, we assessed whether artificial lights (i) led to the development of communities similar to those under natural light conditions, (ii) enhanced the abundance of algae and discouraged invertebrates (functional groups that are inversely impacted by shade) and whether (iii) the extent to which artificial lights impact marine communities varies across environmental settings (high and low turbidity) where natural light availability differs. Impacts were assessed on new (two sites) and established communities (one site). We also assessed the effect of artificial light on predation/herbivory pressure using a caging experiment at the low turbidity site. For new communities developing on bare substrate in low turbidity conditions, low intensity artificial light resulted in similar communities to bare substrate exposed to natural light levels. High intensity artificial light increased algal cover beyond communities developing in natural light. Caging increased the cover of algae and invertebrates across all treatments. In turbid locations, artificial light (high and low) increased algal abundance, though to a lesser extent. The addition of artificial light had limited effects on established benthic communities. Synthesis and applications. Our experiments indicate that artificial lights can be effective in reversing effects of shading, but that targeted outcomes (e.g. increased algal or reduced invertebrate cover) are limited to bare substrates and low turbidity environments where more light is available, and algae are naturally abundant.

AB  - When wide ranging, herbivorous species such as African elephants (Loxodonta africana) are confined and their population densities increase, the vegetation may be negatively affected. Any changes to vegetation structure and complexity may then result in a series of ecological cascades on other plant and animal species that rely on the vegetation for survival. We assessed the composition and structure of the woody and succulent plants within the locally endemic Albany Thicket Biome at five protected areas (reserves) with elephants in the Eastern Cape province, South Africa in 2006 and 2016. We show that when elephant populations in this region are actively managed, wholesale negative impacts on woody thicket plant physiognomy are not observed. In fact, the only statistically detectable change over time, presumably due to elephants, was the toppling of larger, single-stemmed trees. We believe that because the Albany Thicket Biome evolved in the presence of large, top-down browsers such as elephants, the generally negative effects that have been observed of elephants on vegetation in savanna systems are not evident. However, the reserves with elephants in the Eastern Cape are all relatively small (< 400 km(2)) and fenced which prevents elephant dispersal. Thus, continued monitoring of elephant browsing effects is crucial for the future conservation of this unique biome.

AB  - Simple Summary North American grassland birds evolved with American bison (Bison bison), until overhunting drove bison to near-extinction > 150 years ago. Bison have now been reintroduced to many areas that provide important nesting habitat for grassland birds, which are now among the most rapidly declining birds in North America. However, little is known about bison interactions with birds such as Bobolinks (Dolichonyx oryzivorus), obligate grassland nesting songbirds of conservation concern. Using data collected over an 18-year period, we assessed the effects of bison reintroduction, together with other land management and climate factors, on Bobolinks in a private conservation area comprising 24 km(2) of native grasslands in the North American Great Plains. In grasslands where bison were reintroduced, Bobolink abundance (adult numbers) declined by 62%, and productivity (juvenile numbers) declined by 84%. By contrast, Bobolink populations remained stable over the same time period in adjacent grasslands where bison were not reintroduced. Bobolink abundance and productivity increased in years following warmer and wetter winters, but nevertheless declined over time in grasslands where the bison population doubled. Where bison are reintroduced and confined in high densities, overgrazing, trampling, and related impacts may drive severe declines in Bobolinks and other grassland birds of conservation concern. Among the most rapidly declining birds in continental North America, grassland birds evolved with American bison (Bison bison) until bison nearly became extinct due to overhunting. Bison populations have subsequently rebounded due to reintroductions on conservation lands, but the impacts of bison on grassland nesting birds remain largely unknown. We investigated how bison reintroduction, together with other land management and climate factors, affected breeding populations of a grassland bird species of conservation concern, the Bobolink (Dolichonyx oryzivorus). We quantified population changes in Bobolinks over an 18-year period in conservation grasslands where bison were reintroduced, compared with adjacent grasslands grazed by cattle and where hay was harvested after the bird breeding season. Four years after bison reintroduction, the bison population in the study area had doubled, while Bobolink abundance declined 62% and productivity declined 84%. Our findings suggest that bison reintroduction as a conservation strategy may be counterproductive in grassland fragments where overgrazing, trampling, and other negative impacts drive declines in grassland breeding birds. Where bird conservation is an objective, small grassland reserves may therefore be inappropriate sites for bison reintroduction. To maximize conservation benefits to birds, land managers should prioritize protecting grassland birds from disturbance during the bird breeding season.

AB  - The proportion and diversity of prey species consumed by bobcats Lynx rufus are often correlated with prey abundances, individual skill level, environmental conditions, and habitat quality. Bobcats generally consume prey species that rely on mast-the fruits of trees-for basic life-history requirements. In West Virginia forests, many mast-producing tree species have declined over the past 40 y, yet the last known study on bobcat diet in the state was in 1977. Thus, we need current data to understand the effects of forest compositional changes on bobcat dietary patterns. We evaluated stomach contents of 300 bobcats collected over the 2014-2015 (n = 150) and 2015-2016 (n = 150) hunting and trapping seasons in West Virginia. Simpson's index of diversity indicated an 87% probability that two randomly selected prey items belong to different species, supporting the idea of bobcats as generalist carnivores. White-tailed deer (hereafter deer) Odocoileus virginianus (32%), mice and rats (families Cricetidae, Dipodidae, and Muridae; 30.7%), rabbits (family Leporidae; 21.3%), Virginia opossum Didelphis virginiana (18.7%), and squirrels (family Sciuridae; 17.3%) occurred most frequently. We found 92% dietary overlap between sexes and 35% between stage classes. Deer, opossum, and raccoon Procyon lotor occurred more frequently in males, whereas rabbits occurred more frequently in females. Deer occurred more frequently in adults; raccoons in yearlings; and mice and rats in juveniles. Overall occurrence of deer (-17.1%), rodents (order Rodentia; -9.5%), opossum (+13.5%), and raccoon (+5.1%) differed significantly between the 1977 study and this study, which may allude to changes in the abundance of mast-dependent prey species over time. Similarly, hard mast (i.e., nuts) production had a significant interaction effect with study season on the overall occurrence of squirrels in bobcat diets. By improving our understanding of bobcat trophic interactions, we can better manage their populations and ecological communities by managing for the dietary requirements of their common prey species.

AB  - Macropods exhibit selective herbivory on plant traits within and between species and hence can alter plant trait variation. In this study, we asked what are the effects of macropod herbivory on intraspecific variation in plant traits of forest understory species? We tested the effects of herbivory by macropods on eight plant traits, in nine understory species using a herbivore exclusion experiment. Generalized linear mixed models were used to test for differences between herbivory treatments in trait means as well as variation within species and at the community level. Macropod herbivory resulted in differences in either the mean trait value or trait variance within a species for seven of the eight tested plant traits. Macropod exclusion resulted in larger dimensions of size for most species, as well as changes in specific leaf area, moisture content, and carbon content of leaves. Further, community-weighted means of specific leaf area, moisture content, and leaf nitrogen were lower in the presence of macropods. Plant trait variance was altered for three of the seven community-weighted traits. This study demonstrates a mechanism through which macropods can drive changes in the traits of understory plant species. Plant traits have been linked to various larger scale ecological processes including ecosystem flammability, nutrient cycling, response to global change, and habitat suitability for other organisms. Therefore, herbivore-induced changes in plant trait variation and community composition could have important flow-on effects for other environmental processes and hence should be considered in management decisions regarding fire-prone ecosystems.

AB  - In seasonal environments, the timing of reproduction often matches with the peak of food resources. One well-known effect of global warming is an earlier phenology of resources, leading to a possible mismatch between the timing of reproduction for consumers and food peak. However, global warming may also change the dynamics of food resources, such as the intensity and frequency of pulsed mast seeding. How quantitative changes in mast seeding influence the timing of reproduction of seed consumers remains unexplored. Here, we assess how yearly variation in mast seeding influences mating time in wild boar (Sus scrofa), a widespread seed consumer species. We took advantage of the intensive monitoring of both female reproduction (1636 females) and acorn production over 6 consecutive years across 15 populations of wild boar in the wild. We found that mating time occurs earlier when acorn production increases in most but not all populations. In two out of 15 populations, heavy females mated earlier than light ones. Our findings demonstrate that mast seeding advances the mating time in some populations, which could perhaps impact how boars respond to climate change.

AB  - Consistent with a warming climate, the timing of key phenological phases (i.e. phenophases) for many plant species is shifting, but the direction and extent of these shifts remain unclear. For large herbivores such as ungulates, altered plant phenology can have important nutritional and demographic consequences. We used two multi-year datasets collected during 1992-1996 and 2015-2019 of understory plant phenology in semi-arid forested rangelands in northeastern Oregon, United States, to test whether the duration of phenophases for forage species has changed over time for three plant functional groups (forbs, graminoids, and shrubs). Duration of spring green-up was approximately 2 weeks shorter in the later years for forbs (19 +/- 3.8 d) and graminoids (13.2 +/- 2.8 d), and senescence was 3 weeks longer for graminoids (25.1 +/- 5.1) and shrubs (22.0 +/- 4.6). Average peak flowering date was 3.1 +/- 0.2 d earlier per decade for understory forage species with approximately 1/3 of the species (35%) exhibiting earlier peak flowering dates over time. Variation in late-winter precipitation had the greatest effect on the duration of understory green-up, whereas variation in summer precipitation had a greater effect on duration of the senescent period. Collectively, these results indicate climate-related progression towards shorter periods of peak plant productivity, and earlier and longer periods of plant senescence, the combination of which substantially reduces the temporal window of forage available in growing forms most usable to herbivores. This work adds a needed component to the climate change literature, by describing links between shifting climate variables, multiple phases of understory plant phenology, and possible nutritional consequences for herbivores under a warming climate.

AB  - Management of grassland is one of the important factors in traditional livestock farming systems. A survey was conducted in Madi of Chitwan Nepal to understand the perceptions of the farmers/graziers about grassland and feed management. For that, a well-prepared pretested set of questionnaires was used to collect information related to feeds and grassland ecological knowledge of the farmers. The questionnaire consisted of a set of questions about the household, factors affecting grassland productivity and alternative feeding resources. The survey revealed variations in household livestock ownerships, mostly for cattle (1-3) and buffalo (1-5), whilst goat ownership was similar across the survey sites. Grazing duration in months was similar in the study sites (about 7 months per year). Likewise, there was no conflict for grazing livestock, whereas it is believed that goat and buffalo have the same level of detrimental effect on grassland. A significantly higher number of respondents reported that flooding had a negative impact (p = 0.032) on grassland productivity. The Imperata cylindrica (L.) P. Beauv. locally known as Siru was a dominant forage species followed by the mosaics of Saccharum spontaneum L. locally known as Kaans in Nepali and Jhaksi in Tharu language, Saccharum bengalense Retz. locally known as Baruwa in Nepali and Narkat in the Tharu language. The respondents also pointed out that at least 2 to 3 years were needed for the recovery of grasslands when hampered by flooding and riverbank cut-off. Similar species dominated in the recovered grasslands over time of flooding. The seasonal fodder plantation was a major area of grassland improvement issue across the survey sites. There were high dependencies of the graziers on natural herbages and crop residues for feeding livestock in summer and winter, though the herbage species and preferences remained different. This study provides the primary background of the biophysical factors of grassland management for sustainable uses that require institutional support. The study further provides an insight into the need for implementation of the demand-based grassland technology interventions, possibly at a higher rate of adoption than the current local scale. However, the social-ecological consequences of grassland systems, i.e. the impact of climate change, herd dynamics and nutrient flow in vegetation and soil, have to be monitored in a long run.

AB  - Animals in captive and urban environments encounter evolutionarily novel conditions shaped by humans, such as altered diets, exposure to human-associated bacteria, and, potentially, medical interventions. Captive and urban environments have been demonstrated to affect gut microbial composition and diversity independently but have not yet been studied together. By sequencing the gut microbiota of deer mice living in laboratory, zoo, urban and natural settings, we sought to identify (i) whether captive deer mouse gut microbiota have similar composition regardless of husbandry conditions and (ii) whether captive and urban deer mice have similar gut microbial composition. We found that the gut microbiota of captive deer mice were distinct from those of free-living deer mice, indicating captivity has a consistent effect on the deer mouse microbiota regardless of location, lineage or husbandry conditions for a population. Additionally, the gut microbial composition, diversity and bacterial load of free-living urban mice were distinct from those of all other environment types. Together, these results indicate that gut microbiota associated with captivity and urbanization are likely not a shared response to increased exposure to humans but rather are shaped by environmental features intrinsic to captive and urban conditions.

AB  - The vertical composition of the entomofauna was analyzed in three areas of the Universidad Nacional de Colombia Bogota campus, between 2018 and 2020 in order to make known especially to the general community, the faunal richness found in this relict of green areas within the urban landscape. To collect the specimens, stratified samplings were carried out in areas with different plant covers on the university campus. The collected entomofauna was determined at the family level and the values of Brillouin diversity (B), dominance (D) and Simpson's fairness (1-D) were established. The efficiency of the samplings was evaluated by means of the Chao-1, abundance models of the sampling sites were established to know their relationship with the diversity values and the trophic level of each of the collected groups was determined. Results show that the entomofauna of the Ciudad Universitaria is character-ized by low values of diversity, higher values of richness and abundance in the herbaceous strata and by the predominance of groups with phytophagous and polyphagous habits.

AB  - Governments and society increasingly are demanding that industrial projects result in a net positive impact (NPI) on biodiversity. Impacts are commonly measured in terms of losses and gains of area and quality of vegetation, where quality refers to how closely a site matches the condition of native vegetation in its undisturbed state. Existing vegetation quality frameworks share a number of limitations, including little or no replication, uncertain scope of inference, vulnerability to bias, and inability to measure error. Here we present the Vegetation Quality Assessment (VQA) framework, a sampling-based extension of Quality Hectares that measures vegetation quality in terms of overlap between the probability distributions of ecological indicators at a project site and in undisturbed (benchmark) vegetation of the same kind. Distribution overlap incorporates natural variation at the landscape scale and provides an intuitive measure of quality that varies between 0 and 1. Indicators are measured using a stratified-random sampling design that minimizes bias and supports inference at the scale of the project landscape. Confidence limits of quality and quality hectares are determined by bootstrapping; power and minimum sample sizes are estimated by Monte Carlo simulation. Multiple assessments track losses and gains of quality hectares and enable accurate accounting of progress to NPI. The VQA framework can be implemented using a variety of vegetation sampling methods, allowing existing vegetation databases to be leveraged as sources of data. We conclude by demonstrating the application of VQA at several mining operations in the Elk Valley of southeastern British Columbia, Canada.

AB  - Aim Factors that make species resilient to climate change can be difficult to study with empirical data because conditions cannot be experimentally controlled. We used trait-based evolutionary ecological agent-based modelling to understand how dispersal, selection, extirpation, and other factors contribute to resilience under three climate change scenarios to test the extent to which high dispersal rate contributes to persistence of species and the extent to which they occupy large geographic ranges on an evolutionary time-scale involving speciation, dispersal, gene flow, and extinction. Location Hesperia (an imaginary continent with controlled environmental heterogeneity). Major taxa studied Modelled mammalian herbivore clade with 16 terminal species, each of which is a metapopulation with a variable number of local populations. Methods We used NetLogo to model trait-based biotic responses to climate change in an environmentally heterogeneous continent in an evolving clade, the species of which are each represented by local populations that disperse and interbreed; they also are subject to selection, genetic drift, and local extirpation. We simulated mammalian herbivores, whose success depends on tooth crown height, vegetation type, precipitation and grit. Results We found that high dispersal probability usually allowed species to successfully track their ancestral habitat as the continent's geography was altered by climate change. However, tracking was insufficient to allow species' traits to adapt to novel habitats that arose through the climate change process. High dispersal rates combined with moderate plasticity (lower extirpation risk) facilitated occupation of novel habitats, as did weak selective regimes. Main conclusions The interaction between dispersal, probability of local extirpation, and selection intensity were jointly required to understand the likelihood of species survival and how widespread they would be. Diversity and geographic occupancy were maximized when parameters facilitated evolutionary adaptation to novel habitats. High rates of dispersal were sufficient for habitat tracking but insufficient by themselves to allow occupation of newly emerged environments.

AB  - Data on wildlife abundance is an important indicator both for the species concerned and the stability of entire ecosystems as well as for sustainable game management. Therefore, the abundance of ungulate game was verified in a foothill region of Kazakhstan. The methods of thermal imagery and faecal pellet group (FPG) census on transects were compared. The results obtained by the FPG counting method for moose (Alces alces, 0.34 individuals per 100 ha) and maral deer (Cervus elaphus sibiricus, 0.04 individuals per 100 ha) were relatively consistent with the data reported by the hunting ground tenants. Only one moose was detected by the thermal imaging transect count method. The results show that deer and moose abundance in Kazakhstan is significantly lower than in Central and Eastern Europe. Thus, for Kazakhstan, the method of FPG counting is well applicable for both routine and control counts. Detailed data on game populations can be obtained using the camera trap counting method, which has not been verified in Kazakhstan as yet.

AB  - Coastal Antarctic ecosystems feature long periods of sea ice cover, strong seasonality in primary production, and low biodiversity relative to marginal ice zone regions. There are few records of annual cycles of biodiversity and abundance of neritic Antarctic zooplankton, limiting the ability to predict how communities will respond to environmental change. Using a historical data set, we assess the annual cycle of primary production and zooplankton abundance in relation to the growth cycle of fast ice near Vestfold Hills, East Antarctica. Zooplankton abundance and biodiversity were high during the productive summer months, generally showing a lag behind peaks in chlorophyll a concentration. A total of 27 taxa were recorded from the water column, while only three species were recorded from the sea ice, apart from incidental occurrences. Copepods dominated the system throughout the year, especially in the non-productive season, with a small number of species contributing to overall abundance, including Paralabidocera antarctica, Oithona similis, and Oncaea curvata. The abundance of fauna living within the brine channel system was very high, although biodiversity was low relative to the water column. To survive the winter, the copepods employed a combination of life history strategies, including strong association with the fast ice habitat, synchronicity with the spring phytoplankton bloom, and dietary switching in winter. Complementary strategies, such as lipid storage and advection to and from deeper offshore waters, were also observed.

AB  - Remote sensing provides multi-dimensional and multi-temporal information about habitat, insights into the significant drivers of change, and the key factors affecting landscape dynamics. Such information is crucial to provide perspective and a more profound understanding of ecological surveys. This study utilizes Google Earth Engine's capability to assess a riverine wetland grassland floodplain in Hastinapur Wildlife Sanctuary (HWS) along the Ganga River, which is a critical habitat for wintering migratory birds, the critically endangered gharial, turtles, aquatic mammals such as otters and dolphins, and cervid species such as swamp deer. We have developed a framework for regular monitoring through rapid habitat assessment, which visualizes the spatio-temporal change in land cover, the seasonal dynamics in water and vegetation, changes due to anthropogenic in-fluences on the landscape, and finally, how these factors affect the habitat availability of species of concern in the HWS. The results show a dynamic river system with high seasonal variations. The vegetation trend shows increasing greenness, indicative of the conversion of grassland, scrubland, and herbaceous cover to more per-manent vegetation, which will adversely affect the riparian habitat structure. A habitat suitability index generated through geospatial analysis using the weighted overlay method suggests that 40.07% of the HWS, nearly 767.12 km2, comprising mainly the riverscape, wetland, and riparian grasslands, is suitable habitat for aquatic and semi-aquatic species. However, only 9.93% of the sanctuary comprising 197.27 km2, is available as a core habitat. Further, the area is threatened by encroachment evident from the rapidly increasing land-use in-tensity and night light pollution, which puts the grasslands sheltered to swamp deer and other wildlife at higher risk leaving almost 27.9% of the area comprising 533.63 km2 unsuitable for wildlife. Urban and agricultural land use has taken over 67% of the sanctuary. An increase in minimum radiance value representing ALAN, from 0.41 to 0.73 W/m2-sr in just six years from 2015 to 2021, shows a reduction in nocturnal darkness, reducing safe niches for wildlife. The study results provide critical baseline information for ecological surveys and a rapid assessment platform for future sanctuary management. Constant monitoring of anthropogenic activities such as farming, settlements, and transport routes threatening the habitat is essential for informed conservation man-agement decisions.

AB  - Afforestation is an effective measure for ecological restoration in the desert ecosystem. The long-term water use efficiency (WUE) of leaves is an important indicator for evaluating the water adaptation strategy of sand-fixing species. However, the WUE of typical sand-fixing plants in the alpine desert and its responses to local climatic, micro-geomorphology, environmental conditions and nutrient limitations are still unclear. In this study, sandfixing vegetation community along a revegetation chronosequence (Hippophae rhammoides planted on dunes in 1987, 2008, and 2015, respectively. H. rhammoides with the longest recovery period were defined as mature plantations, and the shortest recovery period were defined as juveniles.) at the alpine desert at the eastern shore of the Qinghai Lake were used as the research plots. Stable carbon isotope was used to evaluate species WUE. The results showed that: (1) the 813C values of H. rhammoides showed a decreasing trend as plants grew. The seasonal 813C variation was mainly affected by average relative humidity (MRH). (2) The 813C in the dunes revegetated in 2008 and 2015 were significantly higher than that in 1987 at the windward slope (P < 0.05). The values of 813C had various responses to the available soil water under the influence of topography, and soil water content was the key factor for the WUE of individuals in communities. There was a significant negative correlation between the ratio of carbon and nitrogen content in H. rhammoides leaves and WUE. The research indicated that mature plantations had adopted a more stable water use pattern than the juveniles, which provide an effective insight for ecological restoration in fragile ecological regions.

AB  - Soil erosion caused by unsustainable grazing is a major driver of grassland ecosystem degradation in many semi-arid hilly areas in China. Thus, grazing exclusion is considered as an effective method for solving this issue in such areas. However, some ecological and economic problems, such as slow grassland rejuvenation and limited economic conditions, have become obstacles for the sustainable utilization of grassland ecosystem. Accordingly, we hypothesized that the conflict between grassland use and soil conservation may be balanced by a reasonable grazing intensity. In this study, a two-year grazing fence experiment with five grazing intensity gradients was conducted in a typical grassland of the Loess Plateau in China to evaluate the responses of vegetation characteristics and soil and water losses to grazing intensity. The five grazing intensity gradients were 2.2, 3.0, 4.2, 6.7, and 16.7 goats/hm2, which were represented by G1-G5, respectively, and no grazing was used as control. The results showed that a reasonable grazing intensity was conducive to the sustainable utilization of grassland resources. Vegetation biomass under G1-G4 grazing intensity significantly increased by 51.9%, 42.1%, 36.9%, and 36.7%, respectively, compared with control. In addition, vegetation coverage increased by 19.6% under G1 grazing intensity. Species diversity showed a single peak trend with increasing grazing intensity. The Shannon-Wiener diversity index under G1-G4 grazing intensities significantly increased by 22.8%, 22.5%, 13.3%, and 8.3%, respectively, compared with control. Furthermore, grazing increased the risk of soil erosion. Compared with control, runoff yields under G1-G5 grazing intensities increased by 1.4, 2.6, 2.8, 4.3, and 3.9 times, respectively, and sediment yields under G1-G5 grazing intensities were 3.0, 13.0, 20.8, 34.3, and 37.7 times greater, respectively, than those under control. This result was mainly attributed to a visible decrease in litter biomass after grazing, which decreased by 50.5%, 72.6%, 79.0%, 80.0%, and 76.9%, respectively, under G1-G5 grazing intensities. By weighing the grassland productivity and soil conservation function, we found that both two aims were achieved at a low grazing intensity of less than 3.5 goats/hm2. Therefore, it is recommended that grassland should be moderately utilized with grazing intensity below 3.5 goats/hm2 in semi-arid hilly areas to achieve the dual goals of ecological and economic benefits. The results provide a scientific basis for grassland utilization and health management in semi-arid hilly areas from the perspective of determining reasonable grazing intensity to maintain both grassland production and soil conservation functions.

AB  - Pulsed resources have prominent effects on community and ecosystem dynamics; however, there is little research on how resource pulses affect human-wildlife interactions. Tree masting is a common type of pulsed resource that represents a crucial food for many species and has important bottom-up effects in food webs. In anthropogenic landscapes, years of food shortage after mast years can have negative outcomes for both people and wildlife, for instance when an increased use of anthropogenic foods by animals exacerbates human-wildlife conflicts. Here, we used novel remote sensing indicators of forest productivity and phenology, together with weather cues and ground measures of mast production, to assess whether years of masting and crop failures lead to changes in human-wildlife conflict occurrence. We used a unique 14-year dataset including the production of European beech Fagus sylvatica seeds and brown bear Ursus arctos damage in the northeastern Carpathians as our model system. Linking these data in a panel regression framework, we found that temporal fluctuations in damage occurrence were sensitive to the year-to-year variation in beechnut production. Specifically, the number of damages during bear hyperphagia (i.e., September to December, when bears need to accumulate fat reserves prior to hibernation) was significantly higher in years with low beechnut production than in normal or mast years. Furthermore, we provide evidence that beech masting and failure can be predicted through a combination of remote-sensing, weather, and field indicators of forest productivity and phenology. We demonstrate how pulsed resources, such as tree masting, can percolate through food webs to amplify human-wildlife conflict in human-dominated landscapes. Given the recent range expansion of large carnivores and herbivores in many regions, including Europe, predicting years of natural food shortage can provide a pathway to proactive damage prevention, and thus to foster coexistence between wildlife and people.

AB  - Context, Introduced sambar deer (Cervus unicolor) are increasing in south-eastern Australia, and both volunteer and contract ground-based shooters are being used by management agencies to control their undesirable impacts. However, little is known about the effectiveness and costs of volunteer and contract shooters for controlling deer populations in Australia. Aims. We evaluated the effectiveness and costs of volunteer and contract ground-based shooters for controlling sambar deer and their impacts in a 5-year management program conducted in and around alpine peatlands in Alpine National Park, Victoria. Methods. Ground-based shooting operations were organised in two blocks. Within each block, four similar to 4200-ha management units were delimited, of which two were randomly assigned as treatment (ground-based shooting) and two as non-treatment (no organised ground-based shooting). In the treatment units, ground-based shooting was conducted using either volunteers or contractors. Each shooting team recorded their effort and the numbers of deer seen and shot, and used a GPS to record their track log and the time and locations of deer shot. Key costs were recorded for both shooter types. Key results. The catch per unit effort of contract shooters was four times greater than that of volunteer shooters. Both shooter types were most effective during the first half of the night and prior to sunrise, and when using a vehicle with a spotlight or walking with thermal-vision equipment. During the day, the use of gundogs to indicate deer significantly increased the success rate of volunteer shooters. Both volunteer and contract shooters used roads and tracks to move in the landscape, but contractors covered more ground than did volunteers. After accounting for key operational costs, the cost per deer killed was 10.1% higher for contract than volunteer shooters. Conclusions. The effectiveness of ground-based shooters is increased by operating at night using vehicles, spotlights and thermal-vision equipment. Contract shooters kill sambar deer at a faster rate, but are slightly more expensive per deer killed, than are volunteer shooters.

AB  - Common understory vegetation species such as the ericaceous shrubs bilberry (Vaccinium myrtillus), cowberry (V. vitis-idaea) and heather (Calluna vulgaris), are key forage plant species for moose and other large herbivores, as well as fulfilling many additional ecosystem functions and services. Here we developed models to predict above-ground biomass of these ericaceous species in coniferous forests, using data on their percentage cover, height, and different stand characteristics. We also built models to understand how the aforementioned variables affect the proportion of the shrubs commonly utilized as forage by large herbivores. We found that the per-centage cover of shrubs was the most important explanatory variable when predicting above-ground biomass, explaining 51%, 47% and 71% of the variation (marginal R2) in bilberry, cowberry and heather biomass, respectively. By adding ramet height to the model with percentage cover, the variation explained increased to 77% for bilberry, 75% for cowberry and 87% for heather. The best outcome for candidate models was obtained by adding stand site index and spruce basal area to the model, improving the variation explained in bilberry to 83%, to 81% for cowberry, and 91% for heather. When modelling the proportion of the shrubs commonly uti-lized as forage by large herbivores, stand site index and spruce basal area often played important roles. Some of the best fitting models for forage biomass explained 51% of the variation in bilberry, 59% in cowberry and 30% in heather. Site location did not have a major role in improving the variability explained in either type of model, which indicated the applicability of the models regardless of study location. Our models therefore have a high potential to be implemented in forestry decision support systems. Their inclusion should provide better large-scale estimations of forage resources, aiding forest management, and thereby taking an important step for-ward to determine the ecosystem carrying capacity of large herbivores.

AB  - As the two major management practices for grasslands, livestock grazing and mowing greatly influence the soilplant-insect cascading effects, which can be reflected by their associations in stoichiometry. While previous studies have investigated the effect of grazing or moving on plants, soils and insects in grasslands, few have purposely made a sound comparison between the effects of paralleled grazing and mowing on soil-plant-insect stoichiometric linkages and insect community composition in a semi-arid grassland. In a four year field manipulative experiment, we investigated how paralleled grazing and mowing affect C:N:P stoichiometric linkages among soil, dominant plant (Leymus chinensis) and dominant insect herbivore (Euchorthippus grasshopper), as well as insect community composition in a semi-arid grassland in northeastern China. We noted that grazing significantly increased soil and plant total N concentration but decreased their C:N, whereas both grazing and mowing failed to affect C:N:P stoichiometry of grasshoppers. Our results uphold the concept that organisms at higher trophic levels exhibit higher elemental homeostasis against disturbances. The total abundance and species evenness of insects were not affected, whereas grazing significantly increased insect species richness by 17 % compared to mowing. Mowing reduced predator insect abundance by 27 %, whereas grazing increased detritivore insect abundance by 18 %. Our study suggests that cattle grazing is better than mowing in terms of improving soil and plant nutrient and diversifying insects (beneficial in most cases), but longer-term investigations are needed to study the effects of paralleled grazing and mowing on stoichiometric linkages and insect community composition in grasslands.

AB  - Hydrothermal vents are critical to marine geochemical cycling and ecosystem functioning. Although hydrothermal vent-associated megafauna and chemoautotrophic prokaryotes have received extensive dedicated study, smaller hydrothermal vent-associated eukaryotes such as meiofauna and nanobiota have received much less attention. These communities comprise critical links in trophic flow and carbon cycling of other marine habitats, so study of their occurrence and role in hydrothermal vent ecosystems is warranted. Further, an understudied vent habitat is the thin sediment cover at the base of hydrothermal vent chimneys. An initial study revealed that sediments at the base of vent chimneys of the Izu-Ogawasara Arc system (western North Pacific) support metazoan meiofauna, but very little is known about the taxonomic composition and abundance of the meiobenthic protists and nanobiota, or their millimeter-scale distributions. Using the Fluorescently Labeled Embedded Coring method (FLEC), we describe results on meiofaunal and nanobiota higher-level identifications, life positions and relative abundances within sediments from three habitats (base of vent chimneys, inside caldera but away from chimneys, and outside caldera) of the Myojin-Knoll caldera and vicinity. Results suggest that the chimney-base community is unique and more abundant compared to non-chimney associated eukaryotic communities. Supporting evidence (molecular phylogeny, scanning and transmission electron microscopy imaging) documents first known hydrothermal-vent-associated occurrences for two protist taxa. Collectively, results provide valuable insights into a cryptic component of the hydrothermal vent ecosystem.

AB  - Understanding the drivers and consequences of global environmental change is crucial to inform predictions of effects on ecosystems. We used the mammal community of Bialowieza Forest, the last lowland near-primeval forest in temperate Europe, as a sentinel of global change. We analyzed changes in stable carbon (delta 13C) and nitrogen (delta 15N) isotope values of hair in 687 specimens from 50 mammal species across seven decades (1946-2011). We classified mammals into four taxonomic-dietary groups (herbivores, carnivores, insectivores, and bats). We found a significant negative trend in hair delta 15N for the mammal community, particularly strong for herbivores. This trend is consistent with temporal patterns in nitrogen deposition from (15N depleted) industrial fertilizers and fossil fuel emissions. It is also in line with global-scale declines in delta 15N reported in forests and other unfertilized, non-urban terrestrial ecosystems and with local decreases in N foliar concentrations. The global depletion of 13C content in atmospheric CO2 due to fossil fuel burning (Suess effect) was detected in all groups. After correcting for this effect, the hair delta 13C trend became non-significant for both community and groups, except for bats, which showed a strong decline in delta 13C. This could be related to an increase in the relative abundance of freshwater insects taken by bats or increased use of methane-derived carbon in food webs used by bats. This work is the first broad-scale and long-term mammal isotope ecology study in a near-primeval forest in temperate Europe. Mammal communities from natural forests represent a unique benchmark in global change research; investigating their isotopic temporal variation can help identify patterns and early detections of ecosystem changes and provide more comprehensive and integrative assessments than single species approaches.
   The complex interactions among global change drivers require a broader multi-taxon perspective in ecological monitoring. Stable isotope analysis and museum collections provide unique opportunities to study environmental changes at various spatiotemporal windows. We conducted a broad-scale mammal isotope study in Bialowieza Forest (Poland) across seven decades (1946-2011) and evaluated this 50-species community as a sentinel of global change. We found a significant decline in hair delta 15N for the mammal community, particularly strong for herbivores. This trend is consistent with anthropogenic nitrogen deposition patterns and with the global-scale oligotrophication reported for forest ecosystems as a result of growing [CO2] and temperatures.image

AB  - Travel is considered to account for a substantial proportion of endothermic species energy expenditure. However, transport costs depend on speed of the animal and slope angle of the terrain. We used biologging data from six ungulate species within the French mountains, combined with mapping data, to examine how these different species reacted to slopes by varying travel speed, and chosen ascent and descent angles, in relation to vectoral dynamic body acceleration (VeDBA; as a proxy for energy expenditure). As predicted by theory and as seen in pumas, animals travelled obliquely so that the angle that any individual experienced was lower than that of the topography. Travel speed affected the VeDBA-based proxy for cost of transport (COT) even though most species moved slower on steeper inclines. Models that considered speed, COT, slope, and habitat type showed clear relationships between COT and slope with variation across habitat types and according to species. Species-specific choice of travel speeds and slope chosen by animals underpins fundamental differences in species physiology and ecology via links in heat production and time spent per altitude. Understanding these interrelations points to the complexity of factors affecting space use by mountain ungulates and is crucial for conservation efforts, especially in fast-changing environments where energy expenditure, temperature changes, and resource accessibility impact population wellbeing.

AB  - To advance current environmental flow standards in Texas, we developed field, laboratory, and analytical methods to model recruitment dynamics of indicator species selected to cover a range of population responses to flow variation. Preliminary investigations were conducted in three central Texas river basins to evaluate the feasibility of these methods for formulating and evaluating the state's environmental flow standards. Age analysis allowed back-calculation of dates of fish hatching, mussel recruitment, and tree germination for estimation of temporal variation in recruitment. Recruitment data were then analyzed in relation to flow regime components. Statistical models were derived for flow-recruitment relationships of Shoal Chub Macrhybopsis hyostoma, Smallmouth Buffalo Ictiobus bubalus, threeridge mussel Amblema plicata, and boxelder Acer negundo. The Shoal Chub model was used to hindcast recruitment dynamics in the Brazos River, revealing a decline in recruitment after dam construction. The Smallmouth Buffalo model revealed that strong year-classes were positively associated with springtime pulses of long duration but negatively associated with frequent short-duration pulses. Results for the threeridge mussel were not as easily interpreted, but for all three river basins generally showed weaker recruitment during periods with extreme low and high flows. The boxelder model revealed positive associations between recruitment and high flow components and was used to forecast the probability of germination under five simulated flow regime scenarios, thereby providing an additional means for evaluating the suitability of environmental flow standards. Assessment of how hydrology influences recruitment provides an evidence-based method to hindcast responses to past flow regimes and forecast responses to future flow scenarios, thereby providing a basis for evaluating environmental flow standards and water management options.

AB  - Major global change factors, including carbon dioxide (CO2) fertilization, warming, change in precipitation, nitrogen deposition, and land-use change have the potential to significantly affect future stocks of soil organic carbon (SOC). These factors, individually or by interacting with each other, can also trigger positive or negative feedback to the processes affecting the rate of SOC formation or loss. Despite rapid progress in the understanding of carbon (C) cycling processes in the last few decades, much uncertainty remains in our ability to precisely forecast potential changes in SOC stocks in the rapidly changing future world. Stable C isotopes have been extensively used in natural observational studies as well as in laboratory and field experiments that manipulate CO2 concentration, temperature, moisture, nitrogen fertilization, and vegetation type to understand the complex interactions and feedbacks that result from changing climate, plants and their herbivores, as well as soil microorganisms. Newly developed tools such as compound-specific isotope analysis, nano-SIMS (secondary ion mass spectroscopy), and stable isotope probing (SIP) permit isotope tracing in a specific ecosystem pool into specific C compounds and processes, thus providing in-depth insights into many processes affecting C biogeochemistry. The recent availability of affordable and reliable field-deployable optical isotope monitoring devices has provided researchers with a new set of tools for continuously tracking the C-13-CO2 fluxes at the ecosystem level, enabling deeper insights into C biogeochemistry under changing environmental conditions. Despite these great strides, there is a scarcity of review studies that have comprehensively examined the use of C isotopes in studying SOC responses under global change factors. This review highlights recent progress in understanding the effect of major global change factors on SOC fluxes and stocks using selected examples covering scales from plant rhizospheres to geographic regions. Moreover, we discuss the strengths and limitations of current approaches and recent scientific advancements to highlight the new prospects evolving from the exceptional temporal and spatial resolution of stable isotope analysis in studying how global change affects SOC. Finally, we suggest that studies using stable C isotopes are well-poised to focus on identifying how dominant SOC cycling processes respond to environment-specific limiting factors and any thresholds and tipping points that define those relationships.

AB  - Invertebrate growth rates have been changing in the Anthropocene. We examine rates of seasonal maturation in a grasshopper community that has been declining annually greater than 2% a year over 34 years. As this grassland has experienced a 1 degrees C increase in temperature, higher plant biomass and lower nutrient densities, the community is maturing more slowly. Community maturation had a nutritional component: declining in years/watersheds with lower plant nitrogen. The effects of fire frequency were consistent with effects of plant nitrogen. Principal components analysis also suggests associated changes in species composition-declines in the densities of grass feeders were associated with declines in community maturation rates. We conclude that slowed maturation rates-a trend counteracted by frequent burning-likely contribute to long-term decline of this dominant herbivore.

However, regional palaeoclimate records spanning multiple millennia are limited, and the tolerance of extinct taxa to past water scarcity is poorly known. To infer changes in the diet and habitat aridity of extinct pygmy hippos and giant tortoises during approximately 6000-1000 years ago, I used carbon and nitrogen isotope (delta 13C and delta 15N) data from 49 directly radiocarbon-dated bones collected around Tampolove, southwest Madagascar. Fluctuations in bone delta 15N values through time in both species indicate tolerance of dry habitat during intermittent drying trends, including around a dry period known as the '4.2 ka event'. However, taxon-specific differences in the covariance of bone delta 13C and delta 15N values suggest that the diets of pygmy hippos and giant tortoises changed in different ways during these past arid intervals. This suggests that past aridification had different effects on these taxa. Thus, I argue that hypotheses for past extinction that involve a synergy among climate drying and forest clearance, hunting and biological invasion must consider taxon-specific responses to past aridity.

AB  - Local people can act as sentinels for change, especially for wildlife populations not monitored by centralized governments. Responding to concern expressed by the Kitasoo Xai'xais (KX) First Nation over a decline in mountain goat (Oreamnos americanus) sightings, our community-academic partnership assessed the conservation status of goats in KX territory and beyond in British Columbia by evaluating three independent information sources. Aerial surveys (2019 and 2020) over 542 km(2) revealed a low-density population (mean 0.25, SD 0.12 goats/km(2)), typical of peripheral coastal range. Interviews with KX Knowledge Holders revealed that sightings from sea level have declined sharply over 40 years, a period during which temperatures have increased and snowpack has decreased. Finally, Kill data (1980-2018) showed that kills/hunter/day initially increased among guided hunters before plateauing, but declined among resident hunters (similar to 70% of hunt days) in both coastal and interior BC. Convergent patterns among datasets suggest that coastal goats declined in abundance and/or reduced use of low-elevation habitat, disrupting a millennia-old relationship between KX people and goats, thereby posing a conservation concern. Broadly, our work shows that detecting threats to peripheral populations, and wildlife in general, can be informed and empowered by the knowledge of place-based peoples and associated decentralized management. Kitasoo Xai'xais First Nation mountain goat research illustrates roles of Indigenous peoples as sentinels of population and ecosystem change.

AB  - Subtropical grasslands interspersed in forests often present mosaics of tall grasslands and grazing lawns with a high variation in structure, biomass and nutrient concentration. However, the impact of such variation on forage quality is still poorly known. We quantified physical and chemical properties of grasses of grazing lawns and tall grasslands, interspersed in the forested region of Bardia National Park, Nepal during the hot-dry season. This area falls within Cwaclimate (Ko center dot ppen-Geigen climate classification). We found that grasses in grazing lawns had an average bulk density of -5400 g.m-3 whereas tall grasslands had an average bulk density of -1000 g.m-3 only. Forage in grazing lawns was comprised of a higher percentage of green leaf (up to 60%) compared to tall grassland (up to 40%). Phosphorus levels in green leaves were below maintenance requirements of wild herbivores (especially for grazers and mixed feeders) on both grazing lawns and tall grasslands. However, average crude protein levels in green leaves from both the grazing lawns and tall grasslands could meet the herbivores maintenance requirement (-7%). Only green leaves on grazing lawns had crude protein levels sufficient enough (9.7%) to meet the requirements of herbivores for maintenance and gestation, though not for lactation. We conclude that, during the hot-dry season, grazing lawns provide forage with a higher quantity and quality than tall grasslands. Consequently, grazing lawns can make a significant contribution to the maintenance or even growth of the grassland dependent wild ungulate population, such as chital (Axis axis), a primary prey species of the endangered tiger (Panthera tigris) in Bardia National Park. The insight of this study will provide a basis for restoring grazing lawns for quality forage, and aid in the conservation and management of wild grazers and mixed feeders.

AB  - Background In central Texas, re-sprouting oaks (Quercus spp.) co-occur with non-resprouting Ashe juniper (Juniperus ashei) in a mosaic of fire-dependent (oak savanna) and fire-sensitive (oak-juniper woodland) habitats. The region's mature woodlands are the only nesting habitat for the endangered golden-cheeked warbler (Setophaga chrysoparia). We studied long-term recovery of woodland structure and species composition after single and repeated crown fires on three soil types (mesa, slope, and deep savanna soils). Results On once-burned sites, density and basal area of non-juniper trees (all woody species except juniper) reached or exceeded unburned levels after 14-24 years, indicating successful recruitment (24 years vs unburned, mesa: 481 +/- 254 vs 155 +/- 137 stems ha(-1), 2 +/- 1 vs 1 +/- 2 m(2) ha(-1); slope: 910 +/- 330 vs 251 +/- 103 stems ha(-1), 5 +/- 2 vs 3 +/- 2 m(2) ha(-1)). Ashe juniper, however, remained mostly absent from burned woodlands (juniper tree density, 24 years vs unburned, mesa: 6 +/- 10 vs 691 +/- 410 stems ha(-1); slope: 20 +/- 17 vs 731 +/- 183 stems ha(-1)) and total basal area was 47-87% lower than in unburned areas. In formerly fire-suppressed savannas, non-juniper tree density exceeded unburned levels and juniper density recovered the most (24 years vs unburned, non-juniper: 679 +/- 250 vs 251 +/- 103 stems ha(-1); juniper: deep: 50 +/- 71 vs 317 +/- 297 stems ha(-1)). Juniper trees were still absent from twice-burned sites in year 11 and understory density was recovering more slowly, at least on slopes (one fire: 224 +/- 206 stems ha(-1); two fires: 26 +/- 47 stems ha(-1)). Juniper recovery was correlated with distance to the wildfire perimeter, suggesting that regeneration is limited in part by dispersal. Conclusions We found successful recruitment of resprouting hardwood species after one and two crown fires, likely due to the low deer densities at Fort Cavazos. In fire-suppressed oak savannas, a single crown fire did not restore savanna structure and Ashe juniper is slowly re-establishing. Long-term restoration of a savanna on these soils will require additional treatments, like repeated prescribed fire. In oak-juniper woodlands, crown fires removed the fire-sensitive Ashe juniper from canopy co-dominance for decades, making the woodlands unsuitable as habitat for golden-cheeked warblers. Given the long-term consequences of crown fires for golden-cheeked warbler habitat, existing mature oak-juniper woodlands should be protected from crown fire.

AB  - Soil microbial communities are integral in supporting the sustainability of grassland ecosystems. Livestock grazing exerts varied impacts on soil microbial communities due to distinct grazing behaviors and feeding preferences. However, the effects of livestock diversification on the soil microbial community in moderately degraded grassland compared with nondegraded grassland are still uncertain. To narrow this gap, we carried out a grazing experiment in the eastern Eurasian steppe by altering livestock diversification (nongrazing [NG], cattle grazing alone [CG], sheep grazing alone [SG], and mixed cattle and sheep grazing [MG]) in both nondegraded [ND] and moderately degraded grasslands [MD] for 3 years. We applied high-throughput sequencing to investigate microbial diversity, community composition, co-occurrence network structure, and community assembly processes in the topsoil (0-10 cm). Our study revealed that MG significantly enhanced bacterial richness (144.6%, p = 0.005), fungal richness (30%, p = 0.003), network stability and topological properties (5.7% more nodes, and 7.1% higher positive connection ratios) compared to NG in nondegraded grassland. Furthermore, MG had relatively high stability of bacterial networks compared with single grazing in both nondegraded and moderately degraded grasslands. Additionally, the assembly of soil microbial communities in grassland was dominated by stochastic processes, whereas MG reduced the randomness in fungal community assembly. Moreover, bacterial communities exhibited a stronger association with soil characteristics in terms of diversity, composition, and stochastic processes, while fungal communities demonstrated a greater correlation with plant characteristics. Our findings indicated that MG promoted soil bacterial diversity and network stability while reducing the importance of stochastic processes compared to single grazing. However, the effect was largely dependent on the habitat condition of grassland. The results of this study highlight that diversifying livestock grazing can be an effective management practice to maintain the stability of grassland on the eastern edge of the Eurasian steppe belt from the perspective of the soil microbial community.

AB  - Global stressors are increasingly altering ecosystem resistance, resilience, and functioning by reorganizing vital species interactions. However, our predictive understanding of these changes is hindered by failures to consider species-specific functional roles and stress responses within communities. Stressor-driven loss or reduced performance of strongly interacting species may generate abrupt shifts in ecosystem states and functions. Yet, empirical support for this prediction is scarce, especially in marine climate change research. Using a marine assemblage comprising a habitat-forming scagrass (Phyllovadbr torreyi), its algal competitor, and three consumer species (algal grazers) with potentially different functional roles and pH tolerance, we investigated how ocean acidification (OA) may, directly and indirectly, alter community resistance. In the field and laboratory, hermit crabs (Pagurus granosimanus and P. hirsurfusculus) and snails (Tegula fundralis) displayed distinct microhabitat use, with hermit crabs more frequently grazing in the area of high algal colonization (i.e., surfgrass canopy). In mesocosms, this behavioral difference led to hermit crabs exerting similar to 2 times greater per capita impact on algal epiphyte biomass than snails. Exposure to OA variably affected the grazers: snails showed reduced feeding and growth under extreme pH (7.3 and 7.5), whereas hermit crabs (P. granosirnanus) maintained a similar grazing rate under all pH levels (pH 7.3,7.5, 7.7, and 7.95). Epiphyte biomass increased more rapidly under extreme OA (pH 7.3 and 7.5), but natural densities of snails and hermit crabs prevented algal overgrowth irrespective of pH treatments. Finally, grazers and acidification additively increased surfgrass productivity and delayed the shoot senescence. hence, although OA impaired the function of the most abundant consumers (snails), strongly interacting and pH-tolerant species (hermit crabs) largely maintained the top-down pressure to facilitate seagrass dominance. Our study highlights significant within-community variation in species functional and response traits and shows that this variation has important ecosystem consequences under anthropogenic stressors.

AB  - Fallow deer is one of the most widespread alien mammals in Europe. We documented the response of the roe deer population shortly after the fallow deer was introduced to a hunting ground in central Poland. Mean roe density dropped from 17.6 ind./100 ha to 10.5 ind./100 ha after the alien species was introduced. In the reference area, where fallow deer was absent, the roe deer density did not change in the analogue study period. At both study sites, mean roe deer productivity before fallow deer introduction was similar (1.6 juv./female). However, in the first study area, the productivity dropped to 1.4, while in the reference study area, it slightly increased to 1.75. The presence of fallow deer influenced roe deer space use negatively, i.e., the number of pellet groups of roe deer decreased with an increase in the number of fallow deer feces. Overall, the introduction of the fallow deer was successful and the population grew quickly. Yet, the economic impact of its introduction was far from satisfactory. At the same time, its negative influence on the roe deer was apparent. This shows that the fallow deer is an alien species threatening local biodiversity.

AB  - The expanding population of wild pig (Sus scrofa) and the associated economic loss has been a challenge for the government and conservation biologists, for over a decade globally. Unlike the majority of other wildlife, rising anthropogenic pressure offered wild pigs a suitable environment to expand their population. Accordingly, the circumstances for social conflict also increased at human-wildlife interface areas. Understanding the regional ecological landscape factors driving the human-wild pig conflict (HWPC) is vital for developing efficient strategies for HWPC management. We analyzed the important spatial and ecological factors determining HWPC across the Eastern and Western Ghats region of Tamil Nadu, India through semi-structured interviews of local communities. Fifty seven percent (n = 825) of the villagers surveyed (n = 1460) reported frequent wild pig conflict, principally in the form of crop damage (n = 819), especially in areas adjoining the forest boundary. Our study indicated that the probability of HWPC was positively correlated to the diversity of major and minor crops grown, percent crop cover and distance to the nearest water body, and negatively correlated to the degree of slope of the landscape and average annual rainfall. We identified 6729 km 2 of the total sampled area (22,525 km(2)) of high HWPC. Our HWPC hotspot map provides a concise view of the conflict pattern across the larger landscapes that can help the authorities prioritize areas and concentrate the conflict mitigation measures towards areas that require immediate attention.

AB  - Droughts are projected to become more extreme and more frequent throughout the remainder of the 21st century. Our ability to sustain rangeland functioning relies on understanding the interactive effects of extreme drought and herbivory on vegetation. Here, we report on an experiment in northeast Wyoming, USA that simulated five levels of drought intercepting 0 %, 25%, 50%, 75%, or 99% of ambient rainfall for two years. These treatments were crossed with two grazing intensity (50%, 70% utilization) and two browsing intensity (background, + 50% leader removal) treatments. We measured canopy volume changes, leader growth, and leaf water potential on a dominant shrub, Artemisia tridentata ssp. wyomingensis (Beetle & Young), to test three major predictions: (1) canopy volume and leader growth decline with greater drought magnitude, (2) heavy grazing reduces the effects of drought magnitude, and (3) heavy browsing amplifies effects of drought magnitude. Under ambient browsing intensity, extreme drought caused Wyoming big sagebrush (Beetle & Young) canopies to shrink. Interestingly, this effect went away in our heavy browsing treatment, despite overall negative effects of heavy browsing on shrub canopies and leader survival. We show that this drought-buffering effect may be driven by reduced leaf-level water stress in droughted, heavily browsed shrubs compared with droughted, ambiently browsed shrubs; this may have resulted from lower early-season leaf area leading to lower transpiration- related water loss. This potential mechanism for drought resistance in sagebrush steppe highlights the importance of maintaining intact food webs, despite perceived deleterious effects of herbivores for plant abundance and growth. To promote sustainability of sagebrush and other shrub-dominated ecosystems in face of extreme precipitation change, it may be necessary for land managers and policy makers to prioritize conservation of native herbivores within ecosystems.

AB  - Human-wildlife conflict is a critical and complex challenge in wildlife conservation. It arises when humans and wildlife interact and one or both parties suffer negative consequences from the interaction. This research assessed the extent of damage resulting from human-African buffalo Syncerus caffer conflict and explored mitigation strategies. We used a semi-structured questionnaire-based survey of 131 households randomly selected in Kambi ya Simba, Oldeani and Tloma villages surrounding Ngorongoro Conservation Area, Tanzania. Our results revealed that resource competition was the main factor inducing human- African buffalo conflict. The impacts reported most frequently were crop damage (especially during the wet seasons) and human casualties. Crops that were most often damaged included maize, beans, wheat, peas and coffee. To minimize buffalo crop depredation, farmers currently use traditional mitigation approaches such as guarding farms, lighting fires, using torchlight and vocal and other auditory deterrents. In addition, a local coffee estate installed electrified fencing around its plantation. Our findings demonstrate the impacts of human-African buffalo conflict on local communities and the importance of continuing human-African buffalo conflict monitoring to improve conservation action and increase the participation of the local community in conservation activities. To minimize human-African buffalo conflict, we recommend conservation strategies that improve the natural habitat of the African buffalo. Most importantly, providing communities affected by human-African buffalo conflict with modern and more effective mitigation methods, paired with increased community awareness of the use of these methods, could result in significant reductions in the human cost of human- African buffalo conflict.

AB  - Aim: Functional trait-based approach links the zooplankton community to the marine ecosystem functioning. It provides a comprehensive insight into the diversity of zooplankton ecological strategies but has rarely been used to characterize the zooplankton community in estuarine ecosystem. Here, we investigated the seasonality of mesozooplankton functional structure with respect to environmental changes in Changjiang River estuary (CRE) and its adjacent waters.
   Location: Changjiang River estuary and its adjacent waters.
   Methods: Samples were collected in three seasons of 2019. Morphologically identified species were assigned functional traits including body length, feeding strategy, trophic group, reproduction mode and habitat type, and clustered into functional groups. Taxonomic and functional diversity indices were calculated. The relative importance of the environmental variables in explaining the seasonality of functional structures was assessed.
   Results: Ten functional groups were identified, and functional structure showed strong seasonal dynamics. Current- and mixed-feeding omnivore-herbivores were the predominant group over seasons. The contribution of carnivorous, detritivorous and omnivorous groups increased from winter-spring to autumn. The seasonality of zooplankton functional structure was mainly explained by the effect of temperature, fluvial discharge and warm current. Low temperature and riverine input of nutrient in winter-spring favoured the small-sized herbivores. Subsequently, the rising temperature and run-off in summer shifted the zooplankton community to larger herbivores and carnivores. Moderate temperature and relatively enhanced effect of warm current promoted the proliferation of carnivores and detritivores in autumn. Functional diversity also varied over seasons.
   Main conclusions: The functional dynamics of mesozooplankton in CRE across estuarine gradient and seasonality is shaped by the seasonal variation of temperature, fluvial pulse and warm current intrusion. Our findings pave the way for further understanding estuarine biodiversity and have implications in conservation strategies.

AB  - The Brazilian endemic octocoral Phyllogorgia dilatata (elephant ear sea fan) plays a crucial ecological role in the marine ecosystems of the Brazilian coast. Our work investigates the local extinction of P. dilatata on Trindade Island, a remote oceanic island in the Southwestern Atlantic, and assesses the potential impacts of climate change on its distribution. Field surveys conducted over two years (2016-2019) revealed no live individuals of P. dilatata, with only dead peduncles remaining, marking the first observed local extinction of this species. Species distribution models (SDMs) incorporating current and historical climate data were used to estimate the species' habitat suitability and project future distribution under different climate scenarios. Results indicate that P. dilatata currently inhabits approximately 93,090 km2 of suitable area, primarily within tropical ecoregions, but faces significant habitat loss under future climate projections. By 2090-2100, models predict a 63.38 % loss of habitat under the high-emission RCP 8.5 scenario, with severe impacts on tropical regions, including Trindade Island. Environmental variables such as temperature, oxygen concentration, and salinity were identified as key drivers of the species' distribution, while non-climatic factors like seawater velocity, were also significant. The extinction on Trindade Island is attributed to a combination of historical isolation, climate change, and local anthropogenic stressors, including pollution and overfishing. The current investigation highlights the urgent need for conservation efforts, including the establishment of marine protected areas and restoration programs, to protect this vulnerable species and similar marine organisms again climate change.

AB  - Coral reef algae serve many important ecological functions, from primary production to nutrient uptake and reef stabilization, but our knowledge of longer-term effects of thermal stress on algae in situ is limited. While ocean warming can facilitate proliferation of algae and potential phase shifts from coral to macroalgal-dominated states, algal responses may vary by species, genus, functional group, or type (e.g., calcareous vs. fleshy). We used 11 years of annual monitoring data (2009-2019) that spans two El Ni & ntilde;o-associated heatwaves to examine benthic algal community dynamics on Palmyra Atoll in the central Pacific Ocean. We quantified the percent cover of algal taxa via image analysis of permanent benthic photoquadrats from two habitats on Palmyra: the deeper, wave-exposed fore reef (10 m depth) and the shallower, wave-sheltered reef terrace (5 m depth). Each habitat was characterized by distinct algal communities: predominantly calcareous taxa on the fore reef and predominantly fleshy taxa on the reef terrace. Patterns in abundance fluctuated over time and/or in response to thermal anomalies in 2009 and 2015. Fleshy algae generally increased in cover post-warming, which coincided with large declines of the calcified macroalgae, Halimeda spp. Long-term monitoring of coral reef algal communities is critical for understanding their differential responses to thermal stress and can improve projections of ecosystem functioning in the context of global change.

AB  - Heterogeneous seascapes and strong environmental gradients in coastal waters are expected to influence adaptive divergence, particularly in species with large population sizes where selection is expected to be highly efficient. However, these influences might also extend to species characterized by strong social structure, natal philopatry and small home ranges. We implemented a seascape genomic study to test this hypothesis in Indo-Pacific bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops aduncus) distributed along the environmentally heterogeneous coast of southern Australia. The data sets included oceanographic and environmental variables thought to be good predictors of local adaptation in dolphins and 8081 filtered single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) genotyped for individuals sampled from seven different bioregions. From a neutral perspective, population structure and connectivity of the dolphins were generally influenced by habitat type and social structuring. Genotype-environment association analysis identified 241 candidate adaptive loci and revealed that sea surface temperature and salinity gradients influenced adaptive divergence in these animals at both large- (1000 km) and fine-scales (<100 km). Enrichment analysis and annotation of candidate genes revealed functions related to sodium-activated ion transport, kidney development, adipogenesis and thermogenesis. The findings of spatial adaptive divergence and inferences of putative physiological adaptations challenge previous suggestions that marine megafauna is most likely to be affected by environmental and climatic changes via indirect, trophic effects. Our work contributes to conservation management of coastal bottlenose dolphins subjected to anthropogenic disturbance and to efforts of clarifying how seascape heterogeneity influences adaptive diversity and evolution in small cetaceans.

AB  - Nest predation is typically the main cause of nest failure in forest understory birds; thus, identification of primary nest predators is key to understanding nest predation patterns. Furthermore, the responses of predators are likely affected by vegetation structure, but predator responses to micro-scale habitat characteristics are largely unknown, especially in tropical forests. We used a long-term study with one of the largest datasets of its kind to investigate the extent to which micro-habitat structure (5-m radius surrounding a nest) can predict the likelihood of predation and by which predator. In a secondary evergreen forest in northeastern Thailand, 2013-2021, we found 1,016 active nests of 13 species and 24-hour video-monitored 500 of them. We recorded 336 predation events from 16 nest predator species. From this and previous studies at our site, we identified the top 4 predator species/species groups accounting for similar to 83% of predation events: Macaca leonina (northern pig-tailed macaque, 36% of predation events), cat snakes (Boiga cyanea [green cat snake] and B. siamensis [gray cat snake]; 20%), Lycodon cf. davisonii (Blandford's bridle snake, 18%), and accipiters (Accipiter trivirgatus [Crested Goshawk] and A. badius [Shikra]; 9%). These 4 predator species differed in their responses to vegetation structure likely reflecting differences in foraging behaviors. Macaque and accipiters, both diurnal and visually oriented, tended to depredate more visible/open nests, but macaque depredated nests surrounded by more trees and short woody stems (<3 m tall) compared to raptors. For snakes, both nocturnal, cat snakes depredated nests with higher numbers of both short woody stems and woody climbers, whereas bridle snake depredated nests with more trees and fewer climbers. As noted previously, nest predator identity is critical to understanding habitat-predation patterns. Our data suggest that nest site vegetation characteristics influence the likelihood of a given species of predator locating a nest and that even small changes in vegetation structure could significantly alter predation patterns.

AB  - The downsizing of disperser assemblages by selective defaunation is a worldwide phenomenon thought to have important consequences in animal-dispersed plants. Numerous large-seeded Neotropical plants currently depend on the last megafaunal survivors, the large tapirs Tapirus spp., and medium-sized frugivores. The extent to which medium frugivores are functionally equivalent to tapirs remains unresolved. We combined feeding trials, seed dispersal kernel modeling based on seed retention times and animal movement simulation (Levy walks), and germination experiments in a large-seeded palm to assess the dispersal quality provided by the largest (tapirs) and two medium (foxes and howler monkeys) frugivore species in terms of dispersal distances and gut passage effects on germination. Tapirs retained the seeds in the gut for much longer (mean = 221 hours) than howlers (43 h) and foxes (22 h). Median dispersal distance by tapirs (1252 m) was 14 and 40 times larger than that by foxes (88 m) and howlers (31 m), respectively. The seed dispersal kernel of tapirs showed a 5th percentile value (291 m) larger than the 95th percentiles of foxes (285 m) and howlers (108 m). Manually depulped and gut-passed seeds germinated in similar proportions, showing, respectively, 3.5 and 2.5-2.9 times higher values than intact fruits. Germination probability and seed viability decreased with retention time in howlers' and tapirs' gut, with howlers showing a steeper negative relationship. Such detrimental effect implies a trade-off between germination success and dispersal distance. We conclude that tapirs may not play a unique role in germination enhancement but move seeds much further than medium frugivores, thus playing a critical role as long-distance dispersers of many plants. This study provides important insights on palm-frugivore interactions and the potential consequences for large-seeded plants of losing the last megafaunal representatives in the Neotropics.

AB  - Pasture biomass and quality are dependent on herbivore grazing and precipitation, but the responses of vegetation to the interactive effects of climate and grazing regimes remain unclear. We conducted an eight-year sheep grazing experiment with 4 stocking rates (0, 3.5, 5.5, and 7.5 sheep/ha) in an alpine meadow of the northeastern Tibetan Plateau. The above-ground net primary productivity (ANPP) and forage nutritional value (FNV) of four dominant species (Poa annua, Kobresia humilis, Astragalus adsurgens and Potentilla fruticosa) were measured during a wet year (360 mm rainfall) and a drought year (216 mm rainfall). The FNV was used as indicator of forage quality and was calculated from the crude protein (CP) content, in vitro true dry matter digestibility (IVTD), metabolic energy (ME) yield, and neutral detergent fiber (NDF) content of the plant. The stocking rate explained a minimum of 76% of the variations of ANPP, and the precipitation sub-additive effect for ANPP ranged from 5% to 12%. The interaction of sheep stocking rate and precipitation affected ANPP of the 4 species, except for P. fruticosa. The FNV of the pasture increased with increasing grazing pressure, but ANPP and forage nutritional yield (FNY) decreased. In calculating FNY, the increase in FNV did not compensate for the decrease in ANPP. In non-grazed plots, the CP yield declined sharply (18%-55%) in response to drought, but there was no effect on ME yield. The interaction between stocking rate and precipitation affected forage quality of the 4 plant species differently. The grassland ANPP and FNY could be maintained at a grazing intensity of 3.5 sheep/ha in wet and dry years. Our results highlight that stocking density affects pasture ANPP and FNV, and is contingent on rainfall.

AB  - The margins of protected areas are usually considered to have greater forest degradation, and given that most mammals live outside protected areas, researchers and conservation practitioners are increasingly recognizing that nonprotected areas must be incorporated into conservation strategy. However, the strategy used to manage these areas still involves increasing the size of protected areas, while not considering the habitat characteristics and requirements of the species. In this study, during a 3-year period, camera trap and habitat characteristic surveys were used to estimate composition, diversity, and habitat characteristics of mammals to determine habitat characteristics or increase the size of protected areas what should be considered first for mammals' conservation in a nonprotected area near the Huangshan Mountains in Anhui Province, China. From June 2017 to October 2019, 18 species of mammals were recorded, more than in any other protected area nearby. The linear model analysis results showed that habitat characteristics of mammals were different and showed a significant correlation with their relative abundance. Most species were related to vegetation characteristics, except primates (Macaca thibetana), and rodents (Leopoldamys edwardsi). Therefore, to establish conservation policies for nonprotected areas, habitat characteristics should be of prime concern, followed by increasing the size of protected areas to provide effective refuge areas for species conservation.

AB  - Ecological theory and empirical research show that both direct lethal effects and indirect non-lethal effects can structure the composition of communities. While the direct effects of grazers on marine phytoplankton communities are well studied, their indirect effects are still poorly understood. Direct and indirect effects are inherently difficult to disentangle in plankton food webs. In this study we evaluate the indirect effects of copepod grazers on community function and structure using isolated chemical alarm signals, copepodamides. We expose intact summer and spring communities to direct grazing from copepods, or to chemical alarm cues without the presence of grazers in controlled experiments. The effects of direct grazing on ecosystem function were moderate in both experiments as indicated by levels of chlorophyll and primary production. Indirect and direct effects resulted in changes in the composition of both the eukaryote and prokaryote communities as shown by metabarcoding of 18S and 16S rRNA. Size structure analysis suggests that direct grazing and copepodamide exposure both favoured smaller organisms (< 10-15 mu m) corroborating the size-structuring effect of copepod grazers. We conclude that the well-established effect of copepods on phytoplankton communities results from a combination of direct and indirect effects. This is a first attempt to isolate indirect effects of copepods on community structure and the results suggest that a full mechanistic understanding of the structuring effect of copepods will require insights to both direct and indirect effects of consumers as demonstrated for other ecosystems components.

AB  - The consumption of fruits and seeds by mammals can have a strong impact on the regeneration of tropical forests. Our knowledge of this biotic interaction has steadily increased recently but it remains fragmentary. This is largely due to most of the studies focusing on a small proportion of the diverse mammals and plants involved in these interactions and to the fact most commonly used methods provide just partial information about the whole seed dispersal/predation process. The use of camera traps has opened the opportunity to greatly improve our knowledge of the intricacies of frugivory and seed predation by increasing the likelihood to record very secretive animal species and providing detailed accounts of their behavior. Based on camera trap data we report acorn consumption of Quercus benthamii and Q. sapotifolia by the threatened Baird's tapir (Tapirus bairdii). This study was conducted in the largest remnant of Mountain cloud forest in Mexico, located in El Triunfo Biosphere Reserve (ETBR) in the state of Chiapas. Despite the fact that ten mammal species were recorded in the focal trees, only two of them (T. bairdii and Sciurus deppei) were documented exhibiting acorn consumption. We obtained 82 videos showing the consumption of Q. benthamii acorns by tapirs (sampling effort = 133 camera trap days, n = 8 trees) with an average of 6.04 +/- 3.56 (+/- sd) minutes spent on this activity. In comparison, we only obtained one video of a tapir consuming Q. sapotifolia acorns (sampling effort = 264 camera trap days, n = 5 trees) during 35 s. Consumption of these Quercus species by tapir was not previously reported. Moreover, our study is the first (to our knowledge) to show video-recorded evidence of the interaction between tapirs and Quercus trees. Due to tapirs' large body size, the consumption of acorns might be an important source of mortality for some Quercus species (e.g., Q. benthamii).

AB  - Large-scale animal migrations influence population and community dynamics along with ecosystem functioning. The migratory coupling concept posits that movement of migrant prey can lead to large-scale movements of predators. In northern ecosystems, spatial patterns and behavioral responses of grey wolf to spatio-temporal changes in its primary prey distribution, the migratory caribou, remain poorly documented. We used a long-term GPS dataset (2011-2021) of 59 wolves and 431 migratory caribou from the declining Riviere-aux-Feuilles herd (QC, Canada) to investigate movement patterns and space use of wolves related to caribou seasonal distribution. Wolves home ranges overlapped with areas used by caribou year-round, especially in May and winter. Wolves exhibited three annual tactics: sedentary (17%), long-distance migration (> 700 km) between wintering areas and the tundra (36%), and a medium-distance migration, stopping their northward movement near the treeline (47%). Migratory wolves started spring migration northward earlier than caribou, intercepting their prey on their way to calving grounds, but departed southward for fall migration later than caribou, tracking them on their way back to wintering areas. Wolves near or overlapping areas used by caribou exhibited lower monthly movement rates compared to wolves located further away. Overlap of home range among wolves was higher during migrations and winter but decreased in summer when wolves rear pups and caribou are dispersed on summer grounds. We provide evidence of migratory coupling between grey wolves and migratory caribou, with most wolves adjusting their space use patterns to match their primary prey distribution. Although predation pressure may affect the dynamics of declining caribou herds, the global decline of that prey may in turn impact predators on the long-term, potentially enhancing intraspecific competition for new resources. Highlighting this migratory coupling is a key step to develop appropriate conservation and management measures for both guilds in the context of large-scale migratory prey decline.

AB  - Social groups exist because some individuals within the group accrue a net benefit from sharing space. The profitability of sociality, however, varies with ecological context. As ecological context varies, tension emerges among the costs and benefits of social grouping. Fission-fusion societies are fluid in their group dynamics across spatial and temporal contexts, permitting insights into how context affects whether animals choose to join or depart from a group. We tested four nonmutually exclusive hypotheses driving variation in fission and fusion in caribou, Rangifer tarandus: (1) risky places, (2) environment heterogeneity, (3) activity budget and (4) social familiarity. The risky places hypothesis predicts that animals are unlikely to diffuse when habitats are open and the risk of predation is elevated. The habitat heterogeneity hypothesis predicts that fission is more likely in a heterogeneous landscape due to the rising conflicts of interest between group members. The activity budget hypothesis predicts that dyads associate by body size due to similar food passage rates. The social cohesion hypothesis predicts that familiar individuals are less likely to fission. We tested the hypotheses using time-to-event (time before fission) analyses and a linear model that assesses spatial, social and body size relationships among female caribou (N 1/4 22) on Fogo Island, Newfoundland, Canada. Contrary to our prediction for risky places, probability of fission was not influenced by habitat openness. The hypothesis of environmental heterogeneity was partially supported, as caribou remained less cohesive in environments with a higher richness of habitats. No direct evidence emerged to support the activity budget hypothesis. However, it appears that caribou maintain the strongest social bonds among variably sized individuals and that these social bonds do decrease the propensity to split. Collectively, our findings showed that social interactions may depend not only on individual identity and characteristics, but also on the spatial context in which these interactions occur.

AB  - Camera-trapping-based social network analysis (SNA) is a valuable tool to characterize communities and identify species with an outstanding role in pathogen maintenance. This study provides new insights into the contentious debate on the effect of biodiversity on disease risk by combining SNA with the assessment of host diversity indicators and pathogen richness in Spain. The apparent species richness detected by camera traps at each study site ranged from 10 to 33 species (mean +/- standard error (SE): 20.73 +/- 1.94) and their apparent diversity rates (i.e., Shannon index) ranged from 0.57 to 2.55 (mean +/- SE: 1.97 +/- 0.16). At the community level, vertebrate host diversity had a marginal dilution effect on the disease risk and was negatively correlated to pathogen richness. The exposure to multiple pathogens, as a proxy of disease risk, was negatively associated with apparent host diversity. The disease risk was driven by the interaction of apparent biodiversity with the presence of livestock and with the centrality of the indicator species (i.e., the wild boar). The maximum risk of co-exposure to pathogens was reached when the lowest apparent biodiversity rates coincided with the highest wild boar centrality in the host community or with the presence of livestock, respectively. The highest confluence of pathogens occurred at lower apparent diversity indexes, higher wild boar relative abundances and predominance of agricultural lands. Our results suggest that the diversity-disease relationship is not linear and depends on the environment and host community characteristics, thereby opening avenues for designing new prevention strategies.

Este estudio aporta nuevas perspectivas al pol & eacute;mico debate sobre el efecto de la biodiversidad en el riesgo de enfermedad al combinar el ARS con la evaluaci & oacute;n de indicadores de diversidad de hospedadores y riqueza de pat & oacute;genos en Espa & ntilde;a. La riqueza aparente de especies detectada mediante c & aacute;maras trampa en cada lugar de estudio oscil & oacute; entre 10 y 33 especies (media +/- error est & aacute;ndar (SE): 20.73 +/- 1.94) y sus & iacute;ndices de diversidad aparente (es decir, el & iacute;ndice de Shannon) oscilaron entre 0.57 y 2.55 (media +/- SE: 1.97 +/- 0.16). A nivel de comunidad, la diversidad de hospedadores vertebrados tuvo un efecto marginal de diluci & oacute;n sobre el riesgo de enfermedad y se correlacion & oacute; negativamente con la riqueza de pat & oacute;genos. La exposici & oacute;n a m & uacute;ltiples pat & oacute;genos, como indicador del riesgo de enfermedad, se asoci & oacute; negativamente con la diversidad aparente de hospedadores. El riesgo de enfermedad estuvo determinado por la interacci & oacute;n de la biodiversidad aparente con la presencia de ganado y con la centralidad de la especie indicadora (es decir, el jabal & iacute;). El riesgo m & aacute;ximo de coexposici & oacute;n a pat & oacute;genos se alcanz & oacute; cuando los & iacute;ndices m & aacute;s bajos de biodiversidad aparente coincidieron con la mayor centralidad del jabal & iacute; en la comunidad de hospedadores o con la presencia de ganado, respectivamente. La mayor confluencia de pat & oacute;genos se produjo con & iacute;ndices de diversidad aparente m & aacute;s bajos, mayores abundancias relativas de jabal & iacute;es y predominio de ambientes agr & iacute;colas. Nuestros resultados sugieren que la relaci & oacute;n diversidad-enfermedad no es lineal y depende del entorno y de las caracter & iacute;sticas de la comunidad de hospedadores, lo que abre v & iacute;as para dise & ntilde;ar nuevas estrategias de prevenci & oacute;n.

AB  - Plants produce nutritious, fleshy fruits that attract various animals to facilitate seed dispersal and recruitment dynamic. Species-specific differential selection of seed size by multiple frugivorous disperser assemblages may affect the subsequent germination of the ingested seeds. However, there is little empirical evidence supporting this association. In the present study, we documented conflicting selection pressures exerted on seed size and germination by five frugivorous carnivores on a mammal-dispersed pioneer tree, the date-plum persimmon (Diospyros lotus), in a subtropical forest. Fecal analyses revealed that these carnivores acted as primary seed dispersers of D. lotus. We also observed that seed sizes were selected based on body mass and were species-specific, confirming the "gape limitation" hypothesis; three small carnivores (the masked palm civet Paguma larvata, yellow-throated marten Martes flavigula, and Chinese ferret-badger Melogale moschata) significantly preferred to disperse smaller seeds in comparison with control seeds obtained directly from wild plants whereas the largest Asiatic black bears (Ursus thibetanus) ingested larger seeds. Seeds dispersed by medium-sized hog badgers (Arctonyx albogularis) were not significantly different from control seeds. However, regarding the influence of gut passage on seed germination, three arboreal dispersal agents (martens, civets, and bears) enhanced germination success whereas terrestrial species (ferret-badgers and hog badgers) inhibited the germination process compared with undigested control seeds. These conflicting selection pressures on seed size and germination may enhance the heterogeneity of germination dynamics and thus increase species fitness through diversification of the regeneration niche. Our results advance our understanding of seed dispersal mechanisms and have important implications for forest recruitment and ecosystem dynamics.

AB  - Global savannas are the third largest carbon sink with large human populations being highly dependent on their ecosystem services. However, savannas are changing rapidly due to climate change, fire, animal management, and intense fuelwood harvesting. In southern Africa, large trees (>5 m in height) are under threat while shrub cover (<3 m) is increasing. The collection of multi-date airborne LiDAR (ALS) data, initiated over a decade ago in the Lowveld of South Africa, provided a rare opportunity to quantify the ability of L-band SAR to track changes in savanna vegetation structure and this study is the first to do so, to our knowledge. The objective was to test the ability of ALOS PALSAR 1&2, dual-pol (HH, HV) data to quantify woody cover and volume change in savannas over 2-, 8-and 10-year periods through comparison to ALS. For each epoch (2008, 2010, 2018), multiple PALSAR images were processed to Gamma0 (gamma 0) at 15 m resolution with multi-temporal speckle filtering. ALS data were processed to fractional canopy cover and volume, and then compared to 5 x 5 aggregated (75 m) SAR mean gamma 0. The ALS cover change (Delta CALS) and volume change between pairs of years were highly correlated, with (R2 > 0.8), thus results for cover change applied equally to volume change. Cover change was predicted using (i) direct backscatter change or (ii) the difference between annual cover map product derived using the Bayesian Water Cloud Model (BWCM) and logarithmic models. The linear relationship between Delta gamma 0 and Delta CALS varied between year pairs but reached a maximum R2 of 0.7 for 2018-2010 and a moderate R2 of 0.4 for 2018-2008. Overall, 1 dB Delta gamma 0 corresponded to approximately 0.1 cover change. The three cover change models had very similar uncertainties with mean RMSE = 0.15, which is 13% of the observed cover change range (-0.6 to +0.6). The direct backscatter change approach had less underestimation of positive and negative cover change. The L -band backscatter had a higher sensitivity than suggested by previous studies, as it was able to reliably distinguish cover change at 0.25 increments. The SAR-derived cover change maps detected the loss of stands of big trees, and widespread increases in cover of 0.35-0.65 in communal rangelands due to shrub encroachment. In contrast, the maps suggest that cover generally decreased in conservation areas, forming distinct fence-line effects, potentially caused by significant increases in elephant numbers and frequent, intense wildfires in reserves.

AB  - Coral reefs are increasingly ecologically destabilized across the globe due to climate change. Behavioural plasticity in corallivore behaviour and short-term trophic ecology in response to bleaching events may influence the extent and severity of coral bleaching and subsequent recovery potential, yet our understanding of these interactions in situ remains unclear. Here, we investigated interactions between corallivory and coral bleaching during a severe high thermal event (10.3-degree heating weeks) in Belize. We found that parrotfish changed their grazing behaviour in response to bleaching by selectively avoiding bleached Orbicella spp. colonies regardless of bleaching severity or coral size. For bleached corals, we hypothesize that this short-term respite from corallivory may temporarily buffer coral energy budgets by not redirecting energetic resources to wound healing, and may therefore enable compensatory nutrient acquisition. However, colonies that had previously been heavily grazed were also more susceptible to bleaching, which is likely to increase mortality risk. Thus, short-term respite from corallivory during bleaching may not be sufficient to functionally rescue corals during prolonged bleaching. Such pairwise interactions and behavioural shifts in response to disturbance may appear small scale and short term, but have the potential to fundamentally alter ecological outcomes, especially in already-degraded ecosystems that are vulnerable and sensitive to change.

AB  - Endozoochory, the dispersal of seeds through the animal gut passage, plays a significant role in vegetation dynamics. The success of endozoochorous seed dispersal depends on each stage of the process: ingestion by animals, gut passage, and post-dispersal events after defecation. After the deposition of seeds through feces, the effects of feces on the initial stages of seedling establishment, including seed germination and seedling growth, can significantly impact overall survival. The pattern of fecal effects on plant species depends on the animal species. In this study, we investigated the effects of feces presence on seed germination and early seedling growth using feces of the Korean water deer (Hydropotes inermis argyropus). We conducted a germination experiment on 12 plant species belonging to 10 plant families, which are known to germinate in the feces of Korean water deer. The study compared the seed germination rate and seedling length after germination between seeds sown with and without feces of the Korean water deer. In general, we found that the presence of deer feces per se had no significant effects on seed germination and early growth stages. However, additional research on post-dispersal events such as long-term growth, fecal type, and germination conditions is needed to fully understand the costs and benefits of endozoochory.

AB  - Emerging evidence suggests that humans shape the ecology and evolution of species interactions. Islands are particularly susceptible to anthropogenic disturbance due to the fragility of their ecosystems; however, we know little about the susceptibility of species interactions to urbanization on islands. To address this gap, we studied how the earliest stages of urban development affect interactions between Darwin's finches and its key food resource, Tribulus cistoides, in three towns on the Galapagos Islands. We measured variation in mericarp predation rates, mericarp morphology, and finch community composition using population surveys, experimental manipulations, and finch observations conducted in habitats within and outside of each town. We found that both seed and mericarp removal rates were higher in towns than natural habitats. We also found that selection on mericarp size and defense differed between habitats in the survey and experimental populations and that towns supported smaller and less diverse finch communities than natural habitats. Together, our results suggest that even moderate levels of urbanization can alter ecological interactions between Darwin's finches and T. cistoides, leading to modified natural selection on T. cistoides populations. Our study demonstrates that trophic interactions on islands may be susceptible to the anthropogenic disturbance associated with urbanization. Despite containing the highest diversity in the world, studies of urbanization are lacking from the tropics. Our study identified signatures of urbanization on species interactions in a tropical island ecosystem and suggests that changes to the ecology of species interactions has the potential to alter evolution in urban environments.

AB  - Nitrogen (N) is a necessary element of soil fertility and a limiting nutrient in tallgrass prairie but grazers like bison and cattle can also recycle N. Bison and cattle impact the nitrogen (N) cycle by digesting forage that is consumed, and recycled back to the soil in a more available forms stimulating soil microbial N cycling activities. Yet we do not know how both grazers comparatively affect N cycling in tallgrass prairie. Thus, we investigated if bison and cattle had similar impacts on N cycling in annually burned tallgrass prairie relative to ungrazed conditions over a 3-year period (2020-2022) at the Konza Prairie Biological Station. We examined: soil pH, soil water content, mineralized N, nitrification potential, denitrification potential and extracellular enzyme assays. Interannual variability in precipitation controlled soil water and N cycling microbial activities but grazing effects had a stronger influence on N cycling. We found significant differences and increased soil pH, nitrification and denitrification potential and less N limitation in bison vs cattle grazed soils where bison grazed soils exhibited faster N cycling. Differences between the grazers may be attributed to the different management of bison and cattle as both can impact N cycling. Overall, these data provide some evidence that bison and cattle affect N cycling differently at this study site, and improve the ecological understanding of grazer impacts on N cycling dynamics within the tallgrass prairie ecosystem.

AB  - The Argentinian Ministry of Environment has approved the translocation of 45 guanacos from Southern Patagonia to the Pampas region, a distance of 1500 km, as the initial phase toward future translocations into a National Park located in the Chaco region, another 1600 km further North. This decision raises concerns about the technical and ethical aspects of the translocation. Firstly, there is a lack of proper evaluation and scientific evidence to support the need, opportunity, and feasibility of this translocation. The guanaco population is currently over one million and is increasing, and genetic differences exist among local populations. The translocation could produce anthropogenic-driven admixed populations, leading to genetic swamping and disrupting evolutionary processes. Second, there are ethical conflicts around managing wild species populations that prioritize private objectives and disregard local, publicly funded science. Rewilding projects require a deep understanding of interacting ecosystem processes, and of the socio-economic context. This management decision violates guiding principles for rewilding and should have followed proper scientific evaluation and transparent local consultation.

AB  - Argyrosomus japonicus, a widespread estuarine and coastal sciaenid, is listed as endangered on the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Threatened Species Red List. In this review, we conduct an updated assessment of the global status of A. japonicus, an important commercial, recreational and artisanal fisheries species. A wide variety of topics are covered, including a synthesis of our knowledge on A. japonicus reproduction; the larval, juvenile and adult life stages; physiology and behaviour; growth and maturity; food and feeding ecology; predators and parasites; drivers of population status; and the evolution and genetics of the species. Adaptation to low salinities and occupation of estuarine nursery areas by this species may have facilitated the evolution of late maturity and longevity, largely through reduced natural mortality, particularly for juveniles. However, unsustainable fishing mortality and estuarine nursery area degradation have compromised the stock status of A. japonicus. Four management measures are highlighted for the future: (1) maintaining spawning stock biomass and reproductive capacity by restricting fisheries that target spawning aggregations, (2) reducing negative anthropogenic impacts on estuaries, (3) facilitating estuarine protection areas for known nursery habitats of the juveniles and (4) reducing juvenile fishing mortality by implementing suitable size limits and bag limits.

AB  - Animals interact with nutrient cycles by consuming and depositing nutrients, interactions studied separately in nutritional ecology and zoogeochemistry. Recent theoretical work bridges these disciplines, highlighting that animal-driven nutrient recycling could be crucial in helping animals meet their nutritional needs. When animals exhibit site fidelity, they consistently deposit nutrients, potentially improving vegetation quality. We investigated this potential feedback by analysing changes in forage nitrogen stocks following simulated caribou calving. We found that forage nitrogen stocks increased after 2 weeks and remained elevated after 1 year, a change due to increased forage quality, not quantity. We also developed a nutrient budget within calving grounds, demonstrating that natal fluid and calf carcasses contribute substantial nitrogen subsidies. We, thus, highlight a positive zoogeochemical feedback whereby nutrients deposited during calving become bioavailable during lactation and provide evidence that site fidelity creates a biogeochemical boomerang in which animals deposit nutrients that can be reused later.

AB  - Environmental change is disrupting mutualisms between organisms worldwide. Reported declines in insect populations and changes in pollinator community compositions in response to land use and other environmental drivers have put the spotlight on the need to conserve pollinators. While this is often motivated by their role in supporting crop yields, the role of pollinators for reproduction and resulting taxonomic and functional assembly in wild plant communities has received less attention. Recent findings suggest that observed and experimental gradients in pollinator availability can affect plant community composition, but we know little about when such shifts are to be expected, or the impact they have on ecosystem functioning. Correlations between plant traits related to pollination and plant traits related to other important ecosystem functions, such as productivity, nitrogen uptake or palatability to herbivores, lead us to expect non-random shifts in ecosystem functioning in response to changes in pollinator communities. At the same time, ecological and evolutionary processes may counteract these effects of pollinator declines, limiting changes in plant community composition, and in ecosystem functioning. Despite calls to investigate community- and ecosystem-level impacts of reduced pollination, the study of pollinator effects on plants has largely been confined to impacts on plant individuals or single-species populations.With this review we aim to break new ground by bringing together aspects of landscape ecology, ecological and evolutionary plant-insect interactions, and biodiversity-ecosystem functioning research, to generate new ideas and hypotheses about the ecosystem-level consequences of pollinator declines in response to land-use change, using grasslands as a focal system. Based on an integrated set of seven hypotheses, we call for more research investigating the putative pollinator-mediated links between landscape-scale land use and ecosystem functioning. In particular, future research should use combinations of experimental and observational approaches to assess the effects of changes in pollinator communities over multiple years and across species on plant communities and on trait distributions both within and among species.

AB  - Insect herbivory is one of the major drivers of seedling mortality in the tropics and influences plant abundances and community composition. Anthropogenic disturbance can alter patterns of insect herbivory with potential consequences on plant communities in restored forests. We planted seedlings of early- and later-stage successional tree species in 13-15-year-old restored and remnant tropical forests. We then either excluded insect herbivores or left seedlings exposed to examine how insect herbivory-affected seedling mortality. Early-successional seedlings experienced similar decreases in mortality when insect herbivores were excluded from both restored and remnant forest sites, but this effect was smaller and driven by only a few species in restored forests. Later-successional seedlings experienced a stronger decrease in mortality between open and insect-excluded treatments in remnant than restored sites. Our results suggest that herbivory-driven seedling mortality is lower in restored forests, particularly for later-successional seedlings. Results are encouraging from a restoration perspective because recruitment of later-successional seedlings is a key component of ecosystem recovery. However, if reductions in seedling mortality continue over the long term, this may affect tree community composition as succession progresses.

AB  - Natural selection should favor development of behaviors that increase survival, including juvenile survival. Habitat characteristics ( e.g., hiding cover, forage quality and availability), maternal habitat selection, and microhabitat selection by the calf may influence elk (Cervus canadensis) calf survival and recruitment. We assessed diurnal microhabitat selection of bed sites by elk calves and calf-rearing areas selected by adult females to determine if these characteristics were associated with calf survival. We radio-tagged 33 elk calves in west-central New Mexico in 2011 and 55 calves in north-central New Mexico in 2012. We tracked calves daily to locate calf bedding sites and collected data on selected physical features and vegetation characteristics at used and paired random sites. The paired differences in these characteristics were then associated with calf fate. At the calf selection scale, for every 1-m difference in the distance to nearest concealment cover, the odds that a site was from a surviving calf increased by 7.8%. Habitat selection by adult females also was associated with calf survival. The odds of a bed site being from a surviving calf increased by 1.9% for every 1% difference in percentage of grass cover. High levels of concealment cover at the bed site were related to calf survival status. When we expanded selection to the adult level, females with surviving calves selected areas with higher grass cover, suggesting adult selection for higher forage availability while still providing high concealment cover for the calf.

Extensive damage to the reef from bottom fishing activities was apparent, which resulted in the establishment of the 15-km(2) Lophelia Coral Conservation Area (LCCA) in 2004 to prevent further damage and allow recovery. Since 2004, the effectiveness of the LCCA in achieving these objectives has never been assessed. Through the analysis of benthic images collected in 2003, 2009, and 2015, we evaluated the effectiveness of the LCCA in terms of its success in facilitating the recolonization and recovery of its target species, L. pertusa, and in conserving local benthic biodiversity. Using multivariate community analyses and generalized linear modelling techniques, we compared changes in the diversity, abundance, and composition of epibenthic megafauna within and outside its boundaries over the 12-year period. We observed an increase in epibenthic megafaunal species density and abundance over time that was higher inside the closure than outside, suggesting that the LCCA has facilitated the recruitment and recovery of the benthic communities within its confines. While recruitment of L. pertusa was low, the recent discovery of numerous undisturbed large mounds of live L. pertusa establishes a local recruitment source, a prerequisite for the reef structure to recover to its pre-disturbed state. We recommend that monitoring of the reef structure occur every 7-10 years to evaluate the settlement and growth of L. pertusa and the other deep-water corals that reside there.

AB  - Giant clam shells provide a solid substrate for various species of epibionts. Yet, it is not well known how epibiont communities vary among populations of different giant clam species and in giant clams restocked in different habitat types. Here, we examined differences in the epibiont communities of three species of giant clams with different shell morphology (Tridacna gigas, Tridacna derasa, and Hippopus hippopus), and characterized the epibiont communities on T. gigas from three different habitat types (sandy reef flat, seagrass bed, and coral reef). Tridacna gigas had higher species richness, abundance, and cover of epibionts compared to the other two species. Tridacna gigas in coral reef habitat also displayed higher species richness and cover of sessile epibionts, while the same species in the sandy reef flat had higher species richness and abundance of mobile epibionts. Epibiont communities were more variable across habitat types than among different giant clam species restocked in a similar area. Differences in abundance of Trochus sp., Pyramidella sp., and crustose coralline algae contributed to the variability in epibiont communities among the giant clam species and across habitats. A few taxa were observed only on specific giant clam species and sites. For instance, Diadema sp. and Echinometra sp. were found only on T. gigas, and Diadema sp. was present only in the sandy reef flat. Both the complexity of the giant clam shells and habitat type contribute to differences in associated epibiont communities. This further emphasizes the ecological importance of giant clams as habitats for other invertebrates.

AB  - Negative interactions with humans resulting from livestock predation is a major factor influencing the decline of African lion Panthera leo populations across Africa. Here we investigate lion depredation within two Maasai communities in southern Kenya where people and lions coexist in the absence of any formal protected areas. We explore the factors that increase the frequency and severity of lion attacks on pastoralists and their livestock and assess the effectiveness of livestock guarding to reduce damage. Finally, we examine in which circumstances lion depredation triggers retaliation by people. Over a period of 26 months, lions attacked livestock 29 times, resulting in 41 livestock deaths and 19 injuries. There were also two attacks on people. Lions preferred cattle over the more numerous sheep and goats. Attacks on livestock occurred mostly during the dry season and were not affected by changes in prey density or variation in pastoral settlement that brought livestock into closer proximity with lions. Livestock were guarded during 48.2% of lion attacks. Active guarding at pasture disrupted the majority of lion attacks, resulting in lower mortality rates. Passive guarding in corrals at night also disrupted attacks but did not lead to lower livestock mortality.

AB  - The plateau pika (Ochotona curzoniae) is a predominant small burrowing herbivore that plays a vital role within the alpine meadow ecosystem of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau. This investigation centered on delineating the variances in bioturbation impacts by plateau pikas on soil characteristics in alpine meadows under distinct population densities. Outcomes indicated notable discrepancies in SOC, TC, and TN levels between surface soil depth (0-10 cm) and deeper depth (10-20 cm) under different Active Burrow Density (ABD). Across different depths, SOC, TC, and TN concentrations exhibited an initial rise followed by a decline with escalating Active Burrow Density (ABD), reaching peaks within the range of 240-330 burrows per hectare. Additionally, SOC and TN levels displayed synchronized fluctuations across different depths, while TC levels did not exhibit such synchronicity; TC content in deeper depth lagged behind that in surface depth. Moreover, surface soil stoichiometry (C:N ratio) diminished with heightened ABD, whereas deeper depth exhibited an opposing trend. These findings underscore how plateau pika bioturbation reshape nutrient distribution patterns and soil stoichiometry, thereby influencing carbon turnover processes and cycling rates. Drawing upon these findings, the study concludes that moderating plateau pika population density within reasonable thresholds, offers greater promise in stabilizing nutrient cycling processes in alpine meadow and upholding ecological equilibrium.

AB  - Conspecific negative density dependence (CNDD) is a potentially important mechanism in maintaining species diversity. While previous evidence showed habitat heterogeneity and species' dispersal modes affect the strength of CNDD at early life stages of trees (e.g., seedlings), it remains unclear how they affect the strength of CNDD at later life stages. We examined the degree of spatial aggregation between saplings and trees for species dispersed by wind and gravity in four topographic habitats within a 25-ha temperate forest dynamic plot in the Qinling Mountains of central China. We used the replicated spatial point pattern (RSPP) analysis and bivariate pair correlation function (PCF) to detect the spatial distribution of saplings around trees at two scales, 15 and 50 m, respectively. Although the signal was not apparent across the whole study region (or 25-ha), it is distinct on isolated areas with specific characteristics, suggesting that these characteristics could be important factors in CNDD. Further, we found that the gravity-dispersed tree species experienced CNDD across habitats, while for wind-dispersed species CNDD was found in gully, terrace and low-ridge habitats. Our study suggests that neglecting the habitat heterogeneity and dispersal mode can distort the signal of CNDD and community assembly in temperate forests.

AB  - Shallow coastal seas play an important role in the economy of many countries by sustaining fisheries, tourism, aquaculture and other economic activities. Their exploitation has largescale ecosystem effects that are easily overlooked, as they often built up over decades or centuries, and historical ecological reference data are rarely available. Here, we assess these effects by comparing live and surface death assemblages (recording historical community states) of soft-bottom molluscs across a range of habitats in the northern Adriatic Sea, using the degree of mismatch between the 2 assemblages as a proxy for ecological change. We found a consistent live-dead mismatch at all stations. Although the degree of mismatch varied between stations with low and high time-averaging (i.e. the range of post-mortem shell ages), the community change followed the same trend over the entire Adriatic basin regardless of the type of sedimentary environment, with a loss of epifaunal species and the reduction of grazers, carnivores, and herbivores. In turn, the abundance of infaunal and opportunistic species feeding on plankton or detritus strongly increased in the living communities. Directionality and magnitude of these changes cannot be explained by time-averaging or by differences in species durability, but reflect a true ecological shift in response to multiple, long-lasting anthropogenic pressures, mainly bottom trawling, eutrophication and hypoxia. The original heterogeneous assemblages characteristic of different sedimentary habitats are thus replaced by a more infaunal, functionally impoverished and less diverse benthic community representing a new ecological baseline shaped by human impact.

AB  - Functional trait and functional diversity indices reflect the variations of community structure and indicate their responses to environmental stress. In this study, based on four functional traits, including body length, feeding type, trophic group, and reproductive mode, the functional diversity and functional groups of crustacean zooplankton from the southern Yellow Sea (SYS) were explored over four seasons of 2019. A total of 53 species were identified and categorized into six functional groups. Copepods with ambush-feeding and omnivore-carnivore diet (Group II) were dominant in spring (55.6%), while omnivore-herbivore copepods (Group I) were the most abundant group in the other three seasons (>54.7%). The comparable distributions of functional diversity indices in different seasons were most likely due to hydrological variations. The Changjiang River Diluted Water promoted the coexistence of multiple traits carried by different functional groups (high functional richness (FRic) and functional dispersion (FDis)), but the stability of ecosystem function in this water mass was vulnerable to the loss of individual species (low functional evenness (FEve)) in summer. In winter, as a result of the Yellow Sea Warm Current, warm-water taxa increased FRic and FEve, suggesting that the community could buffer environmental fluctuations more effectively. Moreover, distribution of FRic values indicates the possible range and influence intensity of the Yellow Sea Cold Water Mass.

AB  - Homogenisation and intensification of agricultural ecosystems are among the most important threats to biodiversity, linked to declines in pollinators, soil biota and ecosystem functioning. Diversification has been proposed as a way to restore ecosystem functioning in agricultural landscapes. To manage agricultural land for multiple ecosystem functions, evidence is needed of the effect of diversification on functionally distinct taxa. We contribute to closing this knowledge gap through a global meta-analysis of 161 peer-reviewed articles addressing the abundance and richness of six distinct functional groups: autotrophs, decomposers, natural enemies, pests, pollinators, and other. We found diversified farming systems increased overall species richness by 26% on average, relative to simplified farming systems. However, the effect of diversified farming on the overall mean abundance was weak. Our study shows diversified farming systems enhanced the abundance and richness of beneficial species while reducing the abundance of pests (e.g., weeds, herbivores), thus providing benefits for both agricultural production and biodiversity. The positive effect of diversified farming systems on the overall mean species richness was stronger in farms in more simplified landscapes, i.e., those that are further from natural and semi-natural habitats or have a lower proportion of seminatural vegetation in a 1 km radius. Pollinator's abundance and richness were highest in diversified farming plots located far away from natural and semi-natural habitats. In contrast, proximity to these natural and semi-natural habitats (<250 m) increased the positive effect of diversified farming systems on natural enemies' abundance, while reducing the number of pests. Our results add to the body of evidence calling for the repurposing of policies, regulations, and international agendas to promote, support and incentivize the adoption of diversified farming practices for supporting biodiversity. Spatial planning of diversification schemes should consider the landscape context of farms to ensure the greatest benefit of intervention.

AB  - Monitoring of reef restoration efforts and artificial reefs (ARs) has typically been limited to coral fragment survival, hampering evaluation of broader objectives such as ecosystem recovery. This study aimed to determine to what extent AR design influences the ecological recovery of restored reefs by monitoring outplanted coral fragments, benthic cover, coral recruitment and fish and invertebrate communities for two years. Four AR designs (16 m(2)), unrestored controls and natural reef patches as reference (n = 10) were established in Mkwiro, Kenya. ARs consisted either of concrete disks with bottles, layered concrete disks, metal cages or a combination thereof. A mixture of 18 branching coral species (mainly Acropora spp.) was outplanted on ARs at a density of 7 corals m(-2). After two years, 60% of all outplanted fragments had survived, already resulting in coral cover on most ARs comparable (though Acropora-dominated) to reference patches. Coral survival differed between ARs, with highest survival on cages due to the absence of crown-of-thorns sea star predation on this design. In total, 32 coral genera recruited on ARs and recruit densities were highest on reference patches, moderate on concrete ARs and low on cages. ARs and reference patches featured nearly twice the fish species richness and around an order of magnitude higher fish abundance and biomass compared to control patches. Fish abundance and biomass strongly correlated with coral cover on ARs. AR, reference and control patches all had distinct fish species compositions, but AR and reference patches were similar in terms of trophic structure of their fish communities. Motile invertebrates including gastropods, sea urchins, sea cucumbers and sea stars were present at ARs, but generally more abundant and diverse at natural reference patches. Taken together, all studied ecological parameters progressed towards reef ecosystem recovery, with varying influences of AR design and material. We recommend a combination of metal cages and layered concrete ARs to promote high fragment survival as well as natural coral recruitment. Ultimately, a longer period of monitoring is needed to fully determine the effectiveness reef restoration as conservation tool to support coral reef ecosystem recovery.

AB  - Trees and shrubs expanded in the last decades in European mountains due to land abandonment and the decrease in grazing pressure, and are expected to further spread also due to climate change. As a consequence of low forage quality and topographic constraints, the management of mountain environments dominated by woody vegetation with livestock is often challenging. Silvopastoral systems based on cattle hardy breeds able to forage on woody plants, such as Highland cattle, could be a suitable option for the management and restoration of such environments. In this study, we used direct observations to explore the foraging behavior of Highland cattle in four study areas across the western Alps. In particular, we assessed: (1) cattle diet composition, (2) the selection for more than 30 tree and shrub species, and (3) the relationships between species consumption and their abundance in the environment. Highland cattle fed on a mixture of both woody and herbaceous species, including between 15 and 46% of woody plants in the diet. Some trees (e.g., Celtis australis, Fraxinus spp., and Populus tremula) and shrubs (e.g., Frangula alnus, Rhamnus spp., and Rubus idaeus) were positively selected by cattle, thus they could be an important forage supplement to their diet. Moreover, the results highlighted that relative species consumption generally increased with increasing species abundance in the environment, suggesting that this cattle breed could be suitable to control shrub expansion in highly encroached areas. The outcomes of this study can support the development of targeted silvopastoral systems in the Alps.

AB  - The Paleocene-Eocene thermal maximum (PETM) was the largest early Cenozoic hyperthermal event, one of a series of carbon cycle and climate perturbations marked by massive releases of carbon into the atmosphere and spikes in global temperature. Previous studies have documented major changes in the composition of terrestrial plant and animal communities during the PETM, as well as changes in arthropod herbivory. Here, we examine possible changes in pollination mode during the PETM in the Bighorn Basin, Wyoming, USA, as inferred from three lines of evidence: (1) the prevalence of fossil pollen preserved as clumps, (2) the pollination mode of nearest living relatives (NLR), and (3) angiosperm pollen morphological diversity. These suggest animal pollination became more common and wind pollination less common during the PETM. The decrease in wind pollination during the PETM reflects the basin-scale extirpation of wind-pollinated lineages and their replacement by dominantly animal-pollinated lineages concomitant with rapid warming and drying. The hotter and seasonally drier climates not only facilitated the northward range shift of plant taxa, but likely their insect and/or vertebrate pollinators as well. The dramatic floral changes during the PETM in the Bighorn Basin may also have changed available resources for insect and/or vertebrate pollinators.

AB  - The role of community conservation areas for large mammals is rarely evaluated. We investigated the species richness and frequency of sightings of large mammals in the Dodola Community Conservation Area. The study area was stratified into three habitat types, and 49 lines transect was laid (27 Dry evergreen Afromontane forests, 20 Sub-afro-alpine habitats, and 2 plantation forests) based on the topography, land use, and vegetation cover of the study area. A total of 24 species of large mammals were identified and recorded in the study area. Though the community conservation area is home to diverse species of mammals, including some endemic and endangered ones such as mountain nyala and Bale Monkey, human encroachment, agriculture, and overgrazing are prominent in the area, putting huge pressure on flora and fauna. Therefore, we recommend the participatory approach be strengthened to ensure sustainable coexistence between people and wildlife.

AB  - Coastal ecosystems worldwide are facing intense and diverse pressures caused by anthropogenic climate change, which compromises physiological tolerance of organisms, as well as causes shifts in their biotic interactions. Within-species genetic variation plays an important role in persistence of populations under such changes by providing building blocks for adaptation. The brackish-water Baltic Sea is predicted to experience a significant desalination by the end of this century. The Baltic Sea is dominated, in terms of biomass, by a few species with locally adapted populations, making it a suitable model for studying shifting biotic interactions under changing abiotic conditions. We exposed two foundation species of brown algae, Fucus vesiculosus and Fucus radicans, to end-of-the-century projected salinity together with grazing pressure in experimental tanks. We measured growth, grazing and phlorotannin content and compared these traits between the current and projected future salinity conditions, between Fucus species, and between high and low genotypic diversity groups. Grazing, phlorotannin content and growth of both F. radicans and F. vesiculosus all showed genotypic variation. Future decreased salinity hampered growth of F. vesiculosus irrespective of genotypic diversity of the experimental population. Furthermore, the growth response to desalination showed variation among genotypes. F. radicans was more susceptible to grazing than F. vesiculosus, and, in the high genetic diversity group of the latter, grazing was higher in the future than in current salinity. Climate change induced hyposalinity will thus challenge Fucus populations at their range margins in the Baltic Sea both because of the growth deterioration and changes in grazing. Differences between the species in these responses indicate a better ability of F. radicans to cope with the changing environment. Our results emphasize the complexity of biotic interactions in mediating the climate change influences as well as the importance of genetic diversity in coping with climate change.

AB  - Wildlife trade is a key driver of extinction risk, affecting at least 24% of terrestrial vertebrates. The persistent removal of species can have profound impacts on species extinction risk and selection within populations. We draw together the first review of characteristics known to drive species use - identifying species with larger body sizes, greater abundance, increased rarity or certain morphological traits valued by consumers as being particularly prevalent in trade. We then review the ecological implications of this trade-driven selection, revealing direct effects of trade on natural selection and populations for traded species, which includes selection against desirable traits. Additionally, there exists a positive feedback loop between rarity and trade and depleted populations tend to have easy human access points, which can result in species being harvested to extinction and has the potential to alter source-sink dynamics. Wider cascading ecosystem repercussions from trade-induced declines include altered seed dispersal networks, trophic cascades, long-term compositional changes in plant communities, altered forest carbon stocks, and the introduction of harmful invasive species. Because it occurs across multiple scales with diverse drivers, wildlife trade requires multi-faceted conservation actions to maintain biodiversity and ecological function, including regulatory and enforcement approaches, bottom-up and community-based interventions, captive breeding or wildlife farming, and conservation translocations and trophic rewilding. We highlight three emergent research themes at the intersection of trade and community ecology: (1) functional impacts of trade; (2) altered provisioning of ecosystem services; and (3) prevalence of trade-dispersed diseases. Outside of the primary objective that exploitation is sustainable for traded species, we must urgently incorporate consideration of the broader consequences for other species and ecosystem processes when quantifying sustainability.

AB  - Human modification of landscapes and associated disturbances may facilitate the emergence and spread of zoonotic diseases. Policy-makers need better understanding of the link between anthropogenic disturbances and wildlife disease hosts at the interface of human society and the natural environment, for example agriculture, forestry and aquaculture. Empirical research is strongly needed for the control of novel zoonoses which might emerge, as well as the management of existing zoonoses with significant economic repercussions such as bovine tuberculosis (bTB). We aimed to examine the link between ecological disturbance and relative bTB risk using Ireland as a case study. We analysed clearfell forestry operations and assessed bTB breakdowns within cattle farms across different spatio-temporal scales over multiple years, examining how ecological conditions may modulate this relationship using conditional logistic regression models. We found a significant effect of the interaction between the extent of clearfell forestry removed and the extent of natural grassland and mixed forestry present on relative bTB risk. This interaction was dynamic, leading to an increase or decrease of the relative bTB risk depending on where (between 2 and 6 km from the farm) and when (between 0 and 36 months prior to the bTB outbreak) the clearfell operations occurred. Our study provides empirical evidence of the link between mechanised forestry operations and fluctuating relative bTB risk in cattle farms, although the mechanism behind it is yet to be elucidated. Given our data, we hypothesise that wildlife hosts may abandon the area subjected to clearfell when disturbance is highest (during active operations and shortly afterward) but are subsequently attracted back to the site as they regenerate, potentially affecting the contact rates with livestock and thus, relative bTB risk. Synthesis and applications. Our analysis demonstrates that landscape modification is correlated with a change in relative bovine tuberculosis (bTB) risk that is dynamic in time and space. Understanding that the effect of landscape change is transient allows managers to understand the risk for neighbouring farms and inform policy accordingly. Landscape-level studies are necessary to unveil subtle-ecological processes, shifting research and management efforts away from cattle herd-centric policy and toward macroecological surveillance of wildlife hosts and longitudinal assessment of bTB risk.

AB  - European wood-pasture landscapes have been the subject of intense debate, particularly in the early twenty-first century. This chapter provides an overview of the critical research and ideas underpinning much of that discussion. The nature and function of wood-pastures are introduced and the historical drivers of European wood-pastures are considered. Specifically, the social roles of wood-pasture are notable - and within the system the roles of large grazing herbivores are key drivers of structure and ecology. Oak Quercus spp., Hazel Corylus avellana and Blackthorn Prunus spinosa are important species in this dynamic system which harks back to Europe's primeval landscapes.

AB  - Simple Summary Changes in precipitation patterns can significantly alter biological processes and associated ecosystem functions. This study aimed to investigate the impacts of rainfall intensity and timing on the structure of dung beetle assemblage and dung mass loss rate in a Tibetan alpine meadow. The results revealed that exposure to rainfall within a 2 h timeframe, regardless of rainfall intensity, significantly reduced the rate of dung mass loss. However, this decrease was not attributed to the activity of dung beetles. Earlier rainfall tended to decrease species richness of dung beetles, while heavier rainfall significantly decreased beetle abundance. These findings suggest that changes in precipitation patterns can influence both the assemblage of dung beetles and the rate of dung decomposition, but may also decouple their relationship under a certain circumstance. The variability in local biological processes and ecosystem functions deserves greater attention within a global climate change scenario.Abstract Changes in precipitation patterns, including rainfall intensity and rainfall timing, have been extensively demonstrated to impact biological processes and associated ecosystem functions. However, less attention has been paid to the effects of rainfall intensity and rainfall timing on the assembly of detritivore communities and the decomposition rate of detritus such as animal dung. In a grazed alpine meadow on the eastern Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, we conducted a manipulative experiment involving two levels of rainfall intensity (heavy rainfall, 1000 mL/5 min; light rainfall, 100 mL/5 min) and five levels of rainfall timing (0, 2, 4, 24, and 48 h after yak dung deposition). The aim was to determine the effects of rainfall intensity, timing, and their interaction on the assemblage of dung beetles and dung removal rate during the early stage (i.e., 96 h after yak dung deposition) of dung decomposition. Light rainfall significantly increased species richness in the treatment of 48 h after dung pats were deposited. Heavy rainfall significantly decreased beetle abundance in both the 0 h and 48 h treatments while light rainfall had no effect on beetle abundance. Dung mass loss was significant lower in the 2 h treatment compared to other treatments regardless of rainfall intensity. The structural equation model further revealed that the species richness of dung beetles and dung mass loss were significantly affected by rainfall timing but not by rainfall intensity. However, no significant relationships were observed between any variables examined. These findings suggest that changes in precipitation patterns can influence both the structure of dung beetles and the rate of dung decomposition but may also decouple their relationship under a certain circumstance. Therefore, it is crucial to pay greater attention to fully understand local variability between the biological processes and ecosystem functions within a global climate change scenario.

AB  - Simple Summary The restriction of the use of bisphenol A (BPA) in industrial production has led manufacturers to employ several BPA analogues. The endocrine-disrupting activity of these substitutes has been proven, and some of them are already widespread in the environment. The intake of these endocrine-disrupting chemicals through diet represents a public concern, and food contamination data are still scarce in scientific literature. To investigate the levels of BPA and its analogues in the production chain of buffalo milk, we developed and validated two analytical methods based on UHPLC-MS/MS and HPLC-FLD. The methods were used to analyse feed and feed additives, raw milk, drinking water, and blood serum samples from buffalo farms in the Campania region, Southern Italy. BPA was found to be the most abundant contaminant, proving that the presence of this compound is still significant and should be monitored. Bisphenol A (BPA) and some of its analogues are well known as endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs), i.e., compounds that can affect the physiological hormonal pathways in both animals and humans, causing adverse health effects. The intake of these substances through diet represents a public concern, compounded by the scarce data in the literature about contamination levels in food. In the framework of a research project, funded by the Italian Ministry of Health, we determined the contamination levels of BPA and 19 EDCs in the production chain of buffalo milk, analysing feed, drinking water, buffalo milk, and blood sera. Overall, 201 feed, 9 feed additive, 62 drinking water, 46 milk, and 190 blood serum samples were collected from 10 buffalo farms in the Campania region, Southern Italy, between 2019 and 2020, and analysed. Moreover, 15 retail bovine milk samples packaged both in Tetra Pak and in PET were analysed to further evaluate consumers' exposure to EDCs. The results of our work showed no contamination by EDCs in drinking water samples, whereas in 43% of all of the other samples from the farms at least one bisphenol was detected. The most abundant bisphenol detected was BPA (32% of the samples from the farms and 80% of the retail milk samples), thus proving that this compound is still widely used for plastic production.

AB  - Forest management must adapt to both current and future climate changes. Yet, there is limited knowledge regarding techniques to enhance the performance of planted trees and their interactions amidst rising temperatures and drought. We studied the effects of rising temperatures and woodland harvesting intensities (WHI) on planted trees and their herbivores in a Patagonian woodland. We planted six native timber species at four WHI levels (0%, 30%, 50%, and 70%) and constructed individual open-top chambers around the planted trees. The experimental increase in temperature created a warmer microenvironment for both the plants and associated herbivores, averaging a 1.4 degrees C rise in air temperature. Additionally, WHI contributed to increased air temperature (raising 3 degrees C from 0 to 70% harvest), radiation (760%), and annual frosts (37%). While plant survival improved with the temperature increase across the WHI levels, plant growth remained unaffected. Interestingly, although temperature was a crucial environmental factor, the temperature increase resulting from higher WHI did not specifically benefit the plants or herbivores. However, the experimental temperature rise led to reduced herbivory and changes in diversity patterns across WHI levels. Our findings suggest that a slight increase in temperature could buffer the effects of harvesting intensities, potentially enhancing the survival of planted trees, particularly when a significant portion of vegetation remains (30-50% WHI). Therefore, our results indicate that these combined management practices (i.e., plantation and harvesting intensities) could remain effective in the context of a warming future scenario.

AB  - Objective: We sought to assess the effects of Common Carp Cyprinus carpio and Bigmouth Buffalo Ictiobus cyprinellus incentivized commercial harvest on seasonal survival from 2017 to 2021 and several additional demographic indices at 5-, 10-, and 20-year timescales. Methods: We implemented a live-dead capture-mark-recapture study from 2017 to 2021 for Common Carp and Bigmouth Buffalo across seven natural, shallow lakes of northwestern Iowa to estimate annual recapture rates and survival related to estimated exploitation. We then compared Common Carp and Bigmouth Buffalo size distribution, condition, growth rate and maximum length, length at age 3, maximum observed age, and catch per unit effort to long-term harvest at 5-, 10-, and 20-year timescales. Results: Common Carp and Bigmouth Buffalo summer survival was higher than winter survival that declined with increasing harvest after exploitation reached 15%; Common Carp and Bigmouth Buffalo relative abundance declined and Common Carp size structure increased, whereas Bigmouth Buffalo growth rates decreased, as harvest increased over 5-, 10-, and 20-year timescales. Conclusions: While commercial harvest may represent additive mortality in short timescales and reduce relative abundance, Common Carp and Bigmouth Buffalo populations showed resiliency in other demographic metrics of growth, age distribution, condition, and recruitment. Incentivized harvest did not achieve goals of reducing Common Carp and Bigmouth Buffalo abundance, and low estimated exploitation (i.e., <10%) led to compensatory mortality in both species. Consequently, higher harvest and supplemental population management is likely necessary to control Common Carp and Bigmouth Buffalo populations.

AB  - Targeted grazing to control undesirable plant species is increasingly of interest across a diversity of ecosystems, particularly as an alternative or complement to widely used herbicides. However, there are limited comprehensive evaluations of targeted grazing that evaluate both invasive species management effectiveness and potential negative effects on the ecosystem. Phragmites australis, a tall-statured, dense perennial invasive grass from Eurasia, is a pervasive problem in wetlands across the North American continent. As with many invasive species where management has historically relied on herbicides and resistance is a growing concern, land managers seek viable alternatives that have minimal negative ecosystem impacts. Grazing has been used for millennia to manage native Phragmites in Europe. Similarly, in its invasive range within North America, small-scale studies suggest Phragmites may be suppressed by grazers. Yet, the effectiveness of grazing at large scales and its effects on broader ecosystem properties remain largely unknown. We evaluated the influence of targeted grazing on vegetation, soil nutrients, and water nutrients over two years in large plots (similar to 300x the size of previous studies). We also tested the effects of mowing, a treatment that can be used to facilitate grazer access to large, dense Phragmites stands. In line with our predictions, we found that cattle grazing effectively suppressed invasive Phragmites over two years. Mowing reduced litter, and moderately reduced standing dead Phragmites, both of which suppress native plant germination in this system. However, these reductions in Phragmites were not accompanied by indications of native plant community recovery, as we had optimistically predicted. Despite the potential for grazing to reduce nutrient sequestration by plants and fertilize soils, we were surprised to find no clear negative effects of grazing on nutrient mobilization to groundwater or floodwater. Taken together, our findings indicate that targeted grazing, when implemented at broad scales over short time frames, is effective at achieving invasive plant management goals without sizable nutrient impacts. However, additional steps will be needed to achieve the restoration of diverse, robust native plant communities.

AB  - Sand quarries that are used occasionally and not subjected to rehabilitation are important biodiversity banks in both anthropogenic and semi-natural landscapes. However, their value for biodiversity preservation can change due to dynamic successional processes. We determined the responses of three Aculeata guilds: herbivores (Apiformes), predators (Crabronidae, Sphecidae), and parasitic species (Apiformes, Chrysididae, Crabronidae) to successional transformations in 32 sand quarries, along a successional chronosequence covering 15 years of spontaneous regenera-tion, classified into three stages (early, middle and late succession). Responses to succession differed depending on the trophic guild of the Aculeata. Values of community characteristics for herbivores and parasitic species were the highest in the middle stages of succession, whereas for predators, they did not change. The arrival of new species significantly affected the community structure of all three Aculeata guilds, although dominance structure did not change. However, only for predators, turnover was higher in the later successional stages. This was manifested by a rapid accumulation of new and rare species. In contrast, for parasitic species the species turnover decreased, and in the case of herbivores, it remained constant throughout the successional stages. Predators were also characterized by the highest number of species, present at all successional stages. We emphasize that the various patterns of species turnover can influence the conservation value of sand quarries assessed as numbers of rare and/or threatened species as well as other community characteristics and structure. The collected information will allow a more deliberate selection of protective measures to facilitate the preservation of these valuable habitats.

AB  - ContextHuman activities, particularly intensive agriculture, have caused significant environmental degradation, reduced ecosystem diversity, and increased vulnerability to global change. Recent international policies, such as the Global Biodiversity Framework's 30 x 30 target, advocate for nature-based solutions (NbS) such as ecological restoration to address these impacts. In agricultural landscapes, however, there are concerns that restoration may impact food production.ObjectivesWe investigated how forest restoration, as an NbS, changes the supply of ecosystem services (ES), including potential trade offs with agricultural output. Using the Mont & eacute;r & eacute;gie region of Qu & eacute;bec (southeastern Canada) as a case study, we assessed the influence of restoration extent, spatial configuration, and the original agricultural site conditions on the ES outcomes.MethodsWe modeled ES outcomes for seven ES (crop production, maple syrup production, deer hunting, water quality, carbon storage, pollination, and outdoor recreation) under nine scenarios, which varied by total amount of the landscape restored (3.3%, 10.8%, 30%) and initial conditions of the agricultural fields restored (randomly selected, degraded agricultural field, or abandoned agricultural field).ResultsOur findings indicate that increasing the amount of land restored enhances provision of most ES, though improvement varied by service. The initial condition of restored sites minimally influences ES outcomes. However, the spatial pattern of restoration plays a significant role in determining ES delivery, as restored sites enhance most ES through spillover effects up to 500 m.ConclusionThis study underscores the potential for combining landscape ecology approaches and ES tools to forecast NbS outcomes and inform landscape planning.

We investigated variations in the vegetative and reproductive traits, demography, habitat structure (tree richness), and pre-dispersal seed predation in the palm Syagrus coronata (Martius) Beccari (Arecaceae) by Pachymerus nucleorum (Fabricius) (Bruchinae) in habitats with different management intensities in the Brazilian semiarid region. In addition, we also assessed whether these plant variables affect seed predation. The palm tree known as licuri is widely used in extractivism and its cutting is prohibited by the Brazilian law. It is common to find isolated individuals in landscapes managed for agriculture and pasture. We predicted that more homogeneous microhabitats (with lower diversity of woody plants and higher density of licuri) with little fruiting synchrony would have higher levels of seed predation. Moreover, at the plant level, licuri individuals whose bunch are taller from the ground and with a larger number of fruits would sustain a lower proportion of pre-dispersal seed predation. The study was carried out in 13 sites, distributed between managed (pasture) and natural (Caatinga vegetation) habitats. Overall, 3,120 fruits were assessed, out of which 25.6% were preyed by P. nucleorum. We found that habitats with natural vegetation supported a higher density of adult licuri individuals and richness of woody plants, lower licuri fruiting synchrony, and greater seed predation. In addition, seed predation was positively affected by both total licuri abundance and tree richness, and negatively by the abundance of licuri fruiting at a micro-habitat level. This palm has unseasonal fruiting throughout all months of the year, and we suggested that the fruit harvest could be concentrated in the months of fruiting peak and the managed areas. Such measures could result in the harvest of healthier fruits by extractive populations and in seeds free from predation for use in habitat restoration through direct seeding.

AB  - Rangelands are important fodder for livestock and wildlife, and provide a range of ecosystem services to the environment. Foliar nutrients such as nitrogen, carbon, and plant pigments such as chlorophyll can be used as indicators of rangeland stress, and play a vital role in determining their health and productivity. The C:N ratio is a key factor in regulating nutrient utilization efficiency and productivity in plants. Understanding the C:N ratio in rangelands could therefore help herders understand the nutrient limitations, and herbivores distribution to facilitate strategic grazing plans and management. Therefore, there is a need for spatially accurate and up-to-date information on C:N ratio to understand and monitor rangeland health for proactive rangeland management. Remote sensing approaches are spatially explicit, cost-effective, and efficient in monitoring foliar nutrient ratio in rangelands. Whereas, the new generation and advanced Sentinel 2 multispectral sensor has the potential to monitor vegetation health, the strength of its spectral settings in relation to predicting the C:N ratio in rangelands remains largely unexplored. Advanced and freely available Sentinel 2 multispectral sensor (MSI) with specialized red edge bands offer unprecedented opportunities in mapping and monitoring rangeland nutrients. Hence, this study examined the prospect of combined Sentinel-2 (MSI) spectral bands and vegetation indices, and the random forest algorithm to map the C: N ratio within a rangeland. To determine the C:N ratio distribution, the Random Forest and the Boruta variable selection were employed to assess the performance of the combined Sentinel 2 spectral bands and vegetation indices models. Results show an estimated accuracy R2 of 81 and 74, with RMSE of 2.38 and 2.68 for calibration and validation datasets of the C:N ratio model established by combining the spectral bands and vegetation indices. The random forest variable selection model indicates that the red edge bands, and near-infrared were the most valuable in predicting the C:N ratio. The red edge and near-infrared (Inverted Red-edge Chlorophyll Index) and near-infrared and red band (Enhanced Vegetation Index) vegetation indices were important predictor variables for estimating the C:N ratio. This study demonstrates the prospects and value of mapping the geographic distribution of the C:N ratio in rangelands using high spatial resolution Sentinel 2 MSI. This information will not only help determine nutrient deficiencies in rangelands but will also provide informed recommendation in mitigating landscape degeneration to allow for rangeland regeneration.

AB  - Artificial light at night (ALAN) is an increasingly intensified disturbance in urban ecosystems, but its effects on ground-dwelling arthropods' biodiversity and their biotic interactions remain unclear. Here, we evaluated the response of ground-dwelling arthropods and leaf herbivory of two common street tree species ( Styphnolobium japonicum (L.) Schott and Fraxinus pennsylvanica ) to ALAN in the urban areas of Beijing, China. We found that 1) ALAN was associated with increased ants' activity in areas dominated by F. pennsylvanica , but there were no detectable effects on beetles and spiders. 2) Ground-dwelling arthropods and their interactions with ALAN were linked to variations in leaf herbivory in both two tree species. These results suggested that the response of ground-dwelling arthropods to ALAN is species-specific and that high levels of ALAN can affect top-down ecological processes in arthropods. The findings confirmed that the ALAN-caused effects on ground-dwelling arthropods can lead to cascading effects on some key ecological effects in urban ecosystems.

TI  - Osteophagia of sea turtle bones by white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) in Santa Rosa National Park, northwestern Costa Rica
T2  - NEOTROPICAL BIOLOGY AND CONSERVATION
LA  - English
AB  - Herbivores obtain nutrients mostly from the vegetation they consume, but may obtain additional minerals during periods of nutritional stress by consuming bones (osteophagia), a behavioral strategy that has been reported for many wild ungulate species, including the white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus). Here we document multiple records (n = 183 camera-trap records) of osteophagia by white-tailed deer chewing sea turtle remains (resulting from jaguar [Panthera onca] predation) near a nesting beach in Santa Rosa National Park, Costa Rica during January-September 2017. Females with fawns, males with hard and velvet-covered antlers, and non-spotted fawns reached a peak of sea turtle bone consumption during June to August. We hypothesize that seasonality, sex, age, and individual growth stage influence the frequency of osteophagy as a strategy to cope with environmental changes and food resource scarcity. Finally, these observations highlight the role of an apex predator as indirectly influencing rare but important ecological processes.

AB  - Caribou are the most abundant large terrestrial mammals in Arctic Alaska, providing important cultural and subsistence resource values for local communities. As oil and gas development expands across the Arctic Coastal Plain of northern Alaska, understanding the potential impacts on caribou and improving associated mitigation measures are a crucial focus of applied research. One consistently observed impact in northern Alaska is displacement of maternal caribou within 2 ??? 5 km of active oilfield roads and gravel pads for a period of 2 ??? 3 weeks during and immediately after calving. A potential mitigation measure to address calving displacement is convoying of traffic to reduce traffic frequency and vehicle-related disturbance on roads in calving areas. We conducted frequent road and aerial surveys of caribou near two oilfield roads, one with convoying and one without, over a 3-year period during the precalving, calving, and postcalving periods to evaluate the effectiveness of traffic convoying. Road surveys indicated that caribou closer to the roads and groups with calves exhibited more frequent and stronger behavioural reactions in response to traffic, and that moderate or strong reactions to traffic, such as standing up and walking or running away, were more frequent near the road with convoying than near the road with unlimited traffic. Aerial survey results indicated some avoidance of areas up to at least 2 km from the road with convoying and 4 km from the road without convoying by caribou groups with calves. This relationship was present even after adjusting for other factors affecting distribution. This avoidance of roads by maternal caribou was limited to the calving period and was not evident during the precalving or postcalving periods. In addition, an inactive elevated terrestrial drilling platform was present on the calving grounds during one year, but we found no evidence of caribou avoidance of that structure during calving at our scale of analysis.

AB  - Urban green spaces are composed of native and exotic plant species, and they vary in their vegetation characteristics. In urban areas, vegetation structure is one of the key factors for birds recognizing their environment. The current study was carried out in the smaller urban green spaces in the two adjacent cities in the Pune metropolitan region (PMR), Pune and Pimpri-Chinchwad. The relationship between woody plants and birds was studied in the 20 smaller urban green spaces. Overall 69 woody plant species and 44 species of birds were listed in the sampling sites. Common Myna was the dominant bird species, followed by Purple Sunbird and Oriental White-eye. Regression analysis showed a significant positive relationship between the richness and diversity of woody plants and birds. It was observed that a higher density of exotic woody plants reduces the richness of birds; mainly specialist birds such as insectivores, herbivores and predators. However, it was noted that native woody species support more diverse birds than exotic woody species; the richness of specialist birds was increased with an increase in the richness of native woody plants. It was found that vegetation composition is the prime factor for birds in habitat selection, irrespective of the size and location of urban green space. We recommend native plants over exotic plants for landscaping in the urban environment. This study can help to improve the health of urban green spaces through scientific management and enhance the public understanding of urban vegetation.

AB  - The ecology and predator-prey dynamics of large felids in the tropics have largely been studied in natural systems where wild ungulates constitute the majority of the prey base. However, in tropical countries where communities are primarily agrarian, the high density of domestic animals in human-dominated landscapes can be a potential prey source for large carnivores. We demonstrate almost complete dependence of the Vulnerable leopard Panthera pardus fusca in the Jhalana Reserve Forest in Jaipur, north-west India on domestic animals as prey. We analysed 132 leopard scats collected during the dry season of November 2017-April 2018. Domestic animals comprised the majority of the leopards' prey (89.5% frequency of occurrence): dogs Canis lupus familiaris (44%), cats Felis catus (13%), goats Capra aegagrus hircus (16%) and cattle Bos taurus (15%). Wild species, which occurred in the leopards' diet at a relatively low frequency, were rodents, the hare Lepus nigricollis, small Indian civet Viverricula indica, rhesus macaque Macaca mulatta, northern plains grey langur Semnopithecus entellus and mongoose Herpestes edwardsii. Diet is also a function of availability of potential prey, but no data are available on the density of the leopard's wild prey species in Jhalana Reserve Forest. Nevertheless, our results suggest that abundance of domestic prey around Jhalana Reserve Forest sustains the c. 25 known leopards. We conclude that these leopards, by preying on feral dogs in an urban environment, could be considered as suppliers of a service to the human population amongst whom they thrive, although this potentially exposes the leopards to the canine distemper virus.

AB  - Background The Biebrza Valley is one of the largest complexes of wetlands (floodplain and percolation mire) and conservation sites in Central Europe. Local communities have managed the area extensively for subsistence and farming purposes for centuries; nonetheless, since the 1960s, hand mowing and livestock grazing have been gradually ceasing due to the intensification of farming, and wetlands have undergone natural succession. Currently, the protection of this vast ecosystem is challenging. Despite its remarkable cultural origin, the complexity of the traditional practices and knowledge of local people have never been studied comprehensively. Therefore, we found it urgent to explore if traditional ecological knowledge that could be used in conservation management of the area still exists among the local community. Methods We interviewed 42 inhabitants of seven villages located in the Lower Basin of the Biebrza Valley (NE-Poland) in the consecutive years 2018-2020. We applied semi-structured, repeated interviews with farmers (aged 29-89), each lasting several hours. By using different ethnoecological methods (visual stimuli, walks in wetlands, co-mapping of the area), we explored traditional knowledge on the plants, landscape and traditional management of wetlands. Results Farmers from the oldest generation, who used to manage wetlands with scythes, shared the deepest ecological knowledge. Local people divided wetlands into zones differentiated by vegetation type and hay quality. Depending on plant composition, people managed wetlands under a mixed regime: mowing once or twice a year during periods that ensured good hay quality and pasturing various livestock: cattle, horses, sheep, pigs and fowl. We identified at least 50 plant ethnospecies, which were described exhaustively by their habitat, morphological features, and mowing and grazing value. Conclusions The local community in the Biebrza Valley shared a deep traditional ecological knowledge and had a good memory of traditional farming practices. Research confirmed the unquestionable cultural origin of the local ecosystem, therefore in conservation endeavours the area should be treated first and foremost as a cultural landscape. The documented exceptional local perception of the wetland landscape, elements of traditional knowledge and complex farming practices should be considered for inclusion into conservation management, and cooperation with the local community should also be taken into account.

AB  - Cervid roadkill, including moose, red deer and roe deer, can pose a risk to drivers and are frequently registered. However, the roadkill influence on overall cervid populations is not fully known, especially by roadkill that are not officially registered. The aim of this study was to assess the impact of cervid roadkill on population abundance, evaluating (i) the proportion of ungulate-vehicle collisions not registered by official bodies, (ii) the number of roadkill in relation to hunted animals and (iii) the proportion of roadkill that occurs in forest habitat. The number of unreported roadkill was calculated based on a roadkill index assessed during 3815 registration sessions on main and national roads in Lithuania from 2002-2022. During this period, 373 moose, 712 red deer and 9179 roe deer roadkill were unreported, correlating to 13.8%, 95.8% and 31.1% of those registered by the Traffic Supervision Service. In conclusion, 39.5%, 17.5% and 20.1% of roadkill were registered on roads through forests. Moose roadkill amounted to a figure corresponding to 10% of those hunted, with the same figure for red deer being 1.8%, neither adding much mortality. At 16.5%-16.6%, the figure for roe deer might be important.

AB  - Functional traits of herbivorous mammals provide tools for reconstructing past environments. In 1952, Bj & ouml;rn Kurt & eacute;n used distribution of ecomorphological features in fossil herbivorous mammal communities from Late Miocene "Hipparion faunas" of Eurasia to characterize their paleoenvironments as "steppe", "forest" and "mixed" types. We tested Kurt & eacute;n's results with a revised set of ecometric methods. We used dental ecometric estimates of mean annual temperature and precipitation, net primary productivity, and normalized difference vegetation index to compare Miocene localities with modern biomes, and dental mesowear to estimate woody and grass cover in the paleoenvironments. Our results agree with Kurt & eacute;n's, indicating steppe-edge environments in northern China, wooded paleoenvironments in Pikermi, Greece, and central Europe, and open woodland-grassland environment in Maragheh, Iran. Our analyses indicate the presence of wooded grassland savanna in Lothagam and tropical forest in Lukeino in East Africa, further demonstrating paleoenvironmental variation and ecological diversity within later Late Miocene "Hipparion faunas".

AB  - Small mustelids such as the American marten (Martes americana) and short-tailed weasel (Mustela erminea) are important furbearers in temperate and boreal forests and are negatively affected by clearcutting. A major prey species, the southern red-backed vole (Myodes gapperi), also disappears from clearcuts and does not return to abundance levels of uncut forest for many decades. We tested the hypotheses (H) that on newly clearcut sites, (H-1) the presence of small mustelids, (H-2) abundance, species richness, and species diversity of the forest-floor small mammal community, and (H-3) reproduction of the major species: M. gapperi and the deer mouse (Peromyscus maniculatus), would be greater on sites with combined retention treatments of woody debris piles, riparian, and green-tree retention than on sites with no retention. A fourth hypothesis (H-4) predicted that the above response variables on sites with combined structural retention would be comparable to or higher than those in uncut old-growth forest. Mustelid presence and populations of forest-floor small mammals were sampled on five replicated (n = 4) treatment sites from 2017 to 2020 in south-central British Columbia, Canada.
   Mean presence (index of activity patterns) of mustelids was statistically similar among sites but in the combined treatments was 1.4 to 2.9 times higher than that in the dispersed (no retention) and uncut forest sites and was likely biologically important. Mustelid presence was particularly evident in the debris piles and riparian sites. Mean abundance of M. gapperi was 11.1 to 16.6 times higher in the combined retention and uncut forest sites than the dispersed sites. Mean abundance of P. maniculatus was higher in the dispersed than uncut forest, but similar in the combined retention to these treatments. Mean total abundance, species richness, and species diversity of eight small mammal species were all higher (1.3 to 1.6 times) in the combined retention sites than the dispersed and uncut forest sites. Although not formally significant (P = 0.08), results for mustelid presence tended to support H-1 that these small carnivores would occur more frequently on sites with combined structural treatments than the dispersed and uncut forest sites. The overall high total numbers (and species richness and diversity) of small mammal prey species supported H-2 that abundance would be greater on sites with the combined retention than on the dispersed sites with no retention. Reproduction and survival followed the pattern of abundance for the major species, and hence H-3 was supported. Higher mean total abundance in combined retention sites than in uncut forest supported H-4 in 2017-2018 but not in 2019-2020 when an influx of generalist species increased total abundance in the dispersed sites. This study is the first to measure the responses of small mustelids and small mammal prey species to combined structural retention. One or more of these retention treatments is highly recommended during most harvesting regimes in these forests.

AB  - For many mammal species, converting dung density into population density requires accurate estimates of defaecation rate and dung survival time. The latter parameter probably varies seasonally. In Nki National Park, south-east Cameroon, we monitored 216 dung piles of the blue duiker Philantomba monticola and 373 of the red duiker group (Cephalophus spp.), major game animals in Central Africa, and estimated dung survival time across seasons. Mean survival time was 6.83 days in the major dry season and 1.21-1.81 in other seasons for the blue duiker, and 7.37 and 1.53-4.05 for red duikers, lower than the values conventionally used for density estimations in Central Africa (i.e. 18 days for the blue duiker and 21 days for red duikers). Overall, beetles removed half of the dung within 1 day of deposition. However, the proportion of dung piles that beetles removed was significantly lower in the major dry season, and other dung piles remained longer until they disappeared as a result of other factors. As shorter dung survival time results in higher estimates of population density, our findings imply that in forests with intense beetle activity, duiker densities are higher than those based on the conventional values of dung survival time. Duiker densities and dung survival time should be estimated simultaneously. To minimize the bias introduced by rapid removal of fresh dung by beetles, only fresh dung (< 3 hours old) should be monitored when estimating mean dung survival time.

AB  - Phenological shifts due to changing climate are often highly species and context specific. Land-use practices such as mowing or grazing directly affect the phenology of grassland species, but it is unclear if plants are similarly affected by climate change in differently managed grassland systems such as meadows and pastures. Functional traits have a high potential to explain phenological shifts and might help to understand species-specific and land-use-specific phenological responses to changes in climate. In the large-scale field experiment Global Change Experimental Facility (GCEF), we monitored the first flowering day, last flowering day, flowering duration, and day of peak flowering, of 17 herbaceous grassland species under ambient and future climate conditions, comparing meadows and pastures. Both climate and land use impacted the flowering phenology of plant species in species-specific ways. We did not find evidence for interacting effects of climate and land-use type on plant phenology. However, the data indicate that microclimatic and microsite conditions on meadows and pastures were differently affected by future climate, making differential effects on meadows and pastures likely. Functional traits, including the phenological niche and grassland utilization indicator values, explained species-specific phenological climate responses. Late flowering species and species with a low mowing tolerance advanced their flowering more strongly under future climate. Long flowering species and species following an acquisitive strategy (high specific leaf area, high mowing tolerance, and high forage value) advanced their flowering end more strongly and thus more strongly shortened their flowering under future climate. We associated these trait-response relationships primarily with a phenological drought escape during summer. Our results provide novel insights on how climate and land use impact the flowering phenology of grassland species and we highlight the role of functional traits in mediating phenological responses to climate.
   We investigated how future climate and land-use type (i.e. mowing vs. grazing) individually and interactively affect the flowering phenology of grassland plant species in a large-scale field experiment. Both, climate and land use impacted the flowering phenology of plant species in species-specific ways. Functional traits related to the growth strategy and the phenological niche explained species-specific phenological climate responses.image

AB  - Diet selectivity by domestic herbivores controls plant community structure and dynamics and may induce rangeland degradation, particularly in drylands. However, management decisions frequently ignore herbivore selectivity. Here, we studied how grass morphology controls sheep selectivity for individual plants, and how this selectivity interacts with grazing intensity to determine population plant-size distributions and the forage supply.In Patagonian steppes, we manipulated the plant morphology (size and standing-dead proportion) of three dominant grass species differentially preferred by sheep for 4 years. Then, we evaluated how these morphological alterations affected intra- and inter-specific preference patterns. We also evaluated how grazing intensity (ungrazed, moderate grazing and intensive grazing) affected the plant-size distribution of the three species, the forage supply, and its accessibility.For the highly preferred species, herbivores selected plants that were either naturally or experimentally short, with low proportion of standing-dead biomass. In contrast, morphological changes did not alter the within-species selectivity of the least preferred species.Grazing intensity strongly changed the population plant-size distribution of preferred species in ways that resembled the experimental manipulations of morphology. Moderate grazing showed the greatest morphological heterogeneity among individuals. When integrating the green biomass of forage species' individuals at ecosystem level, we found that the forage supply was the highest in ungrazed sites and decreased as grazing intensity increased. However, considering the dissuading effect of the standing-dead proportion of plants, the accessible forage was the highest under moderate grazing.Synthesis and applications. Our findings (i) showed that, within preferred species, sheep selectivity at individual-plant level is controlled by morphological characteristics that determine accessibility to green high-quality biomass. This effect was as important as that of species identity; (ii) empirically proved plant-animal positive feedback at individual level; and (iii) revealed how the individual-plant selectivity scales-up at population level and controls the forage supply, but also its accessibility. Our complementary approach generates critical knowledge for developing management practices to control key forage species defoliation and to adjust the grazing pressure to the offer of accessible forage, avoiding the common carrying capacity overestimation. These aspects are essential for sustainable production in grazed drylands.

AB  - Previous research conducted in central-east region of Argentina recorded potential orthohantavirus host rodents in diverse environments, but no research has focused particularly on islands, the environments that present the greatest risk to humans. For this reason, the aims of this research were to determine the orthohantavirus host in the rodent community focused on islands of Parana River Delta, central-east region of Argentina, to identify temporal and spatial factors associated with orthohantavirus prevalence variations, to compare the functional traits of seropositive and seronegative rodents, and to explore the association between orthohantavirus prevalence and rodent community characteristics between August 2014 and May 2018. With a trapping effort of 14,600 trap-nights, a total of 348 sigmodontine rodent specimens belonging to seven species were captured 361 times. The overall antibody prevalence was 4.9%. Particularly, 14.9% of Oligoryzomys flavescens and 1.5% of Oxymycterus rufus, mainly reproductively active adult males, had antibodies against orthohantavirus. Even though O. flavescens inhabit all islands, our results suggest spatial heterogeneity in the viral distribution, with two months after periods of low temperature presenting increases in seroprevalence. This could be a response to the increased proportion of adults present in the rodent population. In addition, an association was found between the high seroprevalence and the diversity of the rodent assemblage. We also found 1.5% of O. rufus exposed to orthohantavirus, which shows us that further investigation of the ecology of the virus is needed to answer whether this species act as a spillover or a new competent host.

AB  - Neotropical freshwater habitats are particularly sensitive to degradation by human activity. Piscivorous semi-aquatic freshwater megafauna inhabit both the terrestrial and aquatic mediums and thus may be good indicators of wetland habitat quality. However, the drivers of their space use at the terrestrial and aquatic landscape levels are not well understood. We studied the spatial behavior and habitat use of giant otters in Madre de Dios, Peru, inhabiting areas with variable levels of protection. We combined unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) and satellite images to develop different terrestrial and water-associated land cover variables. We tested the influence of these predictors on giant otter habitat use at multiple spatial scales, comparing used and available locations. Giant otters favored bank areas with dense forest canopy cover. In the aquatic medium, giant otters showed positive selection for open water and fallen logs and avoided floating vegetation. These findings may be explained by preference for optimal fish habitat to maximize foraging yield and bank areas that provide more cover from predators and higher quality denning locations. Variables developed from UAV images outperformed satellite-derived variables. Despite recent signs of deforestation in lake banks in unprotected areas, spatial model predictions indicated that unprotected oxbow lakes did not differ in their habitat suitability from protected freshwater habitats. Management implications of our findings include identification of factors driving habitat suitability to guide policy and decisions regarding protection or restoration of oxbow lake ecosystems to support giant otter populations. In addition, we demonstrate that UAVs have value in complementing satellite-derived images and providing a cost-effective methodology to assess habitat quality for semi-aquatic species at the land-water interface.

AB  - The sustainable use of wildlife is foundational to the success of the North American model of wildlife conservation. Harvest management often is shaped through both species biology and public desires. The long timespan it takes males of most ungulate species to reach peak weapon size has created a situation in harvest management in which harvest strategies cannot prioritize both generous hunter opportunity and opportunities to pursue large-weaponed males; therefore, current harvest paradigms prioritize one at the expense of the other. In contrast to other species, pronghorn (Antilocapra americana) attain the majority of their peak horn size early in life. The rapid development of horns relative to their age may allow for liberal harvest without sacrificing the opportunity for hunters to harvest males with large horns. We evaluated the influence of sex ratios and average age of harvested males on the average horn size of harvested male pronghorn from 2019 to 2022 in 9 hunt areas in Wyoming, USA. Although mean age of harvested males was negatively affected by rate of harvest, increases in mean age at harvest led to only slight increases in mean horn size (i.e., a 1-year increase in mean age increased mean horn size by 2.1 cm [similar to 1 inch]). The proportion of the harvest composed of large-horned males was not influenced by mean age of harvest or sex ratio of the population. Based on simulated populations, increasing harvest led to an increase in the number of large-weaponed pronghorn in the harvest-a relationship that existed for bighorn sheep (Ovis canadensis) and elk (Cervus canadensis) but only at low to moderate rates of harvest. The comparatively young age that pronghorn attain near-peak horn size alleviates what is otherwise a tradeoff between hunter opportunity and managing for large horn size that is evident in management of other ungulate species. Though rarely a reality in management for large ungulates, for pronghorn, liberal harvest may be possible while still providing opportunity to harvest males with large horns.

AB  - Dominant plants and insects both structure plant communities and determine key ecosystem functions. However, dominant plants and insects can have opposing effects on plant community structure and ecosystem function. Critically, few studies have assessed the combined effects of these two drivers of plant community structure and ecosystem function. In this study, we factorially manipulated the presence of the dominant plant species Solidago canadensis (Canada goldenrod) and insects in an old field to quantify their independent and interactive effects on the plant community. Overall, insect presence mediated the effects of S. canadensis removal on plant biomass and richness. Total plant biomass was similar to 32% lower following S. canadensis removal only when insects were present. In contrast, subdominant plant biomass was similar to 75% higher following S. canadensis removal, but only when insects were reduced. Subdominant species richness was similar to 37% higher following S. canadensis removal when insects were present, although the abundance of most subdominant species did not vary systematically with S. canadensis removal or insect reduction. Light availability was similar to 49% higher following S. canadensis removal, with no effect of insect presence on light availability. Our results emphasize the interactive role of dominant plants and insects in determining the diversity and biomass of plant communities.

AB  - The identification of patterns and mechanisms of wildfire effects on biodiversity is of significant conservation importance. The research was conducted in a zone of mixed and broad-leaved forests. Carabid beetles were studied in eight sample plots that varied in relation to the 2010 and 2021 fires through 2022 and 2023. A total of 8667 specimens of 108 species of carabid beetles were counted. In 2022, plots were clearly differentiated by the pyrogenic disturbance in terms of the carabid species structure. As the pyrogenic disturbance increases, the total abundance of brachypterous as well as herbivore species decreases sharply. The carabids that were the most prevalent in an undisturbed forest (Carabus arcensis, Carabus glabratus, Pterostichus oblongopunctatus, and Amara brunnea) demonstrated sensitivity to the 2010 fire. The pyrophilous species Pterostichus quadrifoveolatus and Sericoda quadripunctata were attracted to a moderately burned area. Poecilus lepidus is confined to areas burned in 2010 and not affected by the 2021 fire. A moderately burned area was characterized by increased abundance and number of species. In 2023, the degree of similarity of carabid populations between sample plots did not generally increase, but only the 2010 fire was identified as a significant factor in population differentiation. The abundance of carabids decreased in a moderately burned area and an unburned area near the fire edge. The abundance and number of species increased markedly in heavily burned areas due to open habitat species, while the abundance of Carabus arcensis and Amara brunnea decreased in unburned areas. Forest megafires threaten the biodiversity of carabid beetles in pine and secondary forests.

AB  - Herbivorous fish can mediate spatial competition between algae and corals, which is crucial for coral ecosystems. However, in areas with limited coral coverage like the Mexican tropical Pacific (MTP), this dynamic is not fully understood. This study, using a functional trait approach and ordination analysis, explores whether herbivorous reef fish assemblage influences the benthic habitat components or if physicochemical factors define the habitat variability in the MTP's Cleofas and Marietas insular systems. We analyzed if this relationship persisted across systems and over time, and identified species traits tied to habitat variability. Island comparison analyses between Cleofas and Marietas reveal that both herbivorous reef fish and physicochemical variables shape the habitat. Cleofas had larger mobile herbivorous fish that formed groups related mostly to macroalgae cover. In contrast, temporal analysis of Marietas shows that the habitat is primarily shaped by physicochemical variables with herbivorous fish being mainly small farmer species related to branching corals. Notably, these closely situated insular systems present varied ecosystem mediators, influenced by diverse drivers including fish traits and environmental factors. This study underscores the potential of employing a framework of ecological species traits combined with ordination methods to unravel the distinct site dynamics that contribute to the persistence of coral ecosystems within the MTP.

AB  - Simple Summary: The Helan Mountains, located at the interface between China's arid and semi-arid zones, form a natural dividing line in the heart of the desert. Often described as a "desert oasis", this region functions as an ecological island with a uniquely distinctive geographical setting, making it a focal point for contemporary ecological research. The Alashan wapiti (Cervus canadensis alashanicus), an isolated population in this area, has become a key conservation concern for the Chinese government. Our multi-scale habitat assessments identified bare land as the principal limiting factor for the availability of suitable habitats for the species. Consequently, the protection and restoration of Alashan wapiti habitats are of critical importance, particularly in enhancing the quality of existing habitats. Our findings provide valuable scientific insights to support future conservation and management efforts in the Helan Mountains. The Helan Mountains, situated in the heart of the desert, act as a dividing line between China's arid and semi-arid zones. Often referred to as a "desert oasis", they create an ecological island with a uniquely distinctive geographical location, making this area a focal point of contemporary research. Ungulates play a critical role in this ecosystem. The Alashan wapiti (Cervus canadensis alashanicus), an isolated population of China's smallest wapiti (Cervus canadensis) subspecies, is found exclusively within the Helan Mountains Nature Reserve. The conservation of this isolated population is fraught with challenges, particularly during winter, the harshest season for northern ungulates. Winter habitats are crucial for ensuring population stability. Therefore, we used certain methods, such as factor screening and model parameter optimization to assess habitat suitability using multi-scale species distribution models. The optimized results show that suitable habitats overlap with areas of high vegetation coverage in the Helan Mountains, covering just 588.32 km(2), which is less than a quarter of the reserve's total area. The bare land area and winter NDVI are the two primary factors influencing habitat suitability, with other factors having minimal impact, underscoring the critical importance of food resources for the Alashan wapiti. The limited availability of these resources poses significant conservation challenges. Our findings provide a more precise foundation for targeted habitat protection and restoration efforts. We recommend enhancing the protection and restoration of food resources, effectively conserving vegetated areas, and preventing desertification.

AB  - Globally, grasslands are among the most degraded habitats, and within that category tallgrass prairies are especially threatened. To restore native species in tallgrass prairie, it is often necessary to concurrently remove exotic plant species while restoring the disturbance processes that many prairie taxa depend upon. Here, we coupled one herbicide application and seed mixture addition with tri-annual prescribed fire and annual cattle grazing to explore the consequences for floral resource (i.e., nectar-producing) plant communities and butterfly communities up to four years later. Each site was divided into three equally sized patches which were placed into either control, "spray-only", or "spray-and-seed" treatment groups. We quantified both floral resource plant and butterfly communities in the year prior to herbicide application and the four years following that treatment. In the four years post-treatment, we found that floral resource abundance, richness, and diversity increased over time but did not significantly vary among treatments. No response to treatment was observed in butterflies, but butterfly abundance decreased while richness was stable and diversity increased over time, which may indicate that the changes to floral resources at the patch scale supported more speciose and diverse butterfly communities at the site scale. Butterfly abundance decreasing over time could be an effect of baseline management or unrelated regional factors. Regardless of whether either treatment benefited butterflies, we find support for a one-time herbicide application changing the floral community in desirable ways and at least not harming butterflies.

AB  - We analyzed the variation of plant composition, forage production, and livestock diet across a broad stocking rate gradient on Eastern Hills rangelands of Uruguay. Our approach encompassed five ranches subjected to mixed sheep-cattle grazing and combined field surveys, microhistological fecal analysis, and remote sensing techniques. We hypothesized that selectivity would decrease as stocking rate increased. Vegetation data and fecal samples were obtained in 17 paddocks in 2008. To investigate the role of stocking rate on vegetation, we focused on dominant species and forage type cover. Diet composition was analyzed at forage type level. Annual net primary productivity was estimated for each paddock using the normalized difference vegetation index derived from the MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) sensor. We found a clear relationship between the variation in stocking rate and floristic and forage type composition, both suggesting a deterioration of grassland conservation status. Cool season grass cover varied from 25% to 5%, from low to high stocking rates. Dicot cover showed an opposite trend, with values around 15% in the low and moderate stocking levels and reaching 35% on high-stocked paddocks. Diet composition and diet overlap between herbivores also showed clear patterns of response to stocking rate. On the other hand, livestock selectivity interacted with herbivore type. While cattle showed the expected pattern, sheep did not decrease selectivity in winter as stocking rate increased. Contrary to expectations, annual net primary productivity was similar across the different stocking rate levels and the month of maximum productivity was generally March. Our study provides strong evidence of marked rangeland degradation; however, the lack of response in terms of ANPP and the ability of sheep to maintain selectivity under high stocking rates could help to explain the lack of responsiveness in the adoption of generalized stocking adjustments by the ranchers.

AB  - The rangelands of Crete island (Greece) are typical Mediterranean habitats under high risk of degradation due to long-term grazing and harsh climatic conditions. We explored the effect of abiotic (climatic conditions, altitude) and biotic factors (long-term grazing by small ruminants) on the floristic composition and diversity of selected lowland (Pyrathi, Faistos) and highland (Vroulidia, Nida) rangelands. In each rangeland, the ground cover was measured, and the floristic composition was calculated in terms of five functional groups: grasses, legumes, forbs, phrygana, and shrubs. The aridity index, species turnover, species richness, Shannon entropy, and Gini-Simpson index (with the latter two converted to the effective number of species) were calculated. Our results reveal that highlands are characterized by the highest aridity index (wetter conditions). Lowland rangelands, compared to highland, exhibited a higher percentage contribution of grasses, legumes, and forbs, while species turnover decreased along the altitudinal gradient. The Shannon entropy index was correlated (a) positively with Gini-Simpson and mean annual temperature and (b) negatively with mean annual precipitation, aridity index, and altitude. Moreover, the Gini-Simpson index correlated positively with mean annual temperature and negatively with altitude. Our results could help to understand the effects of grazing on rangeland dynamics and sustainability in semi-arid regions in the context of climatic change.

AB  - Restoration of anthropogenically altered habitats has often focused on management for umbrella species-vulnerable species whose conservation is thought to benefit co-occurring species. Woody plant encroachment is a form of habitat alteration occurring in grasslands and shrublands around the globe, driven by anthropogenic shifts in disturbance regimes. Conifer encroachment is a pervasive threat to historically widespread sagebrush communities, as trees outcompete sagebrush and can negatively affect sagebrush-obligate animal species. Degradation and loss of sagebrush plant communities in western North America have been associated with drastic declines in wildlife populations. The imperilled Greater Sage-Grouse is assumed to be an umbrella species for the sagebrush community, so habitat restoration, including removal of encroaching conifers, is commonly targeted towards sage-grouse. How this conservation action affects the demography of species other than sage-grouse is largely unknown. We quantified the demographic effects of landscape-level restoration of sagebrush communities through conifer removal on an assemblage of sagebrush-obligate, shrubland generalist and woodland-associated songbirds. We compared songbird density and reproduction between adjacent restored and uncut conifer-encroached sagebrush plots in southwest Montana. We found and monitored nests to record nest fate and number of offspring produced. We found demographic benefits for sagebrush-obligate species in restored areas. Sage Thrashers colonized restored areas. Brewer's Sparrow density was 39% higher and nest success was 63% higher in removal treatments, resulting in 119% higher fledgling production compared with uncut areas. The density of Vesper Sparrows, a shrubland generalist, was 308% higher and fledgling production was 660% higher in restored areas. Another shrubland generalist, the White-crowned Sparrow, experienced 55% lower density and 37% lower fledgling production in conifer removal areas. Two woodland-associated species, Chipping Sparrows and Dark-eyed Juncos, were nearly extirpated following conifer removal. A third woodland associate, the Green-tailed Towhee, experienced 57% lower density and 69% lower fledgling production in removal than non-removal areas. Synthesis and applications. Our study demonstrates the benefits of conifer removal for sagebrush-obligate species, while highlighting species that may be sensitive. Umbrella species management can benefit co-occurring species with similar habitat associations, but demographic analyses for all impacted species are essential for effective conservation.

AB  - Disturbance by small burrowing herbivores often has an impact on plant aboveground biomass of grassland because it makes grasslands into a mosaic of discrete vegetated surfaces and bare soil patches. This study focuses on the plateau pika (Ochotona curzoniae) to investigate the effect of the disturbance by a small burrowing herbivore on plant aboveground biomass through upscaling the quadrat scale to the plot scale across five sites. This study showed that the plateau pika disturbance reduced sedge biomass and increased forb biomass. In contrast, they did not affect plant community biomass, grass biomass and legume biomass at the quadrat scale across the five sites. At the plot scale, that is, when the bare soil patches with a lack of plants were considered, plateau pika disturbance induced lower aboveground biomass of the plant community, sedge and legumes, while it had no relationship with grass biomass and forb biomass. As the disturbance intensity increased, the aboveground biomass of the plant community and sedge decreased, whereas the grass biomass showed a hump-shaped trend. These results indicate that plateau pika disturbance might be not beneficial to alpine meadows given the aboveground biomass of the plant community at the plot scale. In contrast, the intermediate disturbance intensity improves the grazing quality of alpine meadows through the higher grass biomass. The findings of this study imply that the plot scale is better than the quadrat scale to investigate the influence of the disturbance by a small burrowing herbivore on the plant aboveground biomass, and that management of a small burrowing herbivore needs to consider its disturbance intensity.

AB  - The recent offshore oil discovery in the Guiana Shield is expected to bring about significant changes to the area, such as increased GDP per capita, infrastructure development, and urbanization. The potential impact on the wild meat trade depends on factors influencing its demand and provision. Through interviews and group discussions with trade chain stakeholders in all towns of Guyana, we evaluate wildmeat trade sector and explored predicted changes on it in 2033 with the prospects for short term oil-related development. The most traded species in Guyana included paca, white-lipped peccary, deer, tapir and capybara and a total of 38.46 % (5 out of 13) of the taxa being traded is classified as threatened of extinction. Regions with higher population size and GDP per capita, are the main trade hubs for wildmeat. Access to improved preservation methods (e.g. freezers) and motorized transportation options (eg.: boat with engines and vehicles) significantly influence higher volumes of wildmeat traded. The economic growth anticipated in Guyana is expected to boost population growth and, by the same time, wildmeat demand in urban areas. Concomitantly, with improved infrastructure and increased access to electricity, wildmeat provision will be facilitated across a wider catchment area. Based on the assumption that cultural patterns shaping wildmeat demand and environmental regulations will likely not change at the same rapid path as economic growth in the next ten years, we predict wildmeat trade volumes to increase to 10,280 tons/year by 2033. We identify three main opportunities to ensure a sustainable wildmeat sector in the context of the economic boom: First, the sector requires to be well regulated through a licensing and a quota system that can be adequately enforced. Second, efforts to curve demand on the Coast need to be strengthened based on well designed and culturally adapted behaviour change campaigns. Third, local communities and indigenous people need to be empowered to protect and conserve their territories and wildlife resources, in particular with the authority to exclude illegal hunters.

AB  - Parrotfishes are conspicuous herbivores, microvores, and detritivores in coral reef ecosystems, and the impacts of their feeding, particularly their capacity to expose reef carbonate, have received much attention. In many cases, parrotfish assemblages have been shown to control algal proliferation and promote the settlement of corals and crustose coralline algae (CCA). In extreme cases, high densities of parrotfishes may negatively affect net reef accretion through bioerosion and targeted coral predation. Most evidence describing the impacts of parrotfish foraging on benthic community structure is based upon correlations between benthic composition and parrotfish behavior or abundance, with much less known about process-based change of individual parrotfish bite scars through time. Here, we estimated parrotfish bite selectivity and determined the change in benthic composition within parrotfish bite scars relative to change in the overall reefscape using data collected over a 12-month duration from the fore reef habitat at Palmyra Atoll. We identified 2150 parrotfish bite scars which appeared most frequently on turf algae covered substrata but also on coral, CCA, and encrusting macroalgae. Of those bites taken on live coral, 96% of scars returned to live coral within 12 months. Notably, adult coral survivorship in bite scars was higher than at randomly sampled coral-covered locations not affected by parrotfish bites. The exposed substrate within bite scars was most commonly colonized by the dominant benthic functional group in the area immediately surrounding the scar. We found little evidence of coral recruitment to bite scars (1/2150); however, CCA growth on bites initially on turf algae increased from 18.4 to 32.9% across the two time intervals. Our results suggest that benthic areas affected by parrotfish bites were more likely to undergo a successional shift to a more calcified state relative to unaffected benthic areas, indicating that parrotfish grazing helps maintain highly calcified coral reef ecosystems.

AB  - The factors that drive fish communities on coral reefs are varied, complex, and often location specific. In the northern United States Virgin Islands, the large areas of mesophotic coral ecosystems across an insular shelf provide a multitude of gradients along which fish communities form. Using a stratified -random visual fish census, we collected comprehensive data on fish communities across a seascape scale. Fish density and diversity showed responses to depth and hard relief, with these factors occasionally interacting in ways that are species specific. Analysis of trophic groups showed that densities of all groups were positively associated with relief, but while herbivores and invertivores decreased with depth, planktivores and piscivores increased, and piscivores additionally showed an interaction. Some commercially important species occurred more frequently and in larger sizes on deeper reefs, suggesting that mesophotic reefs shelter more fisheries resources, although they are less commonly sampled in visual census programs. Understanding how fish communities change across the seascape informs patterns of ecosystem function, such as identifying areas of resilience and vulnerability. This dataset is a valuable contribution to more completely understanding the ecology and conservation of fishes in the western Atlantic.

AB  - Understanding climatic effect on wildlife is essential to prediction and management of climate change's impact on the ecosystem. The climatic effect can interact with other environmental factors. This study was aimed to determine effects of climate and altitude on Siberian roe deer Capreolus pygargus activity in temperate forests of South Korea. We conducted camera trapping to investigate roe deer's activity level from spring to fall. Logistic regressions were used to determine effects of diel period, temperature, rain, and altitude on the activity level. A negative relationship was noted between temperature and the activity level due to thermoregulatory costs. Roe deer activity exhibited nocturnal and crepuscular patterns during summer and the other seasons, respectively, possibly due to heat stress in summer. In addition, the effect of temperature differed between high- and low-altitude areas. In low-altitude areas, temperature affected negatively the activity level throughout the study period. Conversely, in high-altitude areas, temperature affected activity level only in summer and early fall. Lower temperatures in higher altitudes favoured roe deer activity, resulting in roe deer's preference towards higher altitude areas. However, roe deer's movement toward lower altitudes was observed in summer. Reduced heat stress by changing activity pattern allowed them to access lower altitude areas with greater resource availability during summer. This study revealed how roe deer activity varied across seasons and altitudes, considering the interactions among weather, microclimate and resource availability. It provides insight into how montane species adapt to various climatic conditions, and this could have important implications for wildlife management and conservation efforts.

AB  - Many oceanic areas are still in need of baseline information on their structure and functioning. This is particularly important due to the ever-increasing impacts of global changes, which have led to the decline of marine life, and top predators in particular. The study of the structure and functioning of food webs can help understand the consequences of the disappearance of this group in marine ecosystems. Here, we develop a mass-balanced model for the marine Exclusive Economic Zone of the archipelago of Madeira, with emphasis on the role of marine megafauna in this ecosystem. A total of 50 functional groups were defined, representing coastal and open ocean areas, and epipelagic and deep-sea levels. The total biomass of the Madeira system was calculated at 52.68 t km-2, with lower trophic level organisms comprising 89.9 % of its biomass. Marine megafauna, namely pelagic sharks and coastal birds had the highest impacts across other trophic levels and were classified as keystone species, together with monk seals. The food web was characterized by a linear-like food chain, with a large proportion of specialized organisms, including dolphins, shearwaters, and large pelagic fish. The low mean trophic level of the system was 2.03, much lower than that of fisheries (4.3) targeting mainly tunas and Black scabbardfish. Considering the importance of marine megafauna in this food web and the threats they are facing; monitoring studies of key species in the region should be a priority. This study can now be used to build a needed ecosystem-based fisheries management and integrate conservation measures to declining species.

AB  - North American elk Cervus canadensis inhabited portions of the eastern United States until extirpation in the mid-1800s. From 2000 to 2008, 201 elk were reintroduced to the North Cumberland Wildlife Management Area (NCWMA), Tennessee. The stocking source was Elk Island National Park, Alberta Canada where there are two distinct genetic populations isolated from the north and south. This genetic structure has largely persisted in the population after translocation. Food habits were evaluated in the early stages of restoration, but the population has had approximately 20 years to adapt to the landscape, and current food habits are unknown. To assess diet composition using DNA metabarcoding, we collected fecal pellets of elk from 65 openings within the 79 318 ha NCWMA weekly from February to April of 2019. We targeted the ITS2 region of the nuclear ribosomal DNA to amplify vegetation sequences found in the internal portion of the elk feces. DNA metabarcoding of feces was linked to results from an accompanying elk population genetics study to investigate food habits between sexes from the two different genetic groups. The majority (80.298%) of sequences matched plants from 21 genera. The top genera (> 5.000%) represented were Vaccinium (15.216%), Festuca (8.446%), Rosa (6.358%), Robinia (5.793%), and Eleagnus (5.186%). Elk heavily used woody plants before and after spring green-up (> 50% of diet). However, the quantity of forbs in their diet more than doubled after emergence in the spring. The sex-genetic groups consumed similar vegetation in approximately proportionate amounts. Diversity analyses revealed a significant difference in plant genera sequence detection between males from the two genetic groups, although this finding is likely explained by limited sample size. NCWMA elk used a variety of forage in the winter and DNA metabarcoding analysis allows for a comprehensive analysis of food habits useful for monitoring how elk respond dietarily to habitat management.

AB  - The Andean tapir (Tapirus pinchaque) is one of the most endangered species of the genus, due to habitat fragmentation, hunting and limited distribution in the montane forests and paramos of Colombia, Ecuador and Peru. Despite its ecological relevance, there are few robust studies on the factors influencing its occupancy. This study estimated its density and spatial occupancy by photo-trapping in two habitats: montane forest and paramo in the northern Andes of Ecuador. Four areas of 100 km(2) each were sampled with 40 cameras per area, active for 70.8 days summing a total of 160 cameras. Density was analyzed with the Random Encounter Model (REM), while occupancy was estimated using occupancy models. Sampling effort was 5192 traps/night in montane forest and 6131 in paramo. Andean tapir density was 23.6 individuals/100 km(2) in montane forest and 11.6 in paramo. In montane forest, occupancy was influenced by the presence of carnivores ((psi) over cap = 0.77), while in paramo, by vegetation cover ((psi) over cap = 0.44). The results indicate a higher occupancy in montane forest, although without significant differences in density between the two habitats. The study highlights the importance of protected areas and the need to periodically assess Andean tapir occupancy to monitor ecosystem integrity and the effectiveness of conservation measures.

AB  - Coastal land reclamation dramatically alters ecosystem structure and trajectories of ecological succession, yet knowledge about soil faunal colonization and community assembly in reclaimed coastal land is scarce. In this study, we investigated taxonomic and functional shifts in soil nematode communities following reclamation in sites at Hengsha Island, China. Six reclamation stages were identified based on reclamation age and vegetation type, including tidal flat, 1-year bare field, 3-year halotolerant pioneer community, 5-year grassland, 10-year, and 50-year secondary forests. We collected data on the morphological and life history traits of soil nematodes, including body size, cephalic setae, amphids, tail shape, life history strategy, and feeding habit, to assess the functional responses of nematodes to different reclamation stages. We found a significant decrease in both taxonomic and functional diversity as tidal flats were converted to dry land, followed by a gradual recovery that progressed with increasing reclamation age. Significant shifts in the taxonomic and functional composition of soil nematode communities were also observed. Tidal flat reclamation decreased the relative abundance of marine nematodes with cephalic setae, large amphids and clavate/conicocylindrical tails. With increasing reclamation age, bacterivores and r-strategists with conical and long tails were displaced by fungivores, herbivores, and K-strategists with rounded tails. These shifts were driven by changes in soil water content, organic matter, plant communities, and stress factors, such as pH and salinity. Our findings highlight the critical role of morphological and life history traits in understanding how soil nematode communities adapt to human-induced environmental changes, providing valuable insight into the long-term ecological impacts of coastal reclamation on soil biodiversity.

AB  - Context Diel use of forest and open habitats by large herbivores is linked to species-specific needs of multiple and heterogeneous resources. However, forest cover layers might deviate considerably for a given landscape, potentially affecting evaluations of animals' habitat use. Objectives We assessed inconsistency in the estimates of diel forest use by red and roe deer at GPS location and home range (HR) levels, using two geographic layers: Tree Cover Density (TCD) and Corine Land Cover (CLC). Methods We first measured the classification mismatch of red and roe deer GPS locations between TCD and CLC, also with respect to habitat units' size. Then, we used Generalised Least Squares models to assess the proportional use of forest at day and night at the GPS location and HR levels, both with TCD and CLC. Results About 20% of the GPS locations were inconsistently classified as forest or open habitat by the two layers, particularly within smaller habitat units. Overall proportion of forest and open habitat, though, was very similar for both layers. In all populations, both deer species used forest more at day than at night and this pattern was more evident with TCD than with CLC. However, at the HR level, forest use estimates were only marginally different between the two layers. Conclusions When estimating animal habitat use, geographic layer choice requires careful evaluation with respect to ecological questions and target species. Habitat use analyses based on GPS locations are more sensitive to layer choice than those based on home ranges.

AB  - Macrofauna associated with the bamboo coral Isidella elongata was analysed in the Balearic Basin at depths of 697-1308 m. The diversity of associated macrofauna and the specific associations identified depended on different morphological characteristics of colonies, such as height or density of rami. Species associated with Isidella consisted mainly of sessile fauna, such as cnidarians (the actinian Amphianthus dornhii and the solitary coral Desmophyllum dianthus) and cirripeds (Gibossaverruca sp.). The strongest relationship (commensalism) occurred for the Pontogeneiidae amphipod Dautzenbergia megacheir, living attached to colonies of Isidella and represented by all population stages from adult (oostegal) females and males to juveniles. Species-coral relationships between Dautzenbergia and bamboo corals (Isididae) are plausible. Dautzenbergia spp. showed morphological differences between Atlantic (described by Walker 1897 as "eyes wanting") and Mediterranean (with well-developed reddish eyes) specimens. This would suggest diversification of this genus, as has been recently suggested for Pleustidae associated with deep gorgonians. The diversity of the macrofaunal community associated with I. elongata was higher in the most mature (larger colonies with higher density) fields found NW of Mallorca, with higher colonies than in other parts of the Mediterranean. This was the only site where Gibossaverruca sp. (a first Mediterranean faunal record) and D. dianthus were collected. These complex associations between macrofauna and deep-water corals may provide arguments to protect these fragile ecosystems as a source of faunal diversity and diversification.

AB  - Research has indicated that simple forest ecosystem composition, structure and diversity have uncomplicated community relationships and insufficient pest control capabilities. To investigate changing characteristics of plant and insect communities in under pest outbreaks in Larix principis-rupprechtii plantations, the research areas were defined as mature (48-50 years) and young (24-29 years) infested stands along with healthy stands. The results show a reduction in the complexity and diversity of plant communities and herbaceous plant guilds (polycultures of beneficial plants) and the complexity and dominance of insect communities, especially natural insect enemies. The results also show the relative simplicity of the main factors of community change and development that represent the characteristics of pest outbreaks in L. principis-rupprechtii plantations. The complexity and diversity of plant communities, particularly herbaceous plant guilds play a fundamental role in the regulation and development in forest ecosystems.

AB  - The Persian Gulf is a thermally extreme environment in which reef corals have adapted to survive through temperature ranges that would be lethal to corals from other regions. Despite offering a unique opportunity to better understand how corals from other regions may adapt in the future, through a changing climate, much of the Gulf coral and fish communities remain to be described. In the southwestern Gulf nation of Qatar few reef sites have been described to date. We here characterize reef communities from 16 sites around the Qatar Peninsula, encompassing depths from 3 to 25m. We found the healthiest coral reef communities to be in deeper offshore reefs, with high coral and fish species richness and high coral abundance, likely a result of their occurrence below summer thermocline depths and distance from urban pressures. In contrast, we found shallow reefs, both nearshore and offshore, to have low species richness and abundance relative to deeper reefs, presumably due to impacts from recurrent bleaching events and development pressures over recent decades. The results of this work underscore the Qatar Peninsula as being at the biogeographic epicenter of the wider Gulf. However, further temperature increases may push both fishes and corals over their physiological limits. Management efforts at both the regional and global level are needed to reduce thermal stressors and preserve the rich reef ecosystems found in the waters surrounding Qatar.

AB  - The use of supplements to increase the body and antler size in Odocoileus virginianus (white-tailed deer) is rampant; however, the impact of this strategy on the size of surrounding species assemblages needs to be better understood. This work aimed to determine the effect of the multi -nutrient block (MNB) for white-tailed deer on the richness and abundance of birds and mammals and the presence of predators. We realized this work in Santa Cruz Nuevo, Puebla, Mexico, from 2017 to 2019. A completely randomized design with two treatments and eight replicates per treatment was used, for which 16 completely randomized sites were chosen, within which a camera trap was installed, and the animals' visits to the site were recorded. Plots of 50 m2 were established, and two MNBs (protein and minerals) were placed in the central part of eight squares. The other eight sites served as control treatments. The response variables were animal richness and relative abundance. The results showed that animal richness was higher in the MNBs sites (10.6 species; P < 0.05) and lower (7 species) in the control. The relative abundance of the sites with MNBs was higher for predators: coyote (Canis latrans), bobcat (Lynx rufus), puma (Puma concolor), and mammals less than 10 kg (rabbits, rodents and other omnivores). However, there were no significant differences in the relative abundance of white-tailed deer (P= 0.1568). In conclusion, the presence of the MNBs modifies the relative abundance of predators but does not increase the presence of white-tailed deer.

AB  - Forest management increases the amount of edges or ecotones on the landscape. Ecotones are important transition zones, representing a rapid change in landscape physiognomy and can support greater biodiversity than the adjacent habitats. It is therefore essential to understand how species respond to such habitat transitions. The Lepidoptera (moths and butterflies) provide numerous important ecosystem services in forests as herbivores, pollinators, and as food for many birds, bats, and other animals. It is therefore important to understand how this taxon responds to forest management in the boreal forest, and specifically how Lepidoptera assemblages change across anthropogenic forest edges. Via light trapping in clear-cut, forest, and edge habitats, we quantified the extent to which forestry-created ecotones influence nocturnal macromoth assemblages in the eastern boreal forest. We estimated species diversity as Hill numbers, calculated abundance, assessed composition with nonmetric multidimensional scaling ordination, and used indicator species analysis to determine how assemblage structure differed between the three habitats. We collected a total of 3486 individuals, representing 187 species that belonged to six families over 108 trap-nights. We collected a higher abundance of nocturnal macromoths in edges than clear-cuts, but not than forest. The composition of edges was intermediate between clearcuts and forests, but differed significantly from adjacent habitats and included many unique species. Forest sites supported lower species richness, Simpson diversity and Shannon diversity than clear-cuts and edges, which overlapped with each other. Overall, our study indicates that the habitat created by forest edges supports unique macromoth assemblages. Moreover, the macromoth assemblage in this habitat is rich and abundant as compared to the adjacent habitats. This has important implications for the maintenance of biodiversity and the provisioning of ecosystem services in the boreal, as well as forestry in the context of natural disturbance emulation.

AB  - The Dolphin and Union (DU) caribou herd (Rangifer tarandus groenlandicus x pearyi), locally referred to as Island caribou, is a unique and at-risk ecotype of caribou that ranges on Victoria Island and the adjacent mainland in the central Canadian Arctic. To facilitate the incorporation of traditional knowledge (TK) and better inform the required species recovery plan, we analyzed an archived set of TK interviews done in Ekaluktutiak and Kugluktuk, Nunavut, in 2003. The overarching theme throughout the interviews was that the DU caribou were dynamic, constantly adapting to the changing environment around them. Accounts provided previously unexplored connections between temporal and spatial trends in DU caribou distribution, population, ecology, and disease syndromes. Findings of fewer animals, range shift, and increased observations of disease in the late 1990s and early 2000s suggest that early signs of the declines that have resulted in the herd being reassessed as endangered today were already apparent to Kugluktukmiut in 2003. In contrast, Ekaluktutiakmiut were seeing a stable population. Shifts in caribou range and consequently harvesting ranges were described by both communities, but more evident in Kugluktuk. When combined, the differing accounts of the two communities provided a deeper understanding of caribou ecology and trends across seasons, years, and a broad spatial range. Community differences demonstrate the cruciality of considering unique place-based perspectives and the importance of mobilizing TK from communities and knowledge keepers throughout the caribou range for a herd-level understanding. This study highlights the importance of timely analyses and reporting on TK studies to ensure a nimble conservation response in a rapidly changing environment.

AB  - Species overexploitation has simplified food webs worldwide, resulting in the degradation of ecosystems relative to their natural state. Fishes are the most important herbivores in many shallow coral reef environments, where they control algal successional processes and promote coral reef resilience. Nowadays, Rapa Nui (Easter Island) is suffering a severe decline in its nearshore fish populations due to overfishing. In this study, we used artificial underwater settlement plates with different levels of herbivore exclusion, and underwater visual censuses, for eight consecutive months to examine the functional role of herbivorous fishes in the coastal benthic community of Rapa Nui. Fishes effectively controlled fleshy erect algae growth along the west and north coast of the island. In total exclusion treatments, Codium spp. dominated settlement plates, showing a likely late successional stage when no herbivory occurred. Significant differences in fish biomass were observed across sites, suggesting a possible fishing gradient. The results of this study can help to inform various spatial and temporal management strategies to increase the protection of nearshore fishes at the recently created Rapa Nui multiple-use marine protected area.

AB  - Game parks are the last preserve of many large mammals, and in savanna ecosystems, management of surface waters poses a conservation challenge. In arid and semi-arid regions, water can be a scarce resource during dry seasons and drought. Artificial waterholes are common in parks and reserves across Africa, but can alter mammal community composition by favoring drought intolerant species, with consequences for disease dynamics, and population viability of drought-tolerant species. Analysis of waterborne environmental DNA (eDNA) is increasingly used to inform conservation of rare and invasive species, and conduct large-scale biodiversity assessments. To explore the reliability of eDNA as an indicator of mammal waterhole use in savannas, we compare eDNA metabarcoding and camera traps for documenting artificial waterhole use in the Kruger National Park, South Africa, a global hotspot for mammal diversity. We show that eDNA metabarcoding can recover the majority of mammal species detected by camera traps, including a number of endangered species, but DNA signatures of mammal visitation are temporally limited, with best performance when tracking water-dependent large bodied mammals visiting within two days of sampling. Our results highlight limitation of eDNA based monitoring in these systems, including the lack of long-term eDNA persistence in small and highly utilized waterholes, and variability in detection rates among species. However, we demonstrate that eDNA-based approaches can be used to track mammals of conservation concern, and reflect patterns of recent waterhole use and co-occurrence across water-dependent species, both of which are crucial for making evidence-based decisions regarding water management and provisioning.

AB  - Excessive nitrogen (N) loading poses a substantial risk to soil biodiversity and disrupts carbon (C) flows within the soil food web. Intercropping with legumes is often considered a sustainable way to maintain soil N availability and mitigate the associated detrimental effects. However, it remains unclear whether and how legume crops restore energetic attenuation caused by N loading within the soil food web. Here, we conducted a two-year field experiment using randomized block design in a subtropic Camellia oleifera plantation with high wet N deposition. We examined the effects of applying N fertilizers at normal or half levels (168 or 84 kg N ha(-1)yr(-1)) and intercropping legumes (Arachis hypogaea or Cassia tora) on the soil nematode food web. We observed that N fertilization suppressed the majority of nematode trophic groups, weakened the stability of food web structure, and diminished the C flows across the bacterial and fungal energy channels. Conversely, intercropping with legumes (particularly with C. tora) bolstered the densities of bacterivore and fungivore nematodes. This enhancement facilitated interactions within the soil micro-food web, and subsequently augmented the C flows within their respective channels. Model predictions suggested that the detrimental effects of N fertilizers on the nematode food web are primarily linked to decreased soil pH resulting from soil N accumulation. Notably, higher soil organic C was found to mitigate these effects. Furthermore, N-enriched legume substrates played a beneficial role in stimulating soil microbial activities and facilitating C flows through bottom-up control. Our findings emphasize the positive impacts of legume crops on mitigating soil biodiversity loss and restoring energetic attenuation within soil food web under N-saturated soil conditions. These findings provide valuable insights for agroforestry management practices aimed at sustaining soil health and ecosystem resilience.

AB  - Babesiosis is a tick-borne disease that mainly affects small mammals and has been reported in at least five provinces in China. However, the host range and geographical distribution of the parasite in Fujian province are unclear. Therefore, we investigated the prevalence and genetic characteristics of Babesia in Fujian province, Southeast China, between 2015 and 2020. Rodent blood samples were collected from 26 different surveillance sites across Fujian province. Genomic DNA was extracted to screen for Babesia infection using polymerase chain reaction based on 18S rRNA. DNA samples from 316 domestic goats, 85 water buffalo, 56 domestic dogs and 18 domestic pigs were examined. The prevalence of Babesia was statistically analysed using the Chi-square test or Fisher's exact test. Babesia infections were detected in 3.96% (43/1,087; 95%CI: 2.80%, 5.12%) of rodents and 1.26% (6/475; 95%CI: 0.26%, 2.26%) of other mammals. Multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed that irrigated cropland, shrubs and forests were risk factors for Babesia microti infections. The infection rates among domestic pigs, dogs and goats were 5.56%, 1.79% and 1.27%, respectively, with no infection found in water buffalo. The 18S rRNA gene sequencing revealed that rodents were infected with Babesia (sensu lato), whereas other mammals were infected with Babesia (sensu stricto). The geographical distribution and phylogenetic relationship of Babesia was determined in Southeast China. Mammals, particularly wild rodents, maybe the main natural hosts of Babesia in Fujian. Our findings provide a foundation for public health officials to develop prevention and control measures for Babesia.

AB  - Abandoned, lost, or otherwise discarded fishing gear (ALDFG) is responsible for the entanglement of several marine species. Based on a search of digital media (i.e., Google and YouTube(BR)), we assessed the negative impacts of ghost nets-a type of ALDFG-on Brazilian marine biodiversity. We found that ghost nets negatively affected crustaceans, fishes, reptiles, birds, and mammals in different parts of the Brazilian coast. Our reports include marine megafauna, such as the Bryde's whale and Guiana dolphin. In addition, we found that ghost nets impacted seven threatened species and had negative effects on animals within marine protected areas. Here, we provide an update on the negative impacts of ghost nets on Brazilian marine biota, but the real situation remains underestimated and somewhat obscure.

AB  - Simple Summary Hepatitis E virus (HEV) is a zoonotic pathogen, with an increasing number of cases worldwide. In Asia, including Mongolia, infections are associated with the zoonotic HEV-3 and HEV-4 genotypes, and pigs, deer, and wild boars are the main reservoirs. Recent studies have revealed that sheep are hosts of the virus in several countries. The aim of our study is to diagnose HEV RNA in feces and liver samples of sheep in Mongolia and clarify the origin of the virus and characterize its chain of infection. From our results, we found HEV genotype 4 in sheep and it was closely related to pig HEV genotype 4 in the same region. On Mongolian pig farms, pigs are fed with the raw internal organs of sheep for fattening the pigs as a free resource of protein. There is a concern that the spread of HEV could affect livestock feeding. Hepatitis E is a viral infectious disease in pigs, wild boars, cows, deer, rabbits, camels, and humans as hosts caused by Paslahepevirus. Recently, it has been detected in a wide variety of animals including domestic small ruminants. Mongolia is a land of nomadic people living with livestock such as sheep, goats, and cattle. Due to how Mongolian lifestyles have changed, pork has become popular and swine diseases have emerged. Among them, Hepatitis E disease has become a zoonotic infectious disease that needs to be addressed. The HEV problem in pigs is that infected pigs excrete the virus without showing clinical symptoms and it spreads into the environment. We attempted to detect HEV RNA in sheep which had been raised in Mongolia for a long time, and those animals living together with pigs in the same region currently. We also conducted a longitudinal analysis of HEV infection in pigs in the same area and found that they were infected with HEV of the same genotype and cluster. In this study, we examined 400 feces and 120 livers (pigs and sheep) by RT-PCR in Tov Province, Mongolia. HEV detection in fecal samples was 2% (4/200) in sheep and 15% (30/200) in pigs. The results of ORF2 sequence analysis of the HEV RT-PCR-positive pigs and sheep confirmed genotype 4 in both animals. The results suggest that HEV infection is widespread in both pigs and sheep and that urgent measures to prevent infection are needed. This case study points to the changing nature of infectious diseases associated with livestock farming. It will be necessary to reconsider livestock husbandry and public health issues based on these cases.

AB  - Land Use Land Cover (LULC) changes are a major cause of natural habitat alterations and biodiversity losses affecting wildlife habitats, species distribution, and movement patterns. Understanding the impact of LULC changes on wildlife and their habitats is crucial for the implementation of effective conservation measures, especially in and around conservation areas. LULC changes between 1993, 2003, 2013, and 2023 in Omo National Park (ONP) and adjacent areas were classified and monitored. Landsat Satellite Imagery was used to determine the spatiotemporal patterns of LULC changes using a geographic information system and remote sensing techniques. We found that LULC changed over the last three decades and that LULC changes in surrounding buffer areas influenced the status of the elephant population more than changes within ONP. In ONP, open grassland decreased while the other land covers such as savanna wooded grassland, bushland, woodland, forest land and water bodies increased, whereas in the surrounding buffer areas of ONP, forest land and open grassland decreased and agricultural land increased sharply. The main cause of the contribution of land -cover change in the study area was agriculture related to the expansion of onsite farms and large-scale agricultural investment, which increased by about 284% over the 30 years. Habitats suitable for African elephants outside the eastern Park boundary were converted to sugar cane plantations leading to a decline in the African elephant population and its range, especially in the last 15 years after a Mega Sugar Project was launched in the region in 2010 to develop sugar industry. Our results have shown that large-scale agricultural investments and associated human activities have contributed to the changes in LULC affecting the suitable habitats and migration corridors of the African elephant in the study area.

AB  - Simple Summary Rusa unicolor swinhoei is an economically important animal in Taiwan, owing to the market demand for its velvet antler. In this study, we investigated the genetic diversity and structure of Formosan sambar deer using microsatellites. The observed genetic diversity was low, which is likely attributable to inbreeding and bottleneck effects. Moreover, this study revealed two distinct genetic groups within the captive populations and found no significant population genetic structure among the captive populations in Taiwan. These findings have the potential to improve breeding management and contribute to the mitigation of inbreeding, thereby promoting the productive potential of Formosan sambar deer.Abstract Formosan sambar deer (Rusa unicolor swinhoei) are of great economic significance in Taiwan, resulting in a substantial increase in deer farming to meet the high demand for velvet antlers. Inbreeding depression and reduced genetic variability can lead to the deterioration of captive populations. In this study, 239 Formosan sambar deer were genotyped using 13 microsatellites to analyze their genetic diversity and population genetic structure. Our results indicate a high-resolution power of these microsatellites in individual discrimination and parentage analysis. However, captive populations exhibit a low level of genetic diversity, likely because of inbreeding and bottleneck effects. Both principal coordinate analysis (PCoA) and STRUCTURE analyses revealed two distinct and segregated genetic groups within the captive populations and indicated no clear population genetic structure among the captive populations. Introducing new genetic material from the wild through translocation offers a potential solution for mitigating the impact of inbreeding and enhancing genetic diversity. The comprehensive information obtained from these genetic analyses is crucial for the development of effective breeding strategies aimed at preserving and enhancing Formosan sambar deer populations.

AB  - There are more species of lizards and snakes (squamates) alive today than any other order of land vertebrates, yet their fossil record has been poorly documented compared with other groups. Here, we describe a gigantic Pleistocene skink from Australia based on extensive material that includes much of the skull and postcranial skeleton, and spans ontogenetic stages from neonate to adult. Tiliqua frangens substantially expands the known ecomorphological diversity of squamates. At approximately 2.4 kg, it was more than double the mass of any living skink, with an exceptionally broad, deep skull, squat limbs and heavy, ornamented body armour. It probably filled the armoured herbivore niche that land tortoises (testudinids), absent from Australia, occupy on other continents. Tiliqua frangens and other giant Plio-Pleistocene skinks suggest that small-bodied groups that dominate vertebrate biodiversity might have lost their largest and often most morphologically extreme representatives in the Late Pleistocene, expanding the scope of these extinctions.

AB  - Urbanization is changing the conditions in which many species live, forcing them to adjust to these novel environments. Floral size and shape are critical traits for the reproduction of plants pollinated by animals as they are involved in the attraction of pollinators and in efficient pollination. Variation in size and shape could be affected by urbanization via its modification of the abiotic environment (habitat fragmentation, water availability, temperature, soil properties), or via its impact on the biotic environment of plants (pollination, herbivory). Although numerous studies have assessed the impact of urbanization on pollinator communities and many plant traits, few have investigated its impact on floral size and shape while quantifying the proportion of the total urbanization effect that is due to biotic interactions. In this study, we tested if urbanization and pollinator visitation rates affect the flower shape of the spotted jewelweed, Impatiens capensis. We quantified the size and shape of flowers in frontal and profile views using geometric morphometrics for 228 individuals from six populations from the region of Montreal, Canada. Pollinator visitation rates were estimated at each site and the main pollinators were found to be bumblebees, honeybees and hummingbirds. We found that floral size and shape are significantly correlated with urbanization as measured by the amount of vegetation in the surrounding environment of the plants (mean normalized vegetation index, NDVI) and by the visitation rates of bumblebees and honey bees. Partitioning of the total flower shape variation suggests that urbanization affects flower shape through abiotic factors and via its impact on pollinator visitation rates. While further studies from other cities are necessary to confirm the role of urbanization in shaping the floral shape of I. capensis, these results support the idea that urbanization could affect flower shapes.

AB  - 1. Since the Green Revolution, the management of agrochemicals has become a cornerstone of agriculture, allowing it to expand over terrestrial ecosystems previously deemed unsuitable for cultivation. Such expansion altered the connectedness of aquatic habitats to organisms with complex life cycles by increasing the number of temporary ponds in interfluves. Here, we investigate how spatial isolation and intensification in the use of agrochemicals can interact to increase or decrease the permeability of agricultural fields to these organisms by affecting community structure in temporary ponds.
   2. We carried out a field experiment that simulates realistic scenarios of agrochemical contamination at different levels of spatial isolation. We constructed 45 1200-L artificial ponds in a Savanna landscape in Brazil at three distances from a source wetland (30, 120, and 480 m). The ponds were spontaneously colonized by aquatic insects and amphibians and treated with no agrochemicals (control), fertilizers (as in managed pastures) or fertilizers and a single pulse of the insecticide fipronil and the herbicide 2,4-D (as in sugarcane fields) following realistic dosages and application schedules.
   3. Communities treated only with fertilizers generally exhibited a higher abundance of aquatic insects at the peak of the rainy season, suggesting that fertilization caused bottom-up effects. However, because low spatial isolation and fertilization favoured different predatory taxa, their insect prey eventually became less abundant in less isolated fertilized ponds. Communities treated with fertilizers and pesticides diverged strongly from other treatments after the application of the insecticide, when a decrease in insect abundance indirectly benefitted amphibian populations. In this case, spatial isolation delayed the recovery of the abundance of several herbivore and detritivore insects in isolated ponds.
   4. Synthesis and applications. These results have direct consequences for the emergence of insects and amphibians, possibly affecting important ecosystem services. Such consequences can be controlled by avoiding agrochemical contamination at the peak of most taxa reproductive season or through changes in spatial isolation by deliberately constructing wetlands in interfluves. In all cases, the effects of agrochemicals and isolation must be addressed jointly for a successful management of biodiversity in agricultural landscapes.

AB  - This study assessed PBDE congeners in surface water and sediment from the Buffalo River estuary, East London, South Africa. Samples were collected across three seasons in 2020 and analyzed using GC-MS and GC-mu ECD to respectively identify and quantify analytes. The concentration of & sum;6PBDEs in the surface water and sediment ranged from n.d. to 0.947 mu g/L and from 1.87 to 2554 ng/g (dw), respectively. We found the relative abundance of the congeners in water and sediment to be in this order: BDE-66 (36 %) > BDE-100 (25 %) > BDE-17 (21 %) > BDE-183 (9 %) > BDE-153 (6 %) > BDE-47 (3 %) and BDE-66 (26 %) > BDE-100 (23 %) > BDE-17 (18 %) > BDE-47 (15 %) > BDE-153 (10 %) > BDE-183 (9 %) respectively. The ecological risk assessment reveals that the risk quotient, RQs, of BDE-100 (85.1), BDE-47 (2.1) and BDE-183 (1.1) for surface water and BDE-47 (229606), BDE-153 (1192) and BDE-100 (141) for surface sediment were all significantly higher than one, indicating high ecological hazards for both water and sediment-dwelling organisms. The point sources of PBDE pollution were the First and the Second Creek, which regularly carry residential and industrial effluents into the estuary. Sediment under the Pontoon Bridge is the most polluted due to non-point sources. Regular dredging of the estuary is highly recommended to reduce the levels of PBDEs in the sediment.

AB  - Aims Both extreme drought and insect herbivores can suppress plant growth in grassland communities. However, most studies have examined extreme drought and insects in isolation, and there is reason to believe that insects might alter the ability of grasslands to withstand drought. Unfortunately, few studies have tested the interactive effects of extreme drought and insect herbivores in grassland communities. Methods Here, we tested the drought-herbivore interactions using a manipulative experiment that factorially crossed extreme drought with the exclusion of insect herbivores in a temperate semiarid grassland in Inner Mongolia. Important Findings Our results demonstrated that both extreme drought and insect herbivores separately decreased total plant cover. When combined, insect herbivores reduced the impact of drought on total cover by increasing the relative abundance of drought-resistant dominant species. Our results highlight that the negative effect of extreme drought on total plant cover could be alleviated by maintaining robust insect herbivore communities.

AB  - Larger geographical areas contain more species-an observation raised to a law in ecology. Less explored is whether biodiversity changes are accompanied by a modification of interaction networks. We use data from 32 spatial interaction networks from different ecosystems to analyse how network structure changes with area. We find that basic community structure descriptors (number of species, links and links per species) increase with area following a power law. Yet, the distribution of links per species varies little with area, indicating that the fundamental organization of interactions within networks is conserved. Our null model analyses suggest that the spatial scaling of network structure is determined by factors beyond species richness and the number of links. We demonstrate that biodiversity-area relationships can be extended from species counts to higher levels of network complexity. Therefore, the consequences of anthropogenic habitat destruction may extend from species loss to wider simplification of natural communities.
   Using 32 ecological networks (host-parasite, plant-pollinator, plant-herbivore and other food webs), the authors show that several network properties scale with the size of the sampling area, suggesting a new type of biodiversity-area relationship.

AB  - The alpine steppe on the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau (QTP) has been experienced a long-term influence by grazing livestock, resulting the changes in the material cycle of grasslands. By investigating the responses of plant community composition and soil nutrient to grazing regimes (i.e., continuous grazing and rotational grazing) and intensity (4, 6, and 8 sheep per hectare), we examined the mechanisms of maintaining the productivity, tried to answer the questions how grazing regulate the aboveground net primary productivity (ANPP) of the alpine steppe the QTP. Our results showed that medium rotational grazing increased the soil stoichiometry including TC: TN ratio, TN: TP ratio, and TC: TP ratio, whereas continuous grazing only increased TC: TP ratio. Structural equation modeling further revealed that grazing affected soil available nutrient by intermediating soil nutrient balance, and increased NH4+-N and NO3--N. Compared with continuous grazing, rotational grazing could significantly improve ANPP. Soil available nutrients respond preferentially to grazing compare with plant diversity to maintain grassland productivity in the alpine steppe on QTP. These results are meaningful for developing the rational grazing management practices on grasslands.

AB  - The Asian tapir Tapirus indicus is the only tapir species in Southeast Asia. It is declining across its range and is categorized as Endangered on the IUCN Red List. The forests of Sumatra are critical to Asian tapir conservation as they contain some of the last remaining populations of the species, yet conservation efforts are hindered by a lack of information on habitat suitability. We collated camera-trap data from nine landscapes across 69,500 km(2) of Sumatran rainforest to help predict suitable habitat for Asian tapirs on the island. Predictions from Bayesian occupancy models demonstrated that tapir occupancy was greatest in forests below 600 m elevation and exclusively in forests with high aboveground biomass. Forests around the Barisan Mountains on the west of Sumatra provide the most suitable habitat for the species. Only 36% of the most critical habitat (i.e. 80th percentile of predicted occupancy values, or above) for tapirs is formally protected for conservation, with much of the remainder found in forests allocated to watershed protection (35%) or logging (23%). We highlight several key areas in Sumatra where tapir conservation could be bolstered, such as by leveraging existing conservation efforts for other charismatic flagships species on the island.

AB  - In the Atlantic Arctic, bowhead whales (Balaena mysticetus) were nearly exterminated by European whalers between the seventeenth and nineteenth centuries. The collapse of the East Greenland-Svalbard-Barents Sea population, from an estimated 50 000 to a few hundred individuals, drastically reduced predation on mesozooplankton. Here, we tested the hypothesis that this event strongly favoured the demography of the little auk (Alle alle), a zooplanktivorous feeder competitor of bowhead whales and the most abundant seabird in the Arctic. To estimate the effect of bowhead whaling on little auk abundance, we modelled the trophic niche overlap between the two species using deterministic simulations of mesozooplankton spatial distribution. We estimated that bowhead whaling could have led to a 70% increase in northeast Atlantic Arctic little auk populations, from 2.8 to 4.8 million breeding pairs. While corresponding to a major population increase, this is far less than predicted by previous studies. Our study illustrates how a trophic shift can result from the near extirpation of a marine megafauna species, and the methodological framework we developed opens up new opportunities for marine trophic modelling.

AB  - Soils support a highly diverse community of plant pathogens, which are highly responsive to global change. Climate and livestock grazing are the main global changes in grasslands, yet, how long-term grazing alone, and in interaction with climate, influence the distribution of soil-borne plant pathogens remain virtually unknown. Here, we present the first long-term regional-scale experimental investigation on the impacts of livestock grazing on soil-borne fungal plant pathogens and their association with plant community across 10 experimental sites spanning a climate gradient in the steppe in Northern China. Our results showed that long-term grazing effects on the diversity and proportion of soil-borne fungal plant pathogens are strongly controlled by temperature, with grazing increasing pathogen richness and proportions largely in cooler grasslands. We further show that long-term grazing supported stronger connections between soil-borne fungal pathogens and plant communities. Our work demonstrates that climate controls the effects of grazing on plant pathogens, which is critical to understand and manage grasslands in a changing world.
   Long-term effects of grazing on soil-borne fungal plant pathogens are strongly controlled by temperature, posing greater potential threats to plant pathogen infections in cooler grasslands.

AB  - The increasing frequency and severity of human-caused fires likely have deleterious effects on species distribution and persistence. In 2020, megafires in the Brazilian Pantanal burned 43% of the biome's unburned area and resulted in mass mortality of wildlife. We investigated changes in habitat use or occupancy for an assemblage of eight mammal species in Serra do Amolar, Brazil, following the 2020 fires using a pre- and post-fire camera trap dataset. Additionally, we estimated the density for two naturally marked species, jaguars Panthera onca and ocelots Leopardus pardalis. Of the eight species, six (ocelots, collared peccaries Dicotyles tajacu, giant armadillos Priodontes maximus, Azara's agouti Dasyprocta azarae, red brocket deer Mazama americana, and tapirs Tapirus terrestris) had declining occupancy following fires, and one had stable habitat use (pumas Puma concolor). Giant armadillo experienced the most precipitous decline in occupancy from 0.431 +/- 0.171 to 0.077 +/- 0.044 after the fires. Jaguars were the only species with increasing habitat use, from 0.393 +/- 0.127 to 0.753 +/- 0.085. Jaguar density remained stable across years (2.8 +/- 1.3, 3.7 +/- 1.3, 2.6 +/- 0.85/100 km2), while ocelot density increased from 13.9 +/- 3.2 to 16.1 +/- 5.2/100 km2. However, the low number of both jaguars and ocelots recaptured after the fire period suggests that immigration may have sustained the population. Our results indicate that the megafires will have significant consequences for species occupancy and fitness in fire-affected areas. The scale of megafires may inhibit successful recolonization, thus wider studies are needed to investigate population trends.

AB  - Tropical rivers face escalating threats from hydrological alteration and invasive species, yet baseline data remain scarce for seasonal systems. This study provides the first comprehensive assessment of fish assemblage dynamics in the India's Vaigai River, integrating taxonomic, functional, and hydrological perspectives to guide conservation. Over a one-year period (June 2015-May 2016), 94,474 fish specimens were sampled, representing 147 species (139 native, 8 exotic) from 99 genera, 58 families, and 21 orders, with Perciformes (25 species), Cypriniformes (24), and Siluriformes (18) dominating the community. The Athankarai estuary emerged as a biodiversity hotspot (87 species), while midstream sites showed reduced diversity likely due to anthropogenic pressures. Notably, invasive tilapias (Oreochromis spp.) constituted 35% of total abundance, highlighting ecological disruption, and threatening native species like Pseudetroplus maculatus and Etroplus suratensis. Trophic analysis revealed omnivores preferring animal material (75 species = 51%) as the most common feeding group, followed by carnivores (36 species = 24%), omnivores with plant preference (17%), and herbivores (8%), reflecting adaptive strategies to seasonal flow variability. Predatory taxa (e.g., Carangiformes, Elopiformes) exhibited higher trophic levels (>= 3.8), indicating functional stratification within the food web. Diversity indices such as Shannon-Wiener (H'), Fisher's alpha, and Pielou's evenness (J') indicated stable yet seasonally modulated species diversity, while functional diversity metrics (Delta + , Lambda +) pointed to evolutionary stability and habitat-driven community differentiation. Seasonal analyses revealed bimodal abundance peaks during the Southwest Monsoon (46.6%) and Pre-Monsoon (41.6%), driven by hydrological connectivity. Cluster and multivariate ordination (nMDS, MDS) analyses revealed significant seasonal turnover in fish communities (46-96% similarity), highlighting the influence of hydrological variability on biodiversity patterns. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) revealed hydrological seasonality as the dominant habitat specialized key driver of fish assemblage patterns, with PC1 (98.8%) separating high-flow (Southwest and Pre-Monsoon) periods dominated by Oreochromis spp, Cirrhinus mrigala, and Glossogobius giuris, from low-flow (Post- and Northeast Monsoon) periods. PC2 (0.9%) distinguished estuarine species (Megalops cyprinoides, Nematalosa nasus) from pelagics (Thryssa vitrirostris, Stolephorus commersonnii), while PC3 (0.3%) revealed trophic differentiation between detritivores and piscivorous small pelagics. Vaigai River's ecological complexity demands flow-dependent, site-specific conservation controlling invasives, preserving habitats, and maintaining hydrological connectivity amid growing anthropogenic and climate pressures.

AB  - Previous studies in northeastern Patagonia suggested that, mainly as a consequence of overgrazing by sheep, the herbaceous steppes are being replaced by shrub steppes dominated by Chuquiraga avellanedae as a consequence of shrub encroachment. The herbaceous steppe presents a thick sandy loam to loamy sand A-horizon lying on a clay-horizon while the shrub steppe presents the clay-horizon at or near the soil surface. The thickness reduction of the remaining A-horizon and the formation of desert pavements are evidence of soil erosion. As previous studies suggested that shrub encroachment co-occurs with the erosion of the sandy A-horizon, we hypothesized that shrub encroachment is favored by the presence of an clay-horizon near the soil surface. We expected that C. avellanedae emergence and establishment would be higher as the clay horizon is closer to the soil surface and the A-horizon is reduced. We performed field and greenhouse experiments to evaluate seedling emergence and establishment along a gradient of A-horizon thickness. We found that the presence of a relatively thin sandy layer on the surface had a negative influence on both shrub emergence and establishment. The summer drought was not a critical period for the seedlings. Conversely, the highest seedling mortality took place during late winter in sandy soils, suggesting that these soils are more susceptible to frost heaving than clay soils. In conclusion, soil erosion in the northeastern Patagonian steppes would indirectly facilitate shrub encroachment due to differences in frost heaving susceptibility between sandy and clay soils.

AB  - Large mammalian herbivores substantially impact ecosystem functioning. As their populations are dramatically altered globally, disentangling their consumptive and non-consumptive effects is critical to advance mechanistic understanding and improve prediction of effects over ecosystem and Earth-system spatial extents. Mathematical models have played an important role in clarifying potential mechanisms of herbivore zoogeochemistry, based mostly on their consumptive effects as primary consumers and recyclers of organic and inorganic matter via defecation and urination. Trampling is a ubiquitous effect among walking vertebrates, but the consequences and potential mechanisms of trampling in diverse environments remain poorly understood. We derive a novel mathematical model of large mammalian herbivore effects on ecosystem nitrogen cycling, focusing on how trampling and environmental context impact soil processes. We model herbivore trampling with a linear positive or negative additive effect on soil-mediated nitrogen cycling processes. Combining analytical and numerical analyses, we find trampling by large mammalian herbivores is likely to decrease nitrogen mineralisation rate across diverse environments, such as temperate grassland and boreal forest. These effects are mediated by multiple potential mechanisms, including trampling-induced changes to detritivore biomass and functioning (e.g. rate of organic matter consumption). We also uncover scenarios where trampling can increase nitrogen mineralisation rate, contingent on the environment-specific relative sensitivity of detritivore mineral-nitrogen release and detritivore mortality, to trampling. In contrast to some consumptive mechanisms, our results suggest the pace of soil nitrogen cycling prior to trampling has little influence over the direction of the trampling net effect on nitrogen mineralisation, but that net effects may be greater in slow-cycling systems (e.g. boreal forests) than in fast-cycling systems (e.g. grasslands). Our model clarifies the potential consequences of previously overlooked mechanisms of zoogeochemistry that are common to all terrestrial biomes. Our results provide empirically testable predictions to guide future progress in empirical and theoretical studies of herbivore effects in diverse environmental contexts. Resolving ecological contingencies around animal consumptive and non-consumptive effects will improve whole-ecosystem management efforts such as restoration and rewilding.
   Trampling of vegetation and soil is ubiquitous among walking vertebrates, yet most models and empirical studies do not explicitly consider trampling impacts on ecosystem elemental cycling. With a new mathematical model, the authors resolve context-dependent trampling effects on nitrogen cycling via multiple mechanisms related to detritivore functioning and mortality.image

AB  - Human development and induced activities significantly affect the natural functioning of ecosystems and hence landscape connectivity. Ecological corridors are essential for maintaining structural as well as functional connectivity in cultural landscapes for wildlife, while providing interchange between core areas. In two pilot areas in the north-western and eastern part of Austria, ecological corridors were delineated using a geographic information system (GIS). The pilot areas are key to preserving ecological connectivity and are located along important international migration corridors (Bohemian Forest-Northern Alps corridor, Alpine-Carpathian corridor). Both areas are situated in highly human-altered and therefore dissected as well as fragmented landscapes. A one-year monitoring campaign using camera traps was carried out at selected locations along proposed ecological corridors in the cultural landscape and at wildlife crossings structures (WCSs) at intersections with road infrastructure. The monitoring was focused on mammals with a total of 18 species being observed. The most abundant species were roe deer, European hare and wild boar. European otter, European beaver, golden jackal and wildcat have only rarely been observed. Mammal species richness was positively correlated with the presence of vegetation cover and the coefficient of ecological stability (CES). The insights obtained can be used for recommendations and support in planning the planting of vegetation (use of grasslands, scattered and continuous woody vegetation, agroforestry systems) on the sites and in the vicinity of ecological corridors. The green bridges (wildlife overpasses) were used more frequently as well as by a larger number of mammal species compared to other studied WCSs showing characteristics that are less favourable for animals. The effectiveness of WCSs is mainly influenced by human activities, resulting in the recommendation to limit them on WCSs located along the routes of ecological corridors. We point out that actual wildlife migration corridors are likely to differ from designated data-driven ecological corridors generated by spatially explicit models, because these generally do not take into account all factors relating to the effectiveness of corridors. Our results suggest, that the application of the concept of functional connectivity is able to enhance the quality of ecological corridor designations, since usually they are based only on the concept of structural connectivity. For this reason, further studies are needed to help understanding factors and their specificities influencing the interplay between structural and functional connectivity of ecological corridors.

AB  - Global climate change has led to profound alterations of the Arctic environment and ecosystems, with potential sec-ondary effects on mercury (Hg) within Arctic biota. This review presents the current scientific evidence for impacts of direct physical climate change and indirect ecosystem change on Hg exposure and accumulation in Arctic terrestrial, freshwater, and marine organisms. As the marine environment is elevated in Hg compared to the terrestrial environ-ment, terrestrial herbivores that now exploit coastal/marine foods when terrestrial plants are iced over may be ex-posed to higher Hg concentrations. Conversely, certain populations of predators, including Arctic foxes and polar bears, have shown lower Hg concentrations related to reduced sea ice-based foraging and increased land-based forag-ing. How climate change influences Hg in Arctic freshwater fishes is not clear, but for lacustrine populations it may depend on lake-specific conditions, including interrelated alterations in lake ice duration, turbidity, food web length and energy sources (benthic to pelagic), and growth dilution. In several marine mammal and seabird species, tissue Hg concentrations have shown correlations with climate and weather variables, including climate oscillation indices and sea ice trends; these findings suggest that wind, precipitation, and cryosphere changes that alter Hg transport and deposition are impacting Hg concentrations in Arctic marine organisms. Ecological changes, including northward range shifts of sub-Arctic species and altered body condition, have also been shown to affect Hg levels in some populations of Arctic marine species. Given the limited number of populations and species studied to date, especially within Arctic terrestrial and freshwater systems, further research is needed on climate-driven processes influencing Hg concentrations in Arctic ecosystems and their net effects. Long-term pan-Arctic monitoring programs should consider ancillary datasets on climate, weather, organism ecology and physiology to improve interpretation of spatial variation and time trends of Hg in Arctic biota.

AB  - The distribution of forest and savanna biomes and the role of resources (climate and soil) and disturbances (fire and herbivory) in determining tree-grass dynamics remains elusive and variable across geographies. This is especially problematic in Indian savannas which have been historically misclassified as degraded forests and are targeted for tree-planting. Here, we examine biome distribution and determinants through the lens of tree cover across India. Our analyses reveal four distinct zones of differing tree cover, with intermediate zones containing savanna vegetation. Rainfall seasonality determines maximum possible tree cover non-linearly. Once rainfall seasonality is factored out, soil sand fraction and topography partially explain residual variation of tree cover. High domestic livestock herbivory and other anthropogenic pressures reduce tree cover. Lastly, lack of detectable fires precludes robust conclusions about the relationship between fire and tree cover. By considering these environmental drivers in restoration planning, we can improve upon simplistic tree planting initiatives that may be detrimental to Indian savannas.
   In India, water stress regulates tree cover across biomes, and variation in cover is explained by soil sand fraction, topography, and anthropogenic pressure according to an analysis of remote sensing vegetation data and environmental drivers.

AB  - Climate affects living ecosystems and defines species physiology. Climate change causes certain stress on animals, recorded as Enamel Hypoplasia (EH). Proboscideans, the mega herbivores, were extensively represented in the Siwaliks of Pakistan between the Middle Miocene to Pleistocene (similar to 15.99-similar to 0.6 Ma). This study was carried out on 15 species from 9 genera and 4 families using 319 teeth from 266 individual quarries. Our results revealed that 20.06% (64/319) of teeth were infected by EH. Family Deinotheriidae faced higher stress during the terminal of the Middle Miocene (EH 25%). Dental characters of deinotheres indicated that this family preferred soft vegetation like C-3 plants and failed to survive in grassland ecology at the onset of the Late Miocene (similar to 10-9 Ma). Gomphotheriidae (EH 21.05%) and Stegodontidae (EH 23.40%) survived through warm and dry climatic conditions of the Late Miocene, but could not survive the cool and dry climate of Plio-Pleistocene where grasslands were abundant with less browsing activity. Family Elephantidae (EH 8.47%) was successful in drier conditions and utilized the exclusive C-4 diet in open grasslands as efficient grazers, indicated by their tooth morphology. Elephantids were dominant of the proboscideans in open grassland and drier climate during Plio-Pleistocene in the Indian subcontinent. We assume that change in the Siwalik palaeoenvironment was governed by a microclimate.

AB  - Forest management and the stand age play key roles in determining the composition of soil biota, including nematodes. We analysed the effect of the interaction between stands of natural forest and stands influenced by human activity on nematode communities, necessary for realistically assessing the specific potentials of forest soils, plant protection, forest management, and land use management. Nematode communities were evaluated and compared in managed beech and spruce forests in three age classes (0-20, 40-60, and 100-120 years old) and an unmanaged old-growth temperate forest. A total of 51 nematode genera were found in the forests. The number of nematode genera was the highest (46) in European beech forests, dominated by Rhabditis and Filenchus. In contrast, the number of nematode genera was the lowest (37) in a Norway spruce forest, but where nematode abundance was the highest due mostly to the high abundance of bacterivorous nematodes such as Acrobeloides, Plectus, and Rhabditis. The unmanaged old-growth forest had the lowest nematode abundance and total biomass but the highest abundance of herbivorous nematodes of the order Tylenchida, especially Filenchus, Malenchus, and Paratylenchus, and a high abundance of identified genera of predators. The number of identified nematode genera, abundance, total biomass, and diversity index were the highest in young 0-20-year-old stands, and the lowest in 100-120-year-old stands. Enrichment, structure, and basal indices were influenced by both the stands and the ages of the forests.

AB  - Tuberculosis is a zoonotic chronic respiratory infectious disease caused by the Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex. The outbreak and epidemic of tuberculosis can seriously threaten human and veterinary health. To investigate the effects of environmental factors on tuberculosis in domestic ruminants, we collected data regarding the prevalence of tuberculosis in cattle, buffaloes, sheep, and goats in China (1956-2024) from publicly published literature and available databases. We identified the key risk factors among six major air pollutants and 19 bioclimatic variables; simulated the risk distribution of tuberculosis in cattle, buffaloes, sheep, and goats in China using the maximum entropy ecological niche model; and evaluated the effects of environmental factors. The area under the curve of the model was 0.873 (95% confidence interval, 0.851-0.895). The risk factors that most significantly influenced the prevalence of tuberculosis were the nitrogen dioxide (NO2) level, mean temperature of the coldest quarter, cattle distribution density, sheep distribution density, ozone (O3) level, and precipitation of the driest month. The predicted map of tuberculosis risk in cattle, buffaloes, sheep, and goats indicated that the high-risk regions were mainly distributed in South, North, East, and Northwest China. Improved surveillance is needed in these high-risk areas, and early preventive measures must be implemented based on the risk factors identified to reduce the future prevalence of tuberculosis in cattle, buffaloes, sheep, and goats.

AB  - SNP data sets can be used to infer a wealth of information about natural populations, including information about their structure, genetic diversity, and the presence of loci under selection. However, SNP data analysis can be a time-consuming and challenging process, not in the least because at present many different software packages are needed to execute and depict the wide variety of mainstream population-genetic analyses. Here, we present SambaR, an integrative and user-friendly R package which automates and simplifies quality control and population-genetic analyses of biallelic SNP data sets. SambaR allows users to perform mainstream population-genetic analyses and to generate a wide variety of ready to publish graphs with a minimum number of commands (less than 10). These wrapper commands call functions of existing packages (including adegenet, ape, LEA, poppr, pcadapt and StAMPP) as well as new tools uniquely implemented in SambaR. We tested SambaR on online available SNP data sets and found that SambaR can process data sets of over 100,000 SNPs and hundreds of individuals within hours, given sufficient computing power. Newly developed tools implemented in SambaR facilitate optimization of filter settings, objective interpretation of ordination analyses, enhance comparability of diversity estimates from reduced representation library SNP data sets, and generate reduced SNP panels and structure-like plots with Bayesian population assignment probabilities. SambaR facilitates rapid population genetic analyses on biallelic SNP data sets by removing three major time sinks: file handling, software learning, and data plotting. In addition, SambaR provides a convenient platform for SNP data storage and management, as well as several new utilities, including guidance in setting appropriate data filters. The SambaR source script, manual and example data set are distributed through GitHub: .

AB  - Species and community-level responses to warming are well documented, with plants and invertebrates known to alter their range, phenology or composition as temperature increases. The effects of warming on biotic interactions are less clearly understood, but can have consequences that cascade through ecological networks. Here, we used a natural soil temperature gradient of 5-35 degrees C in the Hengill geothermal valley, Iceland, to investigate the effects of temperature on plant community composition and plant-invertebrate interactions. We quantified the level of invertebrate herbivory on the plant community across the temperature gradient and the interactive effects of temperature, plant phenology (i.e. development stage) and vegetation community composition on the probability of herbivory for three ubiquitous plant species, Cardamine pratensis, Cerastium fontanum and Viola palustris. We found that the percentage cover of graminoids and forbs increased, while the amount of litter decreased, with increasing soil temperature. Invertebrate herbivory also increased with soil temperature at the plant community level, but this was underpinned by different effects of temperature on herbivory for individual plant species, mediated by the seasonal development of plants and the composition of the surrounding vegetation. This illustrates the importance of considering the development stage of organisms in climate change research given the variable effects of temperature on susceptibility to herbivory at different ontogenetic stages.

AB  - Context: Global habitat fragmentation is a major threat to terrestrial wildlife biodiversity, and habitat restoration is an effective method to protect biodiversity. The Rhinopithecus roxellana (R. roxellana) in Hubei Province, is a first-class key protected wild animal in China, and now the fragmentation of its habitat has seriously affected species expansion and genetic diversity.
   Objectives: To identify the causes of habitat degradation and the location of recoverable habitat patches, improve habitat connectivity, better respond to species expansion and protect biodiversity effectively.
   Methods: Using two level sets of environmental variables to represent the past and current habitat conditions of R. roxellana in the Shennongjia region. MaxEnt model was firstly used to quantify the suitable habitat value to two levels, and then change detection method determined the habitat degradation areas between the two levels. Finally, the important values of recoverable areas were quantified and ranked with graph theory to clarify the priority of restored patches.
   Results: The patches affected by degraded or damaged vegetation were found, then the suitable restoration patches were mapped. At last 5 patches as the priority areas of habitat restoration were conserved.
   Conclusions: Based on MaxEnt, change detection and connectivity analysis, targeted intervention is carried out on the habitat environment of R. roxellana in Shennongjia. As an effective conservation way, restoration of degraded or damaged habitats provides a mechanism to improve habitat connectivity. Here we show a practical method for the increasingly fragmented landscape restoration.

AB  - Male and female reproductive behaviour is typically synchronised. In species such as those in the family Cervidae, reproductive timing is often cued by photoperiod, although in females, it can be dependent on body condition. When a species is introduced to a novel environment, the environment changes, or responses of the sexes to such cues differ, asynchronous reproductive behaviour between males and females may occur. We investigated the seasonality of reproductive behaviour in introduced chital deer in northern Queensland by examining male antler phase in relation to female conception rates. We then analysed the influence of different variables likely to affect the timing of male and female reproductive physiology. The lowest percentage of chital in hard antler in any 1 month in this study was 35% (Fig. 1), but the average value was closer to 50%, thus there was a seasonal peak in antler phase linked with photoperiod. Females conceived at any time of year, but were strongly influenced by the amount of rainfall 3 months prior to conception. This resulted in varying conception peaks year-to-year that often did not correspond to the male's peak in hard antler. In this system, a proportion of males and females were physiologically and behaviourally ready to mate at any time of the year. We predict that differences in the timing of the peaks between the males and females will lead to increased reproductive skew (variation in reproductive success among individual males). This pattern may select for different mating strategies or physiological mechanisms to increase reproductive success.

AB  - Attacks by wolves (Canis lupus) on dogs (C. familiaris) presumably are motivated both by preying and elimination of potential competitors. Regardless of these alternative motivations in wolves, the risk of attacks might be higher when the density of primary prey is low. We examined how many dogs do territorial wolves in Finland kill in relation to the population density of the most abundant ungulates, moose (Alces alces), white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus), and roe deer (Capreolus capreolus). Most attacks by wolves on dogs take place in hunting with dogs. The number of wolf-killed dogs was in highly significant negative relationship to the population density of white-tailed deer and to total ungulate biomass per unit area which is largely determined by the density of white-tailed deer. Our results indicate that abundant wild prey would decrease the risk at which wolves attack dogs. On the other side of the coin prevail two hard facts which wildlife managers had to take a notice. White-tailed deer, although a potential mitigator of wolf-human conflict, is an alien species and a partner in > 6000 traffic collisions annually in Finland. One factor that seemed to increase the risk of wolf attacks on dogs is the low ungulate density in regions where moose is the only remarkable ungulate prey. Higher moose densities could decrease the risk of attacks, but on the other hand, higher densities could increase the risk of serious traffic collisions and browsing damages in forests.

AB  - Coral-algal interactions are pivotal in reef ecosystems globally as they can scale up ecosystem levels and lead to dominance shifts. In this study, we conducted a systematic review of global coral-algal interactions, identifying the most studied locations, species, and types of interactions. We then assessed how these interactions may be impacted by consumers and climate change. Over the past 20 years (2001-2020), coral and algae interactions were mostly explored in the Pacific, and the Caribbean and US East Coast, where branching and massive corals were the focus, while other coral growth forms received less attention, and effects on algae were often overlooked. Adult corals were generally reported to be damaged when directly interacting with algae through physical abrasion or allelopathy. Conversely, algae interactions were found to have a positive impact on juvenile corals by facilitating larval recruitment and settlement. As expected, coral-algal interactions and the type of coral-algal relationships vary globally, most likely due to differences in abiotic conditions, community composition and the number of studies performed in a region. Despite the large emphasis on the role of consumers in controlling coral-algal interactions, few studies directly explored the effects of herbivory on coral-algal interactions. Given the growing evidence that ocean warming and acidification can reduce the competitive ability of corals, understanding the dynamic relationships between coral, algae, and consumers under future climate change conditions is crucial in predicting future coral recruitment potential and reef composition patterns. Here, we highlight the main findings from coral-algal interaction studies performed in the last 20 year and point to future directions, such as: 1) diversifying location, coral species, growth forms and life phases; 2) considering effects on both sides of interaction, not neglecting effects on algae; and 3) taking a closer look into the role of consumers and microbiomes. Advancing our understanding of coral-algal interactions, as well as how these interactions shift under changing conditions, is critical in predicting how coral reef ecosystems may operate in the future.

AB  - It is crucial to understand the spatio-temporal dynamics of human-wildlife conflict (HWC) due to its serious consequences. This study analysed 34,596 unprecedented, geotagged HWC data points from the Southern Western Ghats of Karnataka, collected from 2019 to 2023. The data were categorized into human-elephant conflicts (HEC), human-carnivore conflicts (HCC), and other types. To identify the factors influencing these conflicts, we integrated various geospatial layers, including land use land cover (LULC), tree loss data, digital elevation model (DEM), road network, and settlements. We employed a range of geoprocessing and visualization tools such as spatial grid analysis, clustering, kernel density estimation, optimized hotspots, and spatial interpolation using kriging. Elephants, tigers, leopards, wild boars, and gaurs contributed to 99.6% of incidences, with HEC accounting for 92.1% of incidents and 87.4% of the total compensation. Key impacting factors included a loss of 5741 hectares of tree cover over the past two decades (at a rate of 261 ha/year), road network (53%), elevation between 1000-1500 m (86%), and settlements. Elephants were responsible for all types of damages across all proximities. The spatially explicit HWC field data demonstrated significant advantages over the conventional approaches. The generated HWC clusters and hotspots provide valuable insights for effective HWC management practices. These hotspots are crucial for strategic planning and can be effectively applied to other similar landscapes globally.

AB  - Parturition timing has long been a topic of interest in ungulate research. However, few studies have examined parturition timing at fine scale (e.g., <1 day). Predator activity and environmental conditions can vary considerably with diel timing, which may result in selective pressure for parturition to occur during diel times that maximize the likelihood of neonate survival. We monitored parturition events and early-life survival of elk (Cervus canadensis) and mule deer (Odocoileus hemionus) in Utah, USA to better understand diel timing of parturition in temperate ungulates. Diel timing of parturition was moderately synchronous among conspecifics and influenced by environmental variables on the date of parturition. For elk, parturition events were most common during the morning crepuscular period and generally occurred later (i.e., closer to 12:00) when a relatively large proportion of the moon was illuminated. For mule deer, parturition events were most common during the diurnal period and generally occurred later (i.e., closer to 15:00) on cold, wet dates. Diel timing of parturition did not influence neonate survival, but larger datasets may be required to verify the apparent lack of influence. Although additional work could evaluate alternative variables that might affect parturition timing, our data provide an improved and finer scale understanding of reproductive ecology and phenology in ungulates.

AB  - Efficient wildlife management requires precise monitoring methods, for example to estimate population density, reproductive success, and survival. Here, we compared the efficiency of drone (equipped with a RGB camera) and ground approaches to detect and observe GPS-collared female moose Alces alces and their calves. We also quantified how drone (n = 42) and ground (n = 41) approaches affected moose behavior and space use (n = 24 individuals). The average time used for drone approaches was 17 min compared to 97 min for ground approaches, with drone detection probability being higher (95% of adult female moose and 88% of moose calves) compared to ground approaches (78% of adult females and 82% of calves). Drone detection success increased at lower drone altitudes (50-70 m). Adult female moose left the site in 35% of drone approaches (with > 40% of those moose becoming disturbed once the drone hovered < 50 m above ground) compared to 56% of ground approaches. We failed to find short-term effects (3 h after approaches) of drone approaches on moose space use, but moose moved > fourfold greater distances and used larger areas after ground approaches (compared to before the approaches had started). Similarly, longer-term (24 h before and after approaches) space use did not differ between drone approaches compared to days without known disturbance, but moose moved comparatively greater distances during days of ground approaches. In conclusion, we could show that drone approaches were highly efficient to detect adult moose and their calves in the boreal forest, being faster and less disturbing than ground approaches, making them a useful tool to monitor and study wildlife.

AB  - Landscape changes resulting from human activities have resulted in range restrictions and substantial reductions in population sizes of most animals. The construction of hydroelectric dams has the same effect on species, but the study of their impact on semi-aquatic megafauna species is limited. We examined the response of a Hippopotamus amphibius population to the inundation of their habitat after the construction of a hydroelectric dam in Bui National Park, Ghana. We conducted an abundance and distribution survey of H. amphibius and compared the population size from our results with a pre-dam construction survey to determine changes in the abundance and distribution of the species within the focal area. Furthermore, we conducted a landscape analysis to estimate land cover before and after the dam construction and determined if the changes in land cover were related to the changes in population of H. amphibius. Finally, we conducted selected interviews to understand additional threats to the species perceived by the local population, as indirect effects of the dam construction. Contrary to our original hypothesis on an increase in the abundance of H. amphibius in the medium term (within a decade) through population recovery after the disturbances caused by the construction of the dam, we found lower numbers of H. amphibius after the dam construction, compared to the pre-dam results. The results indicated a reduced abundance from 209 H. amphibius individuals in 2003 to 64 H. amphibius individuals in 2021. Some individuals may have migrated to areas outside the reserve during damming when their habitat was disturbed. The amount of land covered by water increased from 0.41% before damming to 19.01% after damming, which flooded the resting and grazing sites of the H. amphibius. We conclude that the abundance and distribution of H. amphibius significantly and negatively decreased after the construction of the dam at the Bui National Park. We tentatively relate this decrease to the species' semi aquatic ecology and sensitivity to changes in both the terrestrial and aquatic environment. The activities of human settlement encroachment such as poaching, as well as associated land cover changes, affected the stability of the H. amphibius population. However, as the species can survive in the medium to long term when effective management plans are implemented, we recommend H. amphibius to be given high conservation priorities by enhancing strict laws for habitat protection.

AB  - Shelter-building insects are important ecosystem engineers, playing critical roles in structuring arthropod communities. Nonetheless, the influence of leaf shelters and arthropods on plant-associated microbiota remains largely unexplored. Arthropods that visit or inhabit plants can contribute to the leaf microbial community, resulting in significant changes in plant-microbe interactions. By artificially constructing leaf shelters, we provide evidence that shelter-building insects influence not only the arthropod community structure but also impact the phyllosphere microbiota. Leaf shelters exhibited higher abundance and richness of arthropods, changing the associated arthropod community composition. These shelters also altered the composition and community structure of phyllosphere microbiota, promoting greater richness and diversity of bacteria at the phyllosphere. In leaf shelters, microbial diversity positively correlated with the richness and diversity of herbivores. These findings demonstrate the critical role of leaf shelters in structuring both arthropod and microbial communities through altered microhabitats and species interactions.
   This research demonstrates that ecosystem engineers, through the construction of leaf shelters, play a critical role in shaping not only arthropod community assembly but also the dynamics of the phyllosphere microbial community. We identified specific bacterial taxa with strong associations with leaf shelters, revealing a shift in microbial community dynamics with potentially significant implications for host plant health and resilience.image

AB  - Over the last century, a significant decline in the population size of the Nubian Capra nubiana has been observed across its distribution range. This decline is attributed to the changes in natural resources, including water and foraging site capacity, due to the ongoing climate change. We applied species distribution models (SDMs) to investigate the response of C. nubiana to projected climate change in the next decades. We fitted ensemble SDMs with recently developed climate data based on climate models and two different dispersal scenarios to minimize the uncertainty and bias in our SDMs prediction. Our SDMs predicted a significant shrinkage of the distribution range of the C. nubiana in the coming decades, where C. nubiana may lose ca. 60% of its area of occupancy before 2050, while it may become extinct (lose > 90% of its projected area) before the end of the current century. Our results call for urgent conservation intervention at global and national scales to halt the impact of climate change on one of the remaining top mountain ungulate species in desert ecosystems.

AB  - Although it is well established that density dependence drives changes in organismal abundance over time, relatively little is known about how density dependence affects variation in abundance over space. We tested the hypothesis that spatial trade-offs between food and safety can change the drivers of population distribution, caused by opposing patterns of density-dependent habitat selection (DDHS) that are predicted by the multidimensional ideal free distribution. We addressed this using winter aerial survey data of northern Yellowstone elk (Cervus canadensis) spanning four decades. Supporting our hypothesis, we found positive DDHS for food (herbaceous biomass) and negative DDHS for safety (openness and roughness), such that the primary driver of habitat selection switched from food to safety as elk density decreased from 9.3 to 2.0 elk/km(2). Our results demonstrate how population density can drive landscape-level shifts in population distribution, confounding habitat selection inference and prediction and potentially affecting community-level interactions.

AB  - Endozoochorous seed dispersal by ungulates can facilitate the dispersal of seeds over long dis-tances. Endozoochorous seed dispersal can also result in the ecological filtering of plant species by dispersing plant seeds with distinctive traits. The Korean water deer (Hydropotes inermis argyr-opus) is a potential long-distance seed dispersal vector in lowland areas of South Korea. In this study, to test the endozoochorous seed dispersal role of Korean water deer in forested areas, we collected 202 fresh fecal pellet group samples in Taehwa Research Forest, Gwangju City, Gyeonggi Province, South Korea. Additionally, we conducted a vegetation survey to compare the traits of dispersed seeds from feces with the seed traits of flora in the study site. To test whether the composition of species traits dispersed by endozoochory is consistent with that of lowland areas, which consist of forested hills, arable land, and wetlands, we compared the results with a former study conducted in the lowlands. From the seedling emergence method applied to feces, we found a total of 22 species and 115 seedlings. Among 202 fecal pellet groups, 19.8% had at least one germinable seed. Species of forbs, with small-sized seeds (<= 2 mm in length), from open habitat, and seeds without special morphology for dispersal are most frequently dispersed through Korean water deer endozoochory. These traits were consistent with the former endo-zoochory study conducted in a lowland area, irrespective of the different available flora. Therefore, we suggest that deer can potentially disperse seeds with the aforementioned traits to forest plant communities, acting as a consistent ecological filter through endozoochory.

AB  - Productivity is a primary indicator when assessing plant communities or their responses to various stimuli, but it can be difficult and costly to determine. Adding to this complication is the retention of standing litter from previous years' growth intermingled with current-year biomass. The most accurate and commonly applied method for estimating productivity is to clip and manually sort vegetation to separate current-year and previous years' growth. Because sorting is costly, it is often only done for subsamples or not done at all. Without ac-counting for previous years' growth, productivity estimates will be biased upward for conditions that accumulate more standing dead material, which is problematic when comparing treatments such as fire or different levels of herbivory. We tested whether line-point intercept methods could be adapted to determine proportions of current-year and older vegetation and estimate current-year biomass directly or by calculating the product of percent current-year intercepts and total standing crop. Data were collected by seven observers across four years and five experiments in northern mixed prairie using a total of 306 plots. Point-intercept transects with 20-cm spacing between points were used to determine number of intercepts for current-year and older vegetation and compared with data derived by clipping, manually sorting and weighing herbaceous vegetation. Regression analyses were used to test relationships between 1) total standing crop and total point intercepts; 2) current-year biomass and current-year point intercepts; 3) percent current-year biomass based on manual sorting versus point intercept methods; and 4) sorted current-year biomass and point intercept-derived current-year biomass. Number of intercepts per 100 points was positively related to total standing crop and current-year biomass, but r2 values were only 0.49 and 0.53. The relationship between manually-sorted current-year biomass and that derived from the product of point-intercept percentages and total standing crop was positive, explained 96 % of the variation, and had a mean absolute error of 122 kg ha-1. Point-intercept sampling is more efficient than manual sorting and can provide more indicators, including cover and diversity. Data indicate point intercept methods are accurate and can replace manual sorting of current-year herbaceous biomass.

AB  - Tropical landscapes are perishing due to high rates of land-use change. In West Africa, Guinea-Bissau has lost 77% of its closed-canopy forest over the last 25 years mostly due to the expansion of cashew monoculture. To date, understanding how species cope with such changes remains a conservation priority for the region. Here, we examine mammal species composition, richness and photographic rate, in addition to trophic-guild photographic rate across closed-canopy sub-humid forests and cashew orchards in the Cantanhez National Park, southwest Guinea-Bissau. Mammals were surveyed using one camera trap at each of the 24 sites, half of which were located in forest and half in cashew orchards, with their local and landscape-scale variables measured. Based on 709 trap-nights, we collected 842 records of 25 mammal species. Local habitat structure-including canopy openness, floor obstruction, density of lianas, palms, and trees, tree species richness, and height-sharply contrasted between forests and cashew orchards. As expected, mammal species composition differed between forests and cashew orchards. Although species richness and overall mammal photographic rate remained unaffected by the variables considered, photographic rate for carnivores was higher in cashew-like habitats, whereas that of insectivores and herbivores was higher in forest-like habitats. Human activity and distance to forest did not affect the response variables considered. Our results indicate that forest conversion into cashew orchards can have negative and positive effects on specific mammal guilds by profoundly changing the local habitat structure. The different guild-level responses unveiled specificity in their vulnerability to this form of land-use change, alerting to a potential disruption in ecosystem functioning. We emphasize the need for policies that limit monoculture expansion while safeguarding the remaining forests, thus maximizing biodiversity persistence across the Afrotropics.
   As paisagens tropicais est & atilde;o desaparecendo devido & agrave;s altas taxas de mudan & ccedil;a no uso da terra. Na & Aacute;frica Ocidental, a Guin & eacute;-Bissau perdeu 77% de sua floresta de dossel fechado nos & uacute;ltimos 25 anos, principalmente pela expans & atilde;o do monocultivo de cajueiros. At & eacute; hoje, compreender como as esp & eacute;cies lidam com essas transforma & ccedil;& otilde;es continua a ser uma prioridade de conserva & ccedil;& atilde;o para a regi & atilde;o.

Os mam & iacute;feros foram monitorados com uma armadilha fotogr & aacute;fica em cada um dos 24 pontos de amostragem-metade em floresta e metade em pomar-e vari & aacute;veis tanto em escala local quanto em escala de paisagem foram mensuradas. Com 709 noites-armadilha, obtivemos 842 registros de 25 esp & eacute;cies de mam & iacute;feros. A estrutura do habitat local-incluindo abertura do dossel, obstru & ccedil;& atilde;o do sub-bosque, densidade de cip & oacute;s, palmeiras e & aacute;rvores, al & eacute;m da riqueza e altura das & aacute;rvores-mostrou forte contraste entre florestas e pomares de cajueiros. Como esperado, a composi & ccedil;& atilde;o de esp & eacute;cies difere entre esses dois tipos de habitat.

AB  - Sand mining has emerged as a pervasive environmental crisis with profound consequences for freshwater ecosystems. However, current conservation efforts primarily focus on regulating mining intensity, often neglecting the long-term ecological consequences that may lead to unforeseen risks. Here, we integrated 20 years of remote sensing data on sand dredging activities with eight field surveys of the megafauna, Yangtze finless porpoise (Neophocaena asiaeorientalis asiaeorientalis) in Poyang Lake, to investigate the long-term impacts of sand mining. Our findings revealed that high-density sand mining creates numerous water-filled depressions during the dry season (equivalent to 153.5 % of the original lake area), which we refer to as sand traps. These activities exert dual impacts on porpoise populations: high-intensity dredging significantly limits porpoise distribution during active mining (p = 0.031); whereas the expansion of sand traps attracts porpoises after mining ceases (p = 0.0016). Within sand trap areas, untransported sediments accumulate to form sand reefs, leading to irregular water depth. Moreover, under extreme dry events, the expansion rate of sand reefs (<1 m water depths) within sand traps is 2.15 times higher than that outside them, further exacerbating the risk of megafauna stranding. In addition to controlling mining intensity, our study highlights the urgent need for mitigating long-term stranding risks from sand mining through ecological water level management, intensified patrolling, and targeted dredging, particularly amid the increasing frequency of extreme drought events.

AB  - Landscape change is a driver of global biodiversity loss. In the western Nearctic, petroleum exploration and extraction is a major contributor to landscape change, with concomitant effects on large mammal populations. One of those effects is the continued expansion of invasive white-tailed deer populations into the boreal forest, with ramifications for the whole ecosystem. We explored deer resource selection within the oil sands region of the boreal forest using a novel application of aerial ungulate survey (AUS) data. Deer locations from AUS were "used" points and together with randomly allocated "available" points informed deer resource selection in relation to landscape variables in the boreal forest. We created a candidate set of generalized linear models representing competing hypotheses about the role of natural landscape features, forest harvesting, cultivation, roads, and petroleum features. We ranked these in an information-theoretic framework. A combination of natural and anthropogenic landscape features best explained deer resource selection. Deer strongly selected seismic lines and other linear features associated with petroleum exploration and extraction, likely as movement corridors and resource subsidies. Forest harvesting and cultivation, important contributors to expansion in other parts of the white-tailed deer range, were not as important here. Stemming deer expansion to conserve native ungulates and maintain key predator-prey processes will likely require landscape management to restore the widespread linear features crossing the vast oil sands region.

AB  - The European bison ( Bison bonasus L.) is a species that has been successfully reintroduced in several European countries and requires ongoing monitoring to protect and restore its biodiversity. This study examines the population dynamics of free-ranging European bison in the Vanatori Neamt Natural Park in Romania, taking into account various local biotic and abiotic factors. Data collected from the collars of several European bison from 2014 to 2019, as well as vector maps of the study area, was used for the analysis. Furthermore, the study identifies the influence of slope and altitude on the distribution patterns of the European bison throughout the seasons. While a confluence of biotic and abiotic factors shapes exploration behavior, the study underscores that food supply and land use exert the most pronounced impact on the sustainability and growth of the European bison population. Despite an exhaustive analysis of correlations between various biotic and abiotic factors with recorded temperatures, no significant results reflecting discernible trends or linkages induced by temperature were obtained. The analysis of GPS collar data revealed that, in the research area, the European bison inhabited areas with forest vegetation for about 74% of their time and places without it for 26%. Over 80% of the localization patterns were found in wooded areas, with fewer than 20% found in non-forest areas, year after year. The age class distribution research shows that the European bisons have a significant preference (more than 55%) for old-growth forests that are older than 100 years. This preference is present in all seasons except winter, when the preference for these types of forests decreases. On the other hand, forests that are younger and less than 60 years old are preferred in the summer and spring, which offers important information on the diverse habitat preferences of the European bison population.

AB  - Relatively little is known about the ecology of the white-backed hog- nosed skunk (Conepatus leuconotus) in the United States. Between June 2015 and September 2016, we used camera traps to document the occurrence and seasonal and circadian activity of white-backed hog-nosed skunks at 21 camera trap stations along the Colorado River through Grand Canyon National Park, Arizona, USA. We detected a minimum of 19 individual skunks, including one mother-offspring pair, at camera traps across a 55-mi (88-km) stretch of river. Seasonal activity, measured as mean number of photographs per night, was lowest in December when average air temperatures were also lowest (10 degrees C), increased in the breeding season between January and March, peaking in February, fell in April and May, and then rose to the highest levels in the summer months of June to September. Circadian activity was primarily nocturnal and appeared to be bimodal with an earlier peak circa 2200 h and a later peak centered on 0200 h. Nocturnal activity was not associated with lunar phase, and skunks were not more active on warmer nights during winter. Given that there was no record of white-backed hog-nosed skunks in the Grand Canyon prior to 2012, we hypothesize that increases in shoreline vegetation since the completion of the Glen Canyon Dam in 1963 has increased invertebrate prey availability, allowing white-backed hog-nosed skunks to colonize the lower reaches of the Colorado River within Grand Canyon National Park.

AB  - The capybara, Hydrochoerus hydrochaeris, is a semiaquatic herbivorous rodent widely distributed in South American wetlands. Some authors have proposed the existence of two species, several subspecies, and different Evolutionarily Significant Units (ESUs) in the Hydrochoerus genus. However, the available genetic studies of capybaras are limited in their geographical scope. Thus, we examined genetic variation in 387 sequences of the mitochondrial control region (124 generated by the authors and 263 obtained from GenBank) and performed phylogeographic analyses to determine patterns of geographic variation in capybaras sampled in seven South American countries, representing a large portion of the distribution range of the species. Based on these analyses, four ESUs were identified. In addition, within one of these units, two distant geographic populations were identified in the Trans-Andean Colombia (putative H. isthmius population) and the cis-Andean area of the Napo River in Peru and Ecuador. This result and the genetic distances between these ESUs agree with the idea of a unique capybara species. Mismatch distributions and Bayesian skyline plots suggested that capybaras have undergone processes of population decline associated with the adverse weather conditions of the late Pleistocene, followed by population expansions associated with the climatic conditions of the Holocene Climatic Optimum. Phylogenetic trees support the previous hypothesis that the species originated in Western Amazon. However, as our results are based on a single mitochondrial fragment, these results are not conclusive. New studies, including samples from other sites and more mitochondrial and nuclear markers, may elucidate the evolutionarily history of capybaras.

AB  - Understanding of secondary succession, long-used as a unifying theme in ecology, continues to be informed by early-20th century chronosequence studies of old fields in the southeastern United States. However, growing evidence suggests classical, site-based indicators of successional change alone are not robust enough to capture realized compositional variation in eastern North American forests a century later. We illustrate how long-term data can provide deeper insight into forest dynamics and help identify additional indicators for predicting successional change. Using 80 years of permanent plot data from 36 forest stands in the Piedmont of North Carolina (USA) as a case study within the model system examined by foundational authors, we examine long-term trends in tree species abundance in both old-field pine forests transitioning to hardwood dominance and long-standing hardwood stands representing a range of historical, topographic, and edaphic conditions. We use a suite of descriptive and multivariate analyses to examine these long-term data and to assess them within the context of site conditions and novel drivers of change (e.g., removal of chronic fire, hurricane damage, increase in herbivore populations, and introduction of non-native plants and pathogens). Results indicate that these southeastern forests have undergone various perturbations that have collectively resulted in forests that are developing differently than predicted by classical models. Of particular note is the low recruitment of putative climax species such as oaks (Quercus spp.) and hickories (Carya spp.) and their replacement by novel understory communities, dramatic loss of dominant species (e.g., Cornus florida) due to nonnative pathogens, overcrowding by invasive exotic species, shifts in stem size distributions due to deer herbivory, and overall accelerated shifts in successional trajectory due to hurricane damage. We propose that potential shifts in predator abundance, nonnative species dispersal risk, pest and pathogen potential, changes in disturbance regimes, and frequency and timing of high-intensity disturbance can interact in various ways leading to variable and sometimes stochastic successional outcomes, and so these variables should be considered repeatedly through time as indicators of successional change in addition to classically-utilized indicators such as underlying site and abundance conditions. Using such a broad (and even dynamic) suite of indicators of forest change can more comprehensively enable accurate, long-term successional floristics modeling and resulting ecological and silvicultural management of temperate forests.

AB  - Animal dung is an ephemeral, nutrient-rich resource that supports constantly changing, highly biodiverse invertebrate communities. The dung of large herbivores is especially attractive to invertebrates. Seven oribatid mite species in seven different families were collected from water buffalo dung from the Kizilirmak Delta on the Black Sea coast of Samsun Province in northern T & uuml;rkiye. One new species, Plakoribates cernekensis n. sp. (Tegoribatidae) is described and illustrated. Bipassalozetes (B.) intermedius (Mihel & ccaron;i & ccaron;, 1954) (Passalozetidae), Oribatella (Sacculoribatella) nasuorum Fujikawa, 2012 (Oribatellidae) and Humerobates rostrolamellatus Grandjean, 1936 (Humerobatidae) are new records for T & uuml;rkiye. Peloptulus montanus Hull, 1914 (Phenopelopidae), Oribatula (O.) interrupta (Willmann, 1939) (Oribatulidae) and Scheloribates (S.) pallidulus (Koch, 1841) (Scheloribatidae) were also collected. Further taxonomic investigation of the richly biodiverse Kizilirmak Delta wetlands would likely reveal many new invertebrate species.

AB  - Introduction Coral bleaching immediately impacts the reef benthos, but effects on fish communities are less well understood because they are often delayed and confounded by anthropogenic interactions.Methods We assessed changes in fish abundance, biomass and community composition before and after the 2015/16 coral bleaching event at Aldabra Atoll, Seychelles, where local human impacts are minimal, but reefs suffered 50% bleaching-induced coral mortality. We monitored 12 shallow (2-5 m water depth) and nine deep (15 m water depth) permanent survey sites using two survey methods: indicator surveys recording 84 taxa over six years (pre-: 2014; post-bleaching: 2016-2019, 2021), sizing fish based on six size-class categories, and extended fish surveys recording 198 taxa over two years (pre-: 2015; post-bleaching: 2020) with size estimates to the nearest cm (excluding fish < 8 cm).Results During indicator surveys, mean fish abundance did not change on deep reefs. However, abundance increased by 77% on shallow reefs between 2014 and 2016, which was mainly driven by increases in herbivores and omnivores, likely as a response to elevated turf algae cover following coral mortality. Overall (and functional group-specific) indicator fish biomass did not differ between 2014 and 2016 and remained at or above pre-bleaching levels throughout 2016-2021. In contrast, extended fish surveys in 2015 and 2020 showed a 55-60% reduction in overall abundance on shallow and deep reefs, and a 69% reduction in biomass on shallow reefs, with decreases in biomass occurring in all functional groups. Biomass on deep reefs did not differ between 2015 and 2020. Multivariate analysis of both data sets revealed immediate and long-lasting differences between pre- and post-bleaching fish community compositions, driven largely by herbivorous, omnivorous and piscivorous taxa.Discussion Results from the indicator surveys suggest that the bleaching event had limited impact on fish abundance and biomass, while the extended surveys recorded changes in abundance and biomass which would otherwise have gone undetected. Our findings improve understanding of the shift a broad community of fish undergoes following a mass coral bleaching event and highlights the value of survey methods that include the full suite of species to detect ecological responses to environmental drivers.

AB  - Protected areas (PAs) play a vital role in wildlife conservation. Nonetheless there is concern and uncertainty regarding how and at what spatial scales anthropogenic stressors influence the occurrence dynamics of wildlife populations inside PAs. Here we assessed how anthropogenic stressors influence occurrence dynamics of 159 mammal species in 16 tropical PAs from three biogeographic regions. We quantified these relationships for species groups (habitat specialists and generalists) and individual species. We used long-term camera-trap data (1,002 sites) and fitted Bayesian dynamic multispecies occupancy models to estimate local colonization (the probability that a previously empty site is colonized) and local survival (the probability that an occupied site remains occupied). Multiple covariates at both the local scale and landscape scale influenced mammal occurrence dynamics, although responses differed among species groups. Colonization by specialists increased with local-scale forest cover when landscape-scale fragmentation was low. Survival probability of generalists was higher near the edge than in the core of the PA when landscape-scale human population density was low but the opposite occurred when population density was high. We conclude that mammal occurrence dynamics are impacted by anthropogenic stressors acting at multiple scales including outside the PA itself.
   Camera-trap data for 159 mammalian species at 1,002 sites across 16 tropical-forest protected areas show how local survival and colonization probabilities of specialist and generalist species are differently affected by human-induced stressors at different spatial scales, such as human population density and forest fragmentation.

AB  - Ecosystem engineers are organisms that affect ecosystem state by modifying the physical habitats in which biological interactions occur. Such engineering effect depends on both the engineers for environmental transformation and the persistency of engineered structures, but the distinction has rarely been considered. Here, we examined their relative effect on ecosystem in terms of ecological resilience. We used a mathematical model of a coral reef that incorporates reciprocal facilitation between corals and herbivores. Coral skeletons create physical habitats and promote habitat complexity, allowing more herbivore grazing on macroalgae, which opens further space for coral colonization. By quantifying resilience in form of its basin of attraction, we found that resilience declined much rapidly with the loss of habitat complexity (engineered structures) than from the loss of either corals (engineers) or herbivores, under the substantial pressures of fishing and eutrophication. This model outcome is in accordance with observed empirical patterns. It arises due to two characteristics of habitat complexity: slow temporal changes and habitat provisioning. Habitat complexity can persist even when corals are lost, facilitating the recovery of herbivores and, in turn, of corals. Our model suggests that, as the persistency of engineered structures increases, their influence on ecosystem dynamics increases and becomes independent from that of ecosystem engineer. Identifying such a distinction and its context are vital to preserving ecosystem resilience and to better avoid catastrophic shifts.

AB  - Conservation of mammals in human-dominated landscapes requires essential information on their ecological aspects. We used camera traps to assess the wild mammal assemblage, their relative abundance, and activity patterns in the human-dominated landscape of Vansda taluka, Gujarat, India. We deployed 80 camera traps in square grids of 2 km(2) resulting in an area coverage of 160 km(2). To assess the mammal assemblage, relative abundance of species, and activity pattern, respectively, we used a count of species, relative abundance index (RAI), and circular statistics. We captured 13 mammals, including the wild pig, Indian hare, leopard, rhesus macaque, common grey mongoose, small Indian civet, common palm civet, Indian crested porcupine, hanuman langur, chital, barking deer, striped hyena, and jungle cat. The wild pig was the most abundant (RAI = 10.29), while the jungle cat was the least abundant (RAI = 0.04) species. Hanuman langur, rhesus macaque, and chital showed diurnal activity, while striped hyena, barking deer, small Indian civet, common palm civet, and Indian crested porcupine showed nocturnal activity. Leopard, wild pig, common grey mongoose, and Indian hare showed cathemeral activity pattern. The present study serves as a baseline for future studies and help formulate conservation strategies for wild mammals in the study area.

AB  - We applied two recent approaches largely used in biological conservation: Threat Analysis (TAN) and Threat Reduction Assessments (TRAs), assessing the effectiveness of a project focused on two water-related bird species (common tern, Sterna hirundo and little tern, Sternula albifrons), commonly breeding in some wetlands of Italy. We used the IUCN standardized lexicon for the classification of threats, utilizing a panel of experts to assess a set of regime attributes (extent, severity and magnitude) of each human-induced disturbance. Our aims were: (i) through the TAN approach, to carry out an arrangement and quantification of the main threats acting on our focal species and select the priority ones; (ii) through the TRA approach, to test the effectiveness of an operational project focused on mitigating the threats and improving the breeding success of species (i.e., building rafts and floating islands to encourage their nesting). Using the TAN approach, experts identified the following human-induced threats (IUCN code): 6.1-Generic disturbance; 7.2-Water stress; 7.3-Salinization; 8.8-Vagrant dogs; 8.8-Mediterranean gulls; 8.8-Wild boars, all significantly different in their magnitude. Among them, wild boars and Mediterranean gulls appeared the priority threats with the greatest extent, intensity and magnitude. Using the TRA approach, after the project, we assessed an overall decrease in the threat magnitude of 23.08% (21.42% when considering only the threats directly affected by our project). These data suggest that further efforts should be devoted to achieving greater effectiveness of conservation actions focused on our target species. With limited time and resources to quantify threats, expert-based approaches could be useful for rapidly assessing the effectiveness of small conservation projects by providing a range of scores obtained following an analytical procedure. In this regard, Threat Analysis and Threat Reduction Assessment could be considered useful tools to support adaptive management in project management cycles.

AB  - Research aimed at understanding the mechanisms underlying the relationship between tree diversity and antagonist infestation is often neglecting resource-use complementarity among plant species. We investigated the effects of tree species identity, species richness, and mycorrhizal type on leaf herbivory and pathogen infestation. We used a tree sapling experiment manipulating the two most common mycorrhizal types, arbuscular mycorrhiza and ectomycorrhiza, via respective tree species in monocultures and two-species mixtures. We visually assessed leaf herbivory and pathogen infestation rates, and measured concentrations of a suite of plant metabolites (amino acids, sugars, and phenolics), leaf elemental concentrations (carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus), and tree biomass. Tree species and mycorrhizal richness had no significant effect on herbivory and pathogen infestation, whereas species identity and mycorrhizal type had. Damage rates were higher in arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) than in ectomycorrhizal (EM) trees. Our structural equation model (SEM) indicated that elemental, but not metabolite concentrations, determined herbivory and pathogen infestation, suggesting that the investigated chemical defence strategies may not have been involved in the effects found in our study with tree saplings. Other chemical and physical defence strategies as well as species identity as its determinant may have played a more crucial role in the studied saplings. Furthermore, the SEM indicated a direct positive effect of AM trees on herbivory rates, suggesting that other dominant mechanisms, not considered here, were involved as well. We found differences in the attribution of elemental concentrations between the two rates. This points to the fact that herbivory and pathogen infestation are driven by distinct mechanisms. Our study highlights the importance of biotic contexts for understanding the mechanisms underlying the effects of biodiversity on tree-antagonist interactions. (c) 2020 The Author(s).

AB  - A worldwide increasing demand for renewable and non-renewable energy resources has been ongoing since the mid-1970s and is projected to increase for the next 2 decades. The effects of oil and natural gas development on wildlife mortality risk may play an important role in mule deer (Odocoileus hemionus) population dynamics. We evaluated the potential effects of oil and natural gas development on mortality risk of mule deer in western North Dakota and eastern Montana, USA. We assessed adult and juvenile female mule deer mortality risk with Poisson point process models using 265 deer fitted with global positioning system (GPS) radio-collars that were deployed from 2013-2016. Mortality covariates included proportion of area disturbed by oil and natural gas development, distance to oil and natural gas development, distance to roads, temperature, snow depth, normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), and age of deer. During the study there was no effect of oil and natural gas development or roads on mule deer mortality, though <1% of all deer locations were within 500 m of active drilling rigs. Mule deer mortality was greatest in winter and spring, and positively related to temperature during these seasons. Estimated annual adult survival probability was 0.79 (95% CI = 0.71-0.85). Given the strong influence of season and temperature variables on mortality risk, weather had the strongest influence on mule deer mortality during this study. Although we did not detect an effect of energy development on mule deer mortality, effects on space use resulting from development could influence deer dynamics in the region through displacement and could occur over longer time scales than we evaluated. This study can be used in pre-development planning in a risk assessment framework to minimize effects of development on mule deer.

AB  - When Pacific salmon (Oncorhynchus spp.) spawn and die, they deliver marine-derived nutrient subsidies to freshwater and riparian ecosystems. These subsidies can alter the behavior, productivity, and abundance of recipient species and their habitats. Isotopes, such as nitrogen-15 (N-15), are often used to trace the destination of marine-derived nutrients in riparian habitats. However, few studies have tested for correlations between stable isotopes and physiological responses of riparian organisms. We examined whether increases in delta N-15 in terrestrial insect bodies adjacent to salmon spawning habitat translate to changes in percent nitrogen content and body size. This involved comparisons between distance from a salmon-bearing river, marine-derived nutrients in soils and insects, soil moisture content, and body size and nitrogen content in two common beetle families (Coleoptera: Curculionidae, Carabidae). As predicted, delta N-15 in riparian soils attenuated with distance from the river but was unaffected by soil moisture. This gradient was mirrored by delta N-15 in the herbivorous curculionid beetles, whereas carabid beetles, which feed at a higher trophic level and are more mobile, did not show discernable patterns in their delta N-15 content. Additionally, neither distance from the river nor body delta N-15 content was related to beetle body size. We also found that nitrogen-15 was not correlated with total percent nitrogen in insect bodies, meaning that the presence of spawning salmon did not increase the percent nitrogen content of these insects. We conclude that while salmon-derived nutrients had entered terrestrial food webs, the presence of delta N-15 alone did not indicate meaningful physiological changes in these insects in terms of percent nitrogen nor body size. While stable isotopes may be useful tracers of marine-derived nutrients, they cannot necessarily be used as a proxy for physiologically important response variables.

AB  - Natural and anthropogenic pressures exert influence on ecosystem structure and function by affecting the physiology and behavior of organisms, as well as the trophic interactions within assemblages. Therefore, understanding how multiple stressors affect aquatic ecosystems can improve our ability to manage and protect these ecosystems and contribute to understanding fundamental ecological principles. Here, we conducted a mesocosm experiment to ascertain the individual and combined effects of multiple stressors on trophic interactions within species in freshwater ecosystems. Furthermore, we investigated how species respond to such changes by adapting their food resources. To mimic a realistic food web, we selected fish and shrimp as top predators, gastropods, zooplankton and zoobenthos as intermediate consumers, with producers (macrophytes, periphyton and phytoplankton) and detritus as basal resources. Twelve different treatments included a control, nutrient loading only, herbicide exposure only, and a combination of nutrient loading and herbicide exposure, each replicated under ambient temperature, constant warming and multiple heat waves to simulate environmental stressors. Our results demonstrated that antagonistic interactions between environmental stressors were widespread in trophic interactions, with a more pronounced and less intense impact observed for the high trophic level species. The responses of freshwater communities to environmental stressors are complex, involving direct effects on individual species as well as indirect effects through species interactions. Moreover, our results confirmed that the combinations of stressors, but not individual stressors, led to a shift to herbivory in top predators, indicating that multiple stressors can be more detrimental to organisms than individual stressors alone. These findings elucidate how changes in the resource utilization of species induced by environmental stressors can potentially influence species interactions and the structural dynamics of food webs in freshwater ecosystems.

AB  - In marine ecosystems, fishing often targets predators, which can drive direct and indirect effects on entire food webs. Marine reserves can induce trophic cascades by increasing predator density and body size, thereby increasing predation pressure on populations of herbivores, such as sea urchins. In California's northern Channel Islands, two species of sea urchins are abundant: the red urchin Mesocentrotus franciscanus, which is targeted by an economically valuable fishery, and the virtually unfished purple urchin Strongylocentrotus purpuratus. We hypothesized that urchin populations inside marine reserves would be depressed by higher predation, but that red urchins would be less affected due to fishing outside reserves. Instead, our analyses revealed that purple urchin populations were unaffected by reserves, and red urchin biomass significantly increased in response to protection. Therefore, urchin biomass overall has increased inside reserves, and we found no evidence that giant kelp is positively affected by reserves. Our results reveal the overwhelming direct effect of protecting fished species in marine reserves over indirect effects that are often predicted but seldom clearly documented. Indirect effects due to marine reserves may eventually occur in some cases, but very effective predators, large reserves or extended time periods may be needed to induce them.

AB  - Social-space-time-behaviour has developed very differently (e.g. a, loner, a herd, a pack) in the animal kingdom and depends on many different factors, like food availability, competition, predator avoidance or disturbances. It is known, that red deer are differently distributed in human disturbed areas compared to areas with less anthropogenic influences. But knowledge about the potential influence of human presence on social associations and interactions is rare, albeit differences may result in changing impacts on the environment, such as habitat utilization and feeding damage. Therefore, we investigated differences in the space use and social association of red deer. We studied two radio-collared herds of non-migratory populations in two study areas, which were comparable in landscape structure and vegetation structure, but differed in accessibility for visitors and the extent of their presence. Between the two study sites we compared the home range size, the differences in the extent of home range overlap within each study site and the space-time association (Jacobs Index) of individuals. Additionally, we present data on seasonal variations of home range sizes and social association all year round. In order to compare human activity in the study sites, we used the data from our long-term camera trap monitoring. The herd in the area with more human activity had significantly smaller home ranges and had greater year-round social associations in almost all seasons, except summer. We assume that smaller home ranges and higher association between animals may result in a higher feeding pressure on plants and a patchier utilization in areas with higher disturbances.

AB  - Background Savanna ecosystems constitute approximately 20% of the Earth's terrestrial surface and are increasingly under threat from various factors including effects of climate change. In Baikiaea plurijuga-dominated woodlands of Botswana, the combination of destructive fire regimes and large elephant populations has been cited as a major cause of adverse vegetation changes in African savanna and woodland systems.Aims We assessed the status of fire regimes in Botswana's premium wildlife eco-tourism Chobe region to determine whether market-based fire management could be applied to support broader ecological fire management and employment outcomes.Methods The methods used were: (1) reconstructed fire regimes from the early 1990s coinciding with the cessation of commercial timber exploitation; (2) combined automated MODIS 250 m and manually derived Landsat 30 m burn scar products to generate a 33-year Fire Frequency Index (FFI); (3) classified regional vegetation structural types derived from a 5-year (2021-2024) early dry season Landsat median image; and (4) assessed dry season elephant population density distributions in relation to fire occurrence.Key results Frequent (on average, one in every 2.5 years) and relatively severe late dry season fires were characteristic in more open-canopied legume-dominated savannas and grasslands in the eastern sector of the project area. Elephant distributions in the dry season were independent of fire occurrence. Wildfires plausibly cause relatively greater impacts to Baikiaea-dominated vegetation macro-structure than elephants.Conclusions Multiple factors including national fire exclusion policy contribute to contemporary fire patterning in the Chobe regional landscape.Implications We suggest that carbon market-based approaches have potential for contributing to ecologically sustainable fire management and local employment opportunities.

AB  - Standing dead structures of habitat-forming organisms (e.g., dead trees, coral skeletons, oyster shells) killed by a disturbance are material legacies that can affect ecosystem recovery processes. Many ecosystems are subject to different types of disturbance that either remove biogenic structures or leave them intact. Here we used a mathematical model to quantify how the resilience of coral reef ecosystems may be differentially affected following structure-removing and structure-retaining disturbance events, focusing in particular on the potential for regime shifts from coral to macroalgae. We found that dead coral skeletons could substantially diminish coral resilience if they provided macroalgae refuge from herbivory, a key feedback associated with the recovery of coral populations. Our model shows that the material legacy of dead skeletons broadens the range of herbivore biomass over which coral and macroalgae states are bistable. Hence, material legacies can alter resilience by modifying the underlying relationship between a system driver (herbivory) and a state variable (coral cover).

AB  - In this exploratory study, we employ an interdisciplinary approach to explore potential synergies and trade-offs between the needs of people and nature in the context of agroecological farming and nature conservation. Ecological field studies and management surveys from six sites were combined with a participatory-deliberative appraisal exercise using the Multi-Criteria Mapping (MCM) method. All six study sites and all four land use options in the appraisal were characterised by the use of large herbivores for agricultural and/or conservation purposes, to varying degrees, and were located in South-East England. MCM participants identified habitat and species diversity, soil health, food production, provision of education and recreational access, as the principal benefits associated with successful management of such sites. Taken overall, their appraisals indicated that a combination of land uses may be best suited to delivering these diverse benefits, but with agroecological (While organic and biodynamic agriculture are subject to legal definition, agroecology offers a more flexible approach and can be viewed as 'a development pathway from input-intensive industrial systems through to highly sustainable, ecological systems'-see Laughton, R. (2017) 'A Matter of Scale', Land Workers Alliance and Centre for Agroecology, Coventry University) farming being perceived as a particularly effective multi-purpose option. Five of the six sites were used for recreational purposes, and in total we recorded five times more humans than wild mammals. Ecological data from the sites indicated that the most conservation-oriented sites performed best in terms of species richness and activity (birds, mammals, bats and invertebrates) and number of species of conservation concern. However, beta diversity metrics indicated important variation in the species assemblages recorded within and between sites. Whereas both agroecological farms in our study produced the greatest weight of saleable meat per unit area, the site that produced the most meat also demonstrated consistently strong performance across many biodiversity metrics. Overall, expert perspectives and the performance of our study sites suggests that combinations of diverse approaches to the management of large herbivores, within a 'wildlife-friendly' envelope, are consistent with providing for the diverse needs of people and nature within shared landscapes.

AB  - The forest structure of Canada's northern unmanaged boreal forests are not well characterized despite their critical importance for ecosystem services such as carbon storage and caribou habitat, as well as their vulnerability to climate change and increasing disturbance rates, especially wildfire. Spaceborne lidar observations acquired from the Advanced Topographic Laser Altimeter System (ATLAS) instrument onboard the Ice, Cloud and Elevation Satellite-2 (ICESat-2), enables monitoring of forest structure in these remote northern ecosystems and characterization of long-term post-fire recovery; however, ICESat-2 is a sampling instrument, acquiring data transects rather than wall-to-wall data coverage. By imputing ICESat-2 estimates of canopy height using annual time-series (1984-2021) of spectral indices, change metrics, and land cover metrics from Landsat surface reflectance composites, we derived annual, spatially explicit, wall-to-wall estimates of canopy height for the period 1984-2021 across a 19.6 Mha area of boreal forests in northwestern Ontario and a 630,000 ha area of managed boreal forest further south that had coincident airborne laser scanning (ALS) data for validation. The accuracy of the imputation of derived canopy height estimates in the northwestern site was assessed using a reserved set of ICESat-2 observations (r = 0.76; RMSD = 3.04 m, pRMSD = 33.9%, MD = -0.10 m, and pMD = -1.0%). Using coincident ALS data, the accuracy of the imputed canopy heights in the southern study site were also assessed (r = 0.81; RMSD = 3.65 m, pRMSD = 25.87%), MD = -0.70 m, pMD = 4.96%). Examination of height dynamics post fire indicated that canopy height decreased 8-10 years post fire and recovered between 60% and 85% of pre-fire canopy height within 30 years post fire. The approach presented could readily be extended to similar northern boreal forest areas to provide broad-scale characterizations of fire impacts on forest structure and subsequent recovery.

AB  - Recent ecological research suggests that, in general, mixtures are more resistant to insect herbivores and pathogens than monocultures. However, we know little about mixtures with non-native trees, where enemy release could lead to patterns that differ from commonly observed relationships among native species. This becomes particularly relevant when considering that adaptation strategies to climate change increasingly promote a larger share of non-native tree species, such as North American Douglas fir in Central Europe. We studied leaf damage on European beech (Fagus sylvatica) saplings and mature trees across a wide range of site conditions in monocultures and mixtures with phylogenetically distant conifers native Norway spruce (Picea abies) and non-native Douglas fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii). We analyzed leaf herbivory and pathogen damage in relation to tree diversity and composition effects, as well as effects of environmental factors and plant characteristics. We observed lower sapling herbivory and tree sucking damage on beech in non-native Douglas fir mixtures than in beech monocultures, probably due to a lower herbivore diversity on Douglas fir trees, and higher pathogen damage on beech saplings in Norway spruce than Douglas fir mixtures, possibly because of higher canopy openness. Our findings suggest that for low diversity gradients, tree diversity effects on leaf damage can strongly depend on tree species composition, in addition to modifications caused by feeding guild and tree ontogeny. Moreover, we found that nutrient capacity modulated the effects of tree diversity, composition, and environmental factors, with different responses in sites with low or high nutrient capacity. The existence of contrasting diversity effects based on tree species composition provides important information on our understanding of the relationships between tree diversity and plant-herbivore interactions in light of non-native tree species introductions. Especially with recent Norway spruce die-off, the planting of Douglas fir as replacement is likely to strongly increase in Central Europe. Our findings suggest that mixtures with Douglas fir could benefit the survival or growth rates of beech saplings and mature trees due to lower leaf damage, emphasizing the need to clearly identify and compare the potential benefits and ecological trade-offs of non-native tree species in forest management under ongoing environmental change.

AB  - Climate change poses a major threat to biodiversity, thus understanding how these impacts manifest, and how they might be mitigated is a major priority for conservation biologists. Yet understanding the impacts is complex, due to the nuanced impacts on species directly, as well as resources they depend on. In this study, we examined how biotic interactions, specifically plant availability, effects the distribution patterns of an ungulate, i.e., Marco Polo sheep (Ovis ammon polii). Our findings suggest that plant availability is a major predictor of the sheep's range. The species distribution models (SDMs) incorporating biotic interactions, i.e., plant availability, increases accuracy in predicting the underlying implications of climate change on ungulates compared to models that exclude these interactions. Our results reveal discrepancies in ungulate spatial distribution patterns, with future suitable habitat contraction being less pronounced when incorporating biotic variables than without biotic variables (27 % vs. 33 %). Therefore, ignoring biotic interaction may overestimate the impacts of climate change, resulting in the inefficient allocation of scarce conservation resources. Additionally, our results indicate the importance of protected areas (PAs) as important climatic refugia, though less than half of the range is currently within PAs. This study emphasizes the non-negligible role of biotic interactions in forecasting the geographical distribution of ungulates, which has critical implications for the future wildlife conservation.

AB  - Direct exploitation through fishing is driving dramatic declines of wildlife populations in ocean environments, particularly for predatory and large-bodied taxa. Despite wide recognition of this pattern and well-established consequences of such trophic downgrading on ecosystem function, there have been few empirical studies examining the effects of fishing on whole system trophic architecture. Understanding these kinds of structural impacts is especially important in coral reef ecosystems-often heavily fished and facing multiple stressors. Given the often high dietary flexibility and numerous functional redundancies in diverse ecosystems such as coral reefs, it is important to establish whether web architecture is strongly impacted by fishing pressure or whether it might be resilient, at least to moderate-intensity pressure. To examine this question, we used a combination of bulk and compound-specific stable isotope analyses measured across a range of predatory and low-trophic-level consumers between two coral reef ecosystems that differed with respect to fishing pressure but otherwise remained largely similar. We found that even in a high-diversity system with relatively modest fishing pressure, there were strong reductions in the trophic position (TP) of the three highest TP consumers examined in the fished system but no effects on the TP of lower-level consumers. We saw no evidence that this shortening of the affected food webs was being driven by changes in basal resource consumption, for example, through changes in the spatial location of foraging by consumers. Instead, this likely reflected internal changes in food web architecture, suggesting that even in diverse systems and with relatively modest pressure, human harvest causes significant compressions in food chain length. This observed shortening of these food webs may have many important emergent ecological consequences for the functioning of ecosystems impacted by fishing or hunting. Such important structural shifts may be widespread but unnoticed by traditional surveys. This insight may also be useful for applied ecosystem managers grappling with choices about the relative importance of protection for remote and pristine areas and the value of strict no-take areas to protect not just the raw constituents of systems affected by fishing and hunting but also the health and functionality of whole systems.

AB  - Herbicides have been widely used to manage woody vegetation, but quantification of their effects is often lacking. We documented the impacts of a commonly used clopyralid + aminopyralid + triclopyr herbicide blend on Prosopis velutina Woot. in grazed Sonoran Desert grasslands in southern Arizona. Similar to other applications of comparable herbicide blends in the region, we recorded only modest and shortterm impacts. P. velutina mortality was 7%. Foliar cover declined to 9.2% +/- 0.80% the month following treatment and was comparable across size classes. Cover reductions persisted for similar to 2 yr, by which time it was comparable on treated and control plants (66.9% and 69.3%, respectively). On the basis of eddy covariance tower monitoring of carbon and water flux, soil temperature, and soil moisture, we suggest how knowledge of diurnal and seasonal changes in physiological activity (e.g., evapotranspiration, gross primary production) and environmental conditions may help identify more optimal times to apply herbicides to improve their efficacy. Future research should explore P. velutina response to herbicides at various levels of photosynthetic activity in response to soil temperature and soil moisture in the subtropical North American Monsoon climate system of the Sonoran Desert. From a broader ecosystems trophic perspective, our results also suggest a need to ascertain how herbicide-induced reductions in P. velutina pod and seed production may impact native herbivore communities.

AB  - Plant species loss, driven by global changes and human activities, can have cascading effects on other trophic levels, such as arthropods, and alter the multitrophic structure of ecosystems. While the relationship between plant diversity and arthropod communities has been well-documented, few studies have explored the effects of species composition variation or plant functional groups. In this study, we conducted a long-term plant removal experiment to investigate the impact of plant functional group loss (specifically targeting tall grasses and sedges, as well as tall or short forbs) on arthropod diversity and their functional groups. Our findings revealed that the removal of plant functional groups resulted in increased arthropod richness, abundance and the exponential of Shannon entropy, contrary to the commonly observed positive correlation between plant diversity and consumer diversity. Furthermore, the removal of different plant groups had varying impacts on arthropod trophic levels. The removal of forbs had a more pronounced impact on herbivores compared to graminoids, but this impact did not consistently cascade to higher-trophic arthropods. Notably, the removal of short forbs had a more significant impact on predators, as evidenced by the increased richness, abundance, the exponential of Shannon entropy, inverse Simpson index and inverse Berger-Parker index of carnivores and abundance of omnivores, likely attributable to distinct underlying mechanisms. Our results highlight the importance of plant species identity in shaping arthropod communities in alpine grasslands. This study emphasizes the crucial role of high plant species diversity in controlling arthropods in natural grasslands, particularly in the context of plant diversity loss caused by global changes and human activities.

Due to its status as an introduced species and an important game animal within Victoria, management of the species is complex. Given this complexity, genetic studies can provide important information regarding population structure and diversity which can assist in controlling problematic populations of hog deer, while also ensuring viable game stock in sites managed as game reserves. The aim of this study was to investigate the population genetic structure and diversity of the Victorian hog deer 150 years after introduction using short tandem repeats (STRs). Hog deer samples were collected across 15 sites of differing management regimes in the Gippsland region of Victoria and genotyped for 13 polymorphic STR loci. Up to four distinct genetic clusters were identified across the sites sampled, suggesting that despite low observed genetic diversity, population structure is present across their range. It was also possible to detect evidence of recent translocations among populations. This study suggests that the presence of distinct genetic clusters may enable management of separate genetic units, considering invasive species and game management objectives.

AB  - COVID-19 lockdown measures frequently interrupted the management efforts of invasive species, as in El Palmar National Park in north-eastern Argentina, where wild boar (Sus scrofa) abundance indices and damage to ground rooting and Butia yatay palm seedlings or juveniles had been held in check through systematic controlled shooting over 12 years. We assessed the impact of program interruption on wild boar indices of abundance and damage before and after the resumption of culling operations at the park scale, and examined the relationship between abundance indices and damage. The occurrence and density of wild boar sign (dung, tracks, and ground rooting) and uprooted palm seedlings or juveniles was monitored through systematic line transects (2017-2018) and permanent random plots (austral summer 2020-winter 2022, baseline and endpoint, respectively) deployed park-wide, and in long-term fixed-strip transects in palm habitat (2019-2022). The frequency of plots with any wild boar sign at baseline (15 +/- 4.0%) increased four-fold a year later (58 +/- 5.0%) following program interruption while ground rooting surged six-fold; both metrics peaked in winter post-interruption. Ground rooting reached unprecedented levels by endpoint, increased exponentially in palm habitats, and its frequency rose non-linearly with increasing indices of wild boar abundance. Uprooted palm seedlings or juveniles were rare pre-interruption, peaked by endpoint, and their frequency was positively associated with ground rooting in palm habitats. The prolonged interruption of management efforts combined with region-wide lockdown led to the rapid resurgence of wild boar population indices and substantial damage to target conservation values, with possibly significant loss of the benefits accrued and additional costs to return the system to a desirable state.

AB  - Known as the "roof of the world", the Tibetan Plateau hosts the largest pastoral alpine ecosystem in the world. Nevertheless, there is currently no consensus on how soil organic carbon (SOC) stock changes after livestock grazing on the grassland of this region. Here, a meta-analysis was performed based on 55 published studies to quantify the livestock grazing-induced changes in SOC stock (0-30 cm) in grassland on the Tibetan Plateau. The results showed that livestock grazing significantly increased bulk density by an average of 11.5%, indicating that significant soil compaction was caused by livestock grazing. In contrast, SOC content and stock significantly decreased by 14.4% and 11.9% after livestock grazing, respectively. The decline rate of SOC stock was higher in alpine meadow (-12.4%) than that in alpine steppe (-8.8%), but there was no significant difference between the two rates. The SOC stocks decreased by 10.1%, 6.2% and 20.1% under light grazing, moderate grazing and heavy grazing, respectively. The decline rate of SOC stock under moderate grazing was significantly lower than that under heavy grazing. For different livestock types, it was observed that yak grazing significantly decreased SOC stock by 15.3%. Although the decline rate induced by yak grazing was higher than those induced by Tibetan sheep grazing and mixed grazing, no significant difference was detected among them. Similarly, the grazing-induced SOC declines also did not differ significantly among subgroups of grazing season. The positive relationships between SOC stock and plant biomass indicated that the decreased plant biomass was a likely reason for the declined SOC stock under grazing condition. The findings suggested that moderate grazing with Tibetan sheep in the warm season may minimize SOC losses from grazing activities in alpine grassland on the Tibetan Plateau.

AB  - Prioritizing threatened species protection has been proposed as an efficient response to the global biodiversity crisis. We used in-situ conservation data to predict the potential habitat area of four flagship species: the giant panda (Ailuropoda melanoleuca), golden monkey (Rhinopithecus roxella quinlingensis), takin (Budorcas taxicolor bedfordi), and crested ibis (Nipponia nippon). We then designed systematic conservation planning schemes for various scenarios given species habitat preferences and anthropogenic activities and conducted a costeffectiveness assessment. Broadly, the geographical distributions of suitable habitats for giant pandas, golden monkeys, and takins exhibited high spatial congruence (correlation coefficients of 0.59-0.90), and areas of high congruence were concentrated in the northern portion of the Qinling Mountains at high elevation (>1500 m). By contrast, the crested ibis was negatively correlated in space with its sympatric species (-0.47 to -0.29). Crested ibis habitats were clustered in the southern portion of the region at low elevation (<1500 m). A hypothetical conservation priority area (CPA) based on the giant panda, golden monkey, and takin included 39.64% of the Qinling Mountains and 100%, 99.99%, 99.59%, and 7.84% of the suitable habitats for giant pandas, golden monkeys, takins, and crested ibises, respectively. The same area included 99.07%, 70.87%, and 39.96% of the highly important areas for the ecosystem services of biodiversity conservation, water supply, and soil retention, respectively, and only 4.62%, 16.83%, and 13.4% of the area were associated with high-density residential area, impervious surfaces, and cropland, respectively. Therefore, we conclude that a CPA approach based on the specialist species could result in effective, low-cost biodiversity conservation in the Qinling Mountains. However, we note that existing protected areas account for only 26.52% of the CPA. We recommend that the main area of the proposed Qinling National Park should be based on the CPA developed here.

AB  - The wild boar (Sus scrofa) was introduced to Patagonia in the early 20th century through multiple independent events in Junin de los Andes, the Huemul Peninsula, and Victoria Island (Neuquen Province). Despite uncertainties surrounding their origin, questions persist regarding the extent of hybridization between these populations and domestic or feral pigs. This study presents (i) an analysis of the genetic variability and phylogenetic origin of the sub-Andean population (Neuqu & eacute;n province) of wild pigs from Patagonia using the molecular marker control region and (ii) a population genotyping with the MC1R marker to identify pure wild boar or domestic alleles in the zone. The results confirm the Iberian origin of the Patagonian wild pigs population and suggest potential genetic erosion due to genetic drift, as evidenced by low diversity values (Hd = 0.7950 +/- 0.0510 and pi = 0.0036 +/- 0.0005) compared with previous studies from Argentina and Europe. Moreover, MC1R genotyping reveals the presence of hybrids in the region (allelic frequencies E+ = 0.5, E-PD2 = 0.250, E-D1e = 0.250), with a pure core observed on Isla Victoria, Nahuel Huapi National Park (allelic frequency E+ = 1). These findings are significant as hybrids contribute to the invasive potential of the species, a concern particularly pertinent in areas with protected habitats. Additionally, the identification of a pure wild boar population on Isla Victoria suggests its potential importance as one of the few remaining pure populations in the country.

AB  - A paleontological deposit near San Clemente de Terapa represents one of the very few Rancholabrean North American Land Mammal Age sites within Sonora, Mexico. During that time, grasslands were common, and the climate included cooler and drier summers and wetter winters than currently experienced in northern Mexico. Here, we demonstrate restructuring in the mammalian community associated with environmental change over the past 40,000 years at Terapa. The fossil community has a similar number of carnivores and herbivores whereas the modern community consists mostly of carnivores. There was also a 97% decrease in mean body size (from 289 kg to 9 kg) because of the loss of megafauna. We further provide an updated review of ungulates and carnivores, recognizing two distinct morphotypes of Equus, including E. scotti and a slighter species; as well as Platygonus compressus; Camelops hesternus; Canis dirus; and Lynx rufus; and the first regional records of Palaeolama mirifica, Procyon lotor, and Smilodon cf. S. fatalis. The Terapa mammals presented here provide a more comprehensive understanding of the faunal community restructuring that occurred in northern Mexico from the late Pleistocene to present day, indicating further potential biodiversity loss with continued warming and drying of the region.

AB  - Caribou (Rangifer tarandus) rely on the short Arctic growing season to restore body condition, support the demands of lactation, and prepare for the long arctic winter, making them susceptible to even small changes in forage availability or quality. Body condition in the summer and autumn is linked to winter survival rates and fecundity in cows, critical factors in the productivity of caribou populations. Climate change predictions of warmer and wetter northern winters suggest increased snowfall over Alaska's North Slope, which has recently been verified between 1995 and 2017. However, a comprehensive analysis of how deeper snow will affect caribou forage quality is absent across Alaska. In this study, we quantify how snow depth alters the quality and seasonality of caribou forage using a long-term (24 yr) International Tundra Experiment snow depth manipulation to evaluate how winter climate change scenarios may affect tussock tundra systems in northern Alaska. Deeper snow in prior winters leads to increases in growing season leaf N and digestible protein (DP) in deciduous shrubs (Salix spp. and Betula spp.) and graminoids (Carex spp. and Eriophorum spp.), but not evergreen dwarf shrubs (Rhododendron spp. and Vaccinium spp.). Dry matter digestibility varied among species with small differences (<5%) associated with snow depth. Most striking was the discovery that deeper snow in the prior winter increased the duration of DP levels above the minimum threshold for protein gain in caribou by as much as 25 d in Salix pulchra and 6-9 d in Betula nana and Carex bigelowii in late summer and early autumn. Consequently, deeper winter snow may provide an extended window of opportunity for foraging and the accumulation of lean body mass and fat reserves which promote winter survival and successful calving the following spring and potentially improve the productivity of caribou in northern Alaska.

AB  - Potential negative artificial selection on horn size is a concern for many harvested ungulates. The mountain goat (Oreamnos americanus) has distinct black horns, but targeting animals based on horn size in the field can be challenging. We analyzed over 23,000 horn records that included base circumference and total length, from which we also derived horn volume, from mountain goats harvested in Alaska, British Columbia, and the Northwest Territories from 1980 to 2016. We tested 3 potential drivers of horn size variation: geographical location, environmental conditions, and artificial selection. We found no support for a latitudinal effect with surprisingly little variation across the sampling distribution. The Pacific Decadal Oscillation had the largest effect outside age in the model, suggesting a role of climate in shaping variation. Mountain goats harvested closer to roads had larger horns, indicating that ease of access might allow hunters to be more selective, though the effect size was small. Our findings reinforce the value of accurate and complete record keeping on horn size, age, and sex of harvested animals, and highlight the importance of explicitly considering climate and accessibility when devising management strategies for the mountain goat.

AB  - Glyphosate-based herbicides (GBH) are an effective, yet controversial, tool for reducing the survival and growth of deciduous vegetation in commercial tree plantations. While glyphosate residues can be stored in plants for over 10 years, the nutritional impacts of GBH for ungulate forage are unknown. Here we compare the energy and protein content of moose (Alces alces) food plants in central British Columbia, Canada. Willow (Salix bebbiana), dogwood (Cornus sericea), and fireweed (Chamaenerion angustifolium) samples were obtained from regenerating cut blocks 1, 3, 6, and 12 years after GBH treatment and from untreated controls with identical initiation dates. We predicted that surviving plants would exhibit reduced palatability, digestibility, and nutritional value compared to controls, and that these effects would last at least 1 year before dissipating. Contrary to predictions, concentrations of digestible protein were higher in treated blocks 1 year after herbicide application, but in subsequent years there were few significant differences in protein from treated versus untreated forage. Digestible energy concentrations were identical to controls 1 year after exposure, but significant reductions were observed after 12 years. Results indicate potential nonlinear, complex, and long-lasting effects of GBH on the constituents of understory plants with implications for ungulate forage quality.

AB  - Herbivores play an important role in shaping seagrass community structure, but local stressors can change the ecological significance of herbivory by altering seagrass physiology in ways that affect herbivore preferences. However, few studies have assessed the cumulative influence of diverse local stressors on seagrass ecosystem function in relation to herbivory pressure. Here, we performed a four-month in situ experiment and laboratory feeding trials to examine the effects of two abiotic stressors (light reduction and nutrient enrichment) and simulated herbivory on the physiology of Cymodocea nodosa meadows and associated plant-mesograzer interactions, with the goal of understanding seagrass resilience to multiple disturbances. We found that light reduction primarily affected leaf morphology, resulting in lower shoot surface area, plant biomass and leaf growth rate. Simulated herbivory stimulated the production of phenolic compounds with a potential antimicrobial effect. Nutrient enrichment significantly reduced the C:N ratio and increased seagrass necrosis tissues and growth of opportunistic algae. Further, while higher macroalgal biomass was negatively correlated with C. nodosa performance, epiphyte biomass was positively correlated. Furthermore, our findings evidenced that C. nodosa leaves not only had high nutritional quality under nutrient enrichment, but also the presence of necrotic areas could be a significant driver modulating isopod consumption. We discuss the potential ecological impact of the natural mesograzer preference for necrotic tissue, which may promote the recovery of seagrass communities under local stressors.

AB  - Treelines are expected to expand into alpine ecosystems with global warming, but herbivory may delay this expansion. This study quantifies long-term effects of temporally varying sheep densities on birch recruitment and growth in the treeline ecotone. We examined treeline ecotone successional trajectories and legacy effects in a replicated experimental setup, where enclosures were present for 14 years with three different sheep densities (0, 25, 80 sheep km(-2)). Before and after the enclosures were present, the site had an ambient sheep density of 20-25 km(-2). We sampled field data 4 years after enclosure removal and compared these to data sampled 8 and 9 years after enclosure erection. We sampled data on birch browsing pressure, birch distribution across life-stages (recruits, saplings, and mature trees), and birch annual radial growth. Fourteen years of increased or decreased sheep density had observable legacy effects depending on birch life-stage. Birch recruit prevalence decreased in areas, where sheep were reintroduced after being absent for 14 years. For the same areas, sapling and mature tree prevalence increased, indicating that these areas have entered alternative successional trajectories compared to areas, where sheep were present the whole time. Birch annual radial growth showed a lag effect of 2 years after enclosure removal, with growth decreasing in areas where sheep had been absent for 14 years and increasing where sheep densities were high. Thus, decadal-scale absences of herbivores can leave legacy effects due to increased numbers of trees that have high resistance to later-introduced herbivore browsing.

AB  - England is a country with ambitious targets for habitat restoration and increased woodland cover, along with new Biodiversity Net Gain (BNG) regulations requiring most new development projects to increase overall biodiversity by 10 % (measured via the statutory Defra Biodiversity Metric). Typically this involves intensively managed conservation or restoration - but could habitat rewilding based on passive restoration be used to increase biodiversity at lower cost? We analysed the potential of passive lowland agricultural rewilding in England to fulfil the requirements of BNG policy. We considered arable land cover, deer browsing pressure and broadleaved woodland cover as our variables affecting 'rewilding potential' and quantified the resulting potential habitat gains using the Biodiversity Metric. We found the likely outcome is mainly habitat restored to poor or moderate condition, and that the southeast part of England has the best rewilding potential, with the eastern side having more potential than the western part of the country. The maximum possible biodiversity units that could hypothetically be generated for different woodland habitat type options varied between 6.0 million and 22.3 million units, in the (albeit highly improbable, and undesirable) case that all arable lowland in England were rewilded. The estimated annual need is currently around 39,000 biodiversity units, which means rewilding a cumulative 0.27-0.90 % of agricultural land back to woodlands starting one year in advance of development could compensate for annual development impacts. A key challenge to this approach is that planners would have to embrace long timescales and uncertainty about the ecological trajectories of habitat offsets.

AB  - In modern landscapes, the sustainable coexistence of humans and wildlife depends on involving stakeholders in the development and implementation of management strategies. This is particularly important for species like the European bison (Bison bonasus) and Eurasian moose (Alces alces), which are reoccupying regions between Germany and Poland after a prolonged absence. The return of these species generates mixed emotions, as interactions with these species are associated with both costs and benefits to people. Addressing the apparent unpreparedness in managing these trade-offs, we implemented a digital participatory impact assessment in two steps. First, we engaged bison and moose experts to develop management scenarios and assessment criteria. Then, in a subsequent virtual workshop, stakeholders evaluated four scenarios along economic, social, and ecological dimensions. Quantitative and qualitative analyses revealed divergent perspectives and priorities, yet consensus emerged on the necessary future steps: formulating a comprehensive management strategy with guidelines and protocols for managing specific conflict scenarios, such as the incursion of large herbivores onto highways. Our approach underscores the importance of early stakeholder engagement in fostering a more equitable and sustainable management of human-wildlife interactions. Moreover, demonstrating the feasibility of remote stakeholder involvement, our study presents a robust model for enhancing coexistence, adaptable even where in-person meetings are challenging.

AB  - The transition zone between the upper forest boundary and the treeless alpine vegetation (i.e., the treeline ecotone) is expected to shift upward in elevation with global warming. Multiple factors in addition to climate are influencing tree establishment, but it is uncertain to what degree. In this study, we took advantage of a unique dataset with field measurements of mountain birch trees acquired from 32 boreal-alpine treeline ecotone sites situated along a 1100-km latitudinal gradient in Norway to investigate the role of climate, herbivory, topography, and vegetation on the establishment success of trees. To represent tree establishment, we recorded occurrence, survival, and height growth of short juvenile birch trees (stem height <= 1 m) as response variables at each site in 2008, 2012, and 2018. We used already available climate and herbivory data, and airborne laser scanning (ALS) and unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) surveyed imagery together with field measurements to compute topography and vegetation explanatory variables per site on microsite scale (approx. 1 m2). We observed a clear decrease in short juvenile birch tree establishment due to livestock herbivory, evidenced by lower occurrence, reduced survival rate, and diminished height growth in treeline ecotones with higher livestock densities. Winter precipitation and the two land cover classes, tree-covered area and lee side vegetation, were also important for tree establishment. However, the direction and magnitude of the relationships depended on the stage of establishment. While winter precipitation can lead to higher tree occurrence, long-term survival is not necessarily ensured, reflecting diverse requirements for optimal conditions of tree establishment. Thus, our results show that occurrence, survival, and height growth of short juvenile birch trees differ in their requirements to climate, topography, and vegetation, but tree establishment is consistently low with livestock herbivory. Overall, our results suggest that treeline ecotones will shift toward higher elevations in areas with little or no livestock herbivory and close to already established trees and in lee sides. Regarding management and conservation issues, our results suggest that free-roaming livestock can reduce tree establishment and hinder treeline ecotone shifts into threatened alpine ecosystems, at least for birch-dominated treelines.

AB  - Global change projections predict more recurrent and intense drought coupled with more frequent soil disturbance events and increased levels of N deposition related to intensive land-use. How these abiotic drivers interact with each other and with biotic drivers in determining plant community dynamics is still unclear. Our study aimed to disentangle the roles of biotic and abiotic drivers in plant natural succession after soil disturbance. We carried out a factorial field experiment in which we performed soil disturbance in two seasons and manipulated drought, N deposition and herbivory. After each disturbance event, we monitored plant establishment dynamics. The species composition of plant communities established after disturbance was different in the early and late season trial probably due to different phenology of species from the seed bank. Depending on the timing of disturbance, plant communities responded differently to drought and N. In particular, seedling emergence and growth appeared sensitive to water stress only in the late season trial. Irrespective of the other treatments, arthropod herbivores increased the number of plant species established after soil disturbance. N generally had a negligible effect on plant community dynamics. We only observed positive effects of N on plant biomass in in the late season trial when there was a high water availability. Under future global change, we expect drought to affect plant establishment after soil disturbance by interacting with biotic and abiotic drivers. In particular, we showed that overlooked drivers such as timing of soil disturbance and arthropod herbivory will play an important role in shaping novel plant communities. Our results stress the critical need to adopt a multiple factor approach when assessing global change impacts on plant community diversity, composition and recovery ability. (c) 2021 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Global climate change is causing plants and other organisms to naturally expand their ranges to higher latitudes or altitudes. This expansion is leading to a strong reshuffling of biotic interactions with consequent ecosystem functions in the new ranges. We report here that soil fauna communities respond strongly to the cushion plants in a large-scale latitudinal gradient in the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau. Local taxonomic, functional, and phylogenetic diversity of soil nematodes increased with the presence of cushion plants independently of the latitudinal gradient, but communities became more functionally similar in the presence of cushion plants and with increasing latitude. This functional homogenization was driven by deterministic processes through which the presence of cushion plants favored some functional traits (i.e., nematode trophic groups: herbivores and bacterivores). Our study reveals functional homogenizations of soil fauna communities in response to climate warming-induced plant range expansion. Given that soil nematodes represent the most abundant and functionally diverse animal communities in terrestrial ecosystems, these findings indicate important changes in the functional dimension of biodiversity and in the delivery of ecosystem functions under climate change.

AB  - How vegetation change caused by ungulates affects other ungulate species has been well studied, yet how grazing the vegetation of the habitat affects a species own food habits is not known. Long-term studies on the effects of sika deer (Cervus nippon) on vegetation have been performed, but not in the context of the species own food habits. I monitored grassland vegetation and deer food habits on an island in northern Japan for 25 years from 1975 to 2000. During the first decade, deer grazing caused the replacement of Miscanthus sinensis tussocks by a Zoysia japonica sward. Deer diets in 1976 were composed of equal proportions of M. sinensis, Pleioblastus chino, and Z. japonica, but after the 1980s, Z. japonica became their major food source. This is because of the high productivity of Z. japonica afforded by its morphology and physiology, as well as by the warm and humid summer climate of the Japanese archipelago. Although the vegetational changes were gradual, changes in the deer food habits were abrupt and the compositions were predominated by Z. japonica after the first decade. This study showed that an ungulate changed its own diet because of its effect on the vegetation by grazing, and that the changes in vegetation and deer diet were not synchronized over a 25-year monitoring period.

AB  - Being the apex predator of Sri Lanka's forests, the endangered Sri Lankan leopard (Panthera pardus kotiya) plays a crucial role in maintaining the balance of natural ecosystems. In this study, we aimed to address the paucity of data related to one of the major leopard habitats of the country, Kumana National Park (KNP). This study investigates the spatial occupancy, population density, and activity patterns of the Sri Lankan leopard in KNP, Sri Lanka. Our findings reveal a higher concentration of leopards around water bodies and rocky areas, which provide shelter and support prey species such as wild buffalo and spotted deer. Using random encounter models (REM) and spatially explicit capture-recapture (SECR) analyses the population density of leopards was estimated. The study identified the eastern region of KNP as having one of the highest recorded leopard densities globally, with REM and SECR estimates showing statistically similar results of approximately 41 leopards per 100 km2. This high density is attributed to the availability of prey and habitat variability that supports the ecological needs of leopards. The study underscores the importance of KNP as a stronghold of leopards in southern Sri Lanka and the necessity of preserving its natural habitats.

AB  - Exposure to toxic metals (TMs) such as cobalt (Co) can cause lifelong carcinogenic disorders and mutagenic outcomes. TMs enter ground water and rivers from human activity, anthropogenic contamination, and the ecological environment. The present study was conducted to evaluate the influence of sewage water irrigation on cobalt (Co) toxicity and bioaccumulation in a soil-plant environment and to assess the health risk of grazing livestock via forage consumption. Cobalt is a very necessary element for the growth of plants and animals; however, higher concentrations have toxic impacts. Measurement of Co in plant, soil and water samples was conducted via wet digestion method using an atomic absorption spectrophotometer. The Co pollution severity was examined in soil, forage crops (Sorghum bicolor Kuntze, Sesbania bispinosa (Jacq.) W. Wight, Cynodon dactylon (L.) Pers., Suaeda fruticosa (L.) Forssk. and Tribulus terrestris L.) in blood, hair and feces of sheep, cow and buffalo from district Toba-Tek-Singh, Punjab, Pakistan. Three sites were selected for investigation of Co level in soil and forage samples. Highest concentration of Co was 0.65 and 0.35 mg/kg occurring in S. bicolor at site I. The sheep blood, cow hair and sheep feces samples showed highest concentrations of 0.545, 0.549 and 0.548 mg/kg, respectively at site I and site II. Bioconcentration factor, pollution load index, enrichment factor and daily intake were found to be higher (0.667, 0.124, 0.12 and 0.0007 mg/kg) in soil, S. bicolor, S. fruticosa and in buffalo, respectively, at site I. It was concluded that forage species irrigated with wastewater are safe for consumption of livestock. However, though the general values were lower than the permissible maximum limit, it was observed that the bioaccumulation in the forage species was higher. Therefore, soil and food chain components should be avoided from trace metal contamination, and other means of nonconventional water resources should be employed for forages irrigation.

AB  - Premise Anthropogenic nitrogen (N) addition alters the abiotic and biotic environment, potentially leading to changes in patterns of natural selection (i.e., trait-fitness relationships) and the opportunity for selection (i.e., variance in relative fitness). Because N addition favors species with light acquisition strategies (e.g., tall species), we predicted that N would strengthen selection favoring those same traits. We also predicted that N could alter the opportunity for selection via its effects on mean fitness and/or competitive asymmetries. Methods We quantified the strength of selection and the opportunity for selection in replicated populations of the annual grass Setaria faberi (giant foxtail) growing in a long-term N addition experiment. We also correlated these population-level parameters with community-level metrics to identify the proximate causes of N-mediated evolutionary effects. Results N addition increased aboveground productivity, light asymmetry, and reduced species diversity. Contrary to expectations, N addition did not strengthen selection for trait values associated with higher light acquisition such as greater height and specific leaf area (SLA); rather, it strengthened selection favoring lower SLA. Light asymmetry and species diversity were associated with selection for height and SLA, suggesting a role for these factors in driving N-mediated selection. The opportunity for selection was not influenced by N addition but was negatively associated with species diversity. Conclusions Our results indicate that anthropogenic N enrichment can affect evolutionary processes, but that evolutionary changes in plant traits within populations are unlikely to parallel the shifts in plant traits observed at the community level.

AB  - Translocations and introductions are important events that allow organisms to overcome natural barriers. The genetic background of colonization success and genetic consequences of the establishment of populations in new environments are of great interest for predicting species' colonization success. The wild boar has been introduced into many parts of the world. We analyzed sequences of the mitochondrial-DNA control region in the wild boars introduced into the Ural region and compared them with sequences from founder populations (from Europe, the Caucasus, Central Asia, and the Far East). We found that the introduced population has high genetic diversity. Haplotypes from all the major phylogenetic clades were detected in the analyzed group of the animals from the Urals. In this group, no haplotypes identical to Far Eastern sequences were detectable despite a large number of founders from that region. The contribution of lineages originating from Eastern Europe was greater than expected from the proportions (%) of European and Asian animals in the founder populations. This is the first study on the genetic diversity and structure of a wild boar population of mixed origin at the northern periphery of this species' geographical range.

AB  - Himalayan Musk deer, Moschus chrysogaster is widely distributed but one of the least studied species in Nepal. In this study, we compiled a total of 429 current presence points of direct observation of the species, pellets droppings, and hoofmarks based on field-based surveys during 2018-2021 and periodic data held by the Department of National Park and Wildlife Conservation. We developed the species distribution model using an ensemble modeling approach. We used a combination of bioclimatic, anthropogenic, topographic, and vegetation-related variables to predict the current suitable habitat for Himalayan Musk deer in Nepal. A total of 16 predictor variables were used for habitat suitability modeling after the multicollinearity test. The study shows that the 6973.76 km(2) (5%) area of Nepal is highly suitable and 8387.11 km(2) (6%) is moderately suitable for HMD. The distribution of HMD shows mainly by precipitation seasonality, precipitation of the warmest quarter, temperature ranges, distance to water bodies, anthropogenic variables, and land use and land cover change (LULC). The probability of occurrence is less in habitats with low forest cover. The response curves indicate that the probability of occurrence of HMD decreases with an increase in precipitation seasonality and remains constant with an increase in precipitation of the warmest quarter. Thus, the fortune of the species distribution will be limited by anthropogenic factors like poaching, hunting, habitat fragmentation and habitat degradation, and long-term forces of climate change.

AB  - Reintroduced animals-especially those raised in captivity-are faced with the unique challenge of navigating a wholly unfamiliar environment, and often make erratic or extensive movements after release. Naivete to the reintroduction landscape can be costly, e.g., through increased energy expenditure, greater exposure to predation, and reduced opportunities to forage. Integration with an extant population may provide opportunities for social information transfer. However, in the absence of interactions with residents, it is unclear how individual and social learning may affect an animal's ability to track resources in an unfamiliar landscape. We use integrated step selection functions (iSSFs) to address these knowledge gaps, by evaluating the extent to which environmental factors, individual experience (time since release), and social information-sharing (group size) influence movement decisions by scimitar-horned oryx (Oryx dammah) reintroduced into their native range for the first time in ca. 30 years. We found that both experience and social factors influenced the habitat selection and movement behavior of reintroduced oryx. Of four candidate iSSFs, the model that included environmental, experience, and group size variables performed best in both dry and wet periods. Statistically significant interaction terms between environmental variables and experience were generally larger than similar terms for group size, indicating that experience may affect habitat selection by reintroduced oryx more strongly than social factors. These findings may inform the management of recovering wildlife populations, update widely-held expectations about how released ungulates acclimate to novel landscapes, and demonstrate the utility of long-term monitoring of reintroduced populations.

AB  - Understanding ecological niche is critical to the management and conservation of any species or population. For herbivores, dietary niche is critical for understanding habitat suitability, carrying capacity, and population and community viability. In closely related species with similar morphologies, dietary niches can diverge depending on environmental and seasonal factors. Elk Island National Park in Alberta, Canada, contains populations of both American bison (Bison bison) subspecies-plains bison (B. b. bison) and wood bison (B. b. athabascae)-in similar but separate habitats located at the historical confluence of the subspecies' distributions. Using generalized additive models and nutritional geometry, we compared the subspecies' dietary niches in terms of content and quality continuously for one year (Dec 2020 - Nov 2021). Both subspecies consumed primarily graminoids during winter, spring, and fall and incorporated a variety of forbs and woody plants during summer. Plains bison diets contained more upland grasses and digestible organic matter in their diet and less wetland graminoids (e.g., sedges) throughout the year. We also found differing dietary niches between the subspecies during the spring and summer months. Our unique, continuous analysis of annual diet content and quality can deliver insight into the similarities and differences between subspecies' dietary niches that should help improve management decisions, such as better matching between source populations and release areas for future translocations.

AB  - Animal movement is the mechanism connecting landscapes to fitness, and understanding variation in seasonal animal movements has benefited from the analysis and categorization of animal displacement. However, seasonal movement patterns can defy classification when movements are highly variable. Hidden Markov movement models (HMMs) are a class of latent-state models well-suited to modeling movement data. Here, we used HMMs to assess seasonal patterns of variation in the movement of pronghorn (Antilocapra americana), a species known for variable seasonal movements that challenge analytical approaches, while using a population of mule deer (Odocoileus hemionus), for whom seasonal movements are well-documented, as a comparison. We used population-level HMMs in a Bayesian framework to estimate a seasonal trend in the daily probability of transitioning between a short-distance local movement state and a long-distance movement state. The estimated seasonal patterns of movements in mule deer closely aligned with prior work based on indices of animal displacement: a short period of long-distance movements in the fall season and again in the spring, consistent with migrations to and from seasonal ranges. We found seasonal movement patterns for pronghorn were more variable, as a period of long-distance movements in the fall was followed by a winter period in which pronghorn were much more likely to further initiate and remain in a long-distance movement pattern compared with the movement patterns of mule deer. Overall, pronghorn were simply more likely to be in a long-distance movement pattern throughout the year. Hidden Markov movement models provide inference on seasonal movements similar to other methods, while providing a robust framework to understand movement patterns on shorter timescales and for more challenging movement patterns. Hidden Markov movement models can allow a rigorous assessment of the drivers of changes in movement patterns such as extreme weather events and land development, important for management and conservation.

AB  - Diets of large carnivores such as pumas vary with ecological conditions including the diversity, abundance, and vulnerability of prey. In the San Andres Mountains, south-central New Mexico, USA, the ungulate prey community changed significantly during the 1980s through the 2000s; mule deer declined ca. 90%; desert bighorn declined to near extirpation, then increased; and exotic oryx increased. Because these changes likely affected pumas, we evaluated puma diets from 2000 to 2011 (divided into 2 periods; 2000-2005, and 2006-2011; mule deer began a slow recovery in the latter), and compared these with diets documented from 1985 to 1995. Diets changed significantly with declines in mule deer; total ungulate (43-52% frequency; 52-61% biomass) and non-ungulate (57-63% frequency; 39-48% biomass) prey in diets were similar during 2000-2005 and 2006-2011, whereas ungulates had comprised 94% biomass (92% mule deer) of diets in 1985-1995. The largest component of diets in the 2000s by frequency was lagomorphs (27-42%), while lagomorphs (20-28) and mule deer (21-42) contributed the greatest biomass. Oryx increased in both frequency and biomass in diets during the 2000s, but still comprised <= 16% of diets, similar to occurrence in coyote diets and thus likely indicative of scavenging. Pumas compensated for declines in mule deer primarily by shifting to medium and small prey, especially lagomorphs, while maintaining nutritional condition. Significant use of non-ungulate prey by pumas highlights their flexibility in diets, and reaffirms their ability to persist in areas where large ungulates are rare or relatively invulnerable to predation and consequently do not dominate diets.

AB  - Unprecedented and dramatic transformations are occurring in the Arctic in response to climate change, but academic, public, and political discourse has disproportionately focussed on the most visible and direct aspects of change, including sea ice melt, permafrost thaw, the fate of charismatic megafauna, and the expansion of fisheries. Such narratives disregard the importance of less visible and indirect processes and, in particular, miss the substantive contribution of the shelf seafloor in regulating nutrients and sequestering carbon. Here, we summarise the biogeochemical functioning of the Arctic shelf seafloor before considering how climate change and regional adjustments to human activities may alter its biogeochemical and ecological dynamics, including ecosystem function, carbon burial, or nutrient recycling. We highlight the importance of the Arctic benthic system in mitigating climatic and anthropogenic change and, with a focus on the Barents Sea, offer some observations and our perspectives on future management and policy.

AB  - Shrub encroachment into grasslands can greatly alter soil organic carbon (SOC), nitrogen (N) cycling processes, and carbon (C) pools. However, the effects of shrub encroachment on the soil microbial community and its feedback on the chemical composition of SOC are not well understood in the alpine ecosystems. This study aims to evaluate the impact of the encroachment of the shrubs Salix cupularis and Hippophae rhamnoides on SOC, soil microbial biomass C (MBC) and N (MBN), microbial community structure, and enzyme activities of the topsoil (0-30 cm) and explore the underlying mechanisms in the eastern Tibetan Plateau grasslands of China. We found that while SOC increased under both S. cupularis (16.0 % increase) and H. rhamnoides (23.3 % increase), only the increase in H. rhamnoides was significant in comparison with the adjacent grass soils. The recalcitrant C pool increases were not significant in S. cupularis or H.rhamnoides soils. Additionally, shrub encroachment significantly increased the soil organic N and the activities of N-acetyl-beta-glucosaminidase (NAG) and leucine aminopeptidase (LAP). Shrub encroachment significantly increased MBC and MBN, as well as enhanced the total bacteria PLFAs, gram-negtive bacteria PLFAs, arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi, actinomycetes, and hydrolytic enzyme activities, but suppressed the ratio of total fungi to total bacteria PLFAs and phenol oxidase activity in comparison with grassland communities. Redundancy analysis (RDA) showed that litterfall mass, litter N, and root N were the main factors affecting the soil microbial community. Our findings highlight that the encroachment of shrub H. rhamnoides tends to increase soil C sequestration as a result of the high quantities of plant litter input and the changes in the composition of soil microbial communities as well as increased complex C compounds in soil organic matter.

AB  - Context. Helicopter-based shooting has been widely used to kill deer in Australasia, but the animal welfare outcomes of this technique have not been evaluated.
   Aim. To assess the animal welfare outcomes of helicopter-based shooting of deer in Australia by quantifying the fates of deer seen and shot at, the duration of procedures and the number and location of bullet wounds in deer.
   Methods. Three deer control operations were assessed. These operations targeted: (1) chital deer (Axis axis) in Queensland, (2) fallow deer (Dama dama) in Australian Capital Territory and (3) fallow deer in New South Wales. For each operation, an independent veterinarian conducted ante-mortem (i.e. from the helicopter as shooting occurred) and post-mortem (i.e. from the ground after shooting had ceased) observations. The ante-mortem data were used to estimate the proportion of deer seen that were shot, chase time (CT), time to insensibility (TTI) and total time (TT; CT thorn TTI). The numbers and locations of bullet wounds were recorded post-mortem.
   Key results. Ante-mortem and post-mortem observations were performed for 114-318 and 60-105 deer, respectively, in the three operations. Shots were fired at 69-76% of deer that were observed. Median CT ranged from 73 to 145 s. Median TTI ranged from 17 to 37 s and median TT ranged from 109 to 162 s. The mean number of bullet wounds per deer ranged from 1.43 to 2.57. Animal welfare outcomes were better in the two fallow deer operations than in the chital deer operation. In both fallow deer operations, most deer were shot multiple times and at least once in the head or thorax. In contrast, chital deer were shot fewer times and less often in the head or thorax, and non-fatal wounding was observed.
   Conclusions. The best animal welfare outcomes were achieved when helicopter-based shooting operations followed a fly-back procedure and mandated that multiple shots were fired into each animal.

AB  - The expansion of linear infrastructure presents a significant threat to biodiversity, emphasizing the urgent need for regional studies on spatial variations and comprehensive multispecies research. This study surveyed and monitored wildlife passages across eight nature reserves in Xinjiang, evaluating their construction status, utilization patterns, and key factors influencing utilization rates, as well as providing optimization recommendations. The findings revealed that dedicated wildlife passages were scarce, especially in smaller reserves, which primarily relied on small bridges and culverts originally designed for water flow. Enhancing the construction of passages in these areas is strongly recommended. A total of 32 wildlife species were recorded, comprising 13 bird species and 19 mammal species. Ungulates, including bharal (Pseudois nayaur), goitered gazelle (Gazella subgutturosa), Asian wild ass (Equus hemionus), and wild Bactrian camel (Camelus ferus), exhibited high relative abundance indices, indicating a strong preference for utilizing passages. Passage utilization rates exhibited significant seasonal and diurnal variations. Winter usage was the lowest, followed by an increase in spring, peaking in summer and autumn. Birds exhibited particularly high passage utilization rates during migratory seasons, with the peak occurring in April. Additionally, nocturnal passage utilization rates were significantly higher than during other periods, with both sunrise and sunset showing positive selection, as indicated by 86.86% and 91.30% of monitored sites recording JSI > 0. To enhance the effectiveness of passages, seasonal and diurnal variations should be fully considered in passage construction and management, particularly by minimizing human activity during nighttime, dawn, and dusk. Utilization rates were significantly constrained by the intensity of human activity and the density of linear infrastructure. Passage type, size, and proximity to water were also critical factors. Optimizing passage layout, implementing dynamic management in grassland fence areas, increasing passage density, and enhancing ecological functionality are recommended strategies to facilitate wildlife movement and support biodiversity conservation.

AB  - Plant diversity has often been reported to decrease insect herbivory in plants. Of the numerous mechanisms that have been proposed to explain this phenomenon, how plant diversity influences plant defences via effects on growth has received little attention. In addition, plant diversity effects may be contingent on abiotic conditions (e.g. resource and water availability). Here, we used a long-term experiment to explore the interactive effects of tree species composition and water availability on growth, direct (i.e. phenolics) and indirect (i.e. volatile organic compounds - VOCs) defences and leaf herbivory in Quercus ilex. We quantified herbivory by chewing insects, phenolic compounds and VOCs in Q. ilex trees growing in stands differing in tree species composition (Q. ilex, Q. ilex + Betula Pendula, Q. ilex + Pinus pinaster and Q. ilex + B. pendula + P. pinaster) and water availability (irrigated versus control). Both direct and indirect defences were affected by tree species composition, but such changes were not mediated by changes in tree stem diameter. Quercus ilex trees growing in stands with P. pinaster had the lowest concentration of both direct and indirect defences. Importantly, the effects of tree species composition on VOCs were exacerbated on irrigated blocks. Despite variation in defences, tree species composition did not affect herbivory in Q. ilex. Accordingly, we did not find any association between defences and insect herbivory. Our results suggest that changes in the micro-environment rather than growth-defence associations may mediate tree diversity effects on defences. In addition, reduced defensive investment in more diverse stands could negatively impact tree resistance masking the beneficial effects of species diversity at reducing insect herbivory.

AB  - The Dorcas Gazelle, Gazella dorcas, has lost 86% of its global historical range, and is regionally categorized as endangered by the IUCN. The factors that caused this decline have never been quantified. In this work, field and remotely sensed data were used to examine the ecological and anthropogenic factors affecting the abundance of Dorcas Gazelle within Wadi El-Gemal Protected Area in the Eastern desert of Egypt, using Generalized Linear Mixed Models (GLMM). The species' abundance is shaped by anthropogenic activities (number of car trails and proximity to the coastal road) more than ecological factors (vegetation and wetness indices). Dorcas Gazelle is avoiding more humid and greener areas because of human disturbance. Such suitable habitats may be perceived by gazelles as too dangerous, and the animals therefore prefer less suitable but safer habitats that are further away or less frequented by humans. Moreover, an easy to conduct, cheap monitoring tool, the Kilometric Abundance Index (KAI), was devised and implemented for baseline information to be used for future monitoring of Dorcas Gazelle.

AB  - Monitoring the invasive exotic species and their effect on native fauna is fundamental for their effective control. The objective of this research is to evaluate the spatiotemporal distribution and overlap of medium-large-sized fauna in El Palmar National Park, Argentina, to consider potential negative interactions between native and exotic species. Camera traps were distributed in 27 sites between 2017 and 2019. Spatial and temporal overlap was estimated for every pair of exotic-native taxa. With 2673 camera days, two exotic and seven native taxa were recorded. All species were distributed along the extension of the National Park but in different numbers of sites. Exotic axis deer (Axis axis) was recorded in all sites but one, and exotic wild boar (Sus scrofa) occurred at only one-third of the sites surveyed. The occurrence of native mammals ranged between 26% (Geoffroy's cat, Leopardus geoffroyi) and 67% (capybara, Hydrochoerus hydrochaeris). Spatial overlap between native and exotic species was high overall and was higher in winter when species moved over larger areas to look for limited resources. Except for greater rhea (Rhea americana), which was diurnal, all species had crepuscular or nocturnal patterns. Both exotic species had an intermediate/high overlap in their activity pattern with almost all native species, including some species with similar diets, but the hours of their maximum activities did not strictly coincide. However, the existence of differences in the exotic species' activity patterns compared to their patterns in other areas where they inhabit could indicate segregation in daily activity to relax competition.

AB  - To identify the genetic determinants of domestication and productivity of Asian water buffaloes (Bubalus bubalis), 470 genomes of domesticated river and swamp buffaloes along with their putative ancestors, the wild water buffaloes (Bubalus arnee) are sequenced and integrated. The swamp buffaloes inherit the morphology of the wild buffaloes. In contrast, most river buffaloes are unique in their morphology, but their genomes cluster with the wild buffaloes. The levels of genomic diversity in Italian river and Indonesian swamp buffaloes decrease at opposite extremes of their distribution range. Purifying selection prevented the accumulation of harmful loss-of-function variants in the Indonesian buffaloes. Genes that evolved rapidly (e.g., GKAP1) following differential selections in the river and swamp buffaloes are involved in their reproduction. Genes related to milk production (e.g., CSN2) and coat color (e.g., MC1R) underwent strong selections in the dairy river buffaloes via soft and hard selective sweeps, respectively. The selective sweeps and single-cell RNA-seq data revealed the luminal cells as the key cell type in response to artificial selection for milk production of the dairy buffaloes. These findings show how artificial selection has been driving the evolutionary divergence and genetic differentiation in morphology and productivity of Asian water buffaloes.

AB  - Ash from biofuels and nitrogen fertilizer are increasingly being used as soil amendments. While this can increase tree growth, it can also increase mammalian grazing and competition with vegetation. We applied moderate amounts of ash (1.5 t.ha(-1).year(-1)) and urea (74 kg N.ha(-1).year(-1)) in each of 2 years to a well-drained site in southeastern Manitoba, planted with Pinus banksiana Lamb. Subplots received deer browsing and (or) vegetation control. The ash resulted in an increase in pH in the upper 15 cm of mineral soil from similar to 5.7 to 6.6, and the urea created short-term spikes in soil inorganic nitrogen (NH4 and NO3) levels. Urea combined with ash significantly increased seedling relative growth rates in the first 2 years, with seedlings being largest with urea, with or without ash. However, by the fourth year, seedling growth and size did not differ between the amendments. Urea application increased browsing damage to 91%, but only when vegetation was mowed. Browsing guards resulted in seedlings having 1.6 times greater shoot mass by the end of the fourth growing season. These results suggest that on sandy soils in the dry region of central Canada, P. banksiana may get little benefit from ash applications.

AB  - Aim: Rapid loss in global insect diversity has generated substantial public worry due to their critical ecological roles. However, there is controversy about the effectiveness of the global-scale hotspots in guiding the conservation of diversity at the regional scale. Even worse, little is known about the knowledge of insect distributional dynamics in many understudied regions, such as East and Southeast Asia. Here, to guide for setting regional-scale conservation priorities for insect diversity, we explore hawkmoths (Lepidoptera: Sphingidae) for their distributional dynamics and identify regional hotspots requiring protection.
   Location: South China (including Guangdong, Guangxi, Hainan, Hong Kong and Macau) and northern Vietnam (17 degrees similar to 26.5 degrees N, 102 degrees similar to 117.5 degrees E).
   Methods: Species distribution models were generated for 194 hawkmoth species based on 3597 occurrence records to predict their distributions. We calculated the spatial patterns of taxonomic and phylogenetic diversity and identified regional hotspots. Furthermore, the potential assembly mechanisms underlying insect diversity were explored by analysing the rates of speciation, extinction and dispersal between phyloregions.
   Results: (a) The coastal regions of South China and northern Vietnam represent a regional hotspot of hawkmoths in East and Southeast Asia, with significantly higher alpha-diversity than that in inland regions. (b) Dispersal played a more important role than local speciation and extinction in the formation of regional hawkmoth hotspots.
   Main Conclusions: In this study, the 'Out-of-the-tropics model' can explain the formation of the hawkmoth regional hotspots and the enhanced version of the 'Pure dispersal model' can explain the formation of the hotspots in Hainan Island. Compared with the local speciation and extinction, dispersal is the main driving factor that promoted the formation of the regional biodiversity hotspot of hawkmoths in South China. The case of Hainan Island suggests that protection within hotspots needs to account for specific regional macro-evolutionary dynamics rather than indiscriminate coverage of identified hotspots.

AB  - Evolutionary biologists have recently solicited archaeologists to help document and understand the morphological evolution of animals in response to human activities and, more generally, to help reconstruct the history and significance of the anthropogenic impact on worldwide ecosystems. Artificial selection associated with domestication is the best-known example of a major anthropogenic morphological evolution preserved in the archaeological record. However, the impact of the domesti-cation process and dispersal on the morphological evolution of animals has been far less explored. To fill this gap, we focused on 4500 years of evolution in Western Europe Sus scrofa, covering the Neolithic transition - a major anthropogenic ecological disturbance involving landscape modification and the translocation of domestic mammals. Using geometric morphometrics on key phenotypic markers pre-served in the archaeological record, associated with isotopic studies, we explored how, and in response to which cultural drivers, the Neolithic niche construction has influenced the morphological evolution of Western European wild boars (Sus scrofa scrofa). The decoupling of size and shape components from bone morphological variation has facilitated the identification of several processes of phenotypic diversification of Sus s. scrofa in response to human behaviour during the Neolithic transition in Western Europe.(c) 2023 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Invasive ants shape assemblages and interactions of native species, but their effect on fundamental ecological processes is poorly understood. In East Africa, Pheidole megacephala ants have invaded monodominant stands of the ant-tree Acacia drepanolobium, extirpating native ant defenders and rendering trees vulnerable to canopy damage by vertebrate herbivores. We used experiments and observations to quantify direct and interactive effects of invasive ants and large herbivores on A. drepanolobium photosynthesis over a 2-year period. Trees that had been invaded for >= 5 years exhibited 69% lower whole-tree photosynthesis during key growing seasons, resulting from interaction between invasive ants and vertebrate herbivores that caused leaf- and canopy-level photosynthesis declines. We also surveyed trees shortly before and after invasion, finding that recent invasion induced only minor changes in leaf physiology. Our results from individual trees likely scale up, highlighting the potential of invasive species to alter ecosystem-level carbon fixation and other biogeochemical cycles.

AB  - Mesophotic reefs, defined as reefs between 30 m and 150 m, have been less investigated than their shallower counterparts. Yet, more protected from human activities and bleaching events, they could be refuge zones allowing the resilience of shallow reefs. However, it is currently unknown if their role as refugia for species diversity also extends to functional diversity and thus potentially ecosystem functioning. Using an extensive video field surveys from Mayotte Island in the Western Indian Ocean, we analyzed how taxonomic diversity and functional diversity of coral reef fishes changed along a depth gradient from 10 to 100 m. We found that shallow and mesophotic reefs host different species, but that these dissimilar assemblages share similar richness combinations of traits values. However, when accounting for biomass of species, it appears that functional structure of assemblages differs along the depth gradient, with, for instance, herbivorous fishes being very scarce in deep reefs while large-bodied carnivorous are more abundant. Therefore, surveys of mesophotic fishes should assess not only species, but also trait composition, abundance and biomass. Overall, our results support the claim that extending marine protected areas to mesophotic reefs is required to maximize the protection of both species and functional diversities to eventually maintain coral reef ecosystem functioning and associated services across the broader seascape.

AB  - 1. Crop diversification offers a promising solution to meet expanding global food demands while maintaining ecosystem services. Diversification strategies that use mixed planting to reduce pest damage (e.g. intercropping), termed `associational effects' (AE) in the ecological literature, can decrease (associational resistance) or increase (associational susceptibility) herbivore abundance on a focal plant. While application of AE to agroecosystems typically reduces pest abundance, the range of outcomes varies widely.
   2. We conducted a meta-analysis using 272 estimates of insect herbivore abundance on crops neighbored by a conspecific or heterospecific from 44 studies undertaken on six continents. We focus on four agricultural crops well represented from sites across the globe to test hypotheses related to understanding how herbivore traits (diet breadth, feeding guild, origin), plant traits (crop type, phylogenetic distance to neighbour) and environmental context (climate, experimental design) contribute to variation in the outcomes of AE.
   3. Overall, bicultures provided a strong reduction of insect abundance on the focal crop. Climate and interactions between herbivore traits, particularly diet breadth and origin, and plant traits or environmental context mediated the strength of AE.
   4. Bicultures provided the strongest reductions in insect abundance at low latitudes, and this effect decreased at higher latitudes but only for insects with certain traits. Abundance of generalist herbivores and globally distributed pests tended to be most strongly negatively affected by bicultures, under certain contexts, whereas specialist herbivores and native pests were less affected by neighbours.
   5. Synthesis and application. This meta-analysis highlights that crop diversification schemes have an overall strongly beneficial effect of reducing pest abundance. However, there was also variability in the outcomes that is determined in part by the interactive effects of herbivore traits and environmental context. The results provide guidance for incorporating beneficial ecological interactions into integrated pest management strategies.

AB  - When pelagic organisms die and fall onto the deep-sea floor they create food falls, i.e., parcels of organic enrichment that subsidize deep benthic scavenging communities. The diversity and quantities of food falls remain unstudied for many ocean regions since they are stochastically deposited and rapidly scavenged. The Southern Ocean habitat supports large populations of megafauna but few food falls have been documented. To investigate the diversity and quantity of food falls in the northwestern Weddell Sea, we analyzed 8476 images from the deep seafloor that were captured during the expedition PS118 on RV Polarstern in 2019 by the camera system OFOBS (Ocean Floor Observation and Bathymetry System). OFOBS was towed 1.5 m above the seafloor along five transects (400 to 2200 m seafloor depth) east of the Antarctic Peninsula. We observed the carcasses of one baleen whale, one penguin, and four fish at depths of 647 m, 613 m, 647 m, 2136 m, 2165 m, and 2112 m, respectively, as well as associated scavenging fauna. To the best of our knowledge, we describe here the first in situ observations of deep-sea food falls for penguins and fish in the Southern Ocean. While the whale carcass seemed in an intermediate successional stage, both the penguin and the fish were likely recently deposited and three of the fish potentially resulted from fishery discards. Our relatively small data set suggests that a diverse array of food falls provide nutrients to the slopes of the Powell Basin.

AB  - We present phenological data for two time periods (1985-1987 and 2014-2016) on major tree species (Shorea robusta, Pinus roxburghii, Myrica esculenta, Quercus leucotrichophora, Rhododendron arboreum, Quercus floribunda, and Machilus duthiei) occurring along an altitudinal gradient of 300-2,200 m asl of Himalayan forests (a data-deficient region identified by the IPCC, 2007), and show that bud break and leafing in trees has advanced at 0.20 days/year, which is associated with a significant (P < 0.001) increase in atmospheric temperature (0.038 degrees C/year) over the years in the study area. Also, the leaf drop period has advanced correspondingly (0.40 days/year); hence, the length of season (LOS) did not increase in these trees. This finding is contrary to the report of increase in LOS due to climatic warming from temperate latitudes of the world and satellitebased studies in Himalayan region. Arguably, phenomena such as bud break and leafing may not be captured by remote sensing, which is critical for determining the impact of climate change on the forest vegetation of the eco-sensitive Himalayan region. We suggest that this phenological earliness may alter forest structure and functioning and associated ecosystem services of these forests in the long run.
   Study Implications: This study suggests that bud break and leafing in trees has advanced, an advancement that is associated with the significant increase in atmospheric temperature over the years in the study area. However, the leaf drop period has advanced correspondingly; hence, the length of season of trees in the study area did not increase. Nonetheless, the earliness in the leafing and leaf drop have potential implications on forest ecosystem structure and functioning, such as photosynthesis, carbon assimilation, increased asynchrony in plant-pollinators and animal interactions, reproduction success, and herbivory that require further detailed investigation. Warming may also advance seed maturation and desiccation of seeds that may disrupt the synchrony between monsoon and tree seed germination, forest regeneration, and ensuing ecosystem services. Generalizations on a regional scale on the impact of climate change on annual patterns of growth of forests that are based on remote-sensing studies could mask the impact of the premonsoon period, when bud break and leafing take place. These impacts may not be captured by remote sensing; impacts which, in this study, we have found to be critical.

AB  - Extreme weather conditions, like heatwave events, are becoming more frequent with climate change. Animals often modify their behaviour to cope with environmental changes and extremes. During heat stress conditions, individuals change their spatial behaviour and increase the use of shaded areas to assist with thermoregulation. Here, we suggest that for social species, these behavioural changes and ambient conditions have the potential to influence an individual's position in its social network, and the social network structure as a whole. We investigated whether heat stress conditions (quantified through the temperature humidity index) and the resulting use of shaded areas, influence the social network structure and an individual's connectivity in it. We studied this in free-ranging sheep in the arid zone of Australia, GPS-tracking all 48 individuals in a flock. When heat stress conditions worsened, individuals spent more time in the shade and the network was more connected (higher density) and less structured (lower modularity). Furthermore, we then identified the behavioural change that drove the altered network structure and showed that an individual's shade use behaviour affected its social connectivity. Interestingly, individuals with intermediate shade use were most strongly connected (degree, strength, betweenness), indicating their importance for the connectivity of the social network during heat stress conditions. Heat stress conditions, which are predicted to increase in severity and frequency due to climate change, influence resource use within the ecological environment. Importantly, our study shows that these heat stress conditions also affect the animal's social environment through the changed social network structure. Ultimately, this could have further flow on effects for social foraging and individual health since social structure drives information and disease transmission.
   We GPS-tracked 48 free-ranging sheep in the arid zone of Australia. When heat stress conditions worsened, the social network was more connected (higher density) but with lower internal structure (lower modularity). Furthermore, an individual's social connectivity was affected by its shade use behaviour, and individuals with intermediate shade use were most strongly connected (degree, strength, betweenness).image

AB  - Global environmental policies have effectively designated 17 % of the Earth's surface as protected areas and implemented robust measures to address climate change. However, the importance of soils as critical reservoirs of biodiversity and carbon is often overlooked in global policy making. In the present study, we used nematodes as indicators to assess the impact of conservation strategies on soil food web connectance. We explored nematode metabolic footprints and their carbon budget, and evaluated soil health by identifying factors that influence nematode functional diversity. We collected 180 soil samples from three zones in the Souss Massa National Park in Morocco: transitional zone (organic cropping and grazing activities), buffer zone (grazing activity), core zone (strictly protected area), and a nearby intensively farmed non-protected area. We noted a consistent decline in diversity within all trophic groups from the core zone (56 taxa) to the non-protected zone (18 taxa). A notable increase in total nematode abundance and herbivore diversity was observed in the organic soils of the transitional zone. In contrast, nematode abundance and diversity were lower in non-protected zones. Meloidogyne, a sedentary endoparasite, was prevalent in conventional crops outside the park but was not reported within the park. Nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium were the major soil parameters affecting nematode food webs. The functional metabolic footprints of nematodes were enhanced by nature conservation, highlighting the crucial role of nematodes in generating carbon influxes in protected areas. Our results show that 3.11x 1012 nematodes (with a total biomass of 330.47 tonnes) inhabit surface soils across the park, which is 14.38 times greater than the same area in the non-protected zone. Daily production and storage of biomass and carbon budget were 43.85 and 48.93 % higher in the park top soils than in the non-protected zone, respectively. This knowledge is significant for decision makers when formulating nature conservation programs, planning sustainable land use strategies, and addressing the challenges of rising CO2 emissions.

AB  - The arthropod communities are important component in grassland ecosystems and are largely affected by management. However, the information on the effects of different grassland management on ground-dwelling predatory arthropods are very limited, especially for the natural steppe grasslands in semi-arid regions. Here we investigated the dynamic patterns of predatory arthropod communities (Carabidae and Araneida) using the Pitfall-trap method in the grasslands subject to 6 management treatments of full-season grazing, spring-summer grazing, summer grazing, summer-autumn grazing, autumn mowing, and unused grassland in a natural steppe grassland in central Inner Mongolia; each management treatment was replicated by three experimental paddocks. The results showed that (i) a total of 305 ground-dwelling predatory arthropods were captured, belonging to 31 genera, 11 families, 2 orders and 2 classes; and the dominant genera were Craspedonotus, Harpalus, Pardosa and Gnaphosa, accounting for 14.75%, 12.79%, 11.15% and 15.74% of the total genera, respectively. (ii) Compared to unused grassland, grazing significantly reduced the individual number, biomass and genus diversity of ground-dwelling predatory arthropods, and these inverse impacts were smaller under summer-autumn grazing than other grazing; while autumn mowing increased the biomass of the arthropods in summer. (iii) Grazing and mowing had bigger effects on the large than small ground-dwelling predatory arthropods. Our results deepen the understanding of the dynamic patterns of ground-dwelling predatory arthropods in grasslands subject to different management, and it is important to take these dynamic patterns in evaluating management effects on grassland ecosystems, especially for the development of sustainable grassland management systems.

AB  - Land-use change poses a significant threat to biodiversity, particularly in insular ecosystems where species exhibit higher levels of specialisation. Despite the importance of tropical islands for biodiversity conservation, the impacts of land-use change on the diel activity of insular species remain poorly understood. We addressed this gap by investigating the diel activity patterns of insectivorous bats in response to land-use change in S & atilde;o Tom & eacute; Island, Central West Africa. Using passive acoustic detectors, we surveyed insectivorous bats across forests, shaded plantations, oil palm plantations, agricultural and urban areas. We examined (1) how intraspecific diel activity varies between forest and human-altered land-use types, and (2) how interspecific diel activity varies within the same land-use type, by quantifying overlap coefficients in species activity. Based on 19,383 bat passes from four species, we found that the degree of overlap in species-specific activity between forests and human-altered land-use types varied between species, with the least overlap being observed between forests and urban areas for Miniopterus newtoni, and between forests and oil palm plantations for Chaerephon spp. Overlap in the activity of different species was lower within less or not disturbed land-use types (forests and shaded plantations), where more species were present. Overall, diel activity of insectivorous bats altered according to the magnitude of structural land-use change. Such bat responses might be eventually due to the different temporal prey availability and interspecific competition in the altered land-use types. These findings comprise baseline knowledge informing evidence-based management actions across tropical island systems.

AB  - Evaluating the functional structure of benthic macrofaunal communities provides insights into how environmental drivers shape the ecosystem and establishes a baseline knowledge of the communities' dynamics and functioning. This understanding allows the prediction of responses to environmental changes and the implementation of efficient conservation and management strategies. Here we examine the structures and functions of benthic macrofaunal communities on the Northwest Iberian coast concerning environmental factors such as depth, hydrodynamic energy, and bottom type. The results suggest that the community assemblages and their function are structured by factors which influence food availability and habitat heterogeneity. The different sites exhibited different trait compositions and functional structures, indicating that distinct functions are performed according to environmental conditions. The communities found in sandy bottom areas with low hydrodynamic conditions presented frail functionality and demonstrated high vulnerability to alterations in their environment. Conversely, the communities found in rocky bottoms with high hydrodynamic conditions exhibited a fulfilled functional niche space, rendering them more resilient to such changes and less prone to loss of function. Although the analyses did not reveal significant differences in the factor depth, its influence on several factors seems relevant in shaping the functional structure of the communities. These findings highlight the importance of understanding the impact of local environmental conditions on ecosystem functioning, to effectively implement monitoring, management, and conservation strategies.

AB  - Stress factors typical in urban environments adversely affect the productivity and vigor of trees and may limit the development of tree roots with associated soil fungi and bacteria. Studies on mycorrhizal symbiosis and the activity of soil microorganisms are important in monitoring the adaptation of trees to urban conditions. We compared the symbiotic activity of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) living in the rhizosphere of mature white chestnut trees (Aesculus hippocastanum L.) in an urban ecosystem at sites with varying degrees of anthropopressure and in a rural area. We used two methods: (1) direct analysis of the root samples, (2) assessment of the colonization of trap plants grown in the soil taken from under selected white horse chestnut trees. The seasonality of mycorrhizal colonization and soil microbial respiration based on the enzyme activity of nonspecific dehydrogenase (DHA) was studied over several growing seasons. The concentrations of macronutrients in the soil from all study sites were in the ranges accepted as normal for the upper soil layer. However, the C/N ratio indicated carbon limitation in the soil at urban and rural study sites. The results showed that arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi indigenous in the rhizosphere of A. hippocastanum developed a functioning mycorrhizal symbiosis at all research sites, including at highly disturbed urban locations, and that the mycorrhizal colonization varied between the study sites and the research term. The trap culture method confirmed the high biological potential of the soil microbial community, including AMF in urban ecosystems, which was comparable to that at the reference site in the rural environment. Soil moisture strongly affected the overall soil microbial vitality. This research showed that the mycorrhizal status of A. hippocastanum is more strongly influenced by climatic conditions and seasonal rhythms of trees than by urban/non-urban locations.

AB  - The invasive species Bubalus bubalis was introduced in Guapor & eacute; Biological Reserve in 1953. Since then, the buffaloes have become feral, posing a threat to the populations, communities, and natural ecosystems of the region. In the last decade, there has been no study or monitoring of the invasive population and its potential impacts. We utilized systematic flights and multitemporal remote sensing analysis to address (i) What is the distribution range, abundance and density of Asian buffalo in the protected area? (ii) How has this species changed the land scape in the protected area over the past 34 years? The population survey resulted in 4.782 +/- 533.27 buffaloes within 966.22 km(2), population density of 4.9 +/- 0.55 buffaloes per km(2). The study also identified a 51% expansion of occupied areas within the Guapor & eacute; Reserve over the last 10 years. The multitemporal remote sensing analysis revealed significant environmental changes over the years, resulting in 48% loss of naturally flooded areas in the region occupied by buffalo. The government must take urgent measures to develop and implement a plan to control and eradicate this invasive species.

AB  - Conversion of Norway spruce (Picea abies) plantations to more diverse and resilient forest types is an important task for European forest managers in the face of climate change and increased focus on ecosystem services beyond timber production. However, there is a lack of knowledge on how to cost-effectively restore such forests. This study reports the influence of vicinity (distance) of forest type (mixed or spruce), fencing and mechanical site preparation (MSP) on the early performance of planted beech (Fagus sylvatica) seedlings and natural regeneration of other tree species following clear-cuts of Norway spruce in southern Sweden. After 6 years, we found clear effects of fencing and MSP, but not of vicinity of forest type. Fencing had a positive effect on height growth of Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris) but not on height of planted beech and naturally regenerated birch (Betula pendula, B. pubescens). There was a positive effect of MSP on survival and height growth of planted beech, and on the amount of natural regeneration of Scots pine. We conclude that establishment of beech forest is greatly accelerated by active regeneration approaches such as planting. In addition, the combination of planting beech, natural regeneration of other species, fencing and MSP is effective to promote the transition to mixed and diverse stands with both broadleaves and conifers. Fencing represented the highest cost among the treatments, and its cost-effectiveness depends on the local ungulate browsing pressure. In our study, fencing was critical to protect natural regeneration of Scots pine from browsing. Finally, natural regeneration of birch was abundant in our study and relatively unaffected by fencing and MSP treatments. With time, pre-commercial thinning of the naturally regenerated birch will be needed to maintain a diverse mixture of tree species.

AB  - Assessing abundance and distribution of species is important for developing effective management strategies and facilitating monitoring. We investigated marine megafauna abundance and distribution at Aldabra Atoll, Seychelles with uncrewed aerial vehicles (UAVs). Forty-nine grid squares were flown in the west lagoon to estimate abundance, with one grid square repeated to look at tide effects. Generalized additive models were used to investigate whether habitat categories and environmental parameters correlate with the density and abundance of each taxon. We found that sea turtles, sharks and rays but not dugongs (likely due to small dugong sample size) show a significantly heterogeneous distribution. The overall observed density (individuals/km2 +/- SE) was 140.8 +/- 18.7 for turtles, 19.0 +/- 4.9 for sharks, 15.0 +/- 2.2 for whiptail rays, 2.2 +/- 0.7 for eagle rays, and 0.3 +/- 0.1 for dugongs for the total surveyed area (17.1 km2). For all taxa, the presence or absence of land was a common best predictor for density. Time of day, presence of main benthic habitat type, and tide height were also included in best model predictors for various taxa. For tide surveys that were performed on one grid, tide height with date (one spring tide day and one neap tide day) as a random effect were in the top model results for all taxa (excluding dugongs). Hydrodynamics may influence distribution of megafauna in the surveyed grid, although there are likely other environmental factors that influence distribution which we may not have accounted for. This study provides essential insights for Aldabra's management against the backdrop of global climate change and biodiversity loss, setting a conservation baseline, with specific hotspots for each group identified in the study area.

AB  - Dominant species occupy a pivotal role in plant community, influencing the structure and function of the ecosystem. The spatial distributions of dominant species can react to the effect of different grazing intensities, thereby reflecting their tolerance and adaptive strategies toward grazing. In this study, geostatistical methods were mainly used to study the spatial distribution characteristics of Stipa krylovii Roshev. and Leymus chinensis (Trin.) Tzvel. species at two interval scales (quadrat size 5 m x 5 m, 10 m x 10 m) and two treatments (free grazing, FG, 1.66 sheep<middle dot>ha- 1<middle dot>a- 1; control, CK, 0 sheep<middle dot>ha- 1<middle dot>a- 1) in typical steppe of Inner Mongolia. A systematic sampling method was used in each 100 m x 100 m representative sample plots to obtain the height, coverage, and density of all species in the community. The results showed that grazing altered the concentrated distribution of S. krylovii and the spatial mosaic distribution pattern of S. krylovii and L. chinensis while having no effect on the spatial clumped distribution of L. chinensis. It also found that the spatial distributions of dominant species are primarily affected by structural factors, and random factors such as long-term grazing led to a transition of S. krylovii from a concentrated distribution to a small patchy random pattern should not be overlooked. Our findings suggest that long-term grazing alters the spatial distribution pattern of dominant species and that adaptive strategies may be the key for maintaining the dominant role of structural factors.

AB  - Grazing has proven to be a successful management tool in terms of the maintenance and restoration of biodiversity. Sheep and pastoralism can provide a various set of ecosystem services, i.e., benefits for humans from the environment. The Silesian Beskids, the westernmost part of the Carpathian Mountains, is an area with a long tradition of pastoralism. Since the 13th century, sheep have grazed clearings located in forests and in large areas of grasslands in mountains. In this study, we tried to identify all possible aspects of provisional, regulating and cultural services provided by sheep and the pasturage tradition bearing in mind the specificity of this region. The biodiversity maintenance and habitat creation due to grazing and the cultural values of pastoralism was illustrated using a literature review of data concerning cultural heritage, tourism and education and using our own phytosociological field studies performed in nine vegetation types within grazing sites. In order to examine the impact of grazing, an observation of sheep's daily grazing activity during the vegetation season using tractive GPS locators was conducted. The results showed that grazing has a positive impact on the maintenance of vegetation including EU-protected habitats. In addition, the pastoral activity introduced to the Beskids by the Vlachs contributed to the development of a specific highlander culture that continues to this day. Not all potential ecosystem services associated with the use of sheep are realized in the study area. Amongst the provisional services, sheep bones are not used while dairy is the most popular followed by meat. In turn, the cultural heritage of pastoralism is one of the most important drivers for the touristic attraction of Silesian Beskid.

AB  - The quantification of vegetation structure and composition at local and global scales provides valuable information for understanding the balance of the natural and human-made environment, which is crucial for natural resource planning and management, and the sustenance of ecosystem biodiversity. In this study, we proposed using the Sentinel 2A imagery to classify vegetation cover into communities based on the floristic association of individual vegetation species. We apply traditional remote sensing techniques to process the satellite image and identify training regions of interest (ROI) which are thoroughly assessed for spectral uniqueness before using the pixel-based supervised classification algorithms for our classification. Ground truthing assessment and species dominance computations are done to determine the vegetation community composition and naming based on floristic associations. We apply the floristic compositions output in analysing elephant movement tracks in the area, to assess the potential influence the location of specific vegetation species and communities utilized by elephants has on their movement and presence, as well as on elephant bulls and family groupings. The results show that the 10 m spatial resolution Sentinel-2A is suitable for investigating and mapping vegetation species in communities for large-scale mapping operations. We determined Near-Infrared band 8 and shortwave Infrared band 11 as key for identifying and differentiating ROIs at the floristic association community vegetation mapping level. We attained an overall accuracy of 87.395%. The analysis proved the 10 m spatial resolution of Sentinel 2A to be sufficient in distinguishing vegetation communities, including those with similar dominant species but variations in other contributing species. We also found a direct connection between vegetation location and elephant movement based on the summative analysis of utilised vegetation by the different elephant groupings. Bull elephants were predominantly present in areas with Combretum, family groups in areas with Commiphora, and mixed groups with both bulls and families in areas with Commiphora, and Cissus. This study shows the value that remote-sensing scientific support can offer conservationists and governments in objective evidence-based land management, policy making and governance.

AB  - Plant ecological traits affect the species identity of plant-colonizing arthropods, which in turn induces species-specific trait changes in plants, forming feedback between plants and arthropods. Such feedback can amplify initial differences in species composition, leading to large variations (i.e., high beta diversity). We hypothesized that the differences in plant initial conditions have sustained effects on arthropod community composition and species richness. To test this hypothesis, we monitored arthropod community assembly on a willow tree species, Salix eriocarpa, which was experimentally manipulated into three initial treatments: undamaged (in chamber 1); damaged by the specialist leaf beetle, Plagiodera versicolora (chamber 2); and "exposed " plants that were undamaged but were exposed to volatiles from damaged plants (in chamber 2). The arrival and population dynamics of the leaf beetle were affected by the plant's initial condition (chamber 1 vs. 2), which could result from the microscale environmental heterogeneity between chambers (chamber effect) and/or from the herbivory-related impacts (direct herbivory and exposure to induced volatiles in chamber 2). The community composition on damaged and exposed plants became significantly different on day 32. In addition, the divergence in composition between plant individuals was significantly smaller in undamaged plants (chamber 1) than in damaged and exposed plants (chamber 2) on day 60. The compositional variations (beta diversity) between chambers, between treatments, and between days, comprised a large proportion (two third) of the total species richness (gamma diversity) in the whole community of arthropods. These results suggest that plant initial condition is a key driver of community assembly and the maintenance of species diversity.

AB  - Large herbivores can exert pronounced top-down effects on plant communities in grassland ecosystems. Previous studies highlighted the importance of the composition and traits of living plants in regulating the impact of herbivores on plant community. However, there has been little consideration of whether and how plant litter, a ubiquitous "after-life" plant component, affects the outcome of herbivore grazing on grasslands. Here, we conducted a large-scale field experiment in temperate grasslands of northeastern China to investigate how standing plant litter influenced top-down effects of large herbivores (sheep; Ovis aries) on plant species richness, evenness, community composition, and productivity. We found that, in the presence of standing litter, sheep grazing significantly reduced living biomass of forbs by 56%, but have no effects on biomass of the dominant grass, Leymus chinensis. However, in the absence of standing litter, sheep shifted their diet preference from forbs to the grass L. chinensis, leading to a 36% decrease in the biomass of L. chinensis and a 21% decrease in total biomass. Such changes in foraging pressure on plant species led to competitive release that in turn significantly altered plant community composition and increased species evenness. Synthesis and applications. Our results demonstrate that standing litter can alter foraging behaviors of large herbivores and modifying the outcome of their top-down effects on plant community properties in grasslands. These cryptic but perhaps ubiquitous interactions between litter and herbivores may help us better understand the organization and dynamics of plant communities in the grazed grasslands, with important implications for developing effective management and conservation plans.

AB  - Insects perform important ecological roles that influence ecosystem functions, including primary production and nutrient cycling. Likewise, wetland ecosystems perform important functions and provide numerous services, yet they are highly vulnerable to loss. Wetland restoration and construction can provide habitat for insects and other organisms and recover ecosystem functions. While the community structure of plants and non-insect macroinvertebrates in restored and constructed wetlands often fails to recover to comparable levels of reference wetlands, less is known about the recovery of insect communities in restored wetlands. We aimed to determine if differences in biological structure (i.e., plant biomass and soil organic matter) between one reference and two constructed Juncus roemerianus-dominated tidal marshes extend to their respective insect communities. We classified insect communities into taxonomic families and functional feeding groups in one reference marsh and two constructed marshes in Alabama, USA. Sampling methods included replicated pan trapping, line-transect netting, floral observations and floral clippings. We also conducted light trapping at one site per marsh. All insect taxa and functional groups were identified monthly from April to October 2021 and analysed for taxon richness, abundance and H ' diversity. Floral density and herbivory scars on J. roemerianus shoots were also measured during flowering and peak growing seasons, respectively. While insect abundance and taxon richness were similar among sites, the reference marsh generally supported a more diverse insect community than the constructed marshes, although nocturnal flying insects were less diverse. Additionally, temporal shifts in community composition, based on relative abundances of insect taxa and functional feeding groups, differed among marshes, likely reflecting differences in habitats in the surrounding landscapes of each site. By comparing structural differences (i.e., taxonomic and functional) of insect communities in reference and constructed marshes, we can further understand the community composition of an understudied group of organisms, thereby informing restoration strategies to recover habitat and support the health of tidal marshes.
   The relative abundances of key functional groups and individual taxa were similar among marshes but changed significantly over time in a manner that was not similar across sites. Non-nocturnal insect communities failed to reach reference community structure and biodiversity. However, reference-level biodiversity was exceeded by nocturnal insect communities in constructed sites. Insect community structures and their temporal patterns may be driven by surrounding habitats, the extent of inundation and floral resource availability. image

AB  - Management for invasive species is usually done with the intent of maintaining or enhancing one or several ecosystem services. On rangeland landscapes, management is often focused on provisioning services (e.g., livestock) but can also include maintaining biodiversity. Rangeland landscapes are often large and complex, suggesting understanding the invasion and management efforts is best done at multiple scales. The objective of this study was to assess the effectiveness of sericea lespedeza (Lespedeza cuneata [Dum.-Cours] G. Don) management practices on two study areas that were focused on managing livestock and promoting biodiversity simultaneously. At one study area, an experiment containing 134 different prescribed fires was evaluated for 19 yrs comparing pyric herbivory with traditional rangeland management with fire and grazing on sericea lespedeza invasion. The second area had a 21-yr observational study across 16 000 ha with 541 different prescribed burns and on the effects of pyric herbivory and herbicide applications on sericea lespedeza. We found support that pyric herbivory with cattle (Bos spp.) or bison (Bos bison) contributed to long-term invasion mitigation for sericea lespedeza, whereas we found no support that other management practices added to the mitigation provided by pyric herbivory. We found no support for a season of fire effect and/or herbicide control. These practices only provided short-term sericea management (1 yr). Pyric herbivory remains the only viable management action that can reduce the rate of invasion and use this invasive forage legume for livestock production at actual management scales. This study demonstrates the importance of developing large-scale studies of realistic treatments that integrate practices such as fire, grazing, and herbicides to understand the effects of invasion and control efforts on rangelands with multiple objectives.

AB  - The heterogeneity of resource availability shapes animal movements at different spatio-temporal scales. Given that movements at various scales are assumed to be linked, the space use of temperate ungulates within seasonal ranges (winter, summer) should be related to their movement patterns at the annual scale. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the level of stationarity of moose (Alces alces) within their seasonal ranges and to link annual movement patterns to within-season space use. We analysed the ranging behaviour of 32 moose fitted with GPS collars from two study areas in Eastern Poland, where at the annual scale a fraction of individuals migrate between summer and winter ranges (partial migration). Our results revealed that moose stationarity within seasonal home ranges expressed remarkable variation. The probability of moose stationarity within seasonal ranges was significantly higher (by 23%), and the mean home range size tended to be lower (9.7 km(2)) among individuals that seasonally migrated than among non-migratory moose (14.3 km(2)). In addition, we found that (i) in summer, moose were significantly more stationary (by 19%) and exhibited a smaller mean home range size than in winter (9.0 and 15.9 km(2), respectively) and (ii) the mean seasonal home range size of males (19.6 km(2)) was remarkably greater than that of females (9.6 km(2)). Given the significant link between annual and seasonal scales of animal movements, any environmental change (e.g. climate warming) affecting an animal's annual movement strategy could alter within-season animal space use and presumably individual fitness. Significance statement To maximize their fitness, animals adjust their movements to deal with variations in resource distribution in the landscape. The scale of spatio-temporal variation causes different types of migratory behaviours, ranging from year-round stationarity to migration, when individuals establish spatially separated seasonal ranges. Studies on ungulates suggest that the stability and the size of seasonal home ranges can be linked to annual movement behaviour. Using the locations of GPS-tracked moose, we demonstrate in this study that migratory individuals were more prone to establishing stable seasonal home ranges (especially in summer) than moose that occupied the same area throughout the year. Moreover, stable seasonal home ranges were remarkably smaller in summer than in winter, which may suggest a season-specific spatial distribution and a renewability of moose forage. Our results show a clear link between different temporal scales of animal movements.

AB  - AimAnthropogenic threats often lead to range contraction towards the margins of a species historic niche, resulting in increased extinction risk. Here, we investigate niche characteristics of current and historic populations to evaluate changes in 'Area of Niche' (AON) following range loss from different levels of anthropogenic threats three congeneric Asian gazelle species are facing: Przewalski's (Procapra przewalskii), Tibetan (P. picticaudata) and Mongolian gazelles (P. gutturosa).LocationTibet, Qinghai and Mongolia.MethodsWe collated range maps for historic and contemporary distributions of Przewalski's, Tibetan and Mongolian gazelles and created 3-dimensional hypervolume and convex hull niche models using environmental variables from the Worldclim dataset (v2) together with topographic information from SRTM elevation data from historic and contemporary Area of Habitat maps and evaluated changes over time. We calculated Area of Niche (AON) maps by projecting a scaled Mahalanobis distance from the historic niche centroid of each grid cell onto each species' historic range. Finally, we evaluated how the protected area network overlaps with historic niche characteristics.ResultsThe endangered Przewalski's gazelle has lost almost all its range and niche, with remaining populations at niche peripheries. In contrast, the near-threatened Tibetan and least-concern Mongolian gazelles have lost less range and niche and contracted towards their historic niche centre. Protected areas for each species were biased towards the ecological margins of their historic ranges, which can result in sub-optimal conservation strategies.Main ConclusionsThis study uses niche modelling to evaluate changes in Area of Niche (AON) occupied by a species that has undergone range contraction. We highlight that species most affected by anthropogenic threats are most vulnerable to niche shift and contraction. These species are also vulnerable to a mismatch between the protected area network and species historic niche space. We advocate that conservation strategies should include niche dynamics as an indicator of the species risk.

AB  - We investigated the enduring consequences of a wildfire on nematode diversity and abundance in a pine forest, employing a slope gradient approach. Our primary objective was to determine the extent of post-fire alterations in the nematode community 3 years after the incident, to understand if the ecosystem has returned to its pre-fire state or has transitioned to a distinctive ecological environment. Three distinct burned pine forest sites at varying elevations were sampled to capture short-scale soil property variations due to slope gradients, while unburned forest sites served as controls. A consistent pattern emerged where the lowest altitude sites exhibited the highest nematode abundances, although still lower than unburned sites. Fire-induced changes were profound, shifting from fungivore dominance in unburned sites to bacterivore and herbivore dominance in burned sites. Alterations in soil properties post-fire, particularly reduced organic matter and nitrogen content, were closely associated with nematode community shifts. Water availability played a crucial role with lower moisture levels at higher elevations impacting nematode populations. Structural differences in the nematode community primarily resulted from fire disturbance rather than altitude. This study emphasizes the persistent and transformative impact of wildfire on nematode communities, highlighting the intricate interplay between ecological disturbances, soil properties, and nematode trophic dynamics.

AB  - Forest tree diversity helps shape the assembly of herbivorous insect communities in forests worldwide, and Island biogeography theory explains the role of tree range area as a driver of variation in native insect richness per tree species. However, it is unclear if these biogeographical principles apply to non-native insect herbivores. We created an extensive list of tree-insect associations for tree species native to Palearctic Europe bioregion, and investigated how both native and non-native insect herbivore species richness per tree may be influenced by various factors including the range area of the tree and the tree type (conifer or angiosperm). Models were further subsetted to compare drivers for the richness of different feeding guilds (folivores, sap feeders or wood borers) and host breadth (specialist or generalist). Tree range area had a positive effect on native, but not non-native, insect species richness per tree, while non-native richness was affected by host type and had a positive correlation with native herbivore richness on the same tree species. Host breadth grouping did not influence the difference in the effect of tree range on native versus non-native insect richness, but native folivores had a stronger relationship with range distribution area compared to the other groups. We conclude that the assembly of non-native herbivorous insect species on trees occurs through fundamentally different mechanisms than the co-evolutionary processes proposed by the framework of Island biogeography theory.

AB  - Invertebrate herbivory is a crucial process contributing to the cycling of nutrients and energy in terrestrial ecosystems. While the function of herbivory can decrease with land-use intensification, the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. We hypothesize that land-use intensification impacts invertebrate leaf herbivory rates mainly through changes in characteristics of plants and insect herbivores. We investigated herbivory rates (i.e., damaged leaf area) on the most abundant plant species in forests and grasslands and along land-use intensity gradients on 297 plots in three regions of Germany. To evaluate the contribution of shifts in plant community composition, we quantified herbivory rates at plant species level and aggregated at plant community level. We analyzed pathways linking land-use intensity, plant and insect herbivore characteristics, and herbivory rates. Herbivory rates at plant species and community level decreased with increasing land-use intensity in forests and grasslands. Path analysis revealed strong direct links between land-use intensity and herbivory rates. Particularly at the plant community level, differences in plant and herbivore composition also contributed to changes in herbivory rates along land-use intensity gradients. In forests, high land-use intensity was characterized by a larger proportion of coniferous trees, which was linked to reduced herbivory rates. In grasslands, changes in the proportion of grasses, plant fiber content, as well as the taxonomic composition of herbivore assemblages contributed to reduced herbivory rates. Our study highlights the potential of land-use intensification to impair ecosystem functioning across ecosystems via shifts in plant and herbivore characteristics. De-intensifying land use in grasslands and reducing the share of coniferous trees in temperate forests can help to restore ecosystem functionality in these systems.

AB  - To better understand vector-borne disease dynamics, knowledge of the ecological interactions between animal hosts, vectors, and pathogens is needed. The effects of hosts on disease hazard depends on their role in driving vector abundance and their ability to transmit pathogens. Theoretically, a host that cannot transmit a pathogen could dilute pathogen prevalence but increase disease hazard if it increases vector population size. In the case of Lyme disease, caused by Borrelia burgdorferi s.l. and vectored by Ixodid ticks, deer may have dual opposing effects on vectors and pathogen: deer drive tick population densities but do not transmit B. burgdorferi s.l. and could thus decrease or increase disease hazard. We aimed to test for the role of deer in shaping Lyme disease hazard by using a wide range of deer densities while taking transmission host abundance into account. We predicted that deer increase nymphal tick abundance while reducing pathogen prevalence. The resulting impact of deer on disease hazard will depend on the relative strengths of these opposing effects. We conducted a cross-sectional survey across 24 woodlands in Scotland between 2017 and 2019, estimating host (deer, rodents) abundance, questing Ixodes ricinus nymph density, and B. burgdorferi s.l. prevalence at each site. As predicted, deer density was positively associated with nymph density and negatively with nymphal infection prevalence. Overall, these two opposite effects canceled each other out: Lyme disease hazard did not vary with increasing deer density. This demonstrates that, across a wide range of deer and rodent densities, the role of deer in amplifying tick densities cancels their effect of reducing pathogen prevalence. We demonstrate how noncompetent host density has little effect on disease hazard even though they reduce pathogen prevalence, because of their role in increasing vector populations. These results have implications for informing disease mitigation strategies, especially through host management.

AB  - Domestic dogs Canis familiaris may cause a range of impacts on wildlife through predation, competition, pathogen transmission, harassment and hybridisation with wolves and other wild canids, yet such effects are less known than those of other domestic species.In this work, we have combined citizen science data and information collected by scientists on the potential impact of free-ranging dogs on wildlife in Italy. Citizen science data, obtained through online surveys on social networks, consisted of pictures of wildlife killed or harassed by dogs from 2002 to 2022. Additional records were collected from articles in newspapers. We also provide the results of a diet analysis from domestic dog scats, collected in the countryside in central Italy in 1998-1999, for which we assessed prey selection by comparing consumption with availability. The citizen science survey provided 589 records: dogs attacked and killed 95 species, mostly mammals and birds, including small game species. Among species of conservation concern, dogs attacked/killed Mustela putorius and Hystrix cristata, both included in Annex IV of the Habitats Directive, and the Italian endemic Lepus corsicanus and Passer italiae. Over 90% of the attacks were caused by unleashed dogs in the presence of their owner in urban and periurban areas. The 148 dog scats analysed contained 30 prey species, mainly mammals, which made the staple of the dog diet, followed by amorphous material, most likely pet food. Remains of domestic sheep were frequent in the diet, as were hares Lepus europaeus and roe deer Capreolus capreolus among wild mammals. Wild boar Sus scrofa ranked first among the selected prey species, followed by hares, whereas roe deer and grey partridges Perdix perdix were negatively selected. The mitigation of the impact of domestic carnivores on wildlife strongly requires awareness raising to promote responsible pet ownership and strict avoidance of dogs' free-ranging behaviour, especially where encounters with wildlife are most likely.

AB  - The timing of seedling emergence is strongly linked with fitness because it determines the biotic and abiotic environment experienced by plants in this vulnerable life stage. Experiments and observations consistently find that earlier-emerging plants have a competitive advantage over those emerging later. However, substantial genetic and phenotypic variation in emergence timing is harbored within and among plant populations, making it important to characterize the selective agents-including biotic interactions-that contribute to this variation. In seasonal herbaceous communities, we hypothesized that consumption of early-emerging individuals by vertebrates could weaken the strength of directional selection for earlier emergence in competitive environments. To investigate this, we carried out phenotypic selection analyses on emergence timing in two California grass species, the native Stipa pulchra and non-native Bromus diandrus, growing in intraspecific competitive neighborhoods with and without vertebrate herbivore exclusion. Vertebrate herbivores consistently weakened directional selection for earlier emergence. Our results demonstrate that vertebrate herbivores play an underappreciated selective role on phenology in plant populations, with implications for contemporary evolution, such as the potential of species to adapt to global environmental changes.

AB  - Microscopic analysis of indigestible fragments (microhistology) has long been used to monitor diets of wildlife, but the method is slow and difficult to replicate. We automated microhistology analysis by training a computer vision network to quantify the percent slide cover of identified fragments. We compared automated and manual analyses for 3 reference mixes with known proportions of plants and for samples of feces collected during the fall of 2016 and 2017 from white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) and goats (Capra aegagrus) with access to the same plants in the wild at the Sonora Research Station, Edward's Plateau, Texas. Consistent size and shape of fragments for grass (Bothriochloa ischaemum) and conifer (Juniperus ashei) were associated with absolute errors of 6 to 16% for both methods. Irregular fragments of leaves and acorns of oak (Quercus virginiana) were underestimated by both methods. Small star-shaped trichomes of a forb (Croton fruticulosus) were underestimated by computer analysis but overestimated by manual analysis. Fecal fragments from deer were more diverse in plant species and more variable in thickness and shape than those of goats. Computer analysis estimated conifer content of the goat diet within 4% of the manual estimate whereas those estimates for deer were up to 35% greater than the manual estimate. Automated analysis of digital images can increase the rigor of microhistology by expanding the size of sample sets and facilitating the routine use of calibrated references to assess errors in estimates of diet.

AB  - Arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi play a key role in terrestrial ecosystems by forming symbiotic relationships with plants and may confer benefits for sustainable agriculture, by reducing reliance on harmful fertiliser and pesticide inputs and enhancing plant resilience against insect herbivores. Despite their ecological importance, critical gaps in understanding AM fungal ecology limit predictions of their responses to global change in agroecosystems. However, predicting climate change impacts on AM fungi is important for maintaining crop productivity and ecosystem stability. Efforts to classify AM fungi based on functional traits, such as the competitor, stress-tolerator, ruderal (C-S-R) framework, aim to address these gaps but face challenges due to the obligate symbiotic nature of the fungi. As the framework is still widely used, we evaluate its applicability in predicting global change impacts on AM fungal communities in agroecosystems. Chagnon's adaptation of the C-S-R framework for AM fungi aligns with some study outcomes (e.g., under the context of water limitation) but faces challenges when used in complex climate change scenarios, varying agricultural conditions and/or extreme climatic conditions. The reliance on a limited dataset to classify AM fungal families further limits accurate predictions of AM fungal community dynamics. Trait data collection could support a nuanced understanding of AM fungi and leveraging AM fungal databases could streamline data management and analysis, enhancing efforts to clarify AM fungal responses to environmental change and guide ecosystem management practices. Thus, while the C-S-R framework holds promise, it requires additional AM fungal trait data for validation and improvement of its predictive power. Conclusively, before designing experiments based on life-history strategies and developing new frameworks tailored to AM fungi a critical first step is to gain a comprehensive understanding of their traits.

AB  - Forest cover and streamflow are generally expected to vary inversely because reduced forest cover typically leads to less transpiration and interception. However, recent studies in the western U.S. have found no change or even decreased streamflow following forest disturbance due to drought and insect epidemics. We investigated streamflow response to forest cover change using hydrologic, climatic, and forest data for 159 watersheds in the western U.S. from the CAMELS data set for the period 2000-2019. Forest change and disturbance were quantified in terms of net tree growth (total growth volume minus mortality volume) and mean annual mortality rates, respectively, from the U.S. Forest Service's Forest Inventory and Analysis database. Annual streamflow was analyzed using multiple methods: Mann-Kendall trend analysis, time trend analysis to quantify change not attributable to annual precipitation and temperature, and multiple regression to quantify contributions of climate, mortality, and aridity. Many watersheds exhibited decreased annual streamflow even as forest cover decreased. Time trend analysis identified decreased streamflow not attributable to precipitation and temperature changes in many disturbed watersheds, yet streamflow change was not consistently related to disturbance, suggesting drivers other than disturbance, precipitation, and temperature. Multiple regression analysis indicated that although change in streamflow is significantly related to tree mortality, the direction of this effect depends on aridity. Specifically, forest disturbances in wet, energy-limited watersheds (i.e., where annual potential evapotranspiration [PET] is less than annual precipitation) tended to increase streamflow, while post-disturbance streamflow more frequently decreased in dry water-limited watersheds (where the PET to precipitation ratio exceeds 2.35).
   Plain Language Summary Forest disturbance is typically expected to lead to increased runoff, and therefore more water available for aquatic ecosystems and people, because loss of forest vegetation results in less water being taken up and transpired by plants. We examined streamflow and forest change in 159 watersheds in the western U.S. to test this expectation. We found that not all disturbed watersheds experienced increased streamflow. Very dry watersheds were more likely to produce less runoff following forest disturbance and were also more likely to experience forest disturbance.

AB  - The Central Highlands region of Madagascar is currently dominated by open and mosaic ecosystems, and the region is targeted for afforestation projects. At present, little is known about the origin of these ecosystems and whether or not they are ancient or anthropogenically derived mosaics. This paper provides new insights into the environmental history and drivers of change in the Central Highlands of Madagascar during the last 6300 years through palaeoecological records from Lake Dangovavy. Our results suggested that open and mosaic ecosystems have been present in the landscape for at least 6000 years that is, 4 cal. ka BP before human settlement (2 cal. ka BP). Between 6.3 and 2 cal. ka BP landscapes were characterized by a mosaic ecosystem dominated by a matrix of open montane grassland and ericoid shrubland with extent forest patches, associated with seasonal variation of rainfall, and fire. A matrix of ericoid shrubland remained abundant in the landscape despite an increase of fire regime and herbivory activities between 2 and 1.1 cal. ka BP. Major changes in the vegetation were recorded during the last millennium with a shift towards a more open C4-dominated grassland associated with high fire frequency and herbivory activities, most likely linked to human influence. Our findings support the notion of the natural presence of open ecosystems on the islands. These shed light on the landscape history which should be considered when setting conservation goals with a particular focus on areas targeted for tree plantations and fire bans like the Central highlands of Madagascar.

AB  - Studies on animal camouflage offer some of the most compelling examples of microevolution via natural selection. If selection favouring camouflage is indeed widespread, the colour of the vegetation might act as a filter by removing non-camouflaged species. Consequently, the colouration and diversity of colours of animal communities may follow similar patterns to those of the vegetation. During wet and dry periods of the year, we extracted physical descriptors of chromatic and achromatic dimensions of arthropods and vegetation items collected from neighbouring vegetational types: a seasonal savanna (cerrado) and an evergreen gallery forest. Here, colouration can be understood as a trait, and we seek to describe and comprehend patterns at the community-level. The colours of the arthropods in the gallery forest were similar to the vegetation and followed the relatively small changes in this vegetational type. This could indicate the potential for the studied animals to be, overall, camouflaged against the vegetation. Conversely, the cerrado vegetation during the dry season was dominated by dry grasses and a homogeneous beige tint. After the dry season, the vegetation shifted to a bimodal distribution, dominated by the green of new leaves. The diversity of arthropod colours changed, to some extent, in concert with the vegetation. However, the peak location of arthropod colouration did not follow the vegetation. The Cerrado colour variation could act as one of the filters in these arthropod communities.

AB  - Ecological networks describe ecological interactions among species in ecosystems. In natural ecosystems, plant-mutualist (PM) and plant-herbivore (PH) networks are two of the most documented bipartite ecological networks, which are often interconnected through shared plants to form multilayer networks (here referred to as ecological networks with multiple interaction types). Recent developments in multilayer networks have challenged the effects of topological properties on biodiversity and stability once found in ecological networks with a single interaction type. In this study, my goal was to theoretically test the effects of the nested topology of subnetworks (i.e. plant-mutualist and plant-herbivore networks) on the local stability and persistence of the entire community and determine how their effect sizes were dependent on subnetwork structures and interconnection patterns. I used a simple algorithm to construct plant-mutualist or plant-herbivore networks with different levels of nestedness while fixing connectance and network size. By artificially interconnecting plant-mutualist and plant-herbivore networks through shared plants, I also manipulated the inter-subnetwork connection patterns as positive, negative and no correlations between the number of interacting partners of shared plants of two subnetworks. Community dynamics were simulated to show how subnetwork nestedness interacted with other network properties to affect local stability and persistence of multilayer networks. I found that low nestedness of both plant-mutualist and plant-herbivore subnetworks promoted stability and persistence. Effect sizes of the focal PM- or PH-subnetwork nestedness were positively associated with the nestedness levels of the interconnected subnetworks. A positive correlation between the mutualistic and herbivory generalism of plants also led to higher (signed) effect sizes of subnetwork nestedness. Further analyses showed that the effect sizes of the subnetwork nestedness also depended on subnetwork complexity and intraguild competition intensity. Finally, the modularity of interconnected subnetworks had little association with the effect sizes of subnetwork nestedness irrespective of interconnection patterns. The results demonstrate that the effects of topological structures (such as nestedness) on community dynamics in single-interaction networks may be altered by the architectures of multilayer networks, which highlights the need to study the interactions between the architectures of within- and inter-subnetworks in affecting ecosystem stability and biodiversity.

AB  - Successful conservation efforts have led to recent increases of large mammals such as European bison Bison bonasus, moose Alces alces and grey wolf Canis lupus and their return to former habitats in central Europe. While embraced by some, the recovery of these species is a controversial topic and holds potential for human-wildlife conflicts. Involving the public has been suggested to be an effective method for monitoring wildlife and mitigating associated conflicts. To assess two interrelated prerequisites for engaging people in Citizen Science (CS)-knowledge of returning species and respondents' readiness to participate in CS activities for monitoring and managing these species-we conducted a survey (questionnaire) in two wildlife parks located in different states of Germany. Based on 472 complete questionnaires, we developed generalized linear models to understand how sociodemographic variables and exposure to the species affected visitors' knowledge of each species, and to investigate if sociodemographic variables and knowledge influenced the likelihood of visitors to participate in CS activities. Almost all visitors were aware of the returning wolf population, while knowledge and awareness about bison and moose were significantly lower. Knowledge of the two herbivores differed geographically (higher knowledge of moose in the north-eastern state), possibly indicating a positive association between exposure to the species and knowledge. However, models generally performed poorly in predicting knowledge about wildlife, suggesting that such specific knowledge is insufficiently explained by sociodemographic variables. Our model, which explained stated willingness in CS indicated that younger participants and those with higher knowledge scores in the survey were more willing to engage in CS activities. Overall, our analyses highlight how exposure to large mammals, knowledge about wildlife and human demographics are interrelated-insights that are helpful for effectively recruiting citizen scientists for wildlife conservation.

AB  - Understanding mammalian responses to anthropogenic disturbance is challenging, as ecological processes and the patterns arising therefrom notoriously change across spatial and temporal scales, and among different landscape contexts. Responses to local scale disturbances are likely influenced by landscape context (e.g., overall landscape-level disturbance, landscape-level productivity). Hierarchical approaches considering small-scale sampling sites as nested holons within larger-scale landscapes, which constrain processes in lower-level holons, can potentially explain differences in ecological processes between multiple locations. We tested hypotheses about mammal responses to disturbance and interactions among holons using collected images from 957 camera sites across 9 landscapes in Alberta from 2007 to 2020 , examined occurrence for 11 mammal species using generalized linear mixed models. White-tailed deer occurred more in higher disturbed sites within lower disturbed landscapes (beta = -0.30 [-0.4 to -0.15]), whereas occurrence was greater in highly disturbed sites within highly disturbed landscapes for moose (beta = 0.20 [0.09-0.31]), coyote (beta = 0.20 [0.08-0.26]) , lynx (beta = 0.20 [0.07-0.26]). High disturbance sites in high productivity landscapes had higher occurrence of black bears (beta = -0.20 [-0.46 to -0.01]), lynx (beta = -0.70 [-0.97 to -0.34]), and wolves (beta = -0.50 [-0.73 to -0.21]). Conversely, we found higher probability of occurrence in low productivity landscapes with increasing site disturbance for mule deer (beta = 0.80 [0.39-1.14]), and white-tailed deer (beta = 0.20 [0.01-0.47]). We found the ecological context created by aggregate sums (high overall landscape disturbance), and by subcontinental hydrogeological processes in which that landscape is embedded (high landscape productivity), alter mammalian responses to anthropogenic disturbance at local scales. These responses also vary by species, which has impli- cations for large-scale conservation planning. Management interventions must consider large-scale geoclimatic processes and geographic location of a landscape when assessing wildlife responses to disturbance.

AB  - Non-native grazers compete with native species across the globe. We present a novel approach to study the composition of the herbaceous understory across three study areas within the Great-Basin with different historic and contemporary grazing regimes. We surveyed the landscape using distance sampling for livestock and horse feces as an index of use. In addition, we surveyed the herbaceous understory of random sites as well as sites chosen by female Greater sage-grouse to nest and brood their chicks. We used a novel Bayesian hierarchical modeling framework to link vegetation metrics with the spatial-temporal distribution of horses and livestock while accounting for observation error. When livestock and feral horses were not present, we found that Greater sage-grouse use sites with higher percentages of perennial grasses and forbs to build their nests and brood their chicks compared with what was available to them. As livestock increased, we found evidence for decreases in the percentage of perennial grasses, forbs, cheatgrass (Bromus tectorum), and increases in the amount of bare ground. These effects were consistent at available sites and brood sites; however, we found less evidence for an impact of livestock at nest sites. As feral horses increased, we observed similar results at available sites, but at sites chosen by females to nest and brood their chicks, we observed increases in the amount of invasive cheatgrass as feral horses increased, which could reflect attempts by Greater sage-grouse to compensate for reductions in protective cover. We present a noninvasive approach to assess space use that can be applied to other species. More importantly, we document that grazing by non-native ungulates impacts components of the plant community important to Greater sage-grouse reproduction. We provide spatial-temporal maps of livestock and feral horse use to aid managers attempting to balance the needs of livestock producers, feral horses, Greater sage-grouse, and ecosystem function.

AB  - The grassland biome supports an enormous diversity of life and includes ecosystems used extensively by humans. Although graminoids lend grasslands their characteristic appearance, forbs are largely responsible for their taxonomic, phylogenetic, and functional diversity. In terms of abundance, however, forbs often play a subordinate role relative to graminoids. Yet this may be a relatively recent phenomenon; evidence is mounting that forbs comprised a major part of the richness of, and were abundant in, the extensive and highly productive grasslands of the Pleistocene, the so-called "mammoth steppe". As a legacy of their past prevalence under intensive grazing by megafaunal herbivores, we hypothesize that forbs were, and still are, dependent on niche construction by large mammalian herbivores. We suggest that the high species richness of forbs in grasslands globally merits greater research and conservation attention, and management actions tailored to sustain their abundance and diversity.

AB  - Mountain forest dynamics and ecosystems services are critically influenced by disturbances, in particular storm events. After extensive disturbance, the large amount of deadwood lying on ground and the necessity for restoring the forest cover with natural regeneration are two critical issues to be dealt with. Salvage logging is the most common post-disturbance management strategy, but it does not consider the strategic role of coarse woody debris (CWD) in favoring regeneration establishment and survival. The aim of this study is to analyze how CWD contributes to creating favorable microsites for regeneration, increasing seedling establishment probability, after a large windthrow in the eastern Italian Alps. We focused on two different facilitative mechanisms provided by CWD, microsite amelioration and seedling protection, by planting a set of seedlings in the surroundings of deadwood elements. The former mechanism was analyzed by measuring temperature and SWC (Soil Water Content) locally, while for the latter we recorded evidence of browsing at the end of the season. For each trial, we established control sites in empty areas nearby with no CWD presence in order to infer its contribution. The results show that north-facing microsites on south-exposed slopes offer significantly lower temperature and fewer water stress for saplings, in comparison to south-facing microsites. More in general, saplings on deadwood-mitigated microsites are less exposed to desiccation, which mitigates the transplanting shock and facilitates the establishment. Moreover, the presence of lying deadwood increases roughness and, as a consequence, the cost for browsers to reach the seedlings. Using a coefficient expressing this increment, we underline the significant protective effect of CWD against deer browsing. The results of our study highlight the importance of deadwood in providing favorable regeneration microsites, enhancing the probability of sapling establishment and survival, protecting them from deer browsing.

AB  - Given the time scale based on the duration of exposure to global warming, natural climate-gradient studies and experimental manipulations have detected long-term (decades to centuries) and short-term (years to decades) ecological responses to global warming. Combination of these two complementary approaches within a single study may enable prediction of the likely responses of ecological processes to global warming. To understand how global warming affects plant-herbivore interactions within a canopy of Erman's birch, we combined an elevational gradient study and a warming experiment involving mature birch trees in which the soil and tree branches were warmed separately. In the elevational gradient study, herbivory by chewing insects and plant growth increased as elevation decreased, and the concentrations of condensed tannins and total phenolics in the leaves decreased. In the warming experiment, soil warming alone increased herbivory, and the addition of branch warming amplified the effect on herbivory. Soil warming alone decreased the tannin concentration, and the addition of branch warming led to a further reduction. The variation in herbivory was best explained by the tannin content of leaves. Our experimental results demonstrate that the decreased tannin content of leaves due to a combination of soil and branch warming was an important driver of increased herbivory in the canopy of the mature birch trees. The similar tendencies in the short- and long-term responses imply that global warming is likely to increase background herbivory in mature birch trees by decreasing the tannin content of leaves in the canopy.

AB  - Large carcasses often attract multiple carnivore species, so subordinate carnivores must weigh the reward of a profitable meal with the risk of being attacked by dominant carnivores. These risk-reward trade-offs are likely influenced by a variety of factors, including scale-dependent risk from dominant carnivores (e.g., short- vs. long-term risk) and the amount of carcass remaining. In the southeastern United States, human hunters provision a large amount of white-tailed deer carrion, which appears to be an important food source for coyotes (a novel top predator), but we know little about how coyotes influence the scavenging behavior of smaller carnivores. In this study, we evaluated the relative importance of risk from coyotes, vulture activity, forest structure, and remaining food on bobcat, gray fox, raccoon, and opossum scavenging by deploying 71 deer carcasses within a managed forest in South Carolina during January 2020 and 2021. We found that coyotes only had direct effects on bobcat behavior, suggesting that competition for carcasses was greatest between these two species. However, the relative importance of long- versus short-term risk from coyotes was dependent on the stage in the scavenging process. Effects from forest structure were also stage-dependent, where tree density and age were related to carcass discovery for bobcats and raccoons, while minimal understory cover facilitated bobcat, gray fox, and opossum scavenging, despite short-term risk from coyotes. Vulture activity appeared to serve as a cue for gray foxes to discover carcasses. Ultimately, we found that risk from coyotes had species-specific and context-dependent effects on smaller carnivore scavenging. This represents some of the first direct evidence of how coyotes alter smaller carnivore behavior in a region where coyotes are a novel top predator. However, forest structure (particularly understory cover) seemed to mediate risk from coyotes, highlighting how habitat can influence predator-predator interactions. Future research should also investigate these interactions during other times of the year and try to quantify how human-provisioned carcasses influence populations and communities.

AB  - Deer species play a key role in processes that maintain ecosystem community structure and composition. However, several of the species are considered at risk of extinction. One of the strategies for their conservation is the maintenance of legally protected areas in which administration is prescribed by a management plan. Species inventories form the basis of this instrument as it allows to identify key resources and taxons. We reviewed the management plans of Brazilian protected areas to assess the suitability of methods employed to identify deer species. We reviewed 118 management plans (covering 298,000 km(2) of protected area) and checked each occurrence record for information regarding detection methods, which we classified according to their suitability for species-level identification. We found that 38% of the records did not report the species detection method used. Specific identifications were obtained through seven different methodologies, of which 12% were considered suitable, 28% were suitable with caveats, and 60% were unsuitable for species identification. We conclude it is necessary to improve the scientific rigor applied to inventories and data collection to avoid producing further inconsistent information, as this might affect management actions and risks the exclusion of threatened species from public policies on conservation planning.

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic has drastically affected people's social habits, especially those related to outdoor activities. We intended to understand the effects of the two national lockdowns in Portugal on the presence and activity of a wild population of red deer (Cervus elaphus) by analysing data from camera traps installed at Lousa & SIM; mountain, in the central part of Portugal. The cameras were set between 2019 and 2021, and a total of 2434 individual contacts of red deer and 182 contacts of people were recorded. Results showed a higher human presence in the mountain area during the COVID-19 outbreak, especially during the first lockdown in 2020 (0.05 & PLUSMN; 0.17 individuals/day), compared to the same period of the year before the pandemic (0.02 & PLUSMN; 0.05 individuals/day), which resulted in an increase of people by 150%. The increase in human presence did not have a significant direct effect on the presence of red deer. Despite the low overlap of activity patterns between people and red deer, deer showed avoidance behaviour in the 24 h after the detection of human presence on camera traps, as well as an increase in daily activity during the 2020 lockdown, showing red deer's awareness of human visitation. These results showed that people's increased search for cultural services in wild environments during COVID19 lockdowns, such as hiking and biking, seemed to influence the population of red deer, albeit momentarily.

AB  - Aims: To explore the relationship between plant communities and key environmental drivers in the Andes of northwest Patagonia, Argentina, and to evaluate the applicability of traditional phytosociological definitions to this region. Methods: We conducted 141 vegetation samples using a stratified systematic sampling design. This was done along two steep gradients of aridity and temperature, which are further modified by local factors that include successional changes due to fire and soil variation. We employed a series of multivariate approaches, including hierarchical clustering, Indicator Species Analysis (ISA), restricted Monte Carlo permutation tests, and both constrained and unconstrained ordinations, to identify (a) the main plant community types, (b) their representative species, and (c) the primary drivers of variation in species composition. Finally, we compared the obtained groups and species to associations described by earlier expert-based classifications. Results: From the set of analyses, we identified six different plant community types with 241 recorded species. We found significant differences across communities' species composition and their environmental indicators. Among the considered environmental variables, elevation and annual precipitation had the strongest effect on species composition. Additionally, variation in composition was significantly related to forest structure, land use and soil characteristics. We further outlined the influence of locally biased classifications based on a predominance of sampling in areas western to the Andes in classification systems developed in the region. Conclusion: Our analysis allowed us to identify the most relevant environmental drivers and indicator species of the six classified plant communities based on numerical methods. The findings highlight the importance of considering full ecological gradients and communities' responses for developing stable classification approaches.

AB  - The possibility of Toxoplasma gondii transmitted from game meat to humans is of public health concern. Here we determined seroprevalence and risk factors associated with T. gondii in large game ungulates that cohabit in Sierras de Cazorla, Segura and Las Villas Natural Park (SCSV-NP) (Southern Spain), a natural park with high human-animal interaction. Antibodies against T. gondii in 328 wild ungulates were assayed by the modified agglutination test (MAT >= 1:25). Antibodies were found in 39 (11.9%, 95% CI: 8.4-15.4) wild ungulates, with seroprevalence levels of 20.8% in wild boars (Sus scrofa) (5/24), 19.0% in fallow deer (Dama dama) (12/63), 13.9% in Iberian ibex (Capra pyrenaica hispanica) (14/101), 7.9% in red deer (Cervus elaphus) (6/76), and 3.1% in mouflons (Ovis aries musimon) (2/64). Significantly higher seroprevalence was observed in fallow deer and wild boars compared to mouflons. Animals living close to urban areas (<2 km) had 4.6-times higher risk compared to those living at >5 km of urban areas. The results indicate high circulation of T. gondii in wild ungulates in SCSV-NP, which is of animal and public health concern. The increased seroprevalence of T. gondii detected in wildlife ungulates living close to urban areas may increase human infection in those areas if meat from infected animals is consumed raw or undercooked.

AB  - Factors that influence the composition and diversity of soil nematode communities on oceanic islands are poorly understood. In this study, we evaluated the soil nematode communities and associated biotic and abiotic factors on five oceanic islands in the north of the South China Sea. We detected 38 nematode genera and found that bacterivores and fungivores were the dominant trophic groups, representing 54.2-70.4% and 15.1-35.3%, respectively, of total soil nematode abundance. The abundances of total soil nematodes and of all trophic groups, maturity, structure indices and nematode diversity were positively correlated with island latitude and area, and were negatively correlated with soil total K and annual temperature. In addition, the abundances of total soil nematodes, bacterivores, herbivores and nematode dominance index were positively associated with soil available K. The abundances of total soil nematodes, fungivores, herbivores, predators and omnivores, maturity, structure, Shannon diversity indices were positively related to soil moisture. Variation partitioning analysis showed that the combination of soil properties and climatic-geographical factors explained more of the variation (26.8-61.5%). The results suggest that larger island can maintain greater nematode diversity than smaller islands due to the greater diversity of habitats on larger island. The key climatic-geographical and edaphic factors affecting soil nematode communities were latitude, annual temperature, soil moisture and total K, respectively

AB  - Wetlands are one of the ecosystems most easily and severely invaded by alien species. Biological invasions can have significant impacts on local plant communities and ecosystem functioning. While numerous studies have assessed the impacts of biological invasions on wetlands, relatively few have been conducted in protected areas such as national wetland parks. We conducted a field survey to investigate the effects of the invasive herb Alternanthera philoxeroides (alligator weed) on the productivity and structure of plant communities and soil microbial communities in the Lishui Jiulong National Wetland Park in Zhejiang, China. We also examined the potential influence of the distance to the river edge on the impact of the alligator weed invasion. The alligator weed invasion significantly altered the plant community structure. It reduced the coverage of co-occurring plant species, including native (-31.2 %), invasive (-70.1 %), and non-invasive alien plants (-58.4 %). However, it increased species richness by 50 %, Pielou's evenness by 20 %, and Simpson's diversity index by 29.1 % for the overall plant community. Furthermore, within the community not invaded by alligator weed, increasing the distance to the river edge decreased the number of native plants by 57.0 % and the aboveground biomass of other invasive plants by 78.6 %. Contrary to expectations, no effects of the alligator weed invasion were observed on soil fungal and bacterial communities. Therefore, the impacts of the alligator weed invasion varied with spatial context and plant category, emphasizing the need to consider multiple scales and environmental factors when assessing the effects of invasive species on plant biodiversity. These insights enhance our understanding of plant invasions in wetlands and can guide the development of effective management strategies for these important ecosystems.

AB  - Grazing animals can shape plant community composition and functioning through three mechanisms: defoliation, excreta return (dung and urine deposition), and trampling. However, little field research has been done to explore the independent effects of these grazing mechanisms on grassland compositional and functional (ANPP) temporal stability, though it is essential for preserving a sustainable grazing system. To fill this gap, we conducted field experiments in two grasslands (typical and meadow steppe) in the eastern Eurasian temperate steppe to explore the individual and combined effects of defoliation, excreta return and trampling on plant diversity, species asynchrony, dominant species stability, and consequently grassland temporal stability. We showed that defoliation played a predominant role in regulating grassland temporal stability in both steppes. Defoliation significantly increased community compositional and functional temporal stability in typical steppe, but decreased community compositional temporal stability and showed no effect on functional temporal stability in the meadow steppe. This was mainly due to different responses of the dominant species on the two steppes. Grassland temporal stability was also dependent on trampling from animal hooves, which caused a decrease in community functional temporal stability in the meadow steppe, yet had no effect on the typical steppe. Although excreta return alone did not affect grassland temporal stability, it significantly promoted community compositional temporal stability when combined with defoliation in the typical steppe. Species asynchrony and dominant species stability largely contributed to grassland community compositional and functional temporal stability. Our simulated grazing experiment demonstrated that maintaining ecosystem temporal stability in grazed grasslands is a complex process driven by various mechanisms. Defoliation and trampling by herbivores jointly influenced both compositional and functional temporal stability, and external nutrient addition may be necessary for maintaining grassland temporal stability during livestock grazing management, given the dominant impact of herbivore defoliation. Our findings help improve our understanding of grazing practices regulating grassland temporal stability in temperate steppes. Moreover, this study suggests that grassland management should consider the response strategies of dominant species to grazing disturbance, offering valuable guidance for sustainable grazing practice and future policy decision-making.

AB  - Abiotic and biotic factors influence seagrass resilience, but the strength and relative importance of the effects are rarely assessed over the complete lifecycle. This study examined the effects of abiotic (salinity, temperature, water depth) and biotic (grazing by black swans) factors on Ruppia spp. over the complete lifecycle. Structures were set up in two estuaries ( - 33.637020, 115.412608) that prevented and allowed natural swan grazing of the seagrasses in May 2019, before the start of the growing season. The density of life stage(s) was measured from June 2019 when germination commenced through to January 2020 when most of the seagrass senesced. Our results showed that swans impacted some but not all life stages. Seedling densities were significantly higher in the plots that allowed natural grazing compared to the exclusion plots (e.g. 697 versus 311 seedlings per m-2), revealing an apparent benefit of swans. Swans removed <= 10% of seagrass vegetation but a dormant seedbank was present and new propagules were also observed. We conclude that grazing by swans provides some benefit to seagrass resilience by enhancing seedling recruitment. We further investigated the drivers of the different lifecycle stages using general additive mixed models. Higher and more variable salinity led to increased seed germination whilst temperature explained variation in seedling density and adult plant abundance. Bet-hedging strategies of R. polycarpa were revealed by our lifecycle assessment including the presence of a dormant seedbank, germinated seeds and seedlings over the 8-month study period over variable conditions (salinity 2-42 ppt; temperatures 11-28 degrees C). These strategies may be key determinants of resilience to emerging salinity and temperature regimes from a changing climate.

AB  - Fences are a common feature throughout the landscape of North America's Great Plains region. Knowledge surrounding the harmful implication that fences have on the movement of wildlife, specifically ungulates, is expanding. Across the region, it is accepted that there is a need to mitigate the impacts of barbed wire fencing and that "wildlife-friendlier" fence designs are emerging as a practical tool to meet these goals. Here we evaluate the response of sympatric deer species to the implementation of two fence modifications, fastening the top two wires together using clips and the installation of polyvinyl chloride (PVC) pipe to encompass the top two wires. We also aim to determine the optimal top wire height to allow for successful crossing by deer, with the goal to provide a more robust understanding of effective wildlife-friendlier fence standards. We used remote trail cameras to capture crossing events and recorded responses for mule deer (Odocoileus hemionus) and white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus). Using generalized linear mixed modelling, we tested the influence modifications had on crossing success and decisions prior to and after the modifications were installed compared to control sites. We found that these modifications had little impact on deer crossing behavior. We determined that wire height had the greatest impact on the permeability of fences, but that deer permeability was strongly influenced by species and sex. We found that the current maximum recommended top wire height of 102 cm (40 inches) is adequate to allow individuals of both deer species to cross over the fence, with the exception of female mule deer. Our results also indicate as the top wire height reaches 110 cm (43 inches) or higher, that the probability of successfully jumping over the fence dramatically drops off, with the exception for male mule deer. We recommend the installation of clips as a cost-effective method to lower top wire height and PVC pipe to improve fence visibility and potentially reduce entanglement events, all while effectively keeping livestock in intended pastures.

AB  - Simple Summary Buffalo breeding in the Amazon biome can contribute significantly to local community development and, thus, is considered an essential income source. However, in Amazon regions, the inadequate breeding of these animals can lead to considerable negative consequences for the environment. Therefore, it is crucial to develop methodologies to improve animal management and grass yield. One of these methodologies is related to Precision Agriculture (PA), adapted for pasture and animal monitoring. Along these lines, we seek to utilize geostatistical techniques and remote sensing applications to better understand Buffalo grazing under a rotating system. In particular, we analyze forage Dry and Green Matter, as well as pH in pasture soils, demonstrating the obstacles against and advantages of the implementation of precise techniques for decision making and increasing grass productivity. We describe ways in which geostatistical soil pH mapping can be conducted, as well as the premises necessary to include remote sensing data in the analysis of pasture variables. Implementing these results in buffalo management systems can contribute to greater productivity and increasingly sustainable livestock. The mapping of pastures can serve to increase productivity and reduce deforestation, especially in Amazon Biome regions. Therefore, in this study, we aimed to explore precision agriculture technologies for assessing the spatial variations of soil pH and biomass indicators (i.e., Dry Matter, DM; and Green Matter, GM). An experiment was conducted in an area cultivated with Panicum maximum (Jacq.) cv. Mombaca in a rotational grazing system for dairy buffaloes in the eastern Amazon. Biomass and soil samples were collected in a 10 m x 10 m grid, with a total of 196 georeferenced points. The data were analyzed by semivariogram and then mapped by Kriging interpolation. In addition, a variability analysis was performed, applying both the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI) derived from satellite remote sensing data. The Kriging mapping between DM and pH at 0.30 m depth demonstrated the best correlation. The vegetative index mapping showed that the NDVI presented a better performance in pastures with DM production above 5.42 ton/ha(-1). In contrast, DM and GM showed low correlations with the NDWI. The possibility of applying a variable rate within the paddocks was evidenced through geostatistical mapping of soil pH. With this study, we contribute to understanding the necessary premises for utilizing remote sensing data for pasture variable analysis.

AB  - Predator species can indirectly affect prey species through the cost of anti-predator behavior responses, which may involve shifts in occupancy, space use, or movement. Quantifying the various strategies implemented by prey species to avoid adverse interactions with predators can lead to a better understanding of potential population-level repercussions. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to examine predator-prey interactions by quantifying the effect of predator species presence on detection rates of prey species, using coyotes (Canis latrans) and white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) in Central Appalachian forests of the eastern United States as a model predator-prey system. To test two competing hypotheses related to interspecific interactions, we modeled species detections from 319 camera traps with a two-species occupancy model that incorporated a continuous-time detection process. We found that white-tailed deer occupancy was independent of coyote occupancy, but white-tailed deer were more frequently detectable and had greater detection intensity at sites where coyotes were present, regardless of vegetation-related covariates. In addition, white-tailed deer detection rates at sites with coyotes were highest when presumed forage availability was relatively low. These findings suggest that white-tailed deer may be exhibiting an active avoidance behavioral response to predators by increasing movement rates when coyotes are present in an area, perhaps due to reactive evasive maneuvers and/or proactive attempts to reduce adverse encounters with them. Concurrently, coyotes could be occupying sites with higher white-tailed deer densities. Because white-tailed deer did not exhibit significant shifts in daily activity patterns based on coyote occupancy, we further suggest that white-tailed deer in our study system generally do not use temporal partitioning as their primary strategy for avoiding encounters with coyotes. Overall, our study implements a recently developed analytical approach for modeling multi-species occupancy from camera traps and provides novel ecological insight into the complex relationships between predator and prey species.

AB  - Rocky environments host rich levels of biodiversity and provide vital habitat for specialised organisms, range-restricted species and a broad range of ectotherms adapted to saxicoline environments.
   In Australia, rock habitat is being destroyed during soil amelioration practices associated with agricultural intensification. Advances in rock crushing technology, developed to expand or increase crop yields and efficiency, pose an undocumented threat to global biodiversity, especially reptiles dependent on non-renewable rock habitat in agricultural landscapes. Rock removal is a legislated key threatening process in parts of Australia and will accelerate biodiversity loss if not mitigated.
   We estimated reptile species' range overlap with dryland cropping and modified pastoral regions within the Australian wheat-sheep zone to assess the potential impacts of rock crushing practices. We examined species- and family-richness within the impact zone and across bioregions within the impact zone, to identify areas where rock removal has the greatest potential to impact terrestrial and fossorial squamates.
   Our analysis revealed that 159 potentially impacted reptile species occur within the study area, representing 16% of Australian terrestrial squamates. Fourteen of these species, including six threatened species, have more than 50% range overlap with areas of intensive agriculture, and include several endangered pygopodids, scincids and agamids.
   Bioregions rich in rock and burrow-dwelling reptiles include the Brigalow Belt South, Murray Darling Depression, Darling Riverine Plains, Eyre Yorke Block, Avon Wheatbelt, Nandewar, Flinders Lofty Block and New South Wales South Western Slopes.
   Synthesis and applications. The conservation of reptiles in agricultural landscapes requires appropriate management and retention of surface rocks. Potential yield increases from destroying rock habitat to intensify or expand cropland will not compensate for the net loss of reptile populations dependent on non-renewable resources. Financial incentives to prevent the expansion and transformation of non-arable landscapes to cropland are required to prevent the ongoing loss of biodiversity.

AB  - 1. In grassland ecosystems, large herbivorous animal grazing activity and increasing nitrogen deposition strongly alter microbial community structure and function. Understanding the effects of grazing and nitrogen addition on the spatial heterogeneity in soil microbial community structure, enzymatic activities and the underlying mechanisms are crucial for making better predictions of soil organic matter dynamics and nutrient cycling.
   2. We examined the spatial heterogeneity of soil microbial community structure and enzymatic activity associated with changes in soil microclimate, soil characteristics, plant biomass and soil nutrient responses to grazing and nitrogen addition using a manipulative experiment with control (CK), grazing (G), nitrogen addition (N) and grazing plus nitrogen addition (NG) treatments in a Leymus chinensis meadow steppe, in north-eastern China.
   3. The results demonstrated that soil microbial community structure and enzymatic activities showed a high level of spatial dependence [C/(C + C0) >= 0.9] in the CK plot. G, N and NG treatments not only reduced the spatial variability of soil microbial community structure and enzymatic activities but also reshaped the spatial links between enzyme activities and microbial community structure. Litter biomass, soil temperature and soil nutrients (soil dissolved inorganic nitrogen or soil dissolved organic carbon) explained 21%-27% of the spatial variability of soil microbial community structure in the CK treatment and pH was the strongest driver for the spatial variability of soil enzymatic activities. Meanwhile, the homogenization in soil water content induced by the N addition treatment was a determinant of the reduction in spatial heterogeneity of the microbial community structure. The combination of soil physico-chemical properties (bulk density, soil pH and soil dissolved inorganic nitrogen), soil temperature and root biomass explained 32%-43% of the spatial variability of the microbial community structure in the G treatment, and N and G treatments had additive effects on the spatial heterogeneity of total PLFAs by homogenizing root biomass. Plant biomass and microbial community structure were the major drivers for the spatial heterogeneity of enzymatic activities under G, N and NG. In NG, the change in spatial variability of enzymatic activities was dominated by N addition. Regardless of grazing, N addition facilitated the spatial correlation between microbial community structure and enzyme activities.
   4. Overall, our results revealed the drivers of soil microbial community structure and enzymatic activities spatial pattern shift due to grazing and N addition, highlighting the role that spatial variability in soil microbial community structure and enzymatic activities has on the L. chinensis meadow steppe.

AB  - Quaking aspen (Populus tremuloides Michx.) ecosystems are highly valued in the southwestern United States because of the ecological, economic, and aesthetic benefits they provide. Aspen has experienced extensive mortality in recent decades, and there is evidence that many areas in Arizona, United States lack adequate recruitment to replace dying overstory trees. Maintaining sustainable levels of regeneration and recruitment (i.e. juveniles) is critical for promoting aspen ecosystem resilience and adaptive capacity, but questions remain about which factors currently limit juvenile aspen and which strategies are appropriate for managing aspen in an increasingly uncertain future. To fill these critical knowledge gaps, we sampled aspen populations across Arizona and collected data representing a suite of biotic and abiotic factors that potentially influence juvenile aspen. Specifically, we addressed two questions: (i) Is aspen sustainably regenerating and recruiting in Arizona? and (2) Which biotic and abiotic factors significantly influence aspen regeneration and recruitment? We found that many aspen populations in Arizona lack sustainable levels of juvenile aspen, and the status of recruitment was especially dire, with 40% of study plots lacking a single recruiting stem. Aspen regeneration was less abundant on warmer sites than cooler ones, highlighting the threat that a rapidly warming climate poses to aspen sustainability. Aspen recruitment was significantly more abundant in areas with recent fire than in areas without fire, and recruitment had a strong positive relationship with fire severity. The most important limiting factors for aspen recruitment were ungulate browse, especially by introduced Rocky Mountain elk (Cervus canadensis nelsoni), and the invasive insect, oystershell scale (Lepidosaphes ulmi). We conclude with a discussion of how management can promote sustainability of aspen populations by addressing the array of threats that aspen faces, such as a warming climate, chronic ungulate browse, and outbreaks of oystershell scale.

AB  - Prey respond to predation risk with a range of behavioral tactics that can vary based on space use and hunting mode of the predator. Unlike other predators, human hunters are often more spatially and temporally restricted, which creates a period of short-duration, high-intensity predation risk for prey. Consequently, identifying the roles different hunting modes (i.e., archery and rifle), hunts for targeted and non-targeted species, and landscape features play in altering spatial and temporal responses of prey to predation risk by humans is important for effective management of harvested populations. From 2009 to 2016, we used a large-scale experiment including 50 animal-years of location data from 38 unique male elk (Cervus canadensis) to quantify changes in movement and resource selection in response to hunters during 3 separate 5-day controlled hunts for antlered males (elk archery, deer [Odocoileus spp.] rifle, and elk rifle) at the Starkey Experimental Forest and Range in northeast Oregon, USA. We evaluated competing hypotheses regarding elk responses to varying levels of prey risk posed by the different hunt types. We predicted that the strength of elk behavioral responses would increase with perceived hunter lethality (i.e., weak response to elk archery but similar response to elk and deer rifle hunts) and that prey response would be closely associated with hunter activity within the diel cycle (greater during diurnal than nocturnal hours) and across hunting seasons. Elk responses were strongest during diurnal hours when hunters were active on the landscape and were generally more pronounced during both rifle hunts than during the archery hunt (supporting our perceived lethality hypothesis). Male elk avoided open roads across all periods except during nocturnal hours of the breeding season and alternated between avoidance of areas with high canopy cover during nocturnal hours and selection during diurnal hours. In combination these patterns led to distinct distributional changes of male elk from pre-hunt to hunt periods. Patterns of male elk selection highlight the importance of managing for heterogeneous landscapes to meet a variety of habitat, harvest, hunter satisfaction, and escapement objectives.

AB  - The ongoing loss of red-listed coastal heathlands is a threat to biodiversity and cultural heritage legacies throughout the Atlantic coastal regions of Europe. It is possible to restore degraded and afforested heathlands, but restoration interventions are often labour-intensive and costly, and the outcome of specific restoration actions are not well documented. We assess the efficiency of restoring coastal heathlands through natural succession (i.e. 'passive restoration') after removal of Sitka spruce Picea sitchensis (Bong.) Carr. plantations. The study was replicated on two neighbouring islands in a nature reserve in Western Norway. Low-intensity free-range sheep grazing was implemented as part of the reserve management plan. Furthermore, we tested the effect of leaving the clear-felled woody material as chips on site, this being a cost-efficient strategy on islands. Succession was monitored 1, 2, 4/5 and 8 years after clear-felling, and revegetation of vascular plants and bryophytes was compared to target heathland vegetation. Surprisingly, we found different successional trajectories on the two islands. Species composition on one island approached target heathland vegetation during succession, but not on the other. Wood chips reduced species richness and slowed the restoration process, but these negative effects were only short-term (<8 years). Differences in seed bank composition and soil conditions due to land use may explain the deviating successional trajectories on the two islands. We also found that management actions beyond clear-felling and introducing sheep grazing are necessary due to the rapid seed regeneration of the Sitka spruce.

AB  - The Yellow Sea Warm Current (YSWC) constitutes a significant hydrological feature in the Yellow Sea, particularly prominent during winter, facilitating the transport of warm, saline waters and warm-water species from the open sea to the Bohai and Yellow Seas. The YSWC induces alterations in the community structure and function of zooplankton. However, the effects of the YSWC on the functional trait compositions and functional groups of zooplankton remain unclear. This study aimed to elucidate the influence of the YSWC on the community structure, functional trait composition, and functional groups of zooplankton during winter of 2016. The YSWC significantly impacted the zooplankton assemblage in the central Yellow Sea (CYSA), resulting in notable distinctions from the Shandong coastal assemblage (SCA) and Jiangsu coastal assemblage (JCA). Compared to the SCA and JCA (comprising 45 and 34 taxa, with abundances of 119.4 f 114.6 ind center dot m- 3 and 82.8 f 62.1 ind center dot m-3, respectively), the CYSA exhibited higher species richness and abundance (with 51 taxa and 144.4 f 103.4 ind center dot m-3, respectively). This study documented a total of 11 warm-water species, showing a decreasing trend in both species richness and abundance from south to north. The CYSA was characterized by the predominance of medium-sized, current-feeding, omnivorous-herbivorous broadcast spawners, whereas the SCA and the JCA were predominantly dominated by giant-sized, ambush-feeding carnivores. The Qingdao-Shidao anticyclonic eddy in the southern of Shandong Province led to a significant increase in the abundance of zooplankton, potentially impacting Yellow Sea fishery resource. This research contributed to a deeper understanding of how YSWC influence the zooplankton community and offered fresh insights into the effects of YSWC on zooplankton function traits and functional groups.

AB  - This study is the first comprehensive documentation of the distribution and fauna of gorgonian forests along the Atlantic Coast of Morocco. The presence of shallow water gorgonian ecosystems was mapped in 2020 using ROV as part of the FAO-NANSEN habitat mapping program. The seabed was visually mapped at depths from 27 to 112 m using an ROV at 37 localities and 400 m in long video transect was conducted at each locality. The recorded megafauna and substrate were annotated using the software "VideoNavigator". Video-transects were subdivided into 109 sampling units based on substratum and fauna patterns were identified using the multivariate analysis TWINSPAN and DCA. The relation to 10 environmental variables was indicated by correlation with DCA ordination axes. In total, 28,919 organisms and 143 taxa were recorded, with the highest diversity linked to the presence of hard substratum. Eight fauna-groups were identified that related mainly to a gradient in depth and mud along ordination Axis 1 and degrees north and sand along Axis 2. Six of the fauna-groups were gorgonian garden ecosystems on hard substratum and two were sea pen and gorgonian ecosystems associated with soft sediments. Hard substratum at 27-76 m, Group III and IV, were dominated by Leptogorgia viminalis, Eunicella species and E. paraplexaurides. Hard substratum at 59-75 m, Group V, was dominated by E. verrucosa, E. labiata, and Leptogorgia species and E. paraplexaurides. Hard substratum at 76-112 m, Group I and II, was dominated by Ellisella paraplexaurides and sponges. Soft sediments at 38-75 m, Group IV and VIII, were dominated by Pennatula rubra. Soft sediments at 72 m, Group VII was characterized by E. verrucosa and P. rubra. An observed threat to the gorgonian ecosystems were the sand that due to strong swell covered the hard bottom in many places where gorgonians forest occurs. The moving sand threatens both to bury the colonies and damage the tissue on lower parts of the colonies. This emphasizes the importance of conservation efforts to protect these delicate ecosystems.

AB  - The semiarid northeast coast of Brazil harbours just less than 44,300 ha of mangroves, 4% of Brazilian total. Notwithstanding this relatively small area, these forests have high ecological and economic importance, sustaining traditional fisheries and protecting biodiversity, including many threatened species. They present unique biogeochemical characteristics resulting in distinct ecosystem functioning compared to mangroves located in humid areas. Semiarid mangroves present lower aboveground biomass compared to humid region mangroves but show similar belowground biomass. Whereas mangrove soils in humid areas are strongly influenced by sulphate reduction, iron geochemistry is a primary driver of soil characteristics in semiarid mangrove soils, suggesting different responses to climate change drivers between them. Although legally protected, they have incurred continuous degradation due to regional drivers, mostly aquaculture and river damming, which differs from those in humid coast mangroves. Semiarid mangroves are also particularly sensitive to drivers associated with global climate change (high temperatures, reduced rainfall and sea level rise). These conditions occur at a global scale; however, the impacts are worsened by the natural conditions of semiarid coastlines, which already provide biologically stressful conditions for mangroves. This article compares the impacts of such drivers in semiarid mangroves with those of humid mangroves, focusing on their biogeochemical response and eventual rehabilitation.

AB  - Plant secondary metabolites (PSMs) defend plants against abiotic stresses, including those caused by climate change and against biotic stresses, such as herbivory and competition. There is a trade-off between allocating available carbon to growth and defence in stressful environments. However, our knowledge about trade-off is limited, especially when abiotic and biotic stresses co-occur. We aimed to understand the combined effect of increasing precipitation and humidity, the tree's competitive status, and canopy position on leaf secondary metabolites (LSMs) and fine root secondary metabolites (RSMs) in Betula pendula. We sampled 8-year-old B. pendula trees growing in the free air humidity manipulation (FAHM) experimental site, where treatments included elevated relative air humidity and elevated soil moisture. A high-performance liquid chromatography-quadrupole-time of flight mass spectrometer (HPLC-qTOF-MS) was used to analyse secondary metabolites. Our results showed accumulation of LSM depends on the canopy position and competitive status. Flavonoids (FLA), dihydroxybenzoic acids (HBA), jasmonates (JA) and terpene glucosides (TG) were higher in the upper canopy, and FLA, monoaryl compounds (MAR) and sesquiterpenoids (ST) were higher in dominant trees. The FAHM treatments had a more distinct effect on RSM than on LSM. The RSMs were lower in elevated air humidity and soil moisture conditions than in control conditions. The RSM content depended on the competitive status and was higher in suppressed trees. Our study suggests that young B. pendula will allocate similar amounts of carbon to constitutive chemical leaf defence, but a lower amount to root defence (per fine root biomass) under higher humidity.

AB  - Nonnative plant invasion is among the most severe environmental threats facing terrestrial ecosystems. When introduced into new regions, nonnative plants are thought to shed adapted herbivores. This enemy release may contribute to plant invasiveness, but it also implies that by hosting fewer herbivores, nonnative plants contribute little to supporting diverse food webs and ecosystem services. However, for many widespread invasive plants, arthropod communities have not been extensively surveyed, limiting our ability to assess their contribution to ecosystems. Here, we report on the caterpillar fauna of an important invasive shrub in the Midwest U.S, Amur Honeysuckle (Lonicera maackii). We find that, despite its nonnative status, L. maackii hosts a surprising diversity of caterpillar and sawfly species. We recorded 91 caterpillar species from L. maackii, and though some were likely vagrants, we were able to rear 61 species to pupation on this host. This diversity is similar to that found on common native woody plant genera in the region. The caterpillar community on L. maackii is dominated by generalist Noctuidae, Geometridae, and Erebidae, but also includes species specialized on native relatives. Overall survival was relatively low on L. maackii, suggesting that despite the diverse community we documented, physiological barriers may hamper its colonization by native herbivores. Size at collection, date and caterpillar family all significantly affected the likelihood of caterpillar survival on L. maackii. Our results provide a foundation for understanding the ecological impacts of L. maackii on insect herbivore communities and the processes by which invasive plants are integrated into local food webs.

AB  - Insect declines have been attributed to several drivers such as habitat loss, climate change, invasive alien species and insecticides. However, in the global context, these effects remain patchy, whereas insect losses appear to be consistent worldwide. Increases in atmospheric CO2 concentrations are known to have indirect effects on herbivorous insects, but the effects on other insects are largely unexplored. We wondered if elevated atmospheric CO2 (eCO(2)) could influence the growth and survival of insects, not via rising temperature, nor through their changes in food quality, but by other means. Rearing tunnelling dung beetle Euoniticellus intermedius (Reiche, 1848) at pre-industrial (250 parts per million [ppm]), current (400 ppm) and eCO(2) levels (600 and 800 ppm), we found that exposure to eCO(2) resulted in longer developmental times and increased mortality. Elevated CO2 also caused reduction of adult size and mass which is detrimental to dung beetle fitness. Additional results showed associated increases in CO2 levels inside dung brood balls, dung pH and respiration rates of the soil surrounding the developing dung beetles (CO2 flux). We thus hypothesize that elevated CO2 increases competition for O-2 and nutrients between soil microbiota and subterranean insects. Given that many insect orders spend at least part of their life underground, our findings indicate the possibility of a negative ubiquitous effect of eCO(2) on a large portion of the earth's insect biota. These findings therefore suggest an important area for future research on the soil community in the context of atmospheric change.

AB  - Production forestry is known to reduce the naturally variable microhabitat pools in live trees and their biodiversity by tree removal and broad indirect effects of silviculture. However, the tree-scale processes are not known well enough for microhabitat management for the future. This study investigates how tree age affects the microhabitat occurrence in live trees, its effect modifiers, and explanatory value compared with tree diameter. We inventoried tree-related microhabitats on 879 live aspens (Populus tremula) and Norway spruces (Picea abies) of known age in 141 forests representing contrasting productive site conditions in Estonia. We analysed microhabitat incidence using logistic mixed models for significant tree-scale and stand-scale factors. Most microhabitat types appeared rare even in old trees, and the age effects had various patterns. Only 2% of trees bore five or more microhabitat types. Aspens and spruces had a similar microhabitat diversity before 80 years of age. Stand-level effects varied among microhabitat types but were less significant than tree-level effects; interactions were even rarer. Most effects found could be interpreted through known ecological processes; for example, humidity-dependent epiphytic growth; bark stripping by herbivores; pathogen effects in forests with distinct histories. In contrast, a reliable tree-scale prediction of microhabitat occurrence appears rarely possible; and depending on microhabitat type, either tree age or diameter can be a better predictor. We suggest that managing for tree-related microhabitats in production forests should combine facilitating ecological conditions for microhabitat formation, and early detection and retention of the trees with high microhabitat potential.

AB  - The community composition of insect herbivores is largely shaped by host-plant phylogeny and functional traits. These effects differ between herbivores due at least in part to varying levels of diet specialisation. Distinguishing between herbivores with differing specialisation is therefore necessary to understand the roles of host phylogeny and traits in shaping complex insect communities.
   We surveyed the complete plant-caterpillar food web in a 0.2 ha plot of a lowland cool-temperate deciduous forest. We measured leaf nutrients, physical traits and polyphenols of the hostplants and analysed the effects of leaf traits and phylogeny on Lepidoptera caterpillars with differing levels of host specialisation.
   We sampled 190 species from 16 433 individual caterpillars on 20 host plant species. These included 102 species of specialists using confamilial hostplant species, 17 species of conservative generalists using allofamilial but phylogenetically close hostplant species and 71 species of non-conservative generalists using phylogenetically distant hostplant species.
   The species composition of non-conservative generalists associated with the polyphenol protein precipitation capacity and overall leaf trait dissimilarity; conservative generalists were weakly associated with polyphenol oxidative activity. In contrast, the composition of specialist assemblages showed no correlation with leaf traits.
   Our results demonstrate that host phylogeny and traits play variable roles in structuring communities of herbivores, based on the phylogenetic specialisation of herbivores. Understanding the factors that shape the community structures of various herbivores traditionally classified as 'generalists' is important as they account for a large proportion of herbivore species while showing differential responses to traits of hosts.

AB  - In this study we provide the first comprehensive camera-trap assessment of terrestrial mammals in the Yangambi landscape, comprising the Yangambi Biosphere Reserve and a logging concession in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. The terrestrial mammal community in this area exhibits lower occupancy and species richness compared to other conservation areas in the Congo Basin. The community is dominated by four species: Emin's pouched rat Cricetomys emini (1.3 kg), African brush-tailed porcupine Atherurus africanus (2.8 kg), blue duiker Philantomba monticola (5 kg) and bay duiker Cephalophus dorsalis (12 kg), which are known to be highly resilient. Large ungulates and medium-sized carnivores have particularly low abundances. Our study also confirmed the presence of four species categorized as threatened on the IUCN Red List: the chimpanzee Pan troglodytes, giant ground pangolin Smutsia gigantea, black-bellied pangolin Phataginus tetradactyla and white-bellied pangolin Phataginus tricuspis. Our findings highlight the need to consider wildlife conservation at the landscape level, including the logging concession, where species showed higher occupancy levels compared to the Biosphere Reserve, and highlighting the need for planning infrastructure construction and developing mitigation schemes, reducing forest degradation from logging and developing permanent cash crop agriculture. Landscape-level conservation will only be possible if a collaborative management model steered by local communities is developed with the participation of all constituencies.

AB  - Wisent Bison bonasus is an example of a species saved from extinction and reintroduced into nature after a few decades of captive breeding. There were only twelve founders of the Lowland-Caucasian line (LC) and even fewer (seven out of twelve) of Lowland (LB) animals. The genetic diversity in studies based on pedigree or markers is very low. In this paper, we present a summary of the long-term genetic monitoring conducted for the worldwide population of European bison. We summarized the long-term genetic monitoring studies conducted on the worldwide population of wisents to date. We genotyped 2227 wisents from two genetic lines (LC and LB) and different populations at ten microsatellite loci. We found low polymorphism, with only 2.7 alleles per locus, and much lower values of observed heterozygosity (0.380 and 0.348 in the LC and LB lines, respectively) than expected heterozygosity. The difference between the lines is only noticeable in allele proportions, so the number of markers is not enough to distinguish the two genetic lines. We also present the genetic distance among four free-roaming populations that are geographically close to each other. We found that the genetic distance of one of them is larger than that of the others, which could be the effect of genetic drift.

AB  - The huge antlers of the extinct Irish elk have invited evolutionary speculation since Darwin. In the 1970s, Stephen Jay Gould presented the first extensive data on antler size in the Irish elk and combined these with comparative data from other deer to test the hypothesis that the gigantic antlers were the outcome of a positive allometry that constrained large-bodied deer to have proportionally even larger antlers. He concluded that the Irish elk had antlers as predicted for its size and interpreted this within his emerging framework of developmental constraints as an explanatory factor in evolution. Here we reanalyze antler allometry based on new morphometric data for 57 taxa of the family Cervidae. We also present a new phylogeny for the Cervidae, which we use for comparative analyses. In contrast to Gould, we find that the antlers of Irish elk were larger than predicted from the allometry within the true deer, Cervini, as analyzed by Gould, but follow the allometry across Cervidae as a whole. After dissecting the discrepancy, we reject the allometric-constraint hypothesis because, contrary to Gould, we find no similarity between static and evolutionary allometries, and because we document extensive non-allometric evolution of antler size across the Cervidae.

AB  - Static facultative heap composting of animal manure is widely used in China, but there is almost no systematic research on the phytotoxicity of the produced compost. Here, we evaluated the phytotoxic variation in compost produced by facultative heap composting of four types of animal manure (chicken manure, pig manure, sheep manure, and cattle manure) using different plant seeds (cucumber, radish, Chinese cabbage, and oilseed rape) to determine germination index (GI). The key factors that affected GI values were identified, including the dynamics of the phytotoxicity and microbial community during heap composting. Sensitivity to toxicity differed depending on the type of plant seed used. Phytotoxicity during facultative heap composting, evaluated by the GI, was in the order: chicken manure (0-6.6 %) < pig manure (14.4-90.5 %) < sheep manure (46.0-93.0 %) < cattle manure (50.2-105.8 %). Network analysis showed that the volatile fatty acid (VFA) concentration was positively correlated with Firmicutes abundance, and NH4+-N was correlated with Actinobacteria, Proteobacteria, and Bacteroidetes. More bacteria were stimulated to participate in conversions of dissolved organic carbon, dissolved nitrogen, VFA, and ammonia-nitrogen (NH4+-N) in sheep manure heap composting than that in other manure. The GI was most affected by VFA in chicken manure and cattle manure heap composting, while NH4+-N was the main factor affecting the GI in pig manure and sheep manure compost. The dissolved carbon and nitrogen content and composition, as well as the core and proprietary microbial communities, were the primary factors that affected the succession of phytotoxic substances in facultative heap composting, which in turn affected GI values. In this study, the key pathways of livestock manure composting that affected GI and phytotoxicity were found and evaluated, which provided new insights and theoretical support for the safe use of organic fertilizer.

AB  - Agricultural intensification substantially threatens farmland communities and associated ecosystem services. More specifically, landscape simplification and agrochemical use can significantly alter the activity of natural enemies, contributing to hampered pest suppression. At the same time, the effects of these factors on vertebrate predators and their contribution to pest control are relatively understudied, especially in European permanent crops. Using exclosures in Hungarian vineyards, we investigated the effect of birds and bats on arthropods affecting ecosystem functions and crop yield considering the local management (organic vs. integrated pest management [IPM]) and contrasting landscape heterogeneity of the plantations. We also collected abundance data of the European grapevine moth (Lobesia botrana) and canopy-dwelling herbivorous and predatory arthropods and quantified fruit and leaf damage and sentinel prey predation associated with these groups. As opposed to summer bat activity, forested and connected landscapes promoted high insectivorous bird abundance and bat activity in spring and contributed to lower fruit damage caused by L. botrana. Vineyard management showed no effect on birds and bats. In contrast, canopy-dwelling arthropod density was higher in organic than in IPM vineyards, resulting in higher leaf herbivory and the occurrence of caterpillar predation there. Bird and bat exclusion increased leaf herbivory and fruit damage, leading to higher yields in control plots. Furthermore, increased bat activity significantly decreased the abundance of the major grape pest, L. botrana, in spring. Synthesis and applications. Our results highlight the importance of bats and birds in reducing herbivory and increasing economic benefits in vineyards. Their presence and foraging activity can be promoted by connected landscapes incorporating hedgerows and small groups of trees as well as native, deciduous forest patches that can potentially increase the amount of food sources and suitable nesting and roosting sites. Organic vineyards in these landscapes can further enhance pest control services by supporting predatory arthropods.

AB  - Bighorn sheep (Ovis canadensis) habitat frequently is geographically discontinuous and the metapopulation model fits this species well. Consequently, extinction-colonization dynamics are important and need to be monitored. Much of the conservation history of bighorn sheep, however, was based on a theory that natural colonization is not part of the biology of this species. That theory is not supported by a growing body of evidence that natural colonization of vacant habitat does occur in this species. Here I present a simple PCR test that distinguishes bighorn sheep fecal pellets from those of mule deer (Odocoileus hemionus) as a useful tool in documenting bighorn sheep occupancy where mule deer are present. I include examples from California of applications of this method to investigate potential colonization events.

AB  - White-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) are a cervid species found mostly in the Americas. Managing white-tailed deer requires understanding their relationship with the environment, which was characterized by Roseberry and Woolf (Wildlife Society Bulletin 1, 1998, 252) for all counties in Illinois, USA, who incorporated habitat quantity and quality in a deer habitat suitability index. However, this index was based on satellite imagery from 1996 and did not explore the smaller spatial scales used by deer. Our study addressed these gaps by developing a deer land cover utility (LCU) score for each TRS (township, range, and section), township, and county in Illinois based on the methodology outlined in Roseberry and Woolf (Wildlife Society Bulletin 1, 1998, 252) but using data from the National Land Cover Database (2001-2021). These deer LCU scores were validated against minimum deer population data using Bayesian regression with additional covariates relevant to hunting and deer density. These models performed well with Bayesian R2 values of 0.501 (TRS), 0.5 (township), and 0.969 (county). The regression coefficients for the deer LCU scores were statistically significant (95% credibility interval not containing 0) and positive at the TRS, township, and county levels, reflecting the expected relationship between minimum deer density and deer LCU. Predictions made by these regression models on new data were accurate, with the median absolute difference between the true and predicted values being 0.398 deer/km2 for TRS', 0.085 deer/km2 for townships, and 0.066 deer/km2 for counties. This deer LCU could be used in other studies about deer in Illinois or studies in which deer are a relevant factor such as investigations about deer disease or tick distribution. This modeling approach could also be adapted to different wild species, locations, and/or time periods for which land cover data is available.

AB  - Eutrophication through atmospheric nutrient deposition is threatening the biodiversity of semi-natural habitats characterized by low nutrient availability. Accordingly, local management measures aiming at open habitat conservation need to maintain habitat-specific nutrient conditions despite atmospheric inputs. Grazing by wild herbivores, such as red deer (Cervus elaphus), has been proposed as an alternative to mechanical or livestock-based measures for preserving open habitats. The role of red deer for nutrient dynamics in protected open habitat types, however, is yet unclear. Therefore, we collected data on vegetation productivity, forage removal, quantity of red deer dung and nutrient concentrations in vegetation and dung from permanent plots in heathlands and grasslands (eight plots a 225 m(2) per habitat type) on a military training area inhabited by a large population of free-ranging red deer over one year. The annual nutrient export of nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) by red deer grazing was higher than the nutrient import through red deer excreta, resulting in an average net nutrient removal of 14 and 30 kg N ha(-1) a(-1) and 1.1 and 3.3 kg P ha(-1) a(-1) in heathlands and grasslands, respectively. Even when considering approximate local atmospheric deposition values, net nutrient depletion due to red deer grazing seemed very likely, notably in grasslands. Demonstrating that grazing by wild red deer can mitigate the effects of atmospheric nutrient deposition in semi-natural open habitats similarly to extensive livestock grazing, our results support the idea that red deer are suitable grazing animals for open habitat conservation.

AB  - ContextIn the epididymis, epithelial cells manage changes in the luminal environment for proper sperm maturation. Moreover, aquaglyceroporins, a subgroup of aquaporins (AQP), modulate the transport of water, glycerol and other small molecules in epithelial cells.AimsWe aim to characterise the lining epithelium, quantify its cell composition and immunolocalise the aquaglyceroporins AQP3, AQP7, AQP9 and AQP10 alongside the epididymal ductus of three wild ruminant species, and to determine if species-specific differences could be associated with cauda sperm cryoresistance variations.MethodsEpididymides from Iberian ibex (n = 5), mouflon (n = 5) and chamois (n = 6) were obtained. Cauda spermatozoa were collected and sperm parameters were analysed before and after freezing. Histology and immunohistochemistry of AQP3, 7, 9, 10 and T-CD3 were performed in the caput, corpus and cauda epididymal regions.Key resultsThis work first describes the lining epithelium in Iberian ibex, mouflon and chamois epididymis along the three anatomical regions, consisting of principal, basal, apical, clear and halo cells. However, the percentage of each cell type differed in ibex compared to mouflon and chamois. The positive T-CD3 immunolabeling of all the halo cells confirmed their T-lymphocyte nature. Aquaglyceroporin expression patterns were similar among species, except for differences in AQP7 and AQP10 immunolocalisation in ibex. Species-specific differences in epididymal sperm cryoresistance were confirmed.ConclusionsThe epididymal epithelium of the three wild ruminants differ in their relative number of cell types and AQP immunolocalisation, which ultimately appears to affect cauda epidydimal spermatozoa cryoresistance.ImplicationsOur study provides information on the relevance of the quantitative composition and AQP pattern expression in epididymal lining epithelium on sperm cryoresistance.

AB  - Simple Summary Comparison of bacterial diversity and composition of feces from cows and goats offered the same pasture-based diet revealed that the animal species had no effect on bacterial species richness and diversity, but significantly affected species evenness. Both diet and host species influence the gut microbiome. The aim of this study was to compare the diversity and composition of fecal bacteria in goats and cows offered the same diet and to evaluate the influence of animal species on the gut microbiome. A total of 17 female goats (Blond Adamellan) and 16 female cows (Brown Swiss) kept on an organic farm were fed pasture and hay. Bacterial structure in feces was examined by high-throughput sequencing using the V4-V5 region of the 16S rRNA gene. The Alpha diversity measurements of the bacterial community showed no statistical differences in species richness and diversity between the two groups of ruminants. However, the Pielou evenness index revealed a significant difference and showed higher species evenness in cows compared to goats. Beta diversity measurements showed statistical dissimilarities and significant clustering of bacterial composition between goats and cows. Firmicutes were the dominant phylum in both goats and cows, followed by Bacteroidetes, Proteobacteria, and Spirochaetes. Linear discriminant analysis with effect size (LEfSe) showed a total of 36 significantly different taxa between goats and cows. Notably, the relative abundance of Ruminococcaceae UCG-005, Christensenellaceae R-7 group, Ruminococcaceae UCG-010, Ruminococcaceae UCG-009, Ruminococcaceae UCG-013, Ruminococcaceae UCG-014, Ruminococcus 1, Ruminococcaceae UCG-002, Lachnospiraceae NK4A136 group, Treponema 2, Lachnospiraceae AC2044 group, and Bacillus was higher in goats compared to cows. In contrast, the relative abundance of Turicibacter, Solibacillus, Alloprevotella, Prevotellaceae UCG-001, Negativibacillus, Lachnospiraceae UCG-006, and Eubacterium hallii group was higher in cows compared with goats. Our results suggest that diet shapes the bacterial community in feces, but the host species has a significant impact on community structure, as reflected primarily in the relative abundance of certain taxa.

AB  - Elevational gradients represent platforms for exploring the effects of environmental variation on biodiversity. The environmental correlates of these spatial gradients are likely to be modified during the Anthropocene, as species respond to global change drivers including warming and increased frequency of extreme events. We quantified variation in the abundance of four functional groups of canopy arthropods (i.e., folivores, sap-suckers, detritivores, and predators), as well as in aspects of biodiversity on each of six host-plant species along two elevational transects in the Luquillo Mountains of Puerto Rico: a mixed forest transect, traversing tabonuco, palo colorado, and elfin forests, and a palm forest transect, comprising only patches dominated by sierra palm (Prestoea acuminata). We expected gradients in arthropod abundance and biodiversity to be host-tree specific, and for gradients on palm to differ between transects due to a combination of mechanisms associated with host selection, rescue effects, habitat structure, and source pool dynamics. In general, abundance and biodiversity declined with elevation. The ways in which abundance declined with increasing elevation was contingent on host tree identity and on arthropod functional group, whereas all aspects of biodiversity declined with elevation in consistent manners regardless of host tree identity or transect. Similarly, turnover (beta components of biodiversity between sequential elevational strata) did not differ between transects. Decreases in productivity with increasing elevation may be responsible for gradients in abundance or biodiversity. However, host-specific and functional group-specific gradients suggest that elevational effects manifest differently depending on tree species identity and resource bases that are consumer specific.

AB  - The Changbaishan reserve and the forests around it are one of the priority areas for Amur tiger (Panthera tigris altaica) recovery in northeastern China. Previous habitat suitability analyses only took the ecological requirements of tigers into consideration, so this study aims to determine habitat suitability for a tiger-prey community in the region, by analysing ungulate prey availability and habitat suitability for both predator and prey. Three prey species were found, using the snow tacking method: red deer (Cervus canadensis xanthopygus), wild boar (Sus scrofa), and roe deer (Capreolus pygargus). Habitat suitability was evaluated for tigers, red deer, and wild boar, using a multi-criteria evaluation (MCE) process. MCE results showed that (1) habitat suitability is generally low outside the reserve for all three species; (2) suitability values were the lowest for tigers due to high intensity of human impact in the area, with suitable habitat restricted to the centre of the reserve; and (3) red deer and wild boar would find pockets of suitable habitat outside the reserve. A combination of low forest quality and high human impact intensity imposes significant environmental pressure to those ungulates. To recover tiger population in Changbaishan, forest quality and human impacts should be properly managed, which should increase prey availability.

AB  - Invasive alien plants can use animal-plant interactions to increase their invasiveness. This study investigated the role of frugivorous birds in seed dispersal, germination success and germination time of the alien plant Pyracantha angustifolia (Franch.) C.K. Schneid. (Rosaceae) in South African high elevation grasslands. We monitored which bird species fed on the fruit of the invasive P. angustifolia in farms in the Free State Province using timed-focal and opportunistic observations, and camera traps aimed at fruiting branches and fallen fruits on the ground. Nine bird species visited P. angustifolia shrubs to perch or feed on fruits, but only one (Speckled Mousebird) fed on the fruits during timed-focal observations. Camera trap footage and opportunistic observations revealed a further three bird species (African Pied Starlings, Crested Barbets, Red-eyed Barbets), domestic horses and goats, and two rodent species feeding on fruits. To assess the effect of ingestion by avian frugivores on P. angustifolia germination success and time, P. angustifolia fruits were fed to captive Cape White-eyes (Zosterops virens), Dark-capped Bulbuls (Pycnonotus tricolor), Purple-crested Turacos (Gallirex porphyreolophus), Red-winged Starlings (Onychognathus morio) and Speckled Mousebirds (Colius striatus); frugivores present in the invasive range of P. angustifolia in South Africa. Seeds collected from bird excreta, whole fruits, and depulped fruits were grown under greenhouse conditions and germination times recorded. All captive bird species, except for Cape White-eyes, ingested the seeds; Cape White-eyes fed on fruit pulp only. Bird species with relatively larger body mass had longer seed retention times compared with the smaller bird species. Germination success of both depulped and ingested P. angustifolia seeds was significantly higher (> 80%) than for seeds from whole fruits (7%). Ingestion by the four avian frugivore species did not affect germination time and success; instead, the birds facilitate the spread and germination of seeds by removing the fruit pulp and spreading the seed away from the parent shrubs.

AB  - The greater kudu (Tragelaphus strepsiceros) is widespread throughout South Africa and occurs in higher densities in the north-eastern regions, with isolated populations in the Eastern Cape Province and in the Kimberley area in the Northern Cape Province. This study aimed to assess the phylogeographic structure of regional South African greater kudu groups, based on neutral mitochondrial DNA regions as well as adaptive variation. A total of 116 kudu were sampled from across the South African distribution range, separated by geographic features and distance, from six South African provinces. Sampling was mainly based on skin samples collected from taxidermists. Genetic diversity and differentiation were quantified using sequence data from the mitochondrial control region (mtDNA CR) and the heat shock protein subunit 5 (HSPA5) gene. Short tandem repeat (STR) sequences were identified at the 3 '-UTR of the bone morphogenetic protein 4 (BMP4) gene and used for downstream analyses. Twenty-six haplotypes were identified from the CR dataset, three for the HSPA5 region, and 14 alleles were identified for the BMP4 STR. The CR phylogenetic analyses identified two distinct genetic clades representing an Eastern and Western group respectively. Molecular divergence dating identified the most recent common ancestor of the Eastern and Western South African kudu clades as older (2.237 Mya) than some well-known African antelope species. This result was consistent with the HSPA5 and BMP4 results. Environmental selective pressures, such as rainfall and ambient temperature, were also identified as possible driving forces for evolution at the HSPA5 gene region. Overall, these results can provide support for future management decisions to ensure the conservation of natural patterns of diversity in this majestic antelope species in South Africa.

AB  - Buffalo milk is the second most produced type of milk in the world. The process analysis of buffalo milk products should be carefully considered, aiming to minimize waste and value the raw material in obtaining all its dairy products. Rich chemical composition of buffalo milk can generate high polluting wastes, which can be modified on a cleaner production processing. The cow's milk dairy industry has many examples for the minimization and recovery of waste in this production chain. However, regarding the residues from the processing of buffalo milk, only a few works are found. The world perspectives are positive for the valorization of buffalo milk processing derivatives, considering the advances already obtained with the residues of the cow's milk processing. This review brings together suggestions for the recovery of waste in buffalo milk production chain, seeking to contribute to increase income as well as to minimize waste generation.

AB  - Protected areas often are too small to house populations of wide-ranging species. Viability of wildlife populations therefore depends on whether interactions with humans and their land uses are negative, neutral, or positive. In central Iran, we measured interactions between globally endangered onagers (Equus hemionus onager) and livestock by analyzing remotely-sensed vegetation metrics within livestock grazing areas, tracking 9 animals with GPS telemetry, and assessing onagers' diet quality through analysis of fecal samples. Resource selection by onagers depended both on season and the presence of livestock. During the dry season, livestock reduced forage (some combination of forage biomass and forage quality) compared to pre-grazing periods, demonstrating potential for competitive suppression of onagers by livestock when resources are scarce. Additionally, and during both seasons, selection for forage by onagers was accentuated at night when livestock were absent, indicating onager avoidance of livestock. During the wet season, onagers exposed to livestock exhibited higher-quality diets than those that did not co-occur with livestock, suggesting that livestock grazing may potentially enhance forage quality for onagers. Consequently, collaboration with pastoralists to regularly rotate the locations of dry and wet season leases could alleviate negative effects of livestock grazing on onagers. Similar to other cases in multi-use landscapes, temporal shifts in the strength of competition-driven by diel cycles and seasonal rainfall-may characterize wildlife-livestock interactions in Iran and elsewhere in Asian rangelands. Our study is the first indepth investigation of one of the world's remaining populations of onager, and highlights the possibility that conservation of an endangered mammal could be compatible with livestock production, at least during wet seasons.

AB  - Regional patterns of fish diversity, abundance, distribution, and assemblage composition are driven by a combination of biotic and abiotic conditions in the marine environment, but these conditions can be altered through anthropogenic activities, such as those associated with oil and gas extraction. The present study utilises data on fish relative abundance and diversity obtained from 1546 baited remote underwater video deployments conducted between 2004 - 2019 in depths of 9 - 170 m across 2000 km of coastline in north-west Australia on natural habitats and subsea pipelines to understand the influence of oil and gas infrastructure on fish assemblages. A total of 450 fish taxa from 56 families was observed, with populations dominated by generalist and invertebrate carnivore taxa. At the regional scale, subsea pipelines had lower diversity (lower taxonomic richness) than natural environments, but possessed a higher abundance of piscivorous and herbivorous fish taxa. Clear patterns in fish assemblage composition were observed in multivariate analyses, reflecting the proximity of oceanic shoals and banks, depth, and to a lesser extent, oil and gas infrastructure. Shallow-water and close to shoals assemblages were characterised by a diversity of site-attached (e.g., wrasses, tuskfish), reef-associated taxa (e.g., emperors). Mesophotic fish assemblages were characterised by commercially important (e.g., goldband snapper), wide-ranging (e.g., sharks) and sand-affiliated (e.g., toadfish, threadfin bream) taxa. Proximity to pipelines and platforms ranked low as predictors in the multivariate analyses suggesting a negligible regional influence of these structures on fish communities in comparison to depth and shoal habitats. Local-scale influences of subsea infrastructure, however, may be important for some fish species (infrastructure vs. immediate surrounds). Our study highlights the influence of abiotic factors on regional-scale patterns in fish assemblage structure across north-west Australia.

AB  - Climate change is expected to modify host-parasite interactions which is concerning because parasites are involved in most food-web links, and parasites have important influences on the structure, productivity and stability of communities and ecosystems. However, the impact of climate change on host-parasite interactions and any cascading effects on other ecosystem processes has received relatively little empirical attention. We assessed host-parasite dynamics for moose (Alces alces) and winter ticks (Dermacentor albipictus) in Isle Royale National Park over a 19-year period. Specifically, we monitored annual tick burdens for moose (estimated from hair loss) and assessed how it covaried with several aspects of seasonal climate, and non-climatic factors, such as moose density, predation on hosts by wolves (Canis lupus) and wolf abundance. Summer temperatures explained half the interannual variance in tick burden with tick burden being greater following hotter summers, presumably because warmer temperatures accelerate the development of tick eggs and increase egg survival. That finding is consistent with the general expectation that warmer temperatures may promote higher parasite burdens. However, summer temperatures are warming less rapidly than other seasons across most regions of North America. Therefore, tick burdens seem to be primarily associated with an aspect of climate that is currently exhibiting a lower rate of change. Tick burdens were also positively correlated with predation rate, which could be due to moose exhibiting risk-sensitive habitat selection (in years when predation risk is high) in such a manner as to increases the encounter rate with questing tick larvae in autumn. However, that positive correlation could also arise if high parasite burdens make moose more vulnerable to predators or because of some other density-dependent process (given that predation rate and moose density are highly correlated). Overall, these results provide valuable insights about interrelationships among climate, parasites, host/prey, and predators.

AB  - Mammals are important components of biodiversity that have been drastically and rapidly impacted by climate change, habitat loss, and anthropogenic pressure. Understanding key species distribution to optimize conservation targets is both urgent and necessary to reverse the current biodiversity crisis. Herein, we applied habitat suitability models for a key Neotropical forest ungulate, the white-lipped peccary (WLP Tayassu pecari), to investigate the effects of climate and landscape modifications on its distribution, which has been drastically reduced in Brazil. We used 318 primary records of WLP to derive habitat suitability maps across Brazil. Our models included bioclimatic, topographic, landscape, and human influence predictors in two modelling approaches. Models including all categories of predictors obtained the highest predictive ability and showed prevalence of suitable areas in forested regions of the country, covering 49% of the Brazilian territory. Filtering out small forest fragments (<2050 ha) reduced the suitable area by 5%, with a further reduction of 4% that was caused by deforestation until 2020, therefore until 2020, the species has suffered a reduction of similar to 60% from its historical range in Brazil. Of the 40% of the Brazilian territory suitable to WLP, only 12% is protected. In the Atlantic Forest, only half of all protected areas have suitable habitat for WLP and even less in Pantanal (44%), Cerrado (14%) and Caatinga (7%). In a second modelling approach, mapping the areas with suitable climate and those with suitable landscapes separately, allowed us to identify four categories of conservation values, and showed that only 17% of the Brazilian territory has both high landscape and climatic suitability for WLP. Our models can help inform complementary conservation management strategies and actions that could be essential in slowing down and possibly reversing current trends of population and geographic range reductions for the species, thereby averting a possible future collapse of forest ecosystem functioning in the Neotropical region.

AB  - Chronic wasting disease (CWD) is a prion disease of North American cervids. The transmission of CWD to endangered cervid species is of concern for captive breeding programs. Trans-species transmission could occur via direct contact with infected wild deer, or via prion contaminated fomites. Variation in the prion protein gene, PRNP, is associated with differences in CWD susceptibility among cervids. We therefore sequenced PRNP in 36 endangered Eld's deer (Rucervus eldii thamin), detecting five synonymous and two non-synonymous SNPs. Three haplotypes were inferred, suggesting that genetic management in captive breeding programs has been effective at maintaining PRNP diversity. The haplotypes encoded two PrP protein variants. The more common Eld's deer PrP variant encodes methionine at codon 208 and glutamine at codon 226. Because this protein variant is identical to a common PrP variant in white-tailed deer and mule deer and is especially common in white-tailed deer positive for CWD, we recommend reducing the frequency of this variant in the breeding stock, while implementing strict management practices to avoid exposure to wild North American cervids. The frequency of the other PrP variant, which differs from variants present in these North American cervids, was low. It has the potential to reduce susceptibility to CWD and thus could be increased in frequency. While PRNP haplotype frequencies should be shifted, genetic diversity should be maintained. Ultimately protein diversity may be protective should CWD infect the species, and trans-species polymorphisms are suggestive of past balancing selection and a potential fitness advantage for PRNP diversity.

AB  - In forests where the overstorey canopy has been disturbed by timber harvest or other means, evapotranspiration (ET) by the understorey may be the main flux of water back to the atmosphere. However, little research has been apportioned to directly measuring understorey water use, and the technology to do so is thus limited. Here, we used a portable chamber to quickly and directly measure understorey ET by measuring the water flux from the soil and vegetation enclosed by the chamber. This method was used in a third-growth coast redwood forest to measure ET rates from individuals of five species commonly found in the understorey: Sequoia sempervirens (coast redwood) sprouts, Notholithocarpus densiflorus (tanoak) sprouts, Vaccinium ovatum (evergreen huckleberry) sprouts, Polystichum munitum (sword fern) and Struthiopteris spicant (deer fern). Measurements were conducted in four small watersheds which were harvested to varying intensities ranging from 0% to 75% targeted reduction in preharvest overstory basal area. Mean understorey ET rate was highest in the watershed with the lowest residual basal area ((x) over bar = 0.036 +/- 0.024 mm/h) and lowest in the unharvested control watershed ((x) over bar = 0.013 +/- 0.0078 mm/h). Multiple regression modelling on resprouting species indicated that the difference in ET rate between watersheds was related to soil and light resources. These results imply that understorey water use can be significant, particularly in harvested watersheds, and should be quantified at the landscape scale.

AB  - In an era marked by accelerating climate change, habitat loss, and shifting land use patterns, it is crucial to understand the intricate effects of multiple stressors on ecosystems. This long-term study sheds light on the complex interplay between grazing and habitat characteristics on pasture dynamics and offers insights into how various stressors affect ecosystems facing environmental challenges. Our experimental study documents that manipulation in restricting reindeer grazing and trampling through fencing led to higher ground-lichen biomass, volume, height (particularly in one habitat), and cover compared with open-control plots. The effect of fencing varied depending on habitat, and for lichen biomass, volume, and height, the lowest values were observed in windswept exposed ridges and mountain heaths (exposed/mountain), and the highest values were observed in forested and leeward-heath (forest/leeward) habitat. The average (past five years) number of reindeer per square kilometer had indirect effects that varied across habitats. We observed negative density dependence in the open plots for height in the exposed/mountain habitats. Fencing reduced this effect, which was also valid for biomass except that habitat did not affect the effect of density. Surprisingly, in the forest/leeward areas, the estimated effects of reindeer density on biomass, volume, and height were positive for the fenced plots. Negative density dependence was evident for lichen cover irrespective of habitats and manipulation, even though this effect had little biological significance, whereas cover at the initiation of the experiment positively affected later recordings (particularly for the controls). Our models showed high explanatory power, highlighting the significance of reindeer density and habitat as predictors of ground-lichen dynamics. Overall, negative density-dependent effects were observed in the open plots in the most exposed areas, and fencing mitigated the negative impact of reindeer on lichens, particularly in less exposed areas. We challenge the "equilibrium" and "nonequilibrium" frameworks for explaining livestock-pasture dynamics. We propose future studies to estimate the relative importance of density-dependent and density-independent factors, such as climate, using models considering both mechanisms simultaneously.

AB  - Global climate change, habitat fragmentation, and human interference have resulted in a significant, ongoing decline in the population of goitered gazelles. Effective conservation strategies require an understanding of resource requirements of threatened species, such as dietary needs. Therefore, we aimed to elucidate the food composition and seasonal dietary changes of goitered gazelles through microhistological analyses of fresh feces. Fabaceae (11.5%), Gramineae (9.4%), Chenopodiaceae (20.2%), Asteraceae (10.1%), and Rosaceae (19.5%) formed the primary dietary components of goitered gazelle. Additionally, Krascheninnikovia arborescens (13.4%) and Prunus sibirica (16.3%) were identified as the key forage plants. Forbs (50.4%) were the predominant plants for grazing throughout the year, particularly in the spring (72.9%). The proportion of trees in the diet was highest in the autumn (36.7%) and comparatively lower in other seasons. Furthermore, the proportions of shrubs (22.0%) and graminoids (14.8%) both reached their peaks in the winter. Our findings indicate that goitered gazelles strategically forage seasonally to cope with resource bottlenecks, enhancing their adaptability to arid and semi-arid habitats. Our study provides essential ecological information for the conservation of goitered gazelles and emphasizes the importance of dietary studies of species of ecological significance in environmentally sensitive areas.

AB  - The study of interspecific interactions helps scientists and conservationists understand the ability of species to coexist in a given area, improving the conservation and management of ecological communities. Here we present a case study where we tested whether spatial and temporal interactions of whitetailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus), an ungulate native to Costa Rica, and horses (Equus caballus), a domestic ungulate reintroduced to a protected area, might result in avoidance. We used a paired field design with 40 camera traps deployed in two adjacent 228-ha fields within northwestern dry forest of Costa Rica during the wet season. We used general linear models to evaluate the effect of horse presence and vegetation type on white-tailed deer spatial distribution, as well as the Pianka's index to assess evidence of spatial overlapping. In addition, temporal overlap between horses and deer was assessed using the overlap coefficient, and the temporal response of white-tailed deer to horse presence was assessed using a spatially explicit null model approach. Evidence indicated that white-tailed deer used sites with horses more than sites without horses and used grass and shrubland sites more than forested sites. Within the area with horses, spatial overlap between horses and white-tailed deer was intermediate, suggesting insights of a moderate degree of spatial partitioning. Horses and white-tailed deer both showed similar activity patterns with a high degree of overlap, but our null model approach suggested neutral interaction; thus, our results indicated non-negative effects of horse presence on white-tailed deer spatiotemporal activity. Our results are limited by spatial and temporal replication, so caution is recommended when using this information to make decisions in other sites where horses and deer coexist. However, this effort provides relevant and novel information for our study area and can help decision makers to better manage ecological communities in the northwestern dry forest of Costa Rica.

AB  - When predicting the response of marine ecosystems to climate change, it is increasingly recognized that understanding the indirect effects of ocean acidification on trophic interactions is as important as studying direct effects on organism physiology. Furthermore, comprehensive studies that examine these effects simultaneously are needed to identify and link the underlying mechanisms driving changes in species interactions. Using an onshore ocean acidification simulator system, we investigated the direct and indirect effects of elevated seawater pCO(2) on the physiology and trophic interaction of fleshy macroalgae and the grazing sea urchin Lytechinus variegatus. Macroalgal (Dictyota spp.) biomass increased despite decreased photosynthetic rates after two-week exposure to elevated pCO(2). Algal tissue carbon content remained constant, suggesting the use of alternative carbon acquisition pathways beneficial to growth under acidification. Higher C:N ratios driven by a slight reduction in N content in algae exposed to elevated pCO(2) suggest a decrease in nutritional content under acidification. Urchin (L. variegatus) respiration, biomass, and righting time did not change significantly after six-week exposure to elevated pCO(2), indicating that physiological stress and changes in metabolism are not mechanisms through which the trophic interaction was impacted. Correspondingly, urchin consumption rates of untreated macroalgae (Caulerpa racemosa) were not significantly affected by pCO(2). In contrast, exposure of urchins to elevated pCO(2) significantly reduced the number of correct foraging choices for ambient macroalgae (Dictyota spp.), indicating impairment of urchin chemical sensing under acidification. However, exposure of algae to elevated pCO(2) returned the number of correct foraging choices in similarly exposed urchins to ambient levels, suggesting alongside higher C:N ratios that algal nutritional content was altered in a way detectable by the urchins under acidification. These results highlight the importance of studying the indirect effects of acidification on trophic interactions simultaneously with direct effects on physiology. Together, these results suggest that changes to urchin chemical sensing and algal nutritional quality are the driving mechanisms behind surprisingly unaltered urchin foraging behavior for fleshy macroalgae under joint exposure to ocean acidification. Consistent foraging behavior and consumption rates suggest that the trophic interaction between L. variegatus and fleshy macroalgae may be sustained under future acidification. However, increases in fleshy macroalgal biomass driven by opportunistic carbon acquisition strategies have the potential to cause ecological change, depending on how grazer populations respond. Additional field research is needed to determine the outcome of these results over time and under a wider range of environmental conditions.

AB  - The Ngorongoro Conservation Area (NCA) of Tanzania, is globally significant for biodiversity conservation due to the presence of iconic fauna, and, since 1959 has been managed as a unique multiple land-use areas to mutually benefit wildlife and indigenous residents. Understating vegetation dynamics and ongoing land cover change processes in protected areas is important to protect biodiversity and ensure sustainable development. However, land cover changes in savannahs are especially difficult, as changes are often long-term and subtle. Here, we demonstrate a Landsat-based monitoring strategy incorporating (i) regression-based unmixing for the accurate mapping of the fraction of the different land cover types, and (ii) a combination of linear regression and the BFAST trend break analysis technique for mapping and quantifying land cover changes. Using Google Earth Pro and the EnMap-Box software, the fractional cover of the main land cover types of the NCA were accurately mapped for the first time, namely bareland, bushland, cropland, forest, grassland, montane heath, shrubland, water and woodland. Our results show that the main changes occurring in the NCA are the degradation of upland forests into bushland: we exemplify this with a case study in the Lerai Forest; and found declines in grassland and co-incident increases in shrubland in the Serengeti Plains, suggesting woody encroachment. These changes threaten the wellbeing of livestock, the livelihoods of resident pastoralists and of the wildlife dependent on these grazing areas. Some of the land cover changes may be occurring naturally and caused by herbivory, rainfall patterns and vegetation succession, but many are linked to human activity, specifically, management policies, tourism development and the increase in human population and livestock. Our study provides for the first time much needed and highly accurate information on long-term land cover changes in the NCA that can support the sustainable management and conservation of this unique UNESCO World Heritage Site.

AB  - Grazing by large mammalian herbivores influences ecosystem structure and functions through its impacts on vegetation and soil, as well as by the influence on other animals such as arthropods. As livestock progressively replace native grazers around the world, it is pertinent to ask whether they have comparable influence over arthropods, or not. We use a replicated landscape-level, long-term grazer-exclusion experiment (14 years) to address how ground-dwelling arthropods respond to such a change in grazing regime where livestock replace native grazers in the cold deserts of the Trans-Himalayan ecosystem of northern India. We analyze spatial and temporal variation in the abundance of 25,604 arthropods sampled using pitfall traps across 2765 trap-days through the duration of the growing season spanning spring, summer, and autumn. These were from 88 operational taxonomic units covering six orders from 33 families (ants, wasps, bees, ticks and mites, spiders, grasshoppers, and beetles). We find that grazer assemblage-whether livestock or native herbivores-had a strong influence on both vegetation and arthropods. Partial redundancy analysis (RDA) showed that 53.6% of the spatial and temporal variation in arthropod communities could be explained by grazing and by grazer assemblage identity, alongside covariation with vegetation composition and soil variables. Structural equation models revealed that grazing and grazer assemblage identity have direct effects on arthropods, as well as indirect effects that are mediated through vegetation. Importantly, spiders (predators) were less abundant under livestock, whereas grasshoppers (leaf eaters) and ticks and mites (parasitic disease vectors) were more abundant, compared with native grazers. Reduction in spiders can fundamentally alter material and energy flow through the cascading effects of losing predators, and an abundance of grasshoppers may even contribute to vegetation degradation that is often associated with livestock. Parallelly, increases in ticks and mites lead to concerns over vector-borne disease that require planned interventions to align animal husbandry with One Health. Thus, losing native grazers to livestock expansion can have wide-ranging repercussions via arthropods. This may not only affect ecosystem structure and functions, but also offer challenges and opportunities to mitigate risks from vector-borne disease.

AB  - The contents and stoichiometric characteristics of soil carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus greatly influence the structures and functions of the ecological system. The steep gully slope is the main source of erosion sediment in the small watershed on the Loess Plateau, China. It is vital to fully quantify the potential effects of vegetation restoration on soil nutrients and their stoichiometry under such harsh standing environments. To investigate the effects of plant communities on soil C, N, P contents and their stoichiometry on steep gully slopes. Two shrubs (Hippophae rhamnoides Linn., Caragana korshinskii Kom.), four typical grasses (Carex lanceolata Boott., Artemisia giraldii Pamp., Bothriochloa ischcemum (Linn.) Keng. and Artemisia sacrorum Ledeb.), and one slope farmland planted with Zea mays (as control) were chosen as the testing sites. Soil samples were collected from seven layers (0-10, 10-20, 20-30, 30-40, 40-60, 60-80, and 80-120 cm). The results showed that grassland had higher soil total carbon, soil total nitrogen, soil total phosphorus, and stoichiometries than shrubland on steep gully slopes. The C/N ratio had the minimum variation between different communities, while N/P and C/P ratios gradually decreased with soil depth. Both N and P were scarce on steep gully slopes. Soil C, N, P contents and their stoichiometry were closely related to bulk density, plant litter density and root mass density. The results are helpful to understand the spatial variation of soil nutrients and their stoichiometry and vegetation management on steep gully slopes in arid and semi-arid regions.

AB  - Species distribution modelling based on bioclimatic variables to understand habitat suitability and changes in range dominates studies on the spatial distribution of baobabs, which limits our understanding of how the small-scale plant-plant interactions influence the spatial point pattern of this keystone species in semiarid regions of sub-Saharan Africa. Here, we investigated the spatial distribution of the baobab in two protected areas, Chipinge Safari Area (CSA) and Save Valley Conservancy (SVC) which lie in the semi-arid Southeastern lowveld of Zimbabwe. CSA was previously a sparsely human populated area before its proclamation as a protected area, has a small number of herbivores and baboons, and has no elephants, while SVC has a high density of elephants (1.5 km-2) and large number of herbivores. At each site, 1 km2 plots, SVC (n = 4) and CSA (n = 3), were established for spatial analysis. In each plot, we recorded the spatial location, elevation, height, diameter at breast height, and canopy cover of each baobab. Spatial point-pattern was assessed using both the inhomogeneous transformed L-function for Ripley's K-function and the pair-correlation function. Baobabs in SVC were larger (height, canopy cover, and basal area) relative to those in CSA. At both sites, baobabs were clustered at small spatial scale (0-50 m), indicating that competition was insufficient to cause density-dependent thinning that can lead to even distribution as we expected. The distribution of small baobabs was independent of large baobabs, which reflects the importance of other environmental factors such as site conditions and seed dispersal rather than nurseprote ' ge ' on seedling establishment. The random distribution pattern of adult baobabs could be the legacy effects of these random factors and processes at establishment. Overall, our study shows that the distribution of baobabs is not dependent on local plant-plant interactions, but most likely from larger scale random pattern forming factors and processes such as seed dispersal and environmental heterogeneity.

AB  - Context Control of invasive wild pigs (Sus scrofa) is a growing management concern throughout their invaded range. In the United States, control programs often leave wild pig carcasses on the landscape where they are freely available for consumption by scavengers such as coyotes (Canis latrans). Coyotes consume wild pigs, but no studies have investigated the importance of pig carcasses for maintaining coyote abundance.Aims We tested the hypothesis that coyote populations may be bolstered by wild pig carcasses created by control programs.Methods From July 2014 to July 2017, we surveyed road transects for scat to monitor coyote abundance in response to changing levels of pig carcass availability. From June 2015 to July 2017, wild pigs were removed from the eastern half of the study area and placed at one of four carcass dump sites on the western side. We analysed the scat data using an open population spatially-explicit capture-mark recapture model to estimate seasonal abundance and movement of coyotes in response to the carcass treatment.Results Coyote density across the entire study area declined from 95 coyotes/100 km2 in July 2014 to 65 coyotes/100 km2 by July 2016, but declines were unrelated to the carcass availability treatment. Additional analysis on non-genotyped scat data showed no apparent effect of carcass availability on coyote density. Coyote activity centers moved fewer than 100 m towards the nearest carcass dump site in response to the carcass treatment.Conclusions Wild pig carcass availability is not likely to be a primary driver of coyote abundance or territory selection at the study location.Implications We conclude that the availability of wild pig carcasses has little effect on coyote abundance and thus wild pig carcass removal will not be an effective coyote management strategy.

AB  - Successful species reintroductions require land managers to balance the goal of viable wildlife populations with potential risks to human enterprise. Such risks are particularly acute at the wildland-agriculture interface, where native and domestic species are likely to come into contact. In a national park in northern California, we combined insights from three lines of evidence - long-term visual surveys, short-term GPS telemetry, and satellite remote sensing-based animal detections - to characterize spatial overlap between reintroduced tule elk (Cervus canadensis nannodes) and domestic cattle and to estimate the importance of multiple environmental features as predictors of habitat selection by elk. Our results indicate that, at large spatial scales (i.e., home-range level), cattle were the primary driver of habitat selection, with the occurrence of elk being negatively associated with cattle across all seasons. In addition, elk consistently selected for grasslands on gentle, south-facing slopes that occurred at high elevation and close to ponds. NDVI was a seasonally important, positive predictor of habitat selection, with a marked reversal when this resource was concentrated inside of fenced cow pastures during the dry summer months. By contrast, a novel analysis of satellite-derived animal locations yielded no evidence of avoidance of cattle by elk (within pasture areas commonly used by elk), indicating that this population has acclimated to the presence of cattle through spatial partitioning of resources. Thus, this once-imperiled native ungulate exhibits patterns of habitat selection that reduce the potential for grazing conflicts with cattle, even in cases where access to forage is limited.

AB  - The application of ionomics and ecological stoichiometry benefits conservation biology with necessary ecological and evolutionary relevance, allowing unresolved problems to be addressed. The use of ionomics and ecological stoichiometry enables consideration that changes in the environmental nutritional supply affect the ecophysiology, behavior, health and fitness of individuals, influencing their ecological interactions and population functioning. The resulting knowledge can help promote better conservation and restoration strategies. Ultimately, ionomics and ecological stoichiometry facilitate improved forecasting and mitigation of the negative effects of current global change. Here, we present the theoretical background followed by the application of ionomics and ecological stoichiometry in biological conservation. We also propose avenues for future research. For example, larval and adult pollinating insects belong to different feeding guilds, and larvae rely on various stoichiometrically (im)balanced foods (showing herbivory, pollinivory, detritivory or even carnivory). Therefore, the ecology and diversity of pollinators may be shaped by the nutritional quality of larval food, which is required for physiological development into fully functional adults. Although a stoichiometric balance during larval development is crucial for pollinator health and fitness, pollinator conservation is focused on the nutritional needs of adults. Another example is atmospheric CO2 increases leading to nutrient dilution in plant tissues, aggravating nutritional imbalances in consumers and challenging Earth's herbivore populations. CO2-driven nutrient dilution may affect food webs, ecosystems and human wellbeing. However, our understanding of this phenomenon is minimal. These and other unresolved conservation biology problems may be studied and solved using ionomics and ecological stoichiometry.

AB  - In intact ecosystems, factors such as herbivory and light and water availability affect seedling establishment. Land-use change and climate change are now affecting forests globally, influencing seedling establishment directly via changes in light availability and precipitation and indirectly by affecting herbivory. The present study evaluated the ecological complexity of seedling establishment in response to interactions between these factors. The growth and survival of a pioneer species and two later successional species were measured in a factorial experiment testing the effects of land-use change, water availability, and herbivory. The study was conducted on Mt. Gorongosa in central Mozambique, a protected area that is experiencing high levels of land-use change and is in need of forest restoration. The pioneer species, Erythrina lysistemon, gained the most height in undisturbed, shaded environments where it invested resources in accessing light. Erythrina lysistemon grew the most in diameter in open areas. Khaya anthotheca, a later successional species, gained more biomass in disturbed, high light areas. The growth of Millettia stuhlmannii, another later successional species, was not affected by light. Drought conditions reduced survival of the later successional species, while flooding limited the survival of the pioneer species. Herbivory increased in disturbed areas and was nega-tively correlated with E. lysistemon root biomass. In summary, this study indicates land-use change and cli-mate change may alter seedling establishment and community composition. Restoration efforts should focus on increasing seedling survival because although survival is limited in disturbed sites, seedlings that do sur-vive grow successfully.& COPY; 2023 Published by Elsevier B.V. on behalf of SAAB.

AB  - Trees have a great value in terms of ecosystem services in urban areas. LIFE CLIVUT is an "Information and Governance" European project developed in 4 Mediterranean Cities, with the goal of increasing the knowledge and awareness of citizens, especially young people, on the importance of the presence and good management of urban trees to mitigate the "Heat Island" effects. The data collected on the value of tree heritage and their future potential are used to design a green asset management strategy that will help urban planners adopt better practices for the mitigation of the effects of climate change in urban environments. This paper illustrates the results of tree census activity in four urban green areas of Perugia, Central Italy, that will be compared with those recorded in others cities involved in the project. Dendrometric parameters (diameter at breast height, tree height, first branch height, max and min crown width, crown shape and density) were recorded in situ using a dedicated software operating through a web app ("Clivut-Treedb"). The following ecosystem services were estimated: CO2 sequestration, particulate matter (PM) absorption, shadow effect, biodiversity indexes. Several tree species characterized by important wood structures during their adult phase, such as Pinus pinea, Quercus ilex, Q. pubescens, Ulmus carpinifolia, Populus alba and Aesculus hippocastanum showed the highest estimates of CO2 stored. Q. ilex was the most efficient species in particulate adsorption, showing similar estimates (about 60 g PM10 tree(-1) year(-1)) in the 3 oldest green areas established in the 1980s, while the youngest plantations (dating back to 2005) absorbed about 10 g tree(-1) of PM10 per year. In terms of the potential cooling effect of trees, preliminary estimates of the shaded areas highlighted the difference between the older green areas (about 50% of shading) compared to the younger ones (about 15% and 8%).

AB  - The biogenic volatile organic compounds, BVOCs have a central role in ecosystem-atmosphere interactions. High-latitude ecosystems are facing increasing temperatures and insect herbivore pressure, which may affect their BVOC emission rates, but evidence and predictions of changes remain scattered. We studied the long-term effects of + 3 degrees C warming and reduced insect herbivory (achieved through insecticide sprayings) on mid- and late summer BVOC emissions from field layer vegetation, supplemented with birch saplings, and the underlying soil in Subarctic mountain birch forest in Finland in 2017-2018. Reduced insect herbivory decreased leaf damage by 58-67% and total ecosystem BVOC emissions by 44-72%. Of the BVOC groups, total sesquiterpenes had 70-80% lower emissions with reduced herbivory, and in 2017 the decrease was greater in warmed plots (89% decrease) than in ambient plots (34% decrease). While non-standardized total BVOC, monoterpene, sesquiterpene and GLV emissions showed instant positive responses to increasing chamber air temperature in midsummer samplings, the long-term warming treatment effects on standardized emissions mainly appeared as changes in the compound structure of BVOC blends and varied with compounds and sampling times. Our results suggest that the effects of climate warming on the total quantity of BVOC emissions will in Subarctic ecosystems be, over and above the instant temperature effects, mediated through changes in insect herbivore pressure rather than plant growth. If insect herbivore numbers will increase as predicted under climate warming, our results forecast herbivory-induced increases in the quantity of Subarctic BVOC emissions.

AB  - Climate change and agronomic management are major drivers altering Central European anthropogenic grassland ecosystems, but little is known about how these drivers interact in their effects on plant nutrient concentrations and ratios. This study was conducted in a climate change field experiment (higher temperature and changed seasonal precipitation pattern) in Central Germany with species-rich non-fertilized grasslands managed either by two times mowing (meadow) or three times sheep grazing (pasture) per year. In spring 2022, during peak plant growth, we collected leaves of five plant species per functional group (grasses, legumes, non-legume forbs) as well as topsoil samples and determined plant leaf and plant available soil nutrient concentrations (N, P, K, Ca, Mg, S) and ratios. Plant functional groups differed in leaf concentrations of all studied nutrients with the exception of sulfur. The future climate treatment (compared to ambient climate) resulted in lower leaf N:P ratios across both management types and did not show any other effects on leaf or soil nutrients. Independent of the climate treatment, leaf and soil K concentrations were higher, while leaf Ca concentrations were lower in pastures compared to meadows. In addition, grasses had higher leaf N, legumes higher leaf S concentrations but lower leaf N:P ratios, and forbs lower leaf S concentrations in pastures than in meadows. While we found no interactive effect of climate and management and little effects of the rather moderate future climate treatment, the observed differences between pastures and meadows indicate that management, even at low intensity, modifies plant and soil nutrients in grasslands.

AB  - Globally, illegal bushmeat hunting has contributed to the decline of over 300 species listed as threatened on the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List and accounts for an estimated 5 million tons of wildlife harvested annually, particularly in tropical regions, placing immense pressure on biodiversity. Despite its recognized conservation threat, limited information exists on the bushmeat trade dynamics in sub-Saharan African savannas. This study conducted interviews with 133 illegal hunters and 40 anti-poaching field rangers in Southeastern Zimbabwe, using semi-structured questionnaires. We explored the characteristics, motivations, methods, species targeted, and perceptions of wildlife law enforcement in Save Valley Conservancy (SVC). Overall, illegal bushmeat hunting in SVC is mainly done by less educated and unemployed young to middle aged men (15-40 years old). The motives behind illegal bushmeat hunting mainly included household consumption (96%), the desire to raise income (96%), unemployment (78%), retaliation for wildlife induced losses (62%), culture (29%) and poor benefit sharing (8%). The common hunting methods reported were hunting with dogs (87%), and snaring (65%). Targeted animal species included impala (96%), wildebeest (53%), eland (53%), African buffalo (51%) among other 12 animal species. Illegal bushmeat hunting was generally conducted all year round. The law enforcement penalties were considered less deterrent, and most of the hunters intended to continue with illegal hunting. Measures suggested to minimize illegal bushmeat hunting in the SVC included investing and strengthening wildlife law enforcement, provision of community conservation-based incentives and enhancing environmental education and awareness.

AB  - Ecological relationships between supplementary feeding and baiting in situ and vegetation patterns were studied in the mostly forest landscape of the Western Carpathians. We aimed to test the role of wildlife management practices in alien plants spreading. Altogether 82 localities with diverse hunting facilities stretched throughout several mountain areas and hills from northern to southern Slovakia were examined. Presence of vascular plant species was recorded for each locality. In addition, we sampled 33 phytosociological releves to cover main vegetation types using methods of Zurich-Montpeliere approach. Altogether 208 taxa of vascular plants consisting of 144 native and 64 alien ones were found. Among aliens, 44 archaeophytes and 20 neophytes were recognized, including 8 invasive species (Amaranthus retroflexus, Ambrosia artemisiifolia, Bidens frondosa, Conyza canadensis, Echinochloa crus-galli, Galinsoga urticifolia, Helianthus tuberosus, and Stenactis annua). Different habitat conditions as well as intensity and frequency of disturbances result in high community heterogeneity. Six plant communities and one group of stands with weak phytosociological relations were identified. A canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) was applied to explain the effect of hunting facilities, artificial feeds and elevation on species compositional pattern of vascular plants and neophyte species, while variation in percentage of aliens and neophytes was modeled using general linear model (GLM). The CCA revealed the significant role of bait site, elevation, coarse fodder (hay), grain feed and fleshy feed for species composition assemblages. The proportion of aliens decreased at higher elevations and increased with the occurrence of bait sites and with the use of grain feed and corn silage. The neophyte frequency was negatively associated with elevation and coarse fodder (hay), but positively associated with the presence of high shooting stand and crushed corn. Based on results concerning risk of alien and/or invasive plant species spreading, wildlife supplementary feeding, baiting and whatever fodder and crop decoy applications (except hay of local provenience) seem to be undesirable. Especially in natural ecosystems and strictly protected areas, consistent and controlled abidance of regulation has to be enforced.

AB  - Increased group size is predicted to dilute predation risk for individuals and increase predator detection at the group level. Individual vigilance tends to decrease with group size for many species. However, this pattern varies across species, context, space, and time. We explored the effects of group size on vigilance behaviors of white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) in relation to season, sex-age status, group composition, diminishing food returns, and intraspecific competition. We used classical behavioral observation methods and camera traps to study deer behavior. Sex-age class, season, intraspecific competition, and diminishing food returns interacted with group size to shape vigilance behaviors in deer. During spring, the effect of group size was essentially non-existent, and during winter, vigilance patterns exhibited a non-linear relationship with group size. Subadult deer benefited most in terms of increased foraging and decreased vigilance from the presence of 1-2 conspecifics, likely a maternal family group. This effect diminished in the presence of additional conspecifics (>= 3), apparently as a function of contest competition. Individual deer spent less time at a site in areas with greater intraspecific abundance; however, in the presence of conspecifics, the relationship was reversed. Our research suggests that maternal family groups play an important seasonal role in vigilance behaviors of deer. Our study demonstrates the complex effects of group size in white-tailed deer. Group size effects are generally considered to be in response to changes in predation risk; however, our work supports a growing body of evidence that group size effects may also be influenced by intraspecific interactions.

AB  - Background Alterations in weather patterns due to climate change are accelerated in alpine environments, but mountains also provide a wide range of niches and potential refuge areas. In order to identify future critical habitat for mountain ungulates for effective protection, it is important to understand their spatial responses to changing weather conditions without movement constraints by human disturbance.Methods Using integrated step selection functions, we investigated fine-scale changes in seasonal habitat use in response to weather and time of day for 55 GPS-collared adult Alpine chamois in summer and 42 individuals in winter in a strictly protected area.Results Chamois reacted to increasing precipitation and wind speeds primarily by moving to lower elevations in summer and winter. However, reactions to high summer temperatures predominantly involved preferences for increasing tree cover density and northerly slopes. Snow depth had little effect on habitat choice, and southerly slopes were preferred in winter regardless of temperature. At night, chamois moved to steeper slopes and lower elevations than during daytime in both seasons, and to more open areas in summer. Steeper slopes were also preferred with increasing tree cover density.Conclusions Chamois employ adaptive fine-scale adjustments in their habitat choice consistent with respect to efficient thermoregulation and protection from both weather extremes and predation risk in summer and winter. Movement responses to climate change are therefore expected to be far more complex than simple altitudinal changes in distribution. Particularly the role of forest cover must not be underestimated, as it appears to provide important thermal refuge habitat from high summer temperatures.

AB  - Natural enemies of plants, including fungal pathogens and insect herbivores, can maintain plant diversity if their harmful effects on seeds and seedlings are density-dependent (the Janzen-Connell hypothesis). As insect and fungal communities can be modified by anthropogenic habitat fragmentation, we conducted a field experiment to understand how fragmentation might affect the ability of natural enemies to maintain diversity. In 21 rainforest fragments in the Western Ghats, India, we suppressed insects and fungi with biocides and examined consequent changes in the survival of naturally dispersed tree seedlings. Seedling survival decreased with the density of conspecific seedlings in the same plot. This effect was reduced by fungicide applications, especially in large forest fragments. Insecticide increased seedling survival, but its effects were independent of fragment area and conspecific density. The effects of conspecific density and fungicide were predominantly driven by the most abundant species, Syzygium rubicundum. Overall, these results indicate that forest fragmentation can alter biotic processes that regulate plant diversity. However, the overall impact of fragmentation through this pathway may be limited to relatively few species.

AB  - Fire occurs naturally in grasslands and savannas and it is commonly used as a management tool to influence structure and composition. The ability of a grass plant to recover from fire may be influenced by the fire frequency and intensity (influenced by seasonal weather conditions and fuel load), defoliation and competition from neighbouring plants. This study sought to investigate factors influencing the fire and herbivore dynamics of an evergreen C-3 grass, Festuca costata, in a high-altitude C-4 dominated grassland in the Drakensberg Mountains of South Africa. We experimentally examined the effect of fire frequency, defoliation and competition from neighbours on the growth dynamics of F. costata. Annual burning significantly decreased aboveground biomass production, number of tillers and tuft circumference of F. costata. Defoliation similarly reduced aboveground biomass production, number of tillers, tuft circumference and specific leaf area of F. costata. Competition from neighbouring plants reduced aboveground biomass production, number of tillers and tuft circumference of F. costata. Given the expected variable impacts of increasing CO2 levels and temperature on C-3 and C-4 grasses, these results provide insights for managing the matrix of C-3 and C-4 grasses in the Drakensberg grasslands in a changing climate.

AB  - Rabbits have travelled with humans to the most remote archipelagos, having been introduced on at least 800 islands worldwide. This herbivore has caused a devastating effect on endemic insular plants, causing changes in species composition, cascading extinctions and disruption of native seed dispersal systems worldwide. However, its ecological impacts as disrupting native seed dispersal systems have not been studied from a holistic perspective in any of the archipelagos where rabbits were introduced. Here, we assess the role of rabbits as frugivores and seed-dispersers on the most extensive and diverse island of the Canary Archipelago, Tenerife, across its five main vegetation zones represented in an altitudinal gradient 0-3715 m a.s.l. To this end, 120 transects per vegetation zone were conducted (August 2020-November 2021) to collect fresh faecal samples from a total of 244 latrines. They consisted of 29,538 droppings in which we found seeds from 73 plant species, 29 of which were identified to species level (13 endemic, eight natives and eight introduced by humans). About 70% of the seeds were identified as fleshy-fruited plant species while the remaining nine were dry fruits. Of the former, only nine showed a percentage of intact seeds greater than 75%, another nine species between 50 and 75%, and three lower than 50%. The digestive effect of rabbits on seedling emergence was generally low, compared to that produced by native seed dispersers. Since fleshy-fruited plants and rabbits have not been linked in their evolutionary history in the Canaries, the former seems to have their own legitimate seed dispersers.

AB  - The drainage of peatlands followed by land use conversion significantly impacts on the fluxes of green-house gases (GHGs, i.e. CO 2 , CH 4 , and N 2 O) to and from the atmosphere, driven by changes in soil properties and microbial communities. In this study, we compared saturated peatlands with drained ones used for sheep grazing or cultivated, which are common in South-West Iceland. These areas exhibit different degrees of soil saturation and nitrogen (N) content, reflecting the anthropic pressure gradient. We aimed at covering knowledge gaps about lack of estimates on N 2 O fluxes and drainage, by assessing the emissions of GHGs, and the impact of land conversion on these emissions. Moreover, we investigated soil microbial community functional diversity, and its connection with processes contributing to GHGs emission. GHGs emissions differed between saturated and drained peatlands, with increased soil respiration rates (CO 2 emissions) and N mineralization (N 2 O), consistent with the trend of anthropogenic pressure. Drainage drastically reduced methane (CH 4 ) emissions but increased CO 2 emissions, resulting in a higher global warming potential (GWP). Cultivation, involving occasional tillage and fertilization, further increased N 2 O emissions, mediated by higher N availability and conditions favorable to nitrification. Functional genes mirrored the overall trend, showing a shift from prevalent methanogenic archaea ( mcrA ) in saturated peatlands to nitrifiers ( amoA ) in drained-cultivated areas. Environmental variables and nutrient content were critical factors affecting community composition in both environments, which overall affected the GHGs emissions and the relative contribution of the three gases.

AB  - In theory, canopy openings can influence tree species establishment and resulting distributions over environmental gradients, but evidence concerning the magnitude and direction of such effects remain scarce. In this study we examine how canopy openings influence seedling persistence and growth and resulting elevation range limits. We transplanted 1360 seedlings of eight woody species (trees Trichilia habanensis, Persea caerulea, Cedrela tonduzii, Cornus disciflora, Quercus salicifolia, Q. bumelioides, Q. costaricensis and the shrub Hypericum irazuense) under the forest canopy and in open areas with understorey vegetation removed in a replicated design along a 2900 m elevation gradient in Costa Rica. We recorded survival, stem diameter and height over 18 months. We used hierarchical generalized additive models to examine relationships of seedling survival and growth with elevation and treatment (inside forest versus open area). We found a clear effect of open versus forest conditions on survival across the elevation gradient for six species. Species planted into open areas with full light exposure survived 100-1000 m below (similar to 0.5-5 degrees C warmer), and in one case 300 m above (similar to 1.8 degrees C colder) their observed ranges. Above 2900 m, survival of all species was markedly greater under the forest canopy versus open sites, suggesting facilitation from the forest, as frost occurred in open areas above this elevation. The resulting upper range increased between 200 and 1160 m (similar to 1-6 degrees C colder) compared to their observed range. At lower elevations, severe insect herbivory occurred on some species likely influencing lower range limits. Open areas influenced how seedling survival and growth varied with elevation for all the studied species. All species survived and grew outside the elevation ranges where they are typically observed. We suggest that the influence of forest gaps and clearings over extended gradients offers novel insights into tree range dynamics, limits and conservation.

AB  - Self-grooming is the most commonly observed behavior and serves numerous functions, with the removal of ectoparasites likely the most important. According to a predominant conception, grooming is regulated by two mechanisms: a programmed-grooming model and a stimulus-driven model. The programmed-grooming model predicts, first, that smaller body-size females must groom more frequently compared to larger males (body-size principle); second, the smaller young groom significantly more often than adults (developmental grooming); and third, rutting males, busy with social vigilance, groom significantly less often than females (vigilance principle). The impact of molting was also tested on the grooming rate as an additional hypothesis that is not a part of the programmed-grooming model. According to investigations of a wide variety of ungulates in captive and natural conditions, the predictions of the programmed-grooming mechanism were found to be accurate for most sexually dimorphic ungulates. Here, I tested the principles of the programmed-grooming model in free living, wild goitered gazelles (Gazella subgutturosa), which are parasitized by both keds and ticks. My study found the following: (a) the body-size principle was not supported by my data, especially during the gazelles' molting and rutting periods; (b) the developmental grooming model did not relate to the grooming behavior of goitered gazelle fawns; (c) the vigilance principle was not applicable to male goitered gazelles; and (d) spring molting increased the grooming rate drastically for both males and females and likely had the greatest effect over any other factor, even though keds also contributed to the grooming rate at this time. Though previous studies of tick parasitism on many ungulate species demonstrated that oral grooming was more consistent with programmed-grooming than the stimulus-driven grooming model, my study of ked parasitism of goitered gazelles showed the opposite, suggesting that grooming driven mechanisms were parasite-host dependent. However, grooming behavior is likely a multifaceted phenomenon depending not only on body size, vigilance rate or even from ectoparasite burden, but also on numerous other factors.

AB  - Natural disturbances, like those caused by fires or large herbivores, can strongly affect forest ecosystems. Managers can emulate such disturbance effects, for example, with prescribed fire or domestic livestock. This might benefit species of conservation importance, including capercaillie Tetrao urogallus. We tested this idea using two management trials in a Scots pine Pinus sylvestris forest in Scotland. One trial (blocked design with 25 replicates) in small plots (0.07 ha) tested the effects of prescribed burning or mowing alongside a control. The other compared cattle grazing in two large plots (6 ha and 14 ha) with a control. We measured capercaillie habitat quality indicators, namely, in both trials: cover of bilberry Vaccinium myrtillus; and in the burning and mowing trial: biomass of arthropods taken by capercaillie chicks, and capercaillie dung. Monitoring took place before treatments, and afterwards over a 12-13 year period. Bilberry cover increased following burning and mowing, peaking at 1.4 times control values, six years post-treatment. In one of the cattle plots, similar bilberry increases were recorded throughout the post-treatment period. However, the other cattle plot showed no such change, perhaps reflecting different competitive interactions among field layer plants. Capercaillie dung and spider biomass increased markedly in burnt and mown areas, and ant biomass just in burnt areas. Unexpectedly, bilberry also increased strongly in control areas of both trials, reflecting wider successional changes. Our results suggest that any of these techniques could be used to improve capercaillie habitat quality, but should be delivered alongside monitoring, so that their effects can be evaluated in particular contexts.

AB  - Urban green spaces are important for urban insects, providing both habitat space as well as stopover locations within the urban landscape. Street tree pits in cities are small, heterogeneous, and understudied green spaces that may be important for supporting urban insect communities. The purpose of this study was to investigate the composition of insect communities within tree pits in New York City, New York, USA (NYC) and compare tree pit insect communities across NYC neighborhoods. Tree pits in NYC are part of the New York City Parks system but are primarily managed by residents of each street. We postulated that insect assemblages within tree pits would contain both permanent (habitat) and transient (stopover) members and those communities would vary among neighborhoods. Insects were collected from understory plants in tree pits in four NYC neighborhoods during the summer of 2019. We found that the tree pits provided habitat for nine orders and 51 families of insects, the majority of which were herbivores and their associated predators or parasitoids, which were likely utilizing the tree pits as habitat space. Few clearly transient species (e.g. pollinators) were collected. Furthermore, insect communities were similar both within neighborhoods and among neighborhoods, suggesting that while tree pits management is not strictly regulated in NYC, tree pits in all neighborhoods provided habitat to sustain similar insect assemblages. At the neighborhood level, urban tree pits can harbor a diverse insect community and that capability is similar throughout the urban landscape.

AB  - Due to the vulnerability of neonatal ungulates, selection of a birth site can have important implications for offspring survival and thus fitness of the mother. We studied parturition site selection in cow Elk in southeastern Kentucky, United States, using a use-availability framework to evaluate the effects of landscape variables sampled at multiple spatial grains on the relative probability of use of parturition sites. We identified 81 Elk parturition sites during May-Aug 2020-2022 and fit several candidate resource selection function models using a sample of 24,314 random locations to characterize habitat availability. Using an information-theoretic approach to rank candidate models, we identified two top-performing models (cumulative wi = 0.97), which indicated that at fine spatial grains (-10-and 30-m pixels) parturient cow Elk selected for intermediate canopy cover and lower terrain ruggedness compared to available locations. At coarse grains (250-1,000-m buffers/neighborhoods), Elk selected against vegetation greenness/biomass, for higher topographic positions, for closer proximity to major roads, and with higher solar radiation potential. We also found evidence that Elk responded positively to forest/open edge densities at coarse grains, demonstrating that calving habitat throughout the Kentucky Elk Restoration Zone is associated with heterogeneous landscapes resulting from surface mine reclamation. As a result, habitat management actions should aim to increase patchy, early successional shrub cover on gentle topography.

AB  - The Hyrcanian region is a biogeographic entity of high biodiversity and a centre of Arcto-Tertiary relict flora. A pollen record from the mid-elevation of the Alborz Mountains (northern Iran) reaching back to 20,000 cal BP reveals the Late Quaternary vegetation history of this globally important forest ecosystem. For the period 20,000-14,419 cal BP the pollen record indicates the presence of beech, oak, and birch associated with elm and hornbeam, which indicates the presence of a Weichselian refugium for deciduous tree species. The simultaneous presence of abundant pollen attributable to Artemisia, Amaranthaceae, Apiaceae, and Hippophae center dot rhamnoides suggests the presence of a dry and cold steppe environment at higher elevations. For the period 16,746-14,419 cal BP, the pollen record indicates a steppe vegetation around the studied peatland (with a predominance of Artemisia, Amaranthaceae and Apiaceae species, along with Eremurus), a slight expansion of oak, and a strong decrease of beech. The period 14,419-12,993 cal BP started with a substantial rise in the values of pollen attributable to Quercus, Carpinus, and Ulmus with the near absence of pollen of dry-growing herbaceous vegetation. For 12,993-11,745 cal BP, a drastic decline of arboreal pollen types, pronounced peaks of NAP types, and constant values of pollen of Ephedra persuasively point to a dry period in the studied region. Towards the end of this period, when the climate apparently became somewhat warmer, deciduous trees expanded around the study site earlier than in other regions, probably because of the site's proximity to the refugium. After 8600 cal BP, oak declined in importance whereas beech and hornbeam expanded, showing the establishment of the contemporary temperate climate and vegetation. A pronounced expansion of alder and wingnut took place around 4000 cal BP. A remarkable decline of Pterocarya pollen at 1060 cal BP may relate to human impact and/or a cooling/drying climate.

AB  - The mammalian Y chromosome offers a unique perspective on the male reproduction and paternal evolutionary histories. However, further understanding of the Y chromosome biology for most mammals is hindered by the lack of a Y chromosome assembly. This study presents an integrated in silico strategy for identifying and assembling the goat Y-linked scaffolds using existing data. A total of 11.5 Mb Y-linked sequences were clustered into 33 scaffolds, and 187 protein-coding genes were annotated. We also identified high abundance of repetitive elements. A 5.84 Mb subset was further ordered into an assembly with the evidence from the goat radiation hybrid map (RH map). The existing whole-genome resequencing data of 96 goats (worldwide distribution) were utilized to exploit the paternal relationships among bezoars and domestic goats. Goat paternal lineages were clearly divided into two clades (Y1 and Y2), predating the goat domestication. Demographic history analyses indicated that maternal lineages experienced a bottleneck effect around 2,000 YBP (years before present), after which goats belonging to the A haplogroup spread worldwide from the Near East. As opposed to this, paternal lineages experienced a population decline around the 10,000 YBP. The evidence from the Y chromosome suggests that male goats were not affected by the A haplogroup worldwide transmission, which implies sexually unbalanced contribution to the goat trade and population expansion in post-Neolithic period.

AB  - The 2018 arrival of African swine fever (ASF) in China was followed by reports of wild pig deaths across most countries in Southeast Asia. However, the magnitude and duration of population-level impacts of ASF on wild pig species remain unclear. To elucidate the spatiotemporal spread of ASF in the region for native pig species, we gathered qualitative information on wild pig population dynamics in Southeast Asia between 2018 and 2024 from 88 expert elicitation questionnaires representing sites in 11 countries. Peak reported population declines occurred in 2021 and 2022, with more than half of respondents reporting declining wild pig populations, far higher than in earlier years. The reported declines waned to 44.23% in 2024, whereas simultaneously, the number of populations reported to be "increasing" increased from 11.3%-13.2% in 2019-2022 to 28.9% in 2024. These reports suggest that the ASF outbreak may have peaked for wild boars and bearded pigs in mainland Southeast Asia, Borneo, and Sumatra, with some subsequent recovery. However, the disease is still expanding into the ranges of island endemic species, such as new reports for the Sulawesi warty pig (Sus celebensis) in September of 2024. Island endemics remain particularly vulnerable to extinction from ASF and require urgent monitoring and conservation action.

AB  - In canids, resident breeders hold territories but require different resources than transient individuals (i.e., dispersers), which may result in differential use of space, land cover, and food by residents and transients. In the southeastern United States, coyote (Canis latrans) reproduction occurs during spring and is energetically demanding for residents, but transients do not reproduce and therefore can exhibit feeding behaviors with lower energetic rewards. Hence, how coyotes behave in their environment likely differs between resident and transient coyotes. We captured and monitored 36 coyotes in Georgia during 2018-2019 and used data from 11 resident breeders, 12 predispersing residents (i.e., offspring of resident breeders), and 11 transients to determine space use, movements, and relationships between these behaviors and landcover characteristics. Average home range size for resident breeders and predispersing offspring was 20.7 +/- 2.5 km(2) and 50.7 +/- 10.0 km(2), respectively. Average size of transient ranges was 241.4 +/- 114.5 km(2). Daily distance moved was 6.3 +/- 3.0 km for resident males, 5.5 +/- 2.7 km for resident females, and 6.9 +/- 4.2 km for transients. We estimated first-passage time values to assess the scale at which coyotes respond to their environment, and used behavioral change-point analysis to determine that coyotes exhibited three behavioral states. We found notable differences between resident and transient coyotes in regard to how landcover characteristics influenced their behavioral states. Resident coyotes tended to select for areas with denser vegetation while resting and foraging, but for areas with less dense vegetation and canopy cover when walking. Transient coyotes selected areas closer to roads and with lower canopy cover while resting, but for areas farther from roads when foraging and walking. Our findings suggest that behaviors of both resident and transient coyotes are influenced by varying landcover characteristics, which could have implications for prey.

AB  - Context. Although increases in macroalgal cover on coral reefs are often reported alongside declines in coral, the composition of algal assemblages and their spatial dynamics are not commonly investigated. Aims. To quantify changes in macroalgal assemblage composition over two spatial environmental gradients, depth and distance from shore, within a nearshore reef system in Kimbe Bay, Papua New Guinea, where coral cover has declined. Methods. Benthic cover was quantified at three depths (reef flat, 10 and 15 m) on the windward reef slopes of six reefs located three distances from shore (fringing reefs, and platform reefs 100-200 m and 0.7-1 km offshore). Key results. Macroalgal cover was highest on the reef flat, and assemblage composition varied among depths and distances from shore. Macroalgal cover was not correlated with coral cover except where macroalgal cover was greater than 20%, where a negative correlation occurred. There was no correlation between macroalgal cover and turf algal cover. All three benthic groups were negatively correlated with the combined total cover of sand and gravel. Conclusions. These results indicated a fine-scale spatial structure of macroalgal assemblages on coral reefs over a narrow depth range and short distance from shore and highlighted the importance of a solid substratum.

AB  - Climate-driven species redistributions are reshuffling the composition of marine ecosystems. How these changes alter ecosystem functions, however, remains poorly understood. Here we examine how impacts of herbivory change across a gradient of tropicalization in the Mediterranean Sea, which includes a steep climatic gradient and marked changes in plant nutritional quality and fish herbivore composition. We quantified individual feeding rates and behaviour of 755 fishes of the native Sarpa salpa, and non-native Siganus rivulatus and Siganus luridus. We measured herbivore and benthic assemblage composition across 20 sites along the gradient, spanning 30 degrees of longitude and 8 degrees of latitude. We coupled patterns in behaviour and composition with temperature measurements and nutrient concentrations to assess changes in herbivory under tropicalization. We found a transition in ecological impacts by fish herbivory across the Mediterranean from a predominance of seagrass herbivory in the west to a dominance of macroalgal herbivory in the east. Underlying this shift were changes in both individual feeding behaviour (i.e. food choice) and fish assemblage composition. The shift in feeding selectivity was consistent among temperate and warm-affiliated herbivores. Our findings suggest herbivory can contribute to the increased vulnerability of seaweed communities and reduced vulnerability of seagrass meadows in tropicalized ecosystems.

AB  - In this work we explore three methods for quantifying ecosystem vegetation responses spatially and temporally using Google's Earth Engine, implementing an Ecosystem Moisture Stress Index (EMSI) to monitor vegetation health in agricultural, pastoral, and natural landscapes across the entire era of spaceborne remote sensing. EMSI is the multitemporal standard (z) score of the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) given as I, for a pixel (x,y) at the observational period t. The EMSI is calculated as: z(xyt) = (I-xyt - mu(xyT))/sigma(xyT), where the index value of the observational date (I-xyt) is subtracted from the mean (mu(xyT)) of the same date or range of days in a reference time series of length T (in years), divided by the standard deviation (sigma(xyT)), during the same day or range of dates in the reference time series. EMSI exhibits high significance (z > |2.0 +/- 1.98 sigma|) across all geographic locations and time periods examined. Our results provide an expanded basis for detection and monitoring: (i) ecosystem phenology and health; (ii) wildfire potential or burn severity; (iii) herbivory; (iv) changes in ecosystem resilience; and (v) change and intensity of land use practices. We provide the code and analysis tools as a research object, part of the findable, accessible, interoperable, reusable (FAIR) data principles.

AB  - In recent decades, European temperate forests have repeatedly suffered from severe droughts. Drought-weakened forests have often become more susceptible to pest outbreaks such as bark beetle infestations. Tree species diversity is expected to increase resistance to drought and pests, but evidence for a positive tree diversity effect on insect pest reduction is largely circumstantial.
   Here we tested the effects of tree diversity and biogeographic origin of tree species on bark beetle infestation in a large, young tree diversity experiment, with six broadleaved and six conifer species from Europe and North America. Lower infestation risk was expected for the exotic tree species in each congeneric pair (spruce, larch and pine) and for mixtures with higher species richness and higher broadleaf proportion. Following a severe drought in summer 2018, the conifer trees were attacked by the six-toothed spruce bark beetle Pityogenes chalcographus. Bark beetle boreholes were recorded in winter 2018/2019 on all conifer species.
   Norway spruce Picea abies and European larch Larix decidua were the most infested species and thus considered main hosts of the bark beetle. For these two species, probability of infestation decreased with increasing tree diversity (although this was only significant for Larix). In contrast, Pinus, which were less infested overall, were more likely to be infested in plots with high tree diversity. Exotic trees tended to be less infested, with clearest support for enemy release found at the level of infestation intensity when considering pure conifer stands. Overall, the effects of tree diversity and tree species origin were not as strong as the effect of position within the experimental site, where higher rates of infestation were observed at the edge than in the centre.
   Synthesis. Increasing tree diversity may reduce the risk of bark beetle infestation for genera prone to high infestation rates (Picea and Larix), but risk for less preferred genera (Pinus, and to some extent the exotic tree species) may increase with tree diversity due to spillover from preferred hosts. In mixed forests, the risk of infestation, even by relatively specialized insect pests, may be redistributed among tree species rather than reduced for all.

AB  - Pinon pine-juniper woodlands are strongly influenced by water balance variation imparted by variation in climate, landscape attributes, and tree stand characteristics. To elucidate how these multiple factors shape woodland ecohydrology, we simulated the water balance of woodlands in the Spring (higher precipitation (PPT), higher potential evapotranspiration (PET)) and Sheep (lower PPT, lower PET) mountains of southern Nevada, USA. Simulations included: (1) elevation and climate (2000, 2200 and 2400 m; 3 scenarios); (2) low and moderate adult tree density (2 scenarios); and (3) south-facing, neutral, and north-facing aspects (3 scenarios; 18 scenarios in each mountain range). Due to the interplay between PPT and PET, the lower PPT Sheep mountains were atmospherically less dry (PPT - PET) than the Spring mountains. Following this, the Sheep mountains had higher transpiration partitioning into evapotranspiration (T/ET), whereas transpiration magnitude was higher in the Spring mountains. In both mountain ranges, soil moisture and tree transpiration were highest in winter and spring, and low in summer. T/ET was maximized at 12-15 m(2) ha(-1) basal area, illustrating the increasing influence of interception at higher tree densities. Thus, the water balance of these woodlands was driven by PPT, yet partitioning was shaped by PET and tree stand density. Interplay between soil moisture, tree transpiration, evaporation and interception is a defining characteristic of woodlands in southern Nevada, and may be influenced at broader and finer spatial scales. Better understanding of climatic, landscape, and tree stand factors may help to explain high water balance variation observed in woodlands across the western US, and improve understanding of how future change to pinon pine-juniper ecosystems may be realized.

AB  - This study examined the effect of perceived predation risk imposed by lynx (Lynx lynx) and wolf (Canis lupus) on red deer (Cervus elaphus) foraging behavior under experimental conditions. We hypothesized that in response to large carnivore scent red deer would increase their vigilance, although reducing the frequency and duration of visits to foraging sites. Consequently, browsing intensity on tree saplings was expected to decrease, whereas a higher proportion of more preferred species was expected to be browsed to compensate for higher foraging costs. We expected stronger responses towards the ambush predator lynx, compared with the cursorial predator wolf. These hypotheses were tested in a cafeteria experiment conducted within three red deer enclosures, each containing four experimental plots with olfactory cues of wolf, lynx, cow, and water as control. On each plot, a camera trap was placed and browsing intensity was measured for one consecutive week, repeated three times. Red deer reduced their visitation duration and browsing intensity on plots with large carnivore scent. Despite red deer showing a clear preference for certain tree species, the presence of large carnivore scent did not change selectivity towards different tree species. Contrary to our hypothesis, we found more pronounced effects of wolf (cursorial) compared with lynx (ambush). This study is the first to experimentally assess the perceived risk effects on the red deer foraging behavior of large carnivores differing in hunting modes. Our findings provide insights into the role of olfactory cues in predator-prey interactions and how they can modify fine-scale herbivore-plant interactions.

AB  - Seasonality of fleas (Siphonaptera) may be due to species competition, prompting the idea that flea species partition temperature, along with correlated variables such as moisture (thermal-niche partitioning hypothesis). I compared the fleas of five rodent-flea communities described from the literature for thermal-niche optima by fitting non-linear LRF (Lobry- Rosso-Flandrois) curves to examine whether flea species in a community show distinct, partitioned thermal niches. LRF curves estimate physiological parameters of temperature minimum, optimum, maximum, and maximum abundance, and facilitate comparison between species by summarizing seasonal data. Flea-communities were on Nearctic Southern flying squirrel (Glaucomys volans volans), Richardson's ground-squirrel (Urocitellus richardsonii), North American deer-mouse (Peromyscus maniculatus), and Palearctic Midday jird (Meriones meridianus), and Wagner's gerbil (Dipodillus dasyurus). Flea communities appeared to show seasonality consistent with thermal-niche partitioning. Several flea families and genera had characteristic thermal niches: Ceratophyllidae had broad tolerance to extreme temperature, Leptopsyllidae (one species in this study) to cold, and Pulicidae to hot. In contrast, at the local, species level, climatic speciation could be significant in flea diversification. Non-competition hypotheses (environmental filtering, neutrality) require testing, too. Thermal-niche partitioning may increase flea species richness on hosts and could occur in other insect and plant communities. Implications for biodiversity conservation and disease ecology under global warming are wide-ranging.

AB  - Stress and sexual hormones play a crucial role in the survival of wildlife. Understanding how these hormone levels are influenced by environmental and biological factors is essential for effective wildlife management. This study aims to investigate the impact of season, topography, habitat quality, and gender on the levels of the stress hormone cortisol and the sexual hormones testosterone and progesterone in the red deer (Cervus elaphus maral), a key wildlife species in northern Iran. In summer 2022 and winter 2023, 80 fecal samples were collected from the summer and winter ranges of red deer habitats. The levels of cortisol, testosterone, and progesterone were measured in the laboratory using enzyme immunoassay with specific kits and an ELISA device. Among habitat parameters, total percentage of vegetation was selected, and among topographic parameters, elevation was chosen. The influence of these factors, along with gender and season (winter and summer), on stress and sexual hormones was determined. The results showed that season significantly affected cortisol, testosterone, and progesterone levels, with red deer experiencing greater stress and higher testosterone and progesterone levels in summer compared to winter. Total percentage of vegetation and elevation did not have significant effects on these hormones. There was no significant correlation between cortisol and testosterone or progesterone in red deer. These findings can inform conservation and management plans by considering seasonal variations in stress and sexual hormones for red deer and other deer species worldwide.

AB  - Plant diversity can be affected by both herbivore grazing and soil resources. However, it is unclear if the joint effects of herbivores and soil resources might vary with components of plant diversity. Here, we evaluated the relative and combined effects of herbivore assemblage and soil nitrogen (N) quantity and heterogeneity on the alpha and beta components of plant diversity in a grassland that was subjected to four years of grazing under differing herbivore assemblages (no grazing, cattle grazing, sheep grazing, and mixed grazing). We found that herbivore assemblage combined with soil N quantity explained 41% of the variation in plant alpha-diversity, while herbivore assemblage combined with soil N heterogeneity explained 15% of the variation in plant beta-diversity. The independent effects of herbivore assemblage explained more than those of soil N for both alpha- and beta-diversity (alpha-diversity: 12% vs. 4%; beta-diversity: 18% vs. 16%). We concluded that the effects of herbivores are stronger than those of soil N, and that grazing-induced changes in soil resources are important drivers of plant diversity change, especially alpha-diversity. Therefore, we suggest that managing herbivore species by accounting for the effects that their grazing can have on soil resources may be significant for plant diversity maintenance.

AB  - Interspecific interactions among predators can shape ecological communities across trophic levels, including among predator guilds. The strength and directions of these interactions, however, may vary spatially and temporally in regions undergoing widespread landscape changes (e.g., urbanization, agricultural production). We investigated intraguild effects of coyotes (Canis latrans), a de facto apex predator, and land-cover changes on abundance indices of red foxes (Vulpes vulpes) and gray foxes (Urocyon cinereoargenteus) using two long-term and independent time series: direct observations of canids by archery deer hunters (26 years) and harvest data from canid trappers (41 years) from across Illinois, USA. Abundance indices from both time series for red and gray foxes declined whereas coyote abundance indices increased, suggesting increasing coyote abundance may have led to decreases in fox population abundances. Empirical support among candidate models explaining fox declines was generally equivocal yet differed between fox species. Models including effects of coyote abundance were generally competitive for red foxes and estimated negative coyote effects even after controlling for declining farm size. The empirical support among our landscape hypotheses also varied by species despite increasing forest cover and farm size during our study. The estimated effects of coyote in our study were weaker than reported at more northerly latitudes suggesting that increasing coyote populations may not be fully responsible for observed declines in fox populations in the midwestern USA.

AB  - Competition is a complex ecological process involving individual and community interactions at ecological and evolutionary time scales. Individuals within and between species can compete through two mechanisms: exploitative and interference competition. These mechanisms often co-occur, making it difficult to develop a mechanistic understanding of competition. We used movement data from 19 GPS-collared white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) associated with an experimental cattle (Bos taurus) stocking event to disentangle exploitative from interference competition between deer and cattle. We assumed any effect of exploitative competition on reduced forage availability for deer would not occur immediately, whereas interference competition would occur immediately after cattle stocking, and antagonistic interactions between deer and cattle would alter deer behavior and degrade habitat quality. We evaluated the effects of the experimental stocking event on deer for 30-day intervals before and after the cattle stocking event as this period was assumed to be too short for cattle to reduce deer forage resources through exploitative competition. We assessed the effects of interference competition using the movement metrics of home range size, speed, and resource selection. We used home range size as a proxy for habitat quality, assuming cattle would degrade deer habitat through means other than loss of forage. We used speed and resource selection as indicators of deer behavior. We experimentally stocked cattle at densities ranging from 0 to 15.7 animal units/km2 to previously destocked pastures. Stocking densities did not influence home range sizes (beta$$ \hat{\upbeta} $$ = 17.033, 85% CI: -189.471 to 235.322) of deer. However, as stocking density increased, deer decreased speed (beta$$ \hat{\upbeta} $$ = -0.014, 85% CI: -0.020 to -0.008) and increased selection for woody cover (beta$$ \hat{\upbeta} $$ = 0.047, 85% CI: 0.031 to 0.063) and sandier soils (beta$$ \hat{\upbeta} $$ = 0.062, 85% CI: 0.033 to 0.090). Our results suggest cattle density altered deer behavior and their realized niche within our system. Our results demonstrated mechanisms by which competition with livestock could influence native wildlife populations, which can be used to inform management of multiuse working landscapes.

AB  - Agricultural intensification and landscape simplification are among the major drivers of biodiversity loss in agricultural landscapes. Increasing field edges might be a key solution for enhancing biodiversity and related ecosystem services within arable fields. In this study, we investigated the spatial distribution of nine arthropod groups and weed seed and pest predation rates across different distances from field edges and crop types. Furthermore, we tested the relationship between local carabid abundance and species richness and directly measured weed seed and pest predation rates. Most of the investigated taxa were not affected by field margin proximity, except for carabid species richness and the abundance of bees and wasps, hoverflies, and myriapods, which were high near the edge. We found a higher abundance of carabids and herbivores in oilseed rape compared to other crops, while hoverflies, bees and wasps were more abundant in cereal. True bug abundance was significantly higher in oilseed rape interiors compared to edges. Weed seed predation and pest predation by small mammals were the highest at 36 m from the field margin, probably due to small mammal distribution, while pest predation by arthropods did not show any significant pattern. Both weed seed predation rate and arthropod pest predation were positively related to carabid abundance and negatively to species richness. Contrasting responses across nine investigated arthropod taxa indicate that re-designing agricultural landscapes to support biodiversity across taxa will be challenging, and further studies are needed to fully understand the spatial distribution of arthropods and related ecosystem services in agricultural landscapes.

AB  - Reindeer lichens (Cladonia spp.) are an essential food source for caribou especially during winter. They can also be a valuable indicator for ecosystem health and climate change. Inventory of lichen abundance at regional scales is required to assess availability within caribou ranges, and assess potential declines from natural and anthropogenic disturbances. Previous studies have mapped lichen cover and volume using remote sensing, but these efforts were often constrained by the limited availability of ground truth information needed for model calibration and validation. In this study, we leveraged unoccupied aerial vehicle (UAV) surveys and WorldView (WV) satellite scenes in a nested upscaling approach in order to expand the number of training samples at the 30 m Landsat resolution. These were used to develop machine learning models to map fractional reindeer lichen cover in Eastern Canada. We found that the best correlation between UAV and WV derived lichen coverages exists at an optimal scale that is slightly larger than 30 m and varies with landscape type and observation geometry. Based on training data from UAV-calibrated lichen coverage from WV data, a neural network model with simple structure achieved a root mean square error (RMSE) = 0.09, a mean absolute error (MAE) = 0.07 and R-2 = 0.79 for mapping fractional lichen cover from Landsat without the use of ancillary data. We then applied our model and Landsat data to produce a lichen fractional cover map for the Red Wine Mountain caribou herd range in Labrador, NL and the Manicouagan caribou herd range in Que ' bec. Validation against domain-averaged lichen cover in eight UAV survey sites suggests an accuracy with RMSE = 0.04, MAE = 0.03 and R-2 = 0.62 for low lichen cover. Compared to aggregated lichen cover at 30 m from UAV surveys, map accuracy decreases to RMSE = 0.09, MAE = 0.06, and R-2 = 0.49, partially due to registration error between UAV and Landsat images. Our study demonstrates that upscaling of lichen cover from UAV data to Landsat via an intermediate image scale is an effective regional-scale mapping approach.

AB  - Megaherbivores play "outsized" roles in ecosystem functioning but are vulnerable to human impacts such as overhunting, land-use changes, and climate extremes. However, such impacts-and combinations of these impacts-on population dynamics are rarely examined using empirical data. To guide effective conservation actions under increasing global-change pressures, we developed a socially structured individual-based model (IBM) using long-term demographic data from female giraffes (Giraffa camelopardalis) in a human-influenced landscape in northern Tanzania, the Tarangire Ecosystem. This unfenced system includes savanna habitats with a wide gradient of anthropogenic pressures, from national parks, a wildlife ranch and community conservation areas, to unprotected village lands. We then simulated and projected over 50 years how realistic environmental and land-use management changes might affect this metapopulation of female giraffes. Scenarios included: (1) anthropogenic land-use changes including roads and agricultural/urban expansion; (2) reduction or improvement in wildlife law enforcement measures; (3) changes in populations of natural predators and migratory alternative prey; and (4) increases in rainfall as predicted for East Africa. The factor causing the greatest risk of rapid declines in female giraffe abundance in our simulations was a reduction in law enforcement leading to more poaching. Other threats decreased abundances of giraffes, but improving law enforcement in both of the study area's protected areas mitigated these impacts: a 0.01 increase in giraffe survival probability from improved law enforcement mitigated a 25% rise in heavy rainfall events by increasing abundance 19%, and mitigated the expansion of towns and blockage of dispersal movements by increasing abundance 22%. Our IBM enabled us to further quantify fine-scale abundance changes among female giraffe social communities, revealing potential source-sink interactions within the metapopulation. This flexible methodology can be adapted to test additional ecological questions in this landscape, or to model populations of giraffes or other species in different ecosystems.

AB  - Understanding how the nutritional properties of food resources drive foraging choices is important for the management and conservation of wildlife populations. For moose (Alces alces), recent experimental and observational studies during the winter have shown macronutrient balancing between available protein (AP) and highly metabolizable macronutrients (total non-structural carbohydrates [TNC] and lipids). Here, we combined the use of continuous-recording camera collars with plant nutrient analyses and forage availability measurements to obtain a detailed insight into the food and nutritional choices of three wild moose in Norway over a 5-day period in summer. We found that moose derived their macronutrient energy primarily from carbohydrates (74.2%), followed by protein (13.1%), and lipids (12.7%). Diets were dominated by deciduous tree browse (71%). Willows (Salix spp.) were selected for and constituted 51% of the average diet. Moose consumed 25 different food items during the study period of which 9 comprised 95% of the diet. Moose tightly regulated their intake of protein to highly metabolizable macronutrients (AP:TNC + lipids) to a ratio of 1:2.7 (0.37 +/- 0.002SD). They did this by feeding on foods that most closely matched the target macronutrient ratio such as Salix spp., or by combining nutritionally imbalanced foods (complementary feeding) in a non-random manner that minimized deviations from the intake target. The observed patterns of macronutrient balancing aligned well with the findings of winter studies. Differential feeding on nutritionally balanced downy birch (Betula pubescens) leaves versus imbalanced twigs+leaves across moose individuals indicated that macronutrient balancing may occur on as fine a scale as foraging bites on a single plant species. Utilized forages generally met the suggested requirement thresholds for the minerals calcium, phosphorus, copper, molybdenum, and magnesium but tended to be low in sodium. Our findings offer new insights into the foraging behavior of a model species in ungulate nutritional ecology and contribute to informed decision-making in wildlife and forest management.
   Understanding how the nutritional properties of food resources influence foraging decisions is crucial for wildlife management and conservation. Using a combination of camera collars with plant nutrient analyses and forage availability measurements, we show that moose used macronutrient balancing for tightly regulating their intake of protein to highly metabolizable macronutrients (non-structural carbohydrates and lipids) during summer. Our findings provide novel contributions to ungulate nutritional ecology and inform decision-making in wildlife and forest management.image

AB  - PremisePlants can limit the leaf tissue consumed by insect herbivores through chemical, structural, and nutritional leaf defenses or by escaping in space and time. Escaping is related to the phenological patterns of plants, which in turn respond to climatic factors. This study evaluated leaf production in a coastal plant community in southern Brazil to test the following hypotheses: (1) Leaves are continuously produced in this ecosystem, and (2) synchrony acts as an escape strategy from herbivory.MethodsWe evaluated leaf production patterns of 20 herbaceous, shrub, and tree species for 2 years using the Fournier index then measured leaf consumption in the second year. The Rayleigh test was used to verify the synchrony of phenological events. Correlations between leaf production and climatic factors and between leaf production synchrony and herbivory were analyzed.ResultsNew leaves were continuously produced at the plant community scale, but herbaceous and shrub species showed a phenological pattern distinct from that of tree species. Trees had peaks of synchrony in leaf production that were positively correlated with amount of leaf tissue consumed, refuting the hypothesis that synchrony acts as an escape strategy.ConclusionsThe phenological and herbivory patterns in this plant community may be due to the supply of resources in the soil and the composition of the insect community.

AB  - Mediterranean-climate oak woodlands, including those in North America and in the Mediterranean basin, are human-shaped ecosystems with high biodiversity value, which generate different ecosystem services, including grazing resources for livestock production. Low oak recruitment rates, however, are affecting the ecological sustainability of these ecosystems. Understanding the factors affecting recruitment dynamics in Mediterranean oak woodlands is crucial for adequately managing these ecosystems. We used a meta-analysis approach to evaluate the direct effects of ungulates on Mediterranean oak woodlands at various stages of recruitment, analysing publications based on ungulate exclusion experiments. The rela-tionship between ungulates and recruitment is complex, involving multiple interacting factors, but, with very few exceptions, studies reported substantial negative direct impacts. Our meta-analyses show that the odds of an acorn surviving are much lower when ungulates are present and that the impact of wild ungulates on acorn survival was more marked than that of domestic animals. Ungulates also reduce the recruitment rates of oak seedlings and saplings as well as their growth rates. Ungulate management is crucial to achieve adequate oak recruitment in Mediterranean oak woodlands. We suggest management practices that may contribute to reduce the effects of ungulates in oak recruitment and to ecologically sustainable Mediterranean oak woodlands.

AB  - Uncontrolled biological invasions are reducing freshwater ecosystem diversity and resilience. Research is needed to evaluate whether non-structural deterrents are feasible within lock or canal environments. This study examined common carp (Cyprinus carpio) and buffalo hybrid (Ictiobus) movement patterns in response to acoustic and stroboscopic deterrents. Twelve strobe lights and one underwater speaker were deployed across the centre of a ship slip, with an environment analogous to a navigation canal. Common carp (n = 6) and Ictiobus (n = 4) were implanted with acoustic telemetry tags, and their behaviours were examined under control, stroboscopic, and acoustic stimuli for 60-min trial periods. Trials were run during the day and night for six straight days. Linear models determined that the stroboscopic and acoustic stimuli altered fish positioning within the ship slip, but produced weaker avoidance responses than those observed elsewhere. Weak responses were likely due to a strong preference for the open end of the ship slip and a lack of acoustic refuge during the acoustic treatment. Avoidance responses also differed widely among individuals of the same species, with fish expressing repeatability of avoidance radius size across trials. Ambient and stimulus sound-pressure levels should be carefully considered when deploying acoustic deterrents.

AB  - Introduction With increasing human activities, the area affected by humans increases annually and many wild animals are under threat of extinction. On the other hand, there are serious conflicts between human and many wildlife. In order to mitigate conflicts, it is important to understand how animals perceive the balance of benefits and risks in human-inhabited areas and how they use the land. In this study, we investigated how African forest elephants (Loxodonta cyclotis), which are in serious conflict with humans, use anthropogenic environments by focusing on their trails.Methods This study targeted two parameters of anthropogenic environments: vegetation, particularly savannas, which have been maintained by human burning for many years, and population density, particularly in low-density seminatural land. Within Moukalaba-Doudou National Park, Gabon, and an adjacent village, we mapped elephant trails and compared their density and structure between vegetation (forest and savanna) and areas (inside and outside the national park).Results In the forest, only 31.4% of the elephant trails were well-established with exposed ground. In the savanna, the density of elephant trails was lower than that in the forest; however, the trails were narrower and 65% of the trails were well established. This suggests that elephants tend to follow specific routes in the savanna that may help them travel more easily, and that they are perceiving some risks. The density of elephant trails outside the national park was higher, and the trails were wider than those in the national park, suggesting frequent elephant use. This was probably due to the crop fields and mango trees attracting elephants.Discussion In the study area, available food may be a greater attractant to elephants relative to the risk of being threatened by humans. The findings show that elephant trail surveys can be carried out inexpensively over a short period of time. Moreover, they can clarify land use by elephant populations, including fine-scale heterogeneous movements.

AB  - Pronghorn (Antilocapra americana) are a grassland specialist that have experienced a >60% reduction in their historical range due to habitat fragmentation and encroachment of woody vegetation. Pronghorn populations are increasing in the Texas Panhandle despite conversion of grassland to cropland (27-43% of the regional landscape) and associated fragmentation. We hypothesized that pronghorn avoid cropland when selecting seasonal home ranges and avoid cropland within their home ranges. We captured 64 adult pronghorn of equal sex ratios in both the High Plains (n = 32) and Rolling Plains (n = 32) ecoregions of Texas, USA, during February 2017 and fitted them with iridium satellite global positioning system (GPS) collars. We collared 27 additional pronghorn in 2018 to account for mortalities and collar failures. We estimated resource selection functions for the High Plains and Rolling Plains populations using mixed-effects logistic regression at the home range (second order) and within home range (third order) scales separately for each ecoregion and season (fawning, summer, rut, and winter). Our hypothesis that pronghorn avoid cropland was supported in the Rolling Plains ecoregion at the home range scale; otherwise, cropland was inconsistently and seasonally important in resource selection. Furthermore, pronghorn often avoided paved roads more strongly than cropland. At the home range scale during 2017-2019, female pronghorn in the High Plains selected cropland during rut and winter. Males exhibited weak selection for cropland during rut. Within home ranges in the High Plains, female pronghorn avoided cropland during fawning in 2017, during rut in 2017 and 2018, and during winter 2019 but selected areas closer to cropland in winter 2017 and fawning 2018. Males selected areas farther from cropland during all sampling dates in 2017 and winter 2019. Avoidance and selection of cropland within home ranges also varied among seasons and years in the Rolling Plains. Overall, pronghorn avoided cropland when selecting home ranges in the Rolling Plains and cropland was otherwise inconsistently and only seasonally important in resource selection at the home range and within home range scales. We speculate that loss of pronghorn habitat to cropland in the High Plains and Rolling Plains of Texas may outweigh temporary nutritional benefits from seasonal use of crops.

AB  - The influence of climate on deep-time plant-insect interactions is becoming increasingly well known, with temperature, CO2 increases (and associated stoichiometric changes in plants), and aridity likely playing a critical role. In our modern climate, all three factors are shifting at an unprecedented rate, with uncertain consequences for biodiversity. To investigate effects of temperature, stoichiometry (specifically that of nitrogen), and aridity on insect herbivory, we explored insect herbivory in three modern floral assemblages and in 39 fossil floras, especially focusing on eight floras around a past hyperthermal event (the Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum) from Bighorn Basin (BB). We find that higher temperatures were associated with increased herbivory in the past, especially among BB sites. In these BB sites, non-N-2-fixing plants experienced a lower richness but higher frequency of herbivory damage than N-2-fixing plants. Herbivory frequency but not richness was greater in BB sites compared with contemporaneous, nearby, but less arid sites from Hanna Basin. Compared with deep-time environments, herbivory frequency and richness are higher in modern sites, suggesting that current accelerated warming uniquely impacts plant-insect interactions. Overall, our work addresses multiple aspects of climate change using fossil data while also contextualizing the impact of modern anthropogenic change on Earth's most diverse interactions.

AB  - Fungal endophytes are harboured in the leaves of every individual plant host and contribute to plant health, leaf senescence, and early decomposition. In grasslands, fungal endophytes and their hosts often coexist with large herbivores. However, the influence of grazing by large herbivores on foliar fungal endophyte communities remains largely unexplored. We conducted a long-term (18 yr) grazing experiment to explore the effects of grazing on the community composition and diversity of the foliar fungal endophytes of two perennial grassland species (i.e., Artemisia capillaris and Stipa bungeana) across one growing season. Grazing significantly increased the mean fungal alpha diversity of A. capillaris in the early season. In contrast, grazing significantly reduced the mean fungal alpha diversity of endophytic fungi of S. bungeana in the late season. Grazing, growing season, and their interactions concurrently structured the community composition of the foliar fungal endophytes of both plant species. However, growing season consistently outperformed grazing and environmental factors in shaping the community composition and diversity of both plant species. Overall, our findings demonstrate that the foliar endophytic fungal community diversity and composition differed in response to grazing between A. capillaris and S. bungeana during one growing season. The focus on this difference will enhance our understanding of grazing's impact on ecological systems and improve land management practices in grazing regions. This variation in the effects of leaf nutrients and plant community characteristics on foliar endophytic fungal community diversity and composition may have a pronounced impact on plant health and plant-fungal interactions.

AB  - Spatial and temporal patterns of benthic community structure play a crucial role in shaping reef habitats and have a direct impact on fish foraging dynamics, alongside density-dependent effects on the whole community. At isolated oceanic islands, the relatively low fish species richness often leads to the hyperdominance of a few species and a general reduced trophic redundancy. However, the influence of benthic habitat features and hyperdominant species on foraging selection at oceanic islands has been largely overlooked. We used remote underwater videos (RUVs) to investigate whether reef fishes consistently forage on specific habitats across 5 different oceanic islands in the Atlantic Ocean, especially focusing on the importance of the role of hyperdominant species. We analysed 295 RUVs, within 2 m2 areas (3-15 m deep), totalling 49 h of video. Photoquadrats were utilised to gauge benthic group coverage in the same habitats. Our results revealed 5 prevalent habitats and 6 fish trophic groups interacting with reef benthos. The intensity of feeding pressure varied across islands, depending on the diversity of habitats. Herbivores and omnivores exhibited the highest feeding pressure, with omnivores foraging on crustose coralline algae and macroalgae habitats, while herbivores primarily fed on habitats dominated by the epilithic algal matrix. Hyperdominant species forage in multiple habitats, indicating a comparatively high degree of dietary plasticity. Our findings also demonstrated that fish feeding pressure is influenced by both habitat features and fish biomass. Therefore, our study can provide valuable insights for prioritising the management of key species in isolated oceanic reefs.

AB  - We analyze the habitat factors that influence the site selection of the coastal chinchilla Chinchilla laniger for the establishment of colonies in Las Chinchillas National Reserve, Auco, Coquimbo Region, Chile. We used generalized linear models and a presence-absence design with logistic adjustment, considering the presence and absence of Puya berteroniana, rocky outcrops, altitude, slope, exposure, and both vertical and horizontal vegetation cover as explanatory variables. The model variables that would best explain the presence of chinchilla colonies in the Reserve would be the presence of puya, followed by altitude, presence of rocky outcrops, and vertical vegetation cover. The results indicate that when P. berteroniana is present, the probability of finding a chinchilla colony is 97% (95% CI = 56% -99%), which decreases to 23% (95% CI = 12% -39%) when this species of bromelaceae is not present in the habitat. The results suggest that C. laniger selects specific microhabitats within the heterogeneous environment of the semiarid landscape of the Las Chinchillas National Reserve.

AB  - Aboveground herbivores and belowground microbes have been interacting via terrestrial plants since their origins, but whether and how feeding guild affects root bacterial-fungal community structure, diversity, and co-occurrence patterns remains poorly understood. Here we examined the effect of chewing and sucking herbivory on bacterial and fungal communities in the root endosphere and rhizosphere, and further explored whether such effect was mediated by herbivoryinduced changes in plant performance. Our results show that chewing herbivory decreased fungal alpha diversity, while sucking herbivory increased the diversity. Chewing increased microbial competition and network complexity, whereas sucking showed the opposite effect. Moreover, chewing herbivory increased root-associated microbial community stability while sucking herbivory decreased it. Path analysis indicated that chewing and sucking herbivory affected root microbial diversity and co-occurrence network complexity and stability mainly through their influences on plant defense and associated plant growth impacts. Together, chewing and sucking herbivory showed distinct effect on root microbiota, and specific plant performance responses to the corresponding feeding guild may mediate these processes. These results have important implications for understanding the impact of aboveground herbivore diversity on belowground microbial community diversity, co-occurrence and ecosystem function.

AB  - The study aimed to investigate the role of small and isolated fragmented forests (SFFs) in the agricultural ecosystem by analyzing the characteristics of macro-moth communities. The alpha and beta diversities and the community structure of SFFs were compared to large and continuous forests (LCFs) within the same region. The diversity of moth families between the two forest types was also compared. The results showed that the moth assemblages were different between the two forests and had a significantly low diversity in SFFs compared to LCFs. The species richness and abundance of dominant families such as Geometridae, Erebidae, Noctuidae, Notodontidae, Nolidae, and Drepanidae also showed different patterns: the richness and abundance of most families were higher in continuous forests except Noctuidae that showed a higher diversity in the fragmented forest. The beta diversity of both forests was largely explained by the high turnover than nestedness. The study concluded that despite low species diversity, SFFs contributes to maintaining biodiversity in the agricultural landscape through their distinct moth assemblages and active dispersals.

AB  - Ecosystems are substantially changing in response to ongoing climate change. For example, coral reefs have declined in coral dominance, with some reefs undergoing regime shifts to non-coral states. However, reef responses may vary through multiple heat stress events, with the rarity of long-term ecological datasets rendering such understanding uncertain. Assessing coral reefs across the inner Seychelles islands using a 28-year dataset, we document faster coral recovery from the 2016 than the 1998 marine heatwave event. Further, compositions of benthic and fish communities were more resistant to change following the more recent heat stress, having stabilized in a persistent altered state, with greater herbivory, following the 1998 climate disturbance. Counter to predictions, a macroalgal-dominated reef that had regime-shifted following the 1998 disturbance is transitioning to a coral-dominated state following the 2016 heat stress. Collectively, these patterns indicate that reef systems may be more resilient to repeat heatwave events than anticipated.

AB  - Societal Impact Statement The primarily neotropical plant genus Heliconia has been cultivated commercially in gardens and nurseries for hundreds of years. Many of these same species are ecological keystones in their native habitats as important resources for herbivorous insects and pollinating hummingbirds, yet they face threats of habitat loss and degradation, competition with invasive species, poaching from the wild, and impacts of climate change. Only a handful have been assessed to date for their conservation status. We show that nearly half of the species are threatened with extinction, many are not protected, and conserving priority species may reduce overall threats to the genus.Summary Heliconia is a charismatic genus containing 181 neotropical species and six paleotropical species, which play critical ecological roles in natural habitats and are widely cultivated as ornamentals with significant horticultural value. To date little data on the conservation status of these species have been available. To conduct conservation assessments, specimen data were assembled from herbarium collections, species distributions were mapped across biomes and ecoregions, the extent of occurrence and area of occupancy were calculated, and land-cover vegetation loss from human activities was plotted. The number of botanical gardens holding ex situ specimens was also determined. Finally, phylogenomic patterns were used to evaluate the evolutionary conservation status across the genus. Eighty-seven species (47%) of Heliconia are threatened with extinction. Among threatened species, all but one are in five or fewer protected localities; most non-threatened species (61%) are in five or more protected localities. The majority of species maintained in ex situ collections (70 of 118 species) are of least conservation concern. Conservation status and protection are not evenly distributed with some evolutionary lineages more threatened and less protected than others. Previously less than 10% of Heliconia were in the IUCN Red List. Current results indicate that nearly half of species are threatened, but that many species are minimally protected through in situ and ex situ conservation. Forty-five species are considered top priorities for additional protection. Extinction threat also extends to major lineages within the genus. Recommendations are made to concentrate conservation efforts in specific lineages to insure the survival of Heliconia.

AB  - Wetland conversion threatens wetland specialists by reducing their core habitat. The sitatunga is a wetland specialist with declining populations. However, knowledge of sitatunga ecology and threats is limited, particularly outside protected areas. We examined sitatunga food sources, and habitat use in undisturbed Marshes and Marsh-Savannah transition blocks, and a Cultivated (disturbed) block in River Mayanja wetland, central Uganda. We recorded indirect indices and sightings of sitatunga along a 10 km transect in each block, and surveyed food sources in 34 plots along the transects. Our results indicate that the indices and sightings of Sitatunga had lower relative frequency in the Cultivated than in the Marshes and Marsh-Savannah transition blocks. Sitatunga feed on 39 plant species in 13 families and six growth forms; grasses, herbs, sedges, climbers, shrubs and water weeds. Cyperus papyrus, Echinochloa pyramidalis, Leersia hexandra accounted for 58% of sitatunga food sources. There were more individuals and species with Sitatunga feeding activity in the Marshes and Marsh-Savannah transition blocks than in the Cultivated block. Our results show that sitatunga habitat use and food sources are constrained in disturbed habitats while threats are intensified. To maintain wetland integrity and stability of sitatunga populations, stakeholders need to address wetland encroachment.

AB  - The spatial pattern of leaf stoichiometry is critical in predicting plant palatability and ecosystem productivity and nutrient cycling rates and thus is a major focus of community ecological research. Coastal wetlands as vital blue carbon ecosystems, with high possibility to be vulnerable to plant invasion, studies focused on stoichiometry and its pattern are important to unveil the elements cycling process. However, previous studies have mainly focused on stoichiometry in terrestrial ecosystems, there are few studies conducted on coastal wetland ecosystems, especially the studies that compare leaf stoichiometry between native and non-native plants in coastal wetlands. In this study, we compared the latitudinal patterns of leaf nutrient contents and their stoichiometric ratios between native and non-native plant species across coastal wetland ecosystems and investigated whether leaf stoichiometric patterns were driven by climatic factors. We used a compiled global data set of 954 records to conduct a systematic meta-analysis. The results showed that there were significant differences in latitudinal patterns of leaf carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) contents and C:N ratio between native and non-native species, as well as significant differences in leaf C, N, and phosphorus (P) contents. For native species, we found significant latitudinal patterns in leaf C, N, and P contents and C:N and C:P ratios, whereas for non-native species, we found significant latitudinal patterns in leaf N content and C:P and N:P ratios. Mean annual temperature of the data collection site was a significant predictor of leaf stoichiometry of native plants but only of leaf N content and C:P ratio of non-native plants. Thus, we demonstrated spatial heterogeneity in leaf stoichiometries between native and non-native plants in coastal wetlands, indicating that such differences should be emphasized in future biogeochemical models and plant-herbivore interaction studies owing to the important role of wetland plants in global C, N, and P cycles. Our findings increase understanding of plant-related nutrient and elements cycling in coastal wetlands, as well as improve predictions of plant growth rates and vegetation productivity across large scales under plant invasion scenarios.

AB  - Lowland grassy woodlands in Australia's south-east face reductions in native plant diversity because of invasion by non-native plants. We compared the relative abundance and diversity of plant species among sites dominated by the native Kangaroo grass (KG) Themeda triandra with sites co-dominated by the non-native African lovegrass (ALG) Eragrostis curvula and KG. We found significant differences in plant species composition depending on the dominant species. Furthermore, our results revealed differences in several diversity parameters such as a lower species richness and forb diversity on sites co-dominated by ALG and KG. This was the case despite the functional similarity of both ALG and KG-both C-4 perennial tussock grasses of a similar height. Therefore, our results highlight the critical function of the native KG in maintaining and enhancing the target plant species composition and diversity within these grassy woodlands. Herbivore grazing potentially impacts on the abundance of the dominant grass and forb species in various ways, but its impact likely differs depending on their evolutionary origin. Therefore, disentangling the role of individual herbivore groups (native-, non-native mammals, and invertebrates) on the plant community composition of the lowland grassy woodlands is essential to find appropriate grazing regimes for ALG management in these ecosystems.

AB  - Terrestrial soils in forested landscapes represent some of the largest mercury (Hg) reserves globally. Wildfire can alter the storage and distribution of terrestrial-bound Hg via reemission to the atmosphere or mobilization in watersheds where it may become available for methylation and uptake into food webs. Using data associated with the 2007 Moonlight and Antelope Fires in California, we examined the long-term direct effects of wildfire burn severity on the distribution and magnitude of Hg concentrations in riparian food webs. Additionally, we quantified the cross-ecosystem transfer of Hg from aquatic invertebrate to riparian bird communities; and assessed the influence of biogeochemical, landscape variables, and ecological factors on Hg concentrations in aquatic and terrestrial food webs. Benthic macroinvertebrate methylmercury (MeHg) and riparian bird blood total mercury (THg) concentrations varied by 710- and 760-fold, respectively, and Hg concentrations were highest in predators. We found inconsistent relationships between Hg concentrations across and within taxa and guilds in response to stream chemical parameters and burn severity. Macroinvertebrate scraper MeHg concentrations were influenced by dissolved organic carbon (DOC); however, that relationship was moderated by burn severity (as burn severity increased the effect of DOC declined). Omnivorous bird Hg concentrations declined with increasing burn severity. Overall, taxa more linked to in situ energetic pathways may be more responsive to the biogeochemical processes that influence MeHg cycling. Remarkably, 8 years post-fire, we still observed evidence of burn severity influencing Hg concentrations within riparian food webs, illustrating its overarching role in altering the storage and redistribution of Hg and influencing biogeochemical processes.

AB  - In this study, the long-term restoration success of calcareous grasslands was investigated using a functional trait approach. The study site is located in the Swabian Alb, Germany, where a former calcareous grassland patch was restored in the 1990s by clearance of a spruce (Picea abies (L.) H. Karst.) afforestation and subsequent reintroduction of sheep grazing as mobile dispersal vector. Vegetation development was monitored over a period of 25 years, both on the restored and an adjacent never afforested ancient grassland which is still managed by traditional sheep grazing. Changes in the functional composition of fifteen ecological meaningful traits were investigated by comparing the respective attribute expressions of the restored with the ancient reference grassland for each year of observation. A RLQ-analysis was conducted in order to identify plant functional groups. The comparison of attribute expressions showed that differences between restored and ancient grassland decreased rapidly over time. The greatest differences were found in persistence-related traits (e.g., life span and growth form) while dispersal- and establishmentrelated traits recovered faster. The clustering of plant functional groups showed similarities with Grime's CSR-strategy, as cluster analysis grouped species with either ruderal, competitive or stress-tolerant trait attributes. 20 years after restoration, stress-tolerators dominated, while the ruderal cluster could not longer be detected and only a small group of competitive, mostly woody species remained. In 2018, RLQ analysis revealed no differences in the functional composition between restored and ancient grassland. The quick functional recovery is most likely attributed to the reestablishment of the traditional low-intensive grazing management but also to the close vicinity of the ancient grassland as no spatial isolation prevented dispersal of plant species. Hence, the functional trait approach showed that restoration by clearance and subsequent sheep grazing was a suitable management in our study.

AB  - The infestation of ectoparasites poses a severe problem in animal breeding, severely affecting animal health and causing substantial economic losses. However, limited information is available regarding lice infestations in plateau livestock. To address this, we collected and examined lice samples from Tibetan yaks, pigs and sheep, amplifying the rrnS and cox1 genes for evolutionary analysis. The results revealed that the prevalence of lice was 51.3% (95% CI: 44.0-58.6%) in yaks, Tibetan sheep and Tibetan pigs, with regional prevalence ranging from 7.7% to 67.5%. Morphometric analysis showed that female lice were bigger than male lice. In Tibetan pigs, females exhibited a prominent longer body length (p < 0.05), belly length (p < 0.01) and body length to body width ratio (p < 0.05). In yaks, females had longer body length (p < 0.01) and body width (p < 0.05). For Tibetan sheep, female lice had larger body length (p < 0.001), body width (p < 0.001), head length (p < 0.05) and belly length (p < 0.05). Additionally, molecular identification revealed that lice infesting wild and domestic yaks were Linognathus vituli with 96.59-98.78% (wild yaks) and 96.33-98.71% (yaks) similarity to the OL677823.1 isolate. Lice infesting Tibetan sheep were identified as Linognathus africanus, showing 99.02-99.76% similarity to the OP948898.1 isolate. Lice from Tibetan pigs were identified as Haematopinus apri, with 96.38-98.31% similarity to the ON000922.1 isolate. Moreover, cox1 gene analysis of lice from Tibetan pigs showed 96.97-97.72% similarity to the KC814616.1 isolate. It is concluded that these findings could provide valuable insights into the prevention and control of lice-related diseases in plateau animals, enhancing animal health and mitigating economic losses.

AB  - Recovering species are often managed in small numbers, requiring management strategies that maintain genetic variation for long-term viability. Here, we evaluate the genetic outcomes of two restored American bison (Bison bison) populations 15 generations after its reintroduction as Colorado's first wildlife reintroduction. After initial reintroduction in 1914 to Genesee park, the herd was split into two separate populations in 1938. To determine the genetic viability of the restored populations, we genotyped 36 individuals from both herds, analyzing 52 microsatellite markers to asses heterozygosity, allelic richness, inbreeding, and population structure. Both herds exhibit relatively high observed heterozygosity (Genesee: 0.775 sd = 0.183; Daniels: 0.781 sd = 0.178), high allelic richness (Genesee: 5.17 sd = 1.45; Daniels: 4.96 sd = 1.46), and negative FIS values (Genesee: -0.112 bootstraps = -0.158, -0.065; Daniels: -0.15, bootstraps = -0.191, -0.108), indicating a lack of inbreeding. Despite ongoing gene flow, the herds remain genetically distinct, as supported by pairwise FST (0.0354, bootstraps = 0.024, 0.046), Nei's D (0.136), and AMOVA results (FST = 0.078, p = 0.001). STRUCTURE analysis further confirmed that the herds maintain genetic clustering despite some admixture. These results suggest that Denver Mountain Parks' long-term management strategies - promoting controlled gene flow while preventing inbreeding - have been effective in maintaining genetic variation. Intentional individual movement between herds and introductions from external metapopulations have contributed to the long-term viability of these herds. This study highlights the success of small, intensively managed bison populations in maintaining genetic health over many generations and underscores the importance of gene flow strategies in wildlife restoration.

AB  - Forests in the western US have undergone a profound transformation over the last 100 years due to chronic fire suppression and a cycle of extensive timber harvest followed by little silvicultural activity. Forested landscapes in this region are now dominated by intermediate age, denser stands of coniferous trees that reduce transmission of light and precipitation to the understory, with potential consequences for ungulate nutrition. We used a 20-year dataset of mule deer locations (560 animal-years of data) to evaluate long-term patterns of selection of forest stands that had been thinned and burned compared to untreated reference stands. We evaluated within homerange (3rd order) selection at 3 temporal scales (hourly, daily, annually) and landscape-scale (2nd order) use annually. We found that annual selection of treated stands during summer generally increased with two peaks, once immediately after treatments were applied and again 15 years later. Mule deer also showed strong seasonal and temporal patterns in selection of treated forest stands. Deer selected treated stands at night in July and August immediately after treatments. After 4-6 years, mule deer selected treated stands both during the day and at night in May, July, and August, but with stronger selection at night. We hypothesize that preference for treated forest stands were driven by differences in forage quantity and quality among forest stands. Vegetation surveys during years of peak selection showed that treated stands had significantly higher biomass and digestible energy of neutrally selected forage and lower biomass of avoided forage species, although there was no difference in biomass of preferred forage species. A subset of female mule deer with multiple years of data did not shift home ranges to overlap with treated forest stands over time (2nd order use) but did show increasing selection over time for treated forest stands within their home ranges (3rd order). Our results show that thinning and burning of forest stands can benefit mule deer both immediately and for up to 15 years after treatment and that researchers should evaluate temporal and seasonal patterns in studies of habitat selection. Given the diverse habitat needs of mule deer, treatments would be most beneficial if they were scattered across large landscapes and staggered in time to provide a diversity of forage and cover types.

AB  - Movement is a fundamental aspect of animal ecology that varies across space, time, and among individuals or groups within a population. Broad-scale patterns of animal movement are often classified into different movement strategies, such as resident, nomadic, or migratory. While landscape-level environmental patterns can predict the presence of different movement strategies in an area, elucidating how these patterns downscale to fine-scale resource selection behaviors remains a challenge. Partially migratory systems, where both migrants and residents coexist, offer a unique opportunity to address these questions. Using tracking data from four Rocky Mountain elk (Cervus canadensis) herds situated primarily within Colorado, USA, we assessed between-herd, seasonal, and within-herd variation in resource selection behavior. We modeled fine-scale seasonal resource selection and compared strategy-specific behaviors using resource selection functions. Additionally, we used a consistency score to quantify the extent of differentiation in resource selection behavior across strategies, seasons, herds, and groups of covariates. We found variation in strategy frequency within each herd and in selection behavior, highlighting the complexity and context-dependence of strategy-specific selection. Despite herd-specific differences, some consistent trends emerged, with elk avoiding human development and roads at fine scales while selecting areas with higher productivity during summer. Our consistency analysis identified where elk most diverged in their selection behavior, revealing the greatest differences among herds, followed by variation between seasons, and lastly between movement strategies. Elk exhibited more uniform responses to productivity, contrasting with greater differentiation in responses to anthropogenic-related covariates. Overall, our study improves our understanding of elk behavior across space, time, and movement strategies and sheds light on the hierarchical influences of space and time in constraining behavior.

AB  - Coprophagy, the eating of feces, has been documented in a wide range of species but appears to be rare or difficult to detect in deer (Cervidae). Here, we report the first observation of coprophagy in moose Alces alces, which was recorded using camera collars on free-ranging moose in Norway. The footage shows an instance of allocoprophagy by an adult female moose in spring (May). We summarize the current knowledge about coprophagy in deer and briefly discuss potential drivers and possible implications for disease transmission. Further research is needed to determine whether coprophagy occurs frequently in moose and whether this behavior is positive (e.g., increased intake of nutrients) or negative (increased infection by parasites or pathogens).

AB  - Alpine grasslands are sensitive to grazing and atmospheric nitrogen (N) deposition. Despite increases in N deposition, few field studies have assessed the effects of grazing in conjunction with increased N deposition on alpine grassland vegetation. In this two-year field study, we examined the effects of overgrazing and overgrazing plus N deposition on ecophysiological processes of alpine grassland plants at the functional group level. We found that both overgrazing and overgrazing plus N deposition altered species composition and the dominance of three plant functional groups (grasses, sedges, and forbs) in an alpine meadow and alpine steppe. In the overgrazing and overgrazing plus N deposition treatments, forbs dominated the plant community. Grass and sedge dominance decreased substantially, relative to a ungrazed treatment. The underlying eco-physiological processes that led to the forb-dominated plant community differed between the overgrazing and overgrazing plus N deposition treatments. Overgrazing plus N deposition increased forb dominance both directly by selective herbivory and indirectly by enhancing forb photosynthetic rates. Our results suggest that overgrazing concomitant with increases in N deposition will likely shift the plant community composition of alpine grasslands on the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau from grass/sedge communities to forb-dominated communities in the future.

AB  - Cortisol is the main glucocorticoid hormone commonly measured to assess adrenocortical activity in vertebrates in response to potential stressors. Competition and habitat quality may act as chronic stressors leading to an increase in cortisol accumulation. Moreover, chronic cortisol concentrations may seriously hamper the reproductive potential, health status and body condition of a species. Using hair collected from the rump of 88 adult roadkill roe deer Capreolus capreolus in the north-eastern Italy, we aimed to assess the effect of both ungulate competitor population densities and habitat suitability on the long-term physiological stress response of roe deer, using hair cortisol as a reference parameter. Our findings revealed that roe deer showed higher cortisol concentrations in response to higher red deer Cervus elaphus population density, most likely as a consequence of direct interspecific competition. No significant cortisol changes were however recorded in response to both wild boar Sus scrofa and roe deer population densities, probably as a result of reduced competition because of abundant feeding resources, different species population densities and spatial/temporal avoidance among species. Moreover, the absence of a significant effect as far as habitat suitability is concerned, suggest that roe deer are well adapted to live even in poor quality habitats most likely as long as they are close to better quality habitats which provide access to food resources and refuge sites. Our results highlight the importance of hair cortisol as a suitable parameter to assess physiological chronic stress response towards different environmental/ecological conditions.

AB  - Forest and wildlife management can help regulate the risk of human exposure to tick-borne pathogens by influencing the population density of host-seeking ticks and the pathogen infection prevalence in tick populations. For the blacklegged tick (Ixodes scapularis), also known as the deer tick, the overall density of host-seeking nymphs and the density of nymphs infected with Borrelia burgdorferi sensu stricto (which causes Lyme disease) are often closely and positively correlated. We sought to identify biotic and abiotic factors influencing nymph abundance in a multiscale assessment within and across forested landscapes in northern Wisconsin. On a set of randomly located plots within each of six mesic, hardwood-dominated forests, we collected host-seeking and on-host ticks, observed two common mammal hosts (white-tailed deer and mice), and characterized the structure and composition of the forest plant community. We also surveyed activity of exotic invasive earthworms, which are altering forest structure in the region. At the broader forest-level scale (n = 6), nymphal tick abundance was positively related to deer population density after accounting for the negative influence of forb cover. At the finer plot-level scale (n = 87), nymph abundance was positively correlated with the abundance of coarse woody debris and negatively correlated with the density of earthworm castings, an indicator of Lumbricid (nightcrawler) activity. Thus, we identified a suite of key factors, operating at different spatial scales, that shape the suitability of forest habitat for questing immature ticks. These findings inform our basic understanding of blacklegged tick ecology and also have important implications for managing tick-borne pathogens in forest ecosystems and landscapes.

AB  - Citrus greening disease (CGD), also known as Huanglongbing in China, is caused by the endophytic bacterium 'Candidatus Liberibacter asiaticus' and poses a severe threat to the global citrus industry. The disease affects microbial communities in leaves, stems, roots, and soil. Soil nematodes, which occupy multiple trophic levels, play crucial roles in nutrient cycling, pest regulation, and plant-soil interactions. However, the impact of CGD on soil nematode community structure and energy flow remains unclear. This study examined the effects of different levels of CGD infection on soil nematode communities and energy dynamics. Three infection levels were selected: control (healthy plants with no yellowing symptoms), mild infection (<= 50% leaf yellowing), and severe infection (entire canopy affected). The results showed that increasing CGD severity significantly reduced the nematode abundance, community structure index, and total energy flux by 94.2%, 86.7%, and 93.5%, respectively, in the severely infected group. Both mild and severe infections resulted in a higher proportion of bacterivorous nematodes compared to the control. Moreover, herbivorous energy flux was significantly reduced by 99.2% in the severe infection group, suggesting that herbivorous endophytic nematodes are particularly sensitive to CGD. The total energy flux through nematode food web, the energy flux through fungal or herbivorous channels, and the energy flow uniformity were positively correlated with the nematode structure index but negatively correlated with the nematode richness and evenness indices. Furthermore, the reduction in soil resource input (especially total nitrogen and total carbon) caused by CGD was the primary driver of the changes in nematode communities and energy flows. These findings highlight the destructive effects of CGD on soil ecosystems through bottom-up control. The CGD-induced obstruction of photosynthate transport primarily impacts phytophagous organisms and could also influence other trophic levels. To mitigate these effects and ensure healthy citrus production, future research should focus on early detection and effective CGD management strategies.

AB  - The settlement of Iceland is known to have had profound impacts on vegetation and landscape stability, but there remain uncertainties around the spatial variability and timing of environmental change, and the impacts of settlement on aquatic ecosystems. Here a new multiproxy palaeoenvironmental reconstruction spanning the last 3000 years is presented from Kalmanstjorn, a small lake in Myvatnssveit, northeast Iceland. Sedimentology, pollen and non-pollen palynomorphs, and geochemical proxies, dated using tephrochronology, are used to reconstruct terrestrial vegetation, landscape stability and aquatic ecosystems. The data reveal complex environmental dynamics after settlement. At this site, substantial tree populations persisted until the late 15th century, in strong contrast to the rapid deforestation shown by almost all other records from Iceland. The eventual loss of woodland may have been caused by changes in direct human activity and the location of extensive grazing, in combination with Little Ice Age climatic cooling. The loss of woodland was accompanied by increased soil erosion. Conversely, the lake ecosystem showed an immediate response to settlement, becoming more productive for several centuries, perhaps in response to increased availability of nutrients from grazing herbivores. The late persistence of woodland in the Kalmanstjorn record adds to our understanding of the spatial variations in ecosystem responses to settlement in Iceland, while the evidence for decoupling of the aquatic and terrestrial systems suggests that palaeolimnological reconstructions focusing on aquatic ecosystem responses may be important new sources of information on the wider ecological consequences of human settlement.

AB  - Vegetation properties can be assessed through analysis of canopy reflectance spectra. Early techniques relied on simple two-band vegetation indices (VIs) that exploit leaf reflectance properties at key wavelengths. As the technology matures it is now possible to gather and test hyperspectral data. Little evidence exists on how different management regimes, such as nutrient addition, might affect hyperspectral reflectance and thus influence derived estimates of plant diversity and productivity. At a grassland experiment in southern England, we used a portable spectroradiometer to sample 96 plots exposed to multifactorial treatments combining herbivory, plant competition, soil pH and fertility. Our objective was to compare the predictive performance of popular twoband VIs with a multivariate partial least square regression (PLSR) model that uses all available wavelengths. We found that the PLSR models showed higher predictive power than the best performing VIs - that was especially true for our measure of species diversity (R2 cv = 0.36 compared with a Pearson correlation of 0.21). The predictive power for our PLSR model of biomass (R2 cv = 0.54) compares favourably with values reported in earlier grassland studies. These results confirm that hyperspectral measurement combined with multivariate regression techniques is a promising approach for monitoring grassland properties. There is evidence of particular benefit in capturing narrow bands associated with the red edge region of the spectrum (700-750 nm). Remotely sensed hyperspectral images at a fine spatial scale offer the prospect for matching with sampling units as small as the 2 x 2 m nutrient subplots measured here.

AB  - Fire regimes and herbivore densities have in parts of the boreal been heavily impacted by human activities with consequences for vegetation, forage supply and ungulate use. In this study, we evaluate the effects of natural wildfires and prescribed burning on moose forage availability, use, and browsing in northern Sweden. We studied three wildfire locations, adjacent controls, and five prescribed burns 12 years after fire. To compare forage availability and browsing levels we combined related variables with Principal Component Analyses and used the first axis in a regression analysis. The wildfire locations had a different composition of forage compared with the controls with less forage in the field layer and more woody browse and deciduous saplings. Forage availability was best explained by the occurrence of fire and differed between wildfire and the unburned control areas. Browsing levels were higher in wildfire locations compared with unburned controls. Prescribed burns varied substantially and could resemble both unburnt control and wildfire in terms of forage availability and browsing. We conclude that prescribed burning as a restoration action potentially can improve forage availability, particularly of deciduous species, if they mimic the impact of wildfires in terms of larger area burned and high fire severity.

AB  - Ash disease caused by ascomycete fungus Hymenoscyphus fraxineus leads to the retreat of ash, particularly in ashdominated stands characterized by moist, fertile, and neutral soils. Thus, it has a more severe impact on species regeneration and survival in ash optimal sites. We aimed to investigate the joint effects of seed dispersal limitation triggered by the distance from seed source, as well as soil fertility, browsing, and understory vegetation on ash natural regeneration in optimal and neighboring suboptimal sites. We examined ash regeneration within 40 circular plots (25 m2) in Western Poland along soil fertility gradient and increasing distance from seed source (0-100 m). We confirmed the seed dispersal limitation of ash regeneration. We found that the increase of distance from seed source increases ash natural regeneration (both of <0.6 and 0.6-1.3 m height) survival by escaping distance-dependent mortality, referring to the Janzen-Connell effect. Moreover, soil drivers i.e. groundwater table level, CaCO3, and soil C:N influenced ash regeneration damage rate. Furthermore, we indicated that light availability can enhance ash regeneration. We found the highest browsing in sites with the highest ash natural regeneration density. Understory species composition was related to ash regeneration density, browsing, and damage proportion, indicating that species typical of mesic broadleaved forests can be considered as positive indicators of the ash regeneration niche. In conclusion, we state that suboptimal sites can act as refugees for ash, helping this species to persist over ash dieback. Therefore, we recommend broadening the scope of ash conservation and silviculture into suboptimal sites, that can host ash regeneration and allow it to emerge and reproduce. Such sites in the neighborhood of typical ash sites damaged by H. fraxineus can in the future serve as seed sources for forest regeneration and improve the resilience of the forest ecosystem.

AB  - Many large ungulate species, including the banteng (Bos javanicus), are on the verge of extinction. Mae Wong National Park in Thailand was once a haven for banteng due to its abundance of preferred habitat, but the species was extirpated in the 1970s due to logging and hunting, before park designation. Mae Wong is connected with Huai Kha Khaeng Wildlife Sanctuary (HKK), which retains the largest banteng population remaining in Thailand. In 2019, Mae Wong park rangers reported suspected banteng footprints near HKK. We used camera traps to verify the presence of banteng and determine their population structure and activity pattern. We observed at least nine individual bantengs (range 1-7 each month) during the 15-month survey, including three adult males, two adult females, three juveniles, and 1 calf. Solitary males and herds (up to five animals) were observed, reflecting typical social structure. Banteng were detected throughout the survey and across all seasons, suggesting a resident population. Our research confirms the return of banteng to Mae Wong after an absence of over 40 years. The banteng likely dispersed from HKK, emphasizing the importance of landscape connectivity and source sites for recovery of endangered species. Though still small, the Mae Wong population is breeding, which is significant for future population recovery. Protection, community outreach, and habitat management can help secure this population. As banteng is the preferred food of tigers, their recovery will benefit tiger conservation in Mae Wong as well.

AB  - Habitat selection has a significant influence on animals' fitness, and has been well studied in various ungulates. A trade-off between the access to forage and to shelter often occurs for ungulates' habitat selections, which vary temporally. However, habitat selections for primitive ungulates with solitary and sedentary, such as the Japanese serow (Capricornis crispus), are poorly known. We examined habitat selection at the within-home range scale of the Japanese serow in a montane forest of Mt. Asama, central Japan, at two temporal scales, season and time of day (day or night), by radio-tracking. Serows selected shrub-rich habitats with steep slopes and avoided shrub-poor habitats with gentle slopes, and their selection showed little variation according to season. Shrub-rich habitats with steep slopes provide both abundant food and shelter against potential danger, which suggests that it is an adequate habitat for serows throughout the year. The habitat selection of serows had few differences according to time of day, which suggests that shrub-rich habitats with steep slopes are suitable for both feeding and resting (i.e., all times of day). Our results suggest that trade-offs between the access to forage and to shelter may be less likely to occur for serow's habitat selection, unlike other ungulates.

AB  - Environmental conditions change rapidly along elevational gradients and have been found to affect community composition in macroscopic taxa, with lower diversity typically observed at higher elevations. In contrast, microbial community responses to elevation are still poorly understood. Specifically, the effects of elevation on vector-associated microbiota have not been studied to date, even though the within-vector microbial community is known to influence vector competence for a range of zoonotic pathogens. Here we characterize the structure and diversity of the bacterial microbiota in an important zoonotic disease vector, the sheep tick Ixodes ricinus, along replicated elevational gradient (630-1673 m) in the Swiss Alps. 16S rRNA sequencing of the whole within-tick bacterial microbiota of questing nymphs and adults revealed a decrease in Faith's phylogenetic microbial alpha diversity with increasing elevation, while beta diversity analyses revealed a lower variation in microbial community composition at higher elevations. We also found a higher microbial diversity later in the season and significant differences in microbial diversity among tick life stages and sexes, with lowest microbial alpha diversity observed in adult females. No associations between tick genetic diversity and bacterial diversity were observed. Our study demonstrates systematic changes in tick bacterial microbiota diversity along elevational gradients. The observed patterns mirror diversity changes along elevational gradients typically observed in macroscopic taxa, and they highlight the key role of environmental factors in shaping within-host microbial communities in ectotherms.

AB  - Sagami Bay is among the most surveyed areas in Japan and the northwestern Pacific for marine biodiversity, partly owing to collecting efforts by the Showa Emperor, Hirohito. It was also here that the first chemosynthesis-based community was found in Japan, in the Off Hatsushima hydrocarbon seep site dominated by large vesicomyid clams. Nevertheless, new discoveries continue to be made in the deep. Here, we report observations of rare bathyal gastropods from unusual habitats. From the Off Hatsushima seep, the calliostomatid snail Otukaia kiheiziebisu was found living on tubeworm, the second record of the family from seeps. The cocculinid limpet Cocculina tenuitesta, previously only known from Suruga Bay, was found on a piece of branch-like plant debris inside the actively seeping clam field. This supports the step-wise evolutionary scenario from organic falls to hot vents recently suggested for this family. The predatory naticid snail Cryptonatica affinis represents the second record for the family at seeps, and we also show the first evidence for naticids feeding on chemosymbiotic clams-a phenomenon formerly only known from fossil seeps. We also found live individuals of Provanna stephanos, hitherto known from just two empty shells. Outside the seep area, the lepetid true limpet Sagamilepeta sagamiensis was found living on plastic debris, highlighting the function of plastic in the deep sea as settlement substrates among the muddy expanse. Our observations here have ecological and evolutionary implications, underscoring how much remains to be learned from the deep sea, even in well-studied areas like Sagami Bay.

In fact, the use of species distribution models as input allowed to create spatial decision-support maps. Of special interest are maps of potential biodiversity (MPB), which define distribution and ecological requirements of relevant species and maps of priority conservation areas (MPCA), which define priority areas considering endemism and richness. The objective of this paper was to assess multi-taxon biodiversity based on two different spatial analyses and to test their efficiency to support conservation decision at Patagonia. We computed 119 potential habitat suitability maps (one deer, birds, lizards, darkling-beetles, plants) with ENFA (Environmental Niche Factor Analysis) and 15 environmental variables, using Biomapper software. ENFA calculate two ecological indexes (marginality and specialization) which describe the narrowness of species niches and how extreme are the optimum environmental conditions related to the whole study area. These maps were combined obtaining a MPB and MPCA using Zonation software. Multivariate analyses were performed to compare methodologies, analysing environmental variables, ecological areas, forest types and protected areas. Multivariate and ecological indexes showed that deer, lizards and darkling-beetles presented a narrow range, while birds and plants presented a large range of marginality and specialization mainly related to vegetation and climate. At provincial level, highest potential biodiversity and conservation priority values were related to shrublands and humid steppes. However, MPCA showed higher values related to forests and alpine vegetation due to endemism, while MPB showed differences among forest types. These analyses showed that the most valuable areas were not represented in the protected areas, however, many higher conservation priority values were found inside the protected compared with unprotected areas. Different spatial decision-support maps presented similar outputs at provincial scale, but differed in the forest landscape matrix. Both methodologies can be used to plan conservation strategies depending on the specific objectives (e.g. highlighting richness or endemism).

AB  - Given the rate of biodiversity loss, there is an urgent need to understand community-level responses to extirpation events, with two prevailing hypotheses. On one hand, the loss of an apex predator leads to an increase in primary prey species, triggering a trophic cascade of other changes within the community, while density compensation and ecological release can occur because of reduced competition for resources and absence of direct aggression. White-lipped peccary (Tayassu pecari-WLP), a species that typically co-occurs with collared peccary (Pecari tajacu), undergo major population crashes-often taking 20 to 30-years for populations to recover. Using a temporally replicated camera trapping dataset, in both a pre- and post- WLP crash, we explore how WLP disappearance alters the structure of a Neotropical vertebrate community with findings indicative of density compensation. White-lipped peccary were the most frequently detected terrestrial mammal in the 2006-2007 pre-population crash period but were undetected during the 2019 post-crash survey. Panthera onca (jaguar) camera trap encounter rates declined by 63% following the WLP crash, while collared peccary, puma (Puma concolor), red-brocket deer (Mazama americana) and short-eared dog (Atelocynus microtis) all displayed greater encounter rates (490%, 150%, 280%, and 500% respectively), and increased in rank-abundance. Absence of WLP was correlated with ecological release changes in habitat-use for six species, with the greatest increase in use in the preferred floodplain habitat of the WLP. Surprisingly, community-weighted mean trait distributions (body size, feeding guild and nocturnality) did not change, suggesting functional redundancy in diverse tropical mammal assemblages.

AB  - Alberta's forests are becoming increasingly disturbed and fragmented by the cumulative effects of anthropogenic disturbances exacerbated by the enduring footprint of seismic lines on the landscape. Forest harvesting and subsequent reforestation activities (e.g., site preparation and tree planting) may facilitate tree growth on seismic lines when forestry companies incorporate them into management areas. In this study, forest regeneration was assessed along transects on and off seismic lines within four cutblocks in northwestern Alberta. Tree, sapling, and shrub characteristics were measured, and tree cookies from a subset of trees on and off seismic lines were used to model height growth. No difference in total tree, sapling, or shrub counts on and off seismic lines was found although trees on seismic lines were growing at slightly slower rates compared to the adjacent cutblock, and Alnus viridis was more abundant on seismic lines. Our results suggest that, despite some species-level differences and modest differences in tree growth rates, trees on seismic lines within cutblocks are regenerating similarly to other trees growing in the post-harvest stand. These findings indicate that forest harvesting, and subsequent reforestation, could represent an important tool in conducting landscape-level restoration in mixedwood forests where seismic lines have not naturally recovered.

AB  - Environmental conditions and resource availability shape population dynamics through direct and indirect effects of climate, biological interactions and the human modification of landscape. Even when a species seems dependent on predictable anthropogenic food resources or subsidies, ecosystem-level factors can still determine population dynamics across taxa. However, there is still a knowledge gap about the cascade effects driven by climate, vegetation functioning, resource availability and governmental policies on key aspects of species reproduction for top scavengers. Here we put to good use 22 years (2000-2021) of extensive population monitoring from the endemic Canary Egyptian vulture (Neophron percnopterus majorensis) on the Fuerteventura Island (Canary Islands, Spain) to study the relative importance of demographic factors, ecosystem conditions and availability of anthropogenic food sources on breeding success. Our results suggest that ecosystem-level primary productivity, the number of livestock animals present on the island and Density-dependent processes determine the temporal changes in the breeding success of this species. We firstly accounted for a top-down effect of livestock on island vegetation, where overgrazing directly reduces landscape-level vegetation biomass. We, consequently, found a bottom-up effect between vegetation and the Egyptian vulture's breeding success. In this context, minimal changes in ecological conditions can impact the species inhabiting these ecosystems, with direct consequences on a key population stage, such as breeding season, when energy requirements are higher. These results are especially relevant because cascading and indirect effects of ecosystem processes and governmental policies are often overlooked when pursuing conservation goals of endangered species.

AB  - Introduction. Tuberculosis (TB) is a widespread disease known to affect livestock and wildlife, as well as humans. However, its incidence in wildlife remains poorly recognized on the global level. In Europe, the majority of TB cases have been confirmed in red deer, badgers and wild boar. Objective. The aim of the study was to examine the occurrence of TB in Cervidae in Poland, in areas where TB has been detected in cattle and wildlife. Materials and method Head and thoracic lymph nodes were collected from a total of 76 free-living red deer (Cervus elaphus) and roe deer (Capreolus capreolus), from nine Polish provinces during a single hunting season (autumn - winter 2018-19). Samples were subjected to conventional microbiological procedures to isolate mycobacteria. Results. No Mycobacteria was isolated in the material collected from red or roe deer. Conclusions. There is a need to continue monitoring the presence of TB in cattle and other animal species to ensure the protection of public health.

AB  - Fire and grazing in forest ecosystems modify the characteristics of plant communities, favoring colonization by sprouting shrub species. These shrubs may offer protection and facilitate greater survival in slow-growing spe-cies, which are less tolerant of biotic and abiotic stressors. The objective of this study was to evaluate Nothofagus antarctica seedling performance (survival, morphology, water potential, and biomass) under the influence of Berberis microphylla shrubs in sites with different grazing use intensities in burned forests in Tierra del Fuego, Argentina. For that, four treatment were established: N. antarctica seedlings planted a) with fence-under shrub b) with fence-outside shrub c) without fence-under shrub d) without fence-outside shrub. Edaphoclimatic condi-tions were measured inside and outside the shrub at the beginning of the experiment and seedling's performance was measured each summer from 2018 to 2020. Results showed that B. microphylla created favorable edapho-climatic condition under its canopy. There was lower soil bulk density, cover of bare soil, PAR, soil and air temperatures, but also higher relative humidity, pH, and vegetation cover. N. antarctica seedlings growing under B. microphylla shrubs had less leaf number, but the survival and the other morphological variables were similar to those growing with fenced outside the shrub. Therefore, B. microphylla shrubs provide physical protection against livestock and generate a favorable microenvironment for N. antarctica seedlings in sites with a high grazing use intensity that negatively affect N. antarctica seedlings. To restore burned or degraded landscapes, our study results suggest that fencing N. antarctica seedlings or planting them under the cover of shrubs to protect N. antarctica seedlings from biotic (herbivore) and abiotic (edaphoclimatic) stress.

AB  - Animal movements, needed to acquire food resources, avoid predation risk, and find breeding partners, are influenced by annual and circadian cycles. Decisions related to movement reflect a quest to maximize benefits while limiting costs, especially in heterogeneous landscapes. Predation by wolves (Canis lupus) has been identified as the major driver of moose (Alces alces) habitat selection patterns, and linear features have been shown to increase wolf efficiency to travel, hunt, and kill prey. However, few studies have described moose behavioral response to roads and logging in Canada in the absence of wolves. We thus characterized temporal changes (i.e., day phases and biological periods) in eastern moose (Alces alces americana) habitat selection and space use patterns near a road network in a wolf-free area located south of the St. Lawrence River (eastern Canada). We used telemetry data collected on 18 females between 2017 and 2019 to build resource selection functions and mixed linear regressions to explain variations in habitat selection patterns, home-range size, and movement rates. Female moose selected forest stands providing forage when movement was not impeded by snow cover (i.e., spring/green-up, summer/rearing, fall/rut) and stands offering protection against incidental predation during calving. In winter, home-range size decreased with an increasing proportion of stands providing food and shelter against harsh weather, limiting the energetic costs associated with movement. Our results reaffirmed the year-round aversive effect of roads, even in the absence of wolves, but the magnitude of this avoidance differed between day phases, being lower during the "dusk-night-dawn" phase, perhaps due to a lower level of human activity on and near roads. Female moose behavior in our study area was similar to what was observed in landscapes where moose and wolves cohabit, suggesting that the risk associated with humans, perceived as another type of predator, and with incidental predators (coyote Canis latrans, black bear Ursus americanus), equates that of wolf predation in heavily managed landscapes.

AB  - As wild areas disappear and agricultural lands expand, understanding how people and wildlife can coexist becomes increasingly important. Human-wildlife conflicts (HWCs) are obstacles to coexistence and negatively affect both wildlife populations and the livelihood of people. To facilitate coexistence, a number of frameworks have been developed to both understand the drivers of conflict and then to find solutions that mitigate conflict. However, each framework has different foci and strengths in particular stages of analysis. Here, we propose an integrated framework that leverages the individual strengths of previously fairly isolated methodologies, allowing for holistic HWC analysis. The framework for participatory impact assessment (FoPIA) provides a toolset for developing wildlife scenarios, selecting assessment indicators and assessing the impact of different scenarios. The social-ecological framework of ecosystem services and disservices (SEEDS) analyzes the ecosystem services trade-offs related to scenarios, and the 3i stakeholder analysis approach, supports the identification of stakeholders and provides a mechanism to explore, in detail stakeholders' interests, relative influence, and how outcomes of research are likely to impact different stakeholders. We apply these approaches to eastern Germany, where the increase in several wildlife populations (i.e., wild boar, common crane, gray wolf, and European bison) has contributed to conflict with people. We demonstrate the complementarity of FoPIA, SEEDS, and 3i in identifying stakeholder needs and showing how wildlife dynamics may affect coexistence and create imbalanced ecosystem service and disservice distributions. The integrated framework introduced here provides guidelines for analyzing the multistage process of stakeholder participation and enables a comprehensive approach to the complex challenge of HWCs.

AB  - Rewilding incomplete ecosystems by using ungulate megaherbivores represents a significant potential for sus-tainable management of habitats of declining species. Two xeric grasslands patches in the Podyji National Park, Czech Republic, were rewilded by a feral horse breed, the Exmoor pony, in 2018. Before this in 2017, demog-raphy, mobility, and adult habitat use of five congeneric Melitaea butterflies co-occurring at the grasslands were investigated (Vodickova et al., J. Nature Conserv. 2019). In 2021, four seasons after the rewilding, we replicated the survey to assess the effects of the horse on the butterflies. Here, we compare the results of the two surveys and investigate changes in spatial patterns of adult distribution using Ripley's K-functions.Total numbers of captures, and estimated population sizes, were consistently lower in 2021, with the largest drop for spring-flying M. cinxia. We cannot discern whether this was due to the cold 2021 spring, or due to reduction of grasses by the horse, possibly contributing to desiccation of M. cinxia host plants. Demographic parameters such as residency/longevity and capture probability changed only little. Mobility ranking among species remained identical, but within species, some mobility characteristics changed among years. Among early summer species, M. britomartis, second most abundant in 2017, switched to the first position with M. aurelia, and these two species displayed the most notable shift in adult habitat use between the two seasons. Short thorny shrubs avoided by the horse protect M. britomartis host plants; this threatened butterfly thus did not suffer from horse presence. M. athalia, a species of woodland edges, profited from decay of conifers caused by a series of dry years; and M. didyma, forming multiple generations, from increase of its host plant. Contrary to expectations, spatial distribution of most butterflies became more aggregated within rewilded pastures, probably due to regularities in home ranges use by the horses, which restructured the vegetation in a zonal, rather than patchy, way. A considerably larger areas should be rewilded by the herbivores to fully achieve the desired beneficial effects.

AB  - Australia is dominated by 6 million km(2) of rangelands that contribute significantly to the livestock industry and carbon (C) market; yet, few studies have quantified the influence of grazing management on woody biomass and C stocks across these rangelands. Here, we quantified stand-level C stocks (Mg C ha(-1)) in live aboveground biomass (AGB), live belowground biomass (BGB), standing dead mass, coarse woody debris (CWD) and litter of rangeland vegetation at 46 long-term (average 40 year) grazing trials comprising grazed control plots paired with exclosures protected from grazers. Four major woody vegetation types were considered, namely, those dominated by Eucalyptus species, Acacia aneura, other Acacia species, and other species. Most C stocks (except litter C) were highest in Eucalyptus-dominated vegetation and lowest in the 'other species' types. There was high variability and few significant grazing effects on C stocks. There was a trend of higher AGB-C, BGB-C, woody basal area (m(2) ha(-1)) and litter C with grazing exclusion at sites with mean annual precipitation of >300 mm, but the magnitude of increase was highly variable. The impact of the type of grazer was highly variable, although there was a trend of higher woody biomass C where rabbits and domestic livestock were excluded than with exclusion of domestic livestock only. The relative effects of grazing declined as the woody basal area of grazed control plots increased. Our results showed that although grazing exclusion can facilitate C stock accumulation in woody vegetation, it is difficult to predict when and where this may occur. To enable greater clarity, future studies may need to collect additional information, including data on soil water availability and current and historical grazing intensity.

AB  - The knowledge and control of invasive species are essential in the management of marine ecosystems. The Mediterranean Sea is one of the marine areas with the highest number of invasive species detected, most of them invertebrates. On a smaller scale, colonization by non-native species in coastal lagoons depends directly on their connectivity with the adjacent sea and on the changes in their environmental conditions induced mainly by human interventions. In this study, the cirratulid species Timarete caribous Grube, 1859, native from the Western and Central Atlantic Ocean, was detected for the first time in a Western Mediterranean coastal lagoon, the Mar Menor. It has been found in dense aggregates on both artificial and natural rocky substrates, mainly in the most important communication channel with the Mediterranean Sea. Following the evolution of this NIS will be important for understanding the dynamic and spread of the species and its possible effects on the indigenous biological communities.

AB  - Warming-driven growth of tall woody vegetation in the Arctic has the potential to accelerate climate change through multiple positive feedbacks. Local-scale evidence suggests that large herbivores limit this vegetation shift, but there is uncertainty at larger, regional scales whether current herbivory pressure is a major top-down control on ecosystem structure and functioning. Across a 67,000 km(2) region of the Yamal Peninsula in West Siberia, we integrated satellite remote sensing with a novel data set mapping the migrations of herds comprising 151,000 domesticated reindeer. Where reindeer numbers varied over space, higher reindeer herbivory pressure was consistently linked with lower coverage of tall woody vegetation. Within areas dominated by this vegetation type, productivity and climate were increasingly decoupled where reindeer density was higher. Our spaceborne fingerprint detection suggests that large herbivores, at current population densities, counteract Arctic vegetation responses to climate change over large spatial scales.

AB  - Under the increasing global energy demand, the new European Union Biodiversity Strategy for 2030 encourages combinations of energy production systems compatible with biodiversity conservation; however, in photovoltaic parks, panels shadowing the effects on soil health and biodiversity are still unknown. This study (location: Northern Italy) aimed to evaluate the effect of ground-mounted photovoltaic (GMPV) systems on soil arthropod biodiversity, considering two parks with different vegetation management: site 1-grassland mowed with tractor; site 2-grassland managed with sheep and donkeys. Three conditions were identified in each park: under photovoltaic panel (row), between the panel rows (inter-row), and around the photovoltaic plant (control). The soil pH and organic matter (SOM), soil arthropod community, biodiversity, and soil quality index (e.g., QBS-ar index) were characterised. Differences between the two GMPVs were mainly driven by the SOM content (higher values where grazing animals were present). No differences were observed in site 1, even if a high heterogeneity of results was observed for the soil biodiversity parameters under the panels. In site 2, SOM and pH, as well as arthropods biodiversity and QBS-ar, showed low values in the row. Soil fauna assemblages were also affected by ground-mounted panels, where Acarina, Collembola, Hymenoptera, and Hemiptera showed the lowest density in the row. This study suggests that ground-mounted solar panels had significant effects on below-ground soil fauna, and was more marked depending on the system management. Furthermore, the results obtained for the inter-row were similar to the control, suggesting that the area between the panel rows could be considered a good hotspot for soil biodiversity.

AB  - Spatial variation in plant chemical defence towards herbivores can help us understand variation in herbivore top-down control of shrubs in the Arctic and possibly also shrub responses to global warming. Less defended, non-resinous shrubs could be more influenced by herbivores than more defended, resinous shrubs. However, sparse field measurements limit our current understanding of how much of the circum-Arctic variation in defence compounds is explained by taxa or defence functional groups (resinous/non-resinous). We measured circum-Arctic chemical defence and leaf digestibility in resinous (Betula glandulosa, B. nana ssp. exilis) and non-resinous (B. nana ssp. nana, B. pumila) shrub birches to see how they vary among and within taxa and functional groups. Using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) metabolomic analyses and in vitro leaf digestibility via incubation in cattle rumen fluid, we analysed defence composition and leaf digestibility in 128 samples from 44 tundra locations. We found biogeographical patterns in anti-herbivore defence where mean leaf triterpene concentrations and twig resin gland density were greater in resinous taxa and mean concentrations of condensing tannins were greater in non-resinous taxa. This indicates a biome-wide trade-off between triterpene- or tannin-dominated defences. However, we also found variations in chemical defence composition and resin gland density both within and among functional groups (resinous/non-resinous) and taxa, suggesting these categorisations only partly predict chemical herbivore defence. Complex tannins were the only defence compounds negatively related to in vitro digestibility, identifying this previously neglected tannin group as having a potential key role in birch anti-herbivore defence. We conclude that circum-Arctic variation in birch anti-herbivore defence can be partly derived from biogeographical distributions of birch taxa, although our detailed mapping of plant defence provides more information on this variation and can be used for better predictions of herbivore effects on Arctic vegetation.

AB  - Fences serve multiple purposes, including livestock management, agriculture, property delineation, and conservation. However, fences often act as ecological barriers, limiting wildlife movement and access to resources, particularly for species like bison (Bison bison) in North America. Despite the substantial impacts of fencing, large-scale datasets on fence densities are lacking. Our goal was to create potential fence density maps for the western and central U.S. and Canada using GIS modelling and freely accessible data. Specifically, we aimed to: (1) map potential fence density and identify high density of fence, (2) contrast the potential fence density map with the patterns of high human influences, and (3) identify areas with high bison habitat suitability and low density of potential fences. Using GIS modelling, we generated potential fence density maps by integrating data on land parcels, croplands, roads, and railroads. Subsequently, we identified regions with high and low potential fence density and compared them with patterns of human influence and bison habitat suitability. We found high total potential fence density in central regions of Canada and the U.S., mainly due to agriculture and transportation corridors. Interestingly, areas with high potential density of fence in the western U.S., often had low other human influence, suggesting that human influence maps may underestimate impacts if they miss fences. We also identified large areas with high bison habitat suitability and low fence density, which are promising for bison restoration. Our findings highlight the importance of assessing fences for wildlife conservation and supporting bison restoration in the Great Plains.

AB  - Aim: Many invasive plant species benefit from enemy release resulting from the absence of insect herbivores in their invaded range. However, over time, specialized herbivores may `catch up' with such invasive plants. Black locust is a tree species with a relatively limited native range in North America but has invaded large areas in virtually every temperate continent including North America. We hypothesize that both intra - and intercontinental spread of black locust leads to a parallel, though delayed pattern of intra - and intercontinental spread of insect herbivores. Location: Global. Taxon: Black locust, Robinia pseudoacacia, and its insect herbivores.
   Methods: We compiled historical records of the occurrence of insect herbivore species associated with R. pseudoacacia from all world regions. Based on this list, we describe taxonomic patterns and investigate associations between environmental features and numbers of non-native specialist herbivores in the portion of North America invaded by R. pseudoacacia.
   Results: A total of 454 herbivorous species are recorded feeding on R. pseudoacacia across the world, with 23 of these being specialized on Robinia. From this group, seven species have successfully expanded their range beyond North America. Within North America, the richness of specialists is explained by a combination of road density, R. pseudoacacia density, distance from the R. pseudoacacia native range, and climate.
   Main Conclusion: Non--native herbivore species have accumulated on invasive R. pseudoacacia in both North America and in other continents. The steady build-up of invasions likely has diminished the enemy release that this invasive tree species has benefited from - a trend that will likely continue in the future. These findings support the hypothesis that invasive plants promote parallel though delayed invasions of specialist insect herbivores.

AB  - Flower strips are a prominent agri-environmental scheme with the central objective to promote biodiversity and maintain associated ecosystem services. The promotion of natural enemies by increasing resource availability through flower strips is a promising approach for integrated pest management. In a 3-year field study, two annual and two perennial flower strip mixtures, as well as a grass mixture, were tested regarding their attractiveness for natural enemies at three different study sites in Germany. Natural enemies were sampled annually in nine sampling rounds at a 10-day rhythm using sweep netting and pitfall traps. To assess available floral resources, we estimated the species-specific flower cover and classified species into flower types. Flower strip mixtures differed in their attractiveness to natural enemies. Treatment effects on arthropod activity density were most pronounced in the second and third year. Overall, perennial were more attractive than annual flower strip mixtures for most natural enemies, however, the response to flower strip mixtures varied significantly among taxa. For example, perennial flower strips showed a two- to fourfold increase of plant-dwelling spider and parasitoid wasp activity density as well as higher numbers of juvenile stages of predatory bugs and rove beetles compared to annual flower strips. In contrast, annual flower strip mixtures showed the highest attractiveness for ground beetles. Moreover, different natural enemy taxa were associated with varying flower strip characteristics such as flower type proportion, herbivore availability and plant species richness. Synthesis and applications. We found taxon-specific responses of natural enemies to different flower strips, which provide guidance for the floral composition of flower strips in order to maximize their effectiveness for natural pest control. We suggest the use of perennial mixtures with high proportion of flower heads (Asteraceae) and disk flowers (esp. Apiaceae, Rubiaceae, Brassicaceae) in particular, but also flag blossoms (Fabaceae) as these flower types were positively associated with several natural enemy groups. However, since we found mixed responses to flower types, specific flower strip composition will ultimately depends on its objective.

AB  - Aim: We assess the role of spatial distance and depth difference in shaping beta diversity patterns across abyssal seascape regions. We measured the decrease of faunistic similarity across the northeast Pacific seafloor, to test whether species turnover rates differ between deep and shallow-abyssal biogeographical provinces and whether these patterns vary across functionally or taxonomically different biotic groups.
   Location: Abyssal NE Pacific Ocean.
   Time Period: Present.
   Major Taxa Studied: Benthic Invertebrates (13 Phyla).
   Methods: We examined the relationship between compositional similarity (beta(sim)) and spatial distance, distance-decay, in benthic megafauna communities (animals > 10 mm) based on seabed imagery data (> 36,000 specimens in 402 species) collected across 28 abyssal seascape locations spanning a total of 4000 km. By comparing the statistical parameters (intercept and slope) of decay curves, we investigated whether distance-decay patterns differ (i) between communities above and below the carbonate compensation depth (similar to 4400 m at N Pacific), (ii) among taxa with contrasting life-habits and (ii) across dominant phyla.
   Results: We found steeper species turnover rates in communities below 4400 m and variations in distance-decay patterns across biotic groups. Turnover was higher for taxa facultatively growing on hard-substratum patches (polymetallic nodules) than for sediment-dwelling or swimming organisms. Cnidaria and Porifera, respectively, depicted the most and least evident spatial decays in community similarity.
   Main Conclusions: We demonstrate the utility of combining seabed imaging with distance-decay modelling to capture macroecological patterns in poorly explored deep-sea ecosystems. Our results suggest that chemical boundaries associated with depth are a very relevant niche-sorting mechanism driving large-scale beta-diversity patterns and an association between species life-habits and dispersal limitation in abyssal seabed communities. These findings have important implications for biodiversity conservation plans in the deep ocean, amid the need to protect vast abyssal seascape ecosystems from globally rising human threats.

AB  - Forest ecosystems are complex systems where it is often hard to predict and explain mutual activities and interactions of individual factors. Different species of big game make an inseparable part of these ecosystems. Game, particularly big ruminants and wild boar are in a constant interaction with the flora of the area they inhabit. Their positive and negative effects vary during different forest stand phenophases and depend on the forest stand age, presence and number of different game species, availability of food, etc. The negative effects of big game on forest stands have been studied worldwide and in Croatia as well. The focus of this research was to analyse the bark damage induced by red deer on young trees of narrow-leaved ash. The research was conducted in two narrow-leaved ash forest stands situated in the Sava river basin in Croatia, where red deer is known to be present. The obtained results indicate that debarking (bark peeling) of young trees starts immediately upon the removal of the protective fence which is usually put up around forest stands during the regeneration period. Diameter at the breast height (DBH) of damaged narrow-leaved ash trees varied from 2 to 18 cm. In trees of greater diameter, new bark peeling didn't occur, and damage induced in previous years became less conspicuous due to the formation of thicker bark layer. Bark damage was visible from the root collar (ground level) up to 190 cm of the stem height. With the increase of DBH (in the range from 2 to 18 cm), the girdling intensity, i.e., the cumulative damage from previous years increased as well. In some research plots the damage was visible on all narrow-leaved ash trees. Bark damage induced by red deer was not observed on the pedunculate oak and indigo bush, which were the two most common woody species in the researched area just after narrow-leaved ash. Conducted bark analysis didn't indicate that the lack of nutrients, soluble sugar or minerals is the reason for the extensive bark peeling of the narrow-leaved ash bark.

AB  - Resource selection informs understanding of a species' ecology and is especially pertinent for invasive species. Since introduced to Canada, wild pigs (Sus scrofa Linnaeus, 1978) remain understudied despite recognized negative impacts on native and agricultural systems globally. Elsewhere in North America, pigs typically use forests and forage in agricultural crops. We hypothesized Canadian wild pigs would behave similarly, and using GPS locations from 15 individuals, we examined diel and seasonal resource selection and movement in the Canadian prairie region. Forests were predominately selected during the day, while corn (Zea mays L.), oilseeds, and wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) were predominately selected at night. Forests and corn were consistently selected throughout the growing season. Wetlands and forests showed greater use rates than other habitats, with evident trade-offs as crop use increased with the timing of maturation. Activity was consistent with foraging in growing crops. Results indicate diel patterns were likely a function of short-term needs to avoid daytime anthropogenic risk, while seasonal patterns demonstrate how habitats that fill multiple functional roles-food, cover, and thermoregulation-can be optimized. Understanding selection by invasive species is an important step in understanding their potential environmental impacts in novel environments and informs their management.

AB  - Lake browning is expected to change aquatic ecosystems considerably. The changes that may occur in zooplankton communities with a high concentration of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) are little studied and not yet sufficiently understood. We studied zooplankton communities in Finland in 27 lakes with a wide DOC range. We explored how zooplankton diversity and biomass vary along a DOC gradient and how species belonging to different functional groups respond to varying DOC concentrations. The total biomass of zooplankton was not related to DOC concentration, but diversity decreased and the negative linear trend in diversity coincided with an increase in omnivorous zooplankton taxa, whereas several other herbivorous zooplankton taxa were displaced from the community along the gradient of DOC. The results of our study suggest that some well-adapted taxa, especially omnivorous taxa, can benefit from lake browning, but a larger number of taxa suffer from unfavourable conditions caused by high DOC concentration. DOC-induced changes in predation pressure and changes in phytoplankton community in terms of resource availability for zooplankton should be emphasized in future research to understand the effects of lake browning on zooplankton.

AB  - Megafauna, such as elephants, are flagship species and play keystone roles in maintaining ecosystem function. Human-induced deforestation has considerably reduced the global geographic range and population size of Asian elephants (Elephas maximus) in recent decades, yet some reports suggest a possible recent recovery of some of their habitats. The long-term global dynamics of these habitats, however, remain largely unknown. In this study, we compiled environmental covariates from 39 published papers that assessed habitat suitability for Asian elephants. Using these covariates and a habitat suitability index model, we investigated the interannual dynamics of habitat suitability across the species' range from 2000 to 2020. Additionally, we analyzed trends in habitat fragmentation during the same period. Our findings revealed a significant 4.36 % decline in suitable habitat areas over two decades. Interestingly, a tipping point occurred around 2014, when habitat suitability stabilized and began to show slight improvement. However, habitat fragmentation continued to worsen throughout the study period. Notably, habitat suitability was higher in transboundary regions, where degradation was less severe than within protected areas. After 2018, habitat suitability in transboundary regions surpassed that of the protected areas. These findings emphasize the need to prioritize the protection of remaining Asian elephant populations and address the challenges of habitat fragmentation and connectivity across the species' range. Our study highlights the conservation potential often-overlooked transboundary regions and underscores the importance of leveraging geospatial data spanning long time periods and large spatial scales for comprehensive habitat evaluations.

AB  - Coastal ecosystems have been subject to anthropogenic environmental stressors. Although exposed to different environmental pressures and susceptible to bioinvasion events, Todos-os-Santos Bay (TSB) (12oS, Bahia State, Brazil) has great ecological importance. Among the bioinvasive organisms, Tubastraea corals (the 'sun corals') are widespread in artificial and natural environments of the TSB less frequently. Given the lack of baseline information characterizing the original biofouling communities, surveys approaching the malacofauna under the influence of sun corals are essential to the knowledge of local biodiversity and future losses due to possible environmental changes. To provide information on the diversity of the malacofauna, the gastropods, bivalves, and polyplacophorans in the presence of sun corals at 10 sampling stations in the TSB were investigated. Eighty-one taxa of different size classes (micro- and macromolluscs) and mobility (mobile and sessile) were recorded. These species belong to distinct trophic groups (carnivorous, herbivorous, grazers, parasites, and suspensivorous/passive filtering) and life modes (endolithic, epifauna, infauna, and ectoparasitic). Gastropoda had the highest number of species, followed by Bivalvia and Polyplacophora. Cerithiopsidae and Pyramidellidae were the most representative families. Three exotic species and seven new records were identified for the bay. The malacofauna associated with artificial substrates with the presence of sun coral proved to be complex and diverse.

AB  - It is hypothesized that in the Holocene dune fynbos-thicket mosaics of the Cape, decades-long absence of fire results in closed-canopy thicket replacing more open fynbos shrublands. We tested this hypothesis by analyzing repeat photographs from 16 sites at Cape St Francis in the south-eastern Cape Floristic Region. The period of monitoring ranged from 55 to 17 year and most sites had been last burnt between 30 and 50 years ago. We divided the sites into coastal (salt wind-exposed) and inland zones and computed, for each pair of photographs, the rate of change of four plant types, namely thicket shrubs, fynbos woody, fynbos herbaceous and grass. Coastal zone sites showed a significant increase in thicket shrub cover and a significant decline in both grass and fynbos herbaceous cover. Fynbos woody cover declined in the face of thicket invasion, but increased in grassy sites, most likely due to a decline in herbivory intensity. No significant changes in plant types were observed in the inland sites, although thicket shrub cover did increase marginally at the expense of fynbos woody plants. However, thicket invasion was restricted to swales and lower dune slopes; the dune fynbos of the upper slopes and crests remains uninvaded by thicket and surprisingly vigorous after 30 similar to 50 year without fire. This is consistent with the notion that fynbos species occupy drier sites than thicket in these dune landscapes and regular fire is not a prerequisite for its persistence. Overall, we showed a large increase in woody plant cover throughout the study area. While this pattern is consistent with predictions for vegetation change in response to atmospheric [CO2] pollution, it can also be explained by land use changes experienced in the study area, starting in the early 1960s, involving a shift from subsistence agriculture to holiday resort development and tourism.

AB  - Simple Summary
   For the proper management of natural grasslands, it is important to know the interactions between the different herbivores, both wild and domestic, that use them. In this research, we studied the botanical composition of the diet of horses, guanacos, and European brown hares, in summer grasslands of the high mountain range of the Region of Coquimbo, Chile. We were able to determine the main species that these herbivores consume, as well as the characteristics of their diets in terms of diversity and quantify the potential trophic competition between them. The main grassland's species play a maintenance and subsistence role for the three species of herbivores studied, for which they establish selective strategies on certain species of plants, in order to improve the quality of their diets.
   For an adequate management of natural grasslands, the knowledge and understanding of the dietary habits of herbivores and their trophic interactions are fundamental. During two summer seasons, in a mountain range of a sector of the Coquimbo Region, Chile, the botanical composition, diversity, and similarity of the diets of horses, European brown hares, and guanacos were studied, as was the selectivity of the main grassland plant species, using feces microhistology. The contribution of hydromorphic grasses was similar in the diets of guanacos (35.90 +/- 7.27%) and horses (32.25 +/- 4.50%), differing from that found in hares (16.32 +/- 5.32%). Dryland grassland grasses contributed similarly to the diets of horses (13.21 +/- 3.22%), guanacos (22.53 +/- 5.21%) and hares (18.35 +/- 3.81%), as well as graminoids, which averaged 47.79 +/- 6.66%, 35.63 +/- 10.76% and 38.94 +/- 7.88%, in diets of horses, guanacos, and hares, respectively, without significant differences. The contribution of herbaceous dicotyledons was only important in hares (23.76 +/- 3.76%), while that of shrubs was low (<3%) and similar among the three herbivores. Dietary diversity was similar among the three herbivore species (73-79%), with a higher degree of dietary overlap between horses and guanacos (55.7%), which was higher than that obtained between hares and guanacos (50%) and between horses and hares (48%), for which there would be a potential trophic competition between them. The most abundant species of dryland and wet grasslands generally fulfill a functional role of subsistence and a nutritional role of maintenance; however, for the three herbivores studied, a different selective behavior was evidenced, according to their physiological differences, with the selection process little affected by the relative abundance of these species in the grasslands. Due to the above, herbivores resort to the selection of certain species that, despite being not very abundant in grasslands, play an important nutritional and functional role, improving the quality of their diets.

AB  - High Andean wetlands are crucial for biodiversity conservation, climate change mitigation and adaptation, and the well-being of local communities in the Andes. Although community genetics provides an evolutionary viewpoint on ecological processes and allows for potential new understandings of the mechanisms that influence biodiversity and ecosystem function and their response to environmental changes, no research has yet explored the ecological effects of genetic variation in high Andean species. Here, we searched for single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) loci of Carex gayana, an abundant plant species that fulfills crucial ecological functions in high Andean wetlands, that are associated with plant and aquatic macroinvertebrate diversity, and then investigated the spatial distribution of their alleles across a latitudinal gradient of ca. 600 km in Chile's Norte Chico. To identify SNP loci of C. gayana associated with community diversity, we analyzed a genomic dataset of SNP loci obtained through genotyping-by-sequencing of 158 individuals from 17 Andean wetlands using a genome scan approach. We found 30 structure and spatial outlier loci in C. gayana that were also linked with community parameters. We performed spatially-based causal modelling to infer the most probable origin of the observed relationships between SNP allele frequencies and community diversity parameters, resulting in 11 SNP candidates with possible extended effects on communities. The prevalence of alleles linked to greater taxonomic diversity varied greatly across wetlands. Some wetlands exhibited high frequencies of these alleles, while others had very low frequencies. These findings suggest that certain sites may be less resilient to global changes, while others could potentially serve as a source for restoration initiatives. Functional analysis of candidate genes using reference genomes of closely related Carex species allowed the identification of genes involved mainly in plant metabolism, responses to biotic and abiotic stress, defense mechanisms, growth and development, with functions commonly found in high-altitude plant species, and suggests that extended genetic effects of C. gayana genes to high Andean communities could be related to flower/reproductive development, defense mechanisms against herbivore insects and stress response.

AB  - The study of seed dispersal in tropical forest communities is complicated by the high diversity of frugivores and the complex interactions among species and their environments. Determining which species are effective dispersers and which are opportunists with neutral or even negative effects on fruiting plants is a major problem which requires detailed studies focused on particular plant species. In this study we focused on seed dispersal of the wild rambutan (Nephelium melli-ferum) which supplies energy-rich fruits to primates and other mammals in a seasonal evergreen forest in central Thailand. We hypothesized that gibbons (Hylobates lar) were the most important dispersers and were capable of carrying and defecating seeds away from the tree crown where seeds or seedlings could escape increased distance or density-dependent mortality. We deter-mined the seed dispersal effectiveness of all major arboreal consumers of Nephelium fruit (gib-bons, pig-tail monkeys, squirrels) by using data on fruit production and consumption from fruit/ seed traps under the canopies of eight sample trees, observations on animals feeding in fruiting trees, and seed deposition data at varying distances from tree crowns. We assessed the survival of seeds and seedlings in relation to distance from the crown by experiments and transect counts. Camera traps were used to detect consumption of seeds on the ground by terrestrial consumers. About half of the ripe fruit crop was harvested by squirrels which gnawed off the outer husk, ate the pulp and dropped intact seeds to the ground. Monkeys chewed and sucked off the pulp and dropped most seeds to the ground not far from the tree. Seeds and intact fruits dropped by squirrels and monkeys supported a large variety of terrestrial mammals most of which were seed predators. Gibbons, which swallow the seed with pulp attached, consumed only 16 % of the fruit crop but were the most effective and reliable seed dispersers overall, and appear to be the most specialized seed dispersal mutualist. Distance-dependent mortality was found in first-year seed-lings, as well as evidence that further mortality must space out older saplings prior to recruitment into the tree population, which validates the importance of dispersal by gibbons. However, the great majority of fruits of Nephelium melliferum were consumed by mammalian opportunists and seed predators which interacted with one another in ways which depend on composition of the local community.

AB  - Aim: This work examined the influence of induced changes in prolactin (PRL) secretion on sperm cryoresistance of ibex and the mouflon.Materials and Methods: PRL secretion was modified in a first experiment by the use of bromocriptine (BCR, dopamine agonist) during the non-breeding season, and in a second experiment by the use of sulpiride (SLP, dopamine D-2-receptor antagonist) during the rutting season. Slow and ultra-rapid freezing protocols were used to cryopreserve sperm samples.Results: BCR decreased blood plasma PRL concentrations, whereas SLP increased them. Cryoresistance ratios (CRs) for curvilinear velocity (VCL), straight-line velocity (VSL), and average path velocity (VAP) in BCR-treated mouflons were lower than in controls using slow-freezing (p < 0.05), while CRs of motility and morphologically normal sperm of BCR-treated mouflons were greater than controls with ultra-rapid freezing (p < 0.05). BCR increased the head sperm dimensions in ibexes (p < 0.001); conversely, BCR decreased the head dimensions in mouflons (p < 0.001). CR-motility, CR-amplitude of lateral head displacement (ALH), CR-viability, and CR-acrosome integrity in SLP-treated mouflons were lower than in controls with slow-freezing (p < 0.01); CR-viability and CR-acrosome were lower than controls with ultra-rapid freezing (p < 0.05). In ibexes, CR-ALH was lower for SLP-treated (p < 0.05). SLP treatment increased head dimensions in ibexes (p < 0.001) but did not affect the sperm head of mouflons.Conclusion: Our findings show that high levels of blood plasma PRL negatively affect the cryoresistance of ibex and mouflon sperm.

AB  - Intercropping is an agricultural practice applied worldwide to promote biodiversity and biological control services in an agroecosystem. Here, we assessed the differences in arthropod communities in the canopy between pecan (Carya illinoinensis) orchards intercropped with two flowering crops, rapeseed (Brassica rapa) and sunflower (Helianthus annuus), and monoculture pecan orchards. Our results showed that introducing rapeseed and sunflower changed the community composition of arthropods in the canopy. Compared with the monocropping system, the abundance of total arthropods and arthropod herbivores in the intercropping system was reduced, while the abundance of arthropod natural enemies and neutral arthropods significantly increased. The richness and Shannon diversity index of total arthropods and arthropod natural enemies, as well as the Shannon diversity index of arthropod herbivores, were dramatically higher in the intercropping system. However, the effect of the cropping system on the Shannon diversity index of neutral arthropods showed annual variation. Furthermore, compared to the monocropping system, the intercropping system displayed a more complex co-occurrence network structure and stronger co-occurrence patterns among arthropod natural enemies, arthropod herbivores, and neutral arthropods. Our study indicated that intercropping with rapeseed and sunflower can significantly improve arthropod communities in the canopy in pecan orchards and enhance biological control potential.

AB  - Multi-factor experiments suggest that interactions among environmental changes commonly influence biodiversity and community composition. However, most field experiments manipulate only single factors. Soil food webs are critical to ecosystem health and may be particularly sensitive to interactions among environmental changes that include soil warming, eutrophication, and altered precipitation. Here, we asked how environmental changes interacted to alter soil nematode communities in a northern Chihuahuan Desert grassland. Factorial manipulations of nitrogen, winter rainfall, and nighttime warming matched predictions for regional environmental change. Warming reduced nematode diversity by 25% and genus-level richness by 32%, but declines dissipated with additional winter rain, suggesting that warming effects occurred via drying. Interactions between precipitation and nitrogen also altered nematode community composition, but only weakly affected total nematode abundance, indicating that most change involved reordering of species abundances. Specifically, under ambient precipitation, nitrogen fertilizer reduced bacterivores by 68% and herbivores by 73%, but did not affect fungivores. In contrast, under winter rain addition, nitrogen fertilization increased bacterivores by 95%, did not affect herbivores, and doubled fungivore abundance. Rain can reduce soil nitrogen availability and increase turnover in the microbial loop, potentially promoting the recovery of nematode populations overwhelmed by nitrogen eutrophication. Nematode communities were not tightly coupled to plant community composition and may instead track microbes, including biocrusts or decomposers. Our results highlight the importance of interactions among environmental change stressors for shaping the composition and function of soil food webs in drylands.

AB  - Elephants have been structuring woodlands along the Chobe Riverfront, changing them to shrublands. Along with the loss of woodland cover, impala populations seem to be increasing along the Chobe Riverfront. We tested the prediction that elephant-induced loss in woodland cover has increased preferred habitats for impalas along the Chobe Riverfront. We found that home range sizes of impala breeding herds did not differ among seasons at all spatial scales. Impala breeding herds were more selective at broader spatial scales than finer spatial scales in all seasons. Impala breeding herds selected shrublands more than the other habitats throughout the year. The Baikiaea woodland and the riparian woodland were the most avoided habitats, with mixed combretum shrublands and relationships between habitat selectivity and group size, inter-herd encounter and habitat fidelity. The results of our study suggest that impala breeding herds used elephant-transformed habitats throughout the year. Season did not influence habitat selectivity, suggesting that the preferred habitat had higher required resources relative to the other habitats throughout the year.

AB  - The majority of tallgrass prairie has been converted to agriculture over the past two centuries. Restoration projects have sought to increase the quality and size of prairie fragments, with the potential to increase grassland breeding bird habitat. American bison (Bison bison) are being reintroduced to prairie restoration sites and the immediate impacts of these reintroductions are unclear. Our goal was to understand how bison reintroduction influences grassland bird nests and the potential mechanisms behind any change. We measured nest density, nest success, and brood parasitism with a before-after-control-impact (BACI) design to determine if bison influenced pooled nesting success of breeding passerines and field sparrows (Spizella pusilla), the most common nester. In addition, we measured visual obstruction and avian species composition to determine if they changed after the reintroduction. Bison did not influence nest density, brood parasitism, or visual obstruction. Pooled nest success was higher during the first 2 y in bison sites after the reintroduction but decreased the following 2 y. Bird species composition differed slightly between areas with and without bison, but this was not due to the reintroduction and was likely due to other site characteristics. Field sparrow nest success was higher before and after reintroduction in bison sites and drove the pooled nest success results in bison sites. Caution should be taken when interpreting pooled nest data, but these results suggest that bison did not negatively impact nest success of grassland nesting birds immediately following their reintroduction (<5 y).

AB  - The 2023 wildfire season in Quebec, marked by extremely hot and dry conditions, set new records by burning 4.5 million hectares. This situation is directly linked to the persistent and increasing impacts of climate change. This study examines the exceptional weather conditions that led to the fires and assesses their significant impacts on the forest sector, fire management, boreal caribou habitats, and particularly highlights the profound impacts on First Nations communities. The fires led to a significant decline in forest productivity and wood supply, overwhelming fire management teams and requiring mass evacuations. The territory and First Nations communities were profoundly affected, facing severe air quality issues and considerable disruption. While the impact on caribou habitat was modest across the province, the ecological, economic and social impacts were considerable. To mitigate the impacts of future extreme wildfire seasons, one suggested avenue would be to modify forest management practices to increase forest resilience and resistance, adapt industrial structures to new wood supply sources, and improve fire suppression strategies and risk management. Similarly, a comprehensive and unified approach to risk management that incorporates lessons learned from the 2023 fire season, while taking into consideration current climate change, is suggested. The study highlights the urgent need for improved planning and proactive measures to reduce the increasing risks and impacts of wildfire in a changing climate.

AB  - Recruitment is one of the fundamental drivers of ungulate population dynamics. Recruitment of neonates into an ungulate population can be influenced by a wide range of abiotic, biotic, and anthropogenic factors. Our objective was to examine which environmental variables most influenced pronghorn (Antilocapra americana) fawn recruitment, as measured by fawn:doe ratios, across six subpopulations in Idaho spanning 35 years (1984-2018) of herd composition surveys. Using a retrospective analysis, we examined the influence of precipitation, minimum and maximum temperatures, Palmer drought severity, normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), vegetation, and elevation across five biological time periods of interest (one and two months pre-parturition, one and two months post-parturition, and breeding). Environmental factors, especially the variance in the greenness of vegetation (i.e., NDVI) during the two months post-parturition (during lactation), were the main drivers of fawn recruitment for subpopulations occupying mountain valleys. Pronghorn fawn recruitment in these mountain valleys was dependent on the condition of the lactating female as influenced by the quality of vegetation, which would subsequently influence fawn growth rates. In contrast, pronghorn recruitment at lower elevations was driven by several environmental variables (i.e., NDVI, drought severity, minimum and maximum temperatures, forb, and grass cover) during the month pre-parturition. Environmental variables at lower elevations were influencing the condition of the female during gestation which, if favorable, would result in higher birth weights and subsequent increased fawn survival. At intermediate elevation sites, results were mixed with fawn recruitment at one site influenced by low temperatures, which could induce hypothermia in fawns, while recruitment at the other site was influenced by drought severity during gestation (two months pre-parturition). Influence of these environmental variables was also related to the timing of pronghorn arriving at the high elevation sites (i.e., arriving just prior to fawning); hence, effects were predominantly post-parturition. In contrast, low elevation sites either had resident pronghorn or earlier arrival; thereby, effects on fawn recruitment were mostly from pre-parturition variables. Given the range of environmental factors influencing pronghorn subpopulations, managers will need to consider the timing, intensity, and variability of environmental conditions as conditions were spatially and temporally explicit.

AB  - The study on medium and large-sized mammalian species' diversity and distribution is important for conservation efforts in the different protected areas of Ethiopia. The present study was intended to investigate the species diversity of medium and large-sized mammalian fauna between October 2019 and July 2020 in Michole Community Protected Forest, southern Ethiopia. The study was conducted by stratification of the study area into three habitat types: riverine forest (3.37 km(2)), woodland (4.14 km(2)), and grassland with scattered trees (2.33 km(2)) based on the vegetation cover. A diurnal transect survey method was implemented to record the mammalian species diversity. A total of 18 representative sample transect lines (six in riverine forest, four in grassland with scattered trees, and eight in woodland habitats) that varied in length and width were used. A total of 17 species of medium and large-sized mammalian species were identified and recorded in the study area. As a result, the orders Carnivora and Primates have the greatest abundance, while the order Lagomorpha has the least. Anubis baboon (Papio anubis) was the most abundant species (15.14%), followed by Spotted hyena (Crocuta crocuta) (12.98%), Crested porcupine (Hystrix cristata) (12.51%), Vervet monkey (Chlorocebus aethiops) (10.35%), Common duiker (Sylvicapra grimmia) (8.80%), and Giant root-rat (Tachyoryctes macrocephalus) (8.65%). The distributions of mammals among the three habitat types were comparable. The riverine forest harbored the highest mammalian diversity index (H ' = 2.35) followed by the woodland (H ' = 2.32), and the grassland with scattered trees (H ' = 2.30), respectively. The greatest species similarity was recorded in woodland (0.902). The study area harbors considerable mammalian species that are threatened by interacting anthropogenic factors. So, urgent conservation measures by concerned sectors are needed to safeguard these animals and their habitat.

AB  - Litter in the marine environment, in particular plastic, is a significant threat to marine megafauna. Cetaceans are known to ingest or become entangled in marine debris, likely impacting individuals and populations. Southeast Asia is a biodiversity hotspot and harbours a diverse cetacean assemblage. However, there are key knowledge gaps relating to the impact of litter in this region due the lack of experts to survey its vast coastlines. This study aims to address such gaps by using social media, gathering data from Facebook posts relating to cetacean strandings and litter across Southeast Asia between 2009 and 2019. Results show that at least 15 cetacean species have been negatively affected by litter, with ingestion most commonly affecting deep-diving species. Epipelagic and mesopelagic foragers were most vulnerable to entanglement. Davao in the Philippines was identified as a litter-related stranding hotspot. The Irrawaddy dolphin (Orcaella brevirostris) and pygmy sperm whale (Kogia breviceps) are particularly vulnerable to litter. The combination of social media and peer reviewed literature can help build a more complete picture of the spatial distribution of marine litter and the scale of the impact it has on cetacean populations. In this study we provide details of a valuable online tool for helping to understand the impact of marine litter on cetaceans and other charismatic species that are a focus of community engagement.

AB  - Habitat loss and changing climate have direct impacts on native species but can also interact with disease pathogens to influence wildlife communities. In the North American Great Plains, black-tailed prairie dogs (Cynomys ludovicianus) are a keystone species that create important grassland habitat for numerous species and serve as prey for predators, but lethal control driven by agricultural conflict has severely reduced their abundance. Novel disease dynamics caused by epizootic plague (Yersinia pestis) within prairie dog colonies have further reduced prairie dog abundances, in turn destabilizing associated wildlife communities. We capitalized on a natural experiment, collecting data on prairie dog distributions, vegetation structure, avian abundance, and mesocarnivore and ungulate occupancy before (2015-2017) and after (2018-2019) a plague event in northeastern Wyoming, USA. Plague decimated black-tailed prairie dog populations in what was then the largest extant colony complex, reducing colony cover in the focal area from more than 10,000 ha to less than 50 ha. We documented dramatic declines in mesocarnivore occupancy and raptor abundance post-plague, with probability of occupancy or abundance approaching zero in species that rely on prairie dogs for a high proportion of their diet (e.g., ferruginous hawk [Buteo regalis], American badger [Taxidea taxus], and swift fox [Vulpes velox]). Following the plague outbreak, abnormally high precipitation in 2018 hastened vegetation recovery from prairie dog disturbance on colonies in which constant herbivory had formerly maintained shortgrass structure necessary for certain colony-associates. As a result, we observed large shifts in avian communities on former prairie dog colonies, including near-disappearance of mountain plovers (Charadrius montanus) and increases in mid-grass associated songbirds (e.g., lark bunting [Calamospiza melanocorys]). Our research highlights how precipitation can interact with disease-induced loss of a keystone species to induce drastic and rapid shifts in wildlife communities. Although grassland taxa have co-evolved with high spatiotemporal variation, fragmentation of the remaining North American rangelands paired with higher-than-historical variability in climate and disease dynamics are likely to destabilize these systems in the future.

AB  - We investigated the occurrence of congenital dental abnormalities in 94 wild boars Sus scrofa scrofa, and 20 Iberian pigs Sus scrofa domesticus from Donana (DNP) and Sierra de Andujar Natural Park (ANP) southern Spain. The only dental variation found was agenesis of the lower first premolar, either deciduous (Dp(1)) or permanent (P-1). We analyzed prevalence variations using: odds ratios, Fisher's exact test and logistic-regression models. The lower first premolar has often been reported to be absent in modern domestic breeds of pigs, but it is usually reported as present in wild boar. However, we found a similar occurrence of agenesis in wild boar as in Iberian pigs. A common genotypic background between wild boar and Iberian pig populations of ANP sharing the same ecosystems may explain this result. When considering only wild boar, unexpected differences between populations were detected. The wild boar from ANP showed higher estimated probabilities of agenesis than those from DNP. Environmental conditions can also represent influencing factors for changes within subspecies. Our findings reinforce the idea that in suids the congenital absence of premolars probably has an evolutionary relevance, which could represent a generalized trend towards the reduction of the dental formula from the plesiomorphic placental dentition.

AB  - Odonates are the charismatic megafauna of the insect world. This makes them ideal candidates for interaction with the public. These interactions engage communities not only with odonates themselves but the terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems they inhabit. These interactions can have many benefits both for odonates and their ecosystems as well as the global community. Public engagement via odonates, for example, can increase scientific literacy, increase capacity for scientific data collection through community science, and/or encourage environmental advocacy and conservation. Our chapter provides examples of how odonates are used as tools for interaction with the public and how that can be turned into active participation in science and conservation. We conclude by describing existing barriers to making odonate science globally accessible and steps to address these issues.

AB  - Crowdsourcing can be a useful tool for the early detection of invasive species. Invasive wild pigs (Sus scrofa) have been reported in Ontario, Canada. We compared trends in reporting frequency of wild pig sightings to trends in media events that included directions for the public on where to submit their wild pig sightings. We found that media events occurring on the same week, and in up to two weeks before the sighting was reported significantly increased the number of wild pig reports we received. Our findings suggest that media can be used to increase participation by the public. Because of this relationship, our findings also imply that reporting frequency alone cannot accurately index real changes in wild pig numbers-participants were more likely to report sightings after they had been exposed to relevant media, and spikes in the number of reports tracked our outreach efforts. Despite this limitation, reports of wild pig sightings from community members remain a cost-effective tool to detect low-density invasive species across large regions, and participation in the program can be increased with periodic news media and social media blitzes.

AB  - Understanding species' dietary ecology and interspecific interactions is crucial for multi-species conservation planning. In Central Asia and the Himalayas, wolves have recolonized snow leopard habitats, raising considerable concern about resource competition between these apex predators. Using micro-histological analysis of prey species remains (e.g., hair) in their fecal samples, we determined the prey composition, dietary niche breadth, and the extent of diet overlap between these two apex predators in Shey Phoksundo National Park, Nepal. We analyzed 152 scat samples collected along 89 survey transects from April to June 2021. Our findings reveal a significant overlap in their diets (Pianka's index = 0.93), with snow leopard and wolf scats containing the remains of 11 and 10 prey species, respectively. However, the interspecific difference in prey selection was apparent, with significant deviations between observed and expected prey use indicating non-random prey selection relative to availability: Snow leopards exhibited a higher occurrence of wild prey items in their diet (55.28%), primarily blue sheep (Pseudois nayaur) (24.83%), whereas wolves relied predominantly on domestic livestock (67.89%), with goats (Capra hircus) accounting for over one-fourth of their diet (29.15%). Yaks (Bos grunniens) comprised a significant portion of the biomass consumed by both predators, with higher for wolves (43.68%) than snow leopards (36.47%). Overall, the narrow dietary niche breadth with high overlap indicates potential resource competition between snow leopards and wolves. However, a comprehensive understanding of resource competition will require further study on other axes of niche partitioning, including habitat and time. Nevertheless, the region's low prey richness means that, with increasing human influence, any reduction in wild prey or increase in livestock could intensify competition between snow leopards and wolves, which could have implications for livestock depredation.

AB  - Boulder seawalls constructed with granite riprap for shoreline armouring lack habitat complexity, leading to lower marine biodiversity than natural rocky shores. Baskets of live oysters and cured oyster shells, and strings of cured shells laid on concrete blocks were installed on ripraps in Hong Kong, China with an aim to enhance biodiversity and ecosystem functioning towards that of a natural rocky shore. Inhabiting taxa were monitored for at least 18 months and biofiltration capacity of the emerging community was determined ex-situ. Despite high mortality of the live oysters, the baskets and shell reefs developed consistently greater biodiversity than control riprap, culminating in a mean 3.8 (+/- 0.28, 95 % C.I.) times higher across sites. The baskets and shell reefs harboured suspension feeders, herbivores and carnivores generally absent from control riprap, demonstrating the potential for enhancing ecosystem functioning. Overall, baskets and shell reefs increased biodiversity through increased microhabitat availability for epibiota on ripraps.

AB  - For thousands of years edacho Kue (Artillery Lake, Northwest Territories) has been a key water crossing site for barren-ground caribou (Rangifer tarandus groenlandicus). Human disturbance of barren-ground caribou habitat in northern Canada has emerged as an important focus of study in the last decade; particularly in the Bathurst range of the Northwest Territories where caribou populations have declined by more than 95% since the 1980s. Guided by local Indigenous leaders and Elders, a collaborative research project was developed with the Denesoline people of Lutsel K'e Dene First Nation (2012 - 14). This paper describes linkages between knowledge derived from Denesoline oral history and quantitative dendroecological analysis of trample scars on black spruce (Picea mariana) root samples collected at.edacho Kue to provide a better understanding of caribou use at this location. Findings from oral histories and dendroecology analysis were consistent with one another and with previous dendroecology study in the region, although some discrepancies were detected in data from 1995 - 2006 that require further study to elucidate. Key findings include relatively low caribou use at.edacho Kue during the 1930s and late 1960s, with use increasing into the 1970s and peaking in the late 1980s, as well as Elder and hunter reports of no caribou in some years between 2005 and 2012. This work addresses a gap in scientific data about barren-ground caribou movements at.edacho Kue prior to satellite collar use in 1996 and corroborates previously documented oral histories about the enduring value of 'edacho Kue as critical habitat to barren-ground caribou. Given the drastic decline of the Bathurst caribou over the last two decades, more research is needed to understand movements and their relationship to population dynamics. In this context, the research approach described in this paper could be used as an example of how to meaningfully bring together place-based Indigenous knowledge and science in addressing an urgent issue of Arctic sustainability.

AB  - Food provides essential nutrients and energy for wildlife and directly influences the compositional patterns of the gut microbiota in natural reservoirs. Little is known about the interspecific differences and correlations between diet and microbial communities in sympatric herbivores. We conducted chloroplast trnL and 16S rRNA genes amplicon sequencing of 90 faecal samples from sika deer (Cervus nippon kopschi), Reeve's muntjac (Muntiacus reevesi), and a Chinese hare (Lepus sinensis). Diet analysis revealed that sika deer predominantly foraged on Rubus (36.5 %), Loropetalum (25.5 %), and Eurya (13.4 %) at the genus level; Reeve's muntjac favoured Rubus (51.8 %), Eurya (11.0 %), and Euonymus (6.1 %); Chinese hare showed dominance in Rubus (15.8 %), Smilax (15.6 %), and Rhus (10.6 %) consumption, with all these forage plants being shrubs. The gut microbiota of the three herbivores was characterised by Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes, and Proteobacteria, although the relative abundances of these taxa differed across herbivore species. Alpha diversity indicated no significant differences between sika deer and Reeve's muntjac, whereas alpha indices showed significant differences between sika deer and Chinese hare (p < 0.05). Beta diversity analysis indicated significant differences between the Chinese hare and sika deer, as well as between the Chinese hare and Reeve's muntjac (p < 0.05), with no significant difference found between the two cervid species, which may be attributed to the influence of interspecific genetics and evolutionary factors. Due to seasonal shifts, the food availability for herbivores decreased, resulting in the convergent adaptation of shrubs consumed by the three species. Furthermore, PICRUSt functional profile prediction indicated that the gut microbiota of the three species were mainly enriched in metabolic functions. Mantel correlation analysis suggested that the gut microbiota of sika deer showed a significant positive correlation with five genera of plants, one genus of Reeve's muntjacs, and three genera of Chinese hare (p < 0.01), suggesting that the gut microbiota of sika deer may be more susceptible to changes in food abundance. Our study emphasises how the winter climate affects the foraging strategies and microbial communities of the three herbivores, as well as their correlations. These results may further contribute to the food selection, regulation of gut microbiota, disease prevention, conservation, and management of sika deer and other sympatric herbivores.

AB  - Large wood (LW) has important physical and ecological functions in streams. Riparian vegetation is extensively removed during urban expansion, and urban streams may experience enhanced fluvial transport of LW due to flashy hydrology. In this study, LW loads were assessed for three reaches on North Buffalo Creek, an urban stream located in Greensboro, North Carolina, United States. These three reaches have similar hydrology but different riparian vegetation densities. We measured the frequencies and sizes of both in-channel LW and riparian vegetation across the three reaches. Our results showed that the recently reforested reach had greater LW volume (22.5 m(3)/km) compared to the unmanaged forested site (16 m(3)/km) and the site with low riparian vegetation density (4.78 m(3)/km). The difference in LW frequency among reaches was statistically significant (p=.05 ). However, the difference in the volume of individual pieces was not significantly different across reaches (p=.84) , indicating that a similar size of wood is recruited across the three sites. Our findings also showed that there is a positive relationship between riparian vegetation frequency and in-channel LW frequency, which are significantly related as a power function. Spatial lag models (integrating upstream riparian trees) did not show better results compared to a non-lagged model, suggesting that storage and recruitment were predominantly local and that the LW distribution at our reaches is limited by recruitment rather than dominated by fluvial transport. Our findings suggested that a fully forested watershed is not needed to provide some of the benefits of wood to urban streams.

AB  - Fires are common in many ecosystems world-wide, and are frequently used as a management tool. Although the responses of herbivores to fire have been well-studied, the responses of carnivores to fire remain unclear. In particular, post-fire habitat changes, and the associated changes in prey availability, might affect the coexistence or competition of carnivore species within the larger carnivore community, but few studies have focused on how fires influence multiple carnivore species simultaneously. Using South African carnivores as our focal community, we explored relative changes in carnivore intensity of use in post-fire landscapes associated with hypothesized changes in prey availability and top-down suppression. We monitored carnivore intensity of use in relation to prescribed burning using camera traps, with a Before-After-Control-Impact study design. We analysed the camera trap data using community N-mixture models to understand how individual species, as well as the carnivore guild as a whole, respond to burning. Changes in carnivore intensity of use in response to prescribed burns were not uniform; however, no species decreased the intensity of use of post-fire landscapes. The apex predator, the lion Panthera leo, increased the use of prey-rich burnt areas, but other large carnivore species exhibited neutral responses to fire despite the associated prey increase. Responses of medium- and small-sized carnivores were species specific, and included both neutral and positive responses. Positive responses to fire by lions and herbivores were short-lived, and did not persist a year after burning occurred. Synthesis and applications. Our results indicate that fire does not promote carnivore coexistence by creating conditions for all carnivores to increase the use of burned areas, but that it also likely does not result in spatial avoidance of subordinate predators. Instead, fires might cause a suppression of opportunities for subordinate large carnivores because they need to avoid the apex predator, rather than take advantage of short-term increased hunting opportunities in recently burned areas. Our results highlight the complexity of understanding species-specific and community-level responses of carnivores to fire, and overlooked the ecological effects of its use as a management tool.

AB  - Coastal foundation species such as kelps, corals, and seagrasses play vital roles in supporting marine biodiversity and ecosystem services globally, but are increasingly threatened by climate change. In particular, kelp forests are highly dynamic ecosystems experiencing natural fluctuations across seasons and climate cycles, e.g., El Ni & ntilde;o Southern Oscillation, Pacific Decadal Oscillation. As climate change increases variability in these cycles and extreme events such as marine heatwaves become more frequent, long term data are essential to understand deviations from the norm and to better estimate trends of change. This study uses a century-long dataset to examine kelp forest responses to regional drivers in Haida Gwaii, British Columbia, by combining remote sensing data from 1973-2021 with a snapshot of kelp distribution derived from historical records from 1867-1945. We reveal complex patterns of change, with kelp losses and resilience varying at different spatial scales. Kelp forests that had likely persisted for over a century exhibited an overall declining trend of 5 +/- 2% per decade starting in the 1970s. Throughout the time series kelp area was driven by multi-year impacts of the Pacific Decadal Oscillation, El Nino Southern Oscillation, sea surface temperature anomalies and marine heatwaves, such as the 1998 El Ni & ntilde;o and the 2014-2016 marine heatwave known as the 'Blob'. In the warmest areas, kelp forests completely disappeared during the 1977 Pacific Decadal Oscillation shift. Cooler areas showed greater resilience, buffering the loss at the region wide scale, highlighting the importance of local gradients in understanding areas vulnerable to climate change. Lastly, local in situ surveys showed a lack of urchin barrens, and the presence of turf algae in the study region, further supporting the hypothesis that temperature, not herbivory, drove kelp forest loss in this region.

AB  - In wild ungulates, habitat choice usually is influenced by foraging constraints and predator avoidance, potentially leading to spatial variation of population density (e.g., greater densities in food rich or safer habitats). Assessing habitat-correlates of abundance and foraging activity in turn is important in understanding determinants of distribution. We assessed habitat correlates of presence, density, and rooting, for wild boar Sus scrofa, the most widespread ungulate in the world, in six protected areas of central Italy. We worked along an altitudinal gradient ranging from the coast to mountains, in late spring-stunner 2019. We surveyed 617 sampling plots randomly placed onto study areas with tessellation stratified sampling, where we used fecal counts to estimate wild boar density and visually estimated the proportion of rooted area. Overall estimates of density and rooting (+/- standard error) varied from 3.5 +/- 2.0 to 17.9 +/- 5.4 individuals/km(2) and from 1.4 +/- 0.8% to 10.9 +/- 1.1% of rooted ground. Density and rooting showed a moderate yet nonsignificant correlation across sites. Probability of presence, abundance, and rooting in sampling plots were higher in ecotone habitats (transition habitats between wooded and open areas). Topography did not influence boar presence or local abundance. Rooting increased with decreasing slope and rock cover, as well as increasing elevation, possibly due to soil supporting forage of higher nutritional quality. Our results support the importance of ecotone habitats for wild boar, emphasizing the role of these transitional areas in the period of nursing/weaning of offspring, as well as when crops are actively growing. Differences in overall estimates of rooting across study sites may depend on site-specific features (soil moisture and availability of alternative food resources). Future studies should test the correlation between inter-annual differences of rooting and changes in population density. Notwithstanding the latter, we identified significant ecological drivers of wild boar density and rooting activity.

AB  - Climate change is predicted to increase the frequency and size of wildfires. Wildfire burns can influence wildlife space use, but prior to understanding the relationship between wildlife and burns, the extent of wildfires and the regrowth of burned areas must be determined. We used remotely sensed, multispectral satellite imagery to calculate differenced normalized burn ratios (NBRs) to define areas burned by wildfire and assess temporal trends in burn frequency and extent in central British Columbia. We then used NBRs as an index of vegetation regrowth to model regrowth trajectories within burns. Next, we examined spatial responses to burns by a moose (Alces alces) population that recently declined in abundance. We utilized locations used by and available to collared moose to determine spatial responses as a function of years since wildfire and vegetation regrowth. We also assessed functional responses to burns by moose, dependent upon the proportion of burned areas available to each individual. We hypothesized that (h(1)) wildfire burns within our study area increased from 1985 to 2017, (h(2)) that moose increase their use of burns in comparison with availability as burns age as a result of vegetation regrowth, and (h(3)) that moose demonstrate functional responses to burns (i.e., selection of burns by individual moose declines as the amount of burned areas increases). We observed that the frequency and extent of burns are increasing within our study area. In contrast to h(2), moose in summer and fall decreased the selection of burns as burns aged. We, however, observed that moose responded most positively to locations with intermediate vegetation regrowth (i.e., NBR values), which according to burn regrowth trajectories were most likely to be achieved 13 or more years post-wildfire; given that most burns within our study area were <= 13 years of age, we predict that the use of burns will likely increase as vegetation regrows. Moose only selected for burns in fall, and we did not find support for the presence of a functional response. Our research demonstrated the utility of remotely sensed imagery and NBRs to define burn locations and to reveal current and probable future spatial responses to burns by a wildlife population of concern.

AB  - Simple Summary Humans extirpated the wolf Canis lupus from many regions of Europe. Today, the wolf is returning to many of these areas, and with it, people's opposition due to its predatory habits on, among others, ungulate game species. Based on existing data on wolf prey selection, kill rates and territory size, we extrapolated the results from central Sweden and Poland to southern Sweden, where wolf recolonization has not yet occurred and conservation conflicts with hunters are expected. Thus, we calculated the proportion of moose Alces alces, roe deer Capreolus capreolus, red deer Cervus elaphus, fallow deer Dama dama and wild boar Sus scrofa that would be killed by wolves in the municipalities of southern Sweden if wolf recolonization occurs. We found that the current system of five ungulate species in southern Sweden could potentially support a wolf density two to four times higher than in the current wolf distribution in central Sweden, which are mainly inhabited by roe deer and moose. With this type of research, we can anticipate and work to ameliorate the social unrest and expected conservation conflicts that may arise once wolves or other large carnivore species recolonize areas of Europe that are returning to the wild. The ongoing recolonisations of human-transformed environments in Europe by large carnivores like the wolf Canis lupus means that conservation conflicts could re-surface, among other reasons, due to predation on ungulate game species. We estimated the effect of wolves on ungulate species using data on wolf prey selection, kill rates and territory size to build a hypothetical case of future expansion. We extrapolated results on predation from the current wolf distribution in central Sweden and eastern Poland to the eventual wolf recolonisation of southern Sweden. We then calculated the proportion of five ungulate game species killed annually by wolves, and the ratio between the predicted annual predation by wolves given future colonization and the number of ungulates currently harvested by hunters. Results showed that wolf recolonization in southern Sweden would have a minor impact on the estimated population densities of red deer Cervus elaphus, fallow deer Dama dama and wild boar Sus scrofa, but is likely to lead to a significant reduction in human captures of moose Alces alces and roe deer Capreolus capreolus. The current five-ungulate species system in southern Sweden suggests a potential for two to four times higher wolf density than the two-ungulate species system in the northern part of their current distribution. Management and conservation of recolonizing large carnivores require a better understanding of the observed impact on game populations under similar ecological conditions to ameliorate conservation conflicts and achieve a paradigm of coexistence. Integrating these predictions into management is paramount to the current rewilding trend occurring in many areas of Europe or North America.

AB  - In 2015, red deer infected with American liver fluke were discovered in the Veldenstein Forest area for the first time. This was the first detection of the fluke in a wild deer population in Bavaria. The aim of the study was to determine the American liver fluke prevalence rates in red deer, roe deer and wild boar in the Veldenstein Forest, as well as factors influencing these rates. Since 2018, the livers of 83% of the red deer culled in the study area have been examined, as well as those of the occasional roe deer and wild boar. The livers are classified by adspection and dissection into four levels of infection. The age of the animals was estimated based on dentition and tooth cementum annuli in the first molar (M1). The livers of 520 red deer, 226 roe deer and 75 wild boar were dissected. All wild boar livers tested negative. 3% of roe deer and 36% of red deer livers were positive. The red deer population was reduced to lower the prevalence, beginning in 2018. In the following years, it fell significantly. Medium and high infection levels were initially detected in 61% of adult red deer. Since 2018, the median number of flukes per infected liver has decreased significantly from 17.51 flukes/liver to 10.0 flukes/liver. On driven hunts, significantly more diseased deer were found than during hunting from raised hides. Furthermore, there are close correlations between the age of the red deer, infections, and the distance from the Pegnitz floodplains. The American liver fluke leads to the extinction of roe deer locally and to a massive infection and decimation of the red deer. Without a drastic reduction in the number of infected deer populations, there is a risk of large-scale infection of native deer species across Bavaria.

AB  - Aquaporins (AQPs) are essential membrane proteins facilitating water and small solute transport across cell membranes. Mammals have approximately 13 paralogs of AQPs that may have evolved through gene duplication events. These genes are present in two separate clusters within the genome. In the present study, comprehensive 13 AQP genes (AQP0-12) were cloned and characterized in buffalo and goat. The protein coding region of AQPs in both species ranged from 729 to 990 bps, corresponding to 263-330 amino acid residues. Two important residues including NPA motifs and ar/R selectivity filter were found conserved in all AQPs, except for AQP7, 11 and 12. AQP0, 2, 4, 5, 7, 9, 12 showed tissue-restricted expression, whereas AQP1, 3, 8, and 11 exhibited ubiquitous expression across several tissues. AQP10 was identified as a pseudogene in all artiodactyls. Transcript variants were identified in buffalo and goat, where some variants of goat AQP5 and 6 lacked important motifs. Evolutionary analysis indicated positive selection at or near the NPA motifs and ar/R selectivity filter of AQP0, 3, 6, 7, and 10 that may alter its structure and function. This study is crucial for future investigations aiming to study the molecular mechanisms of AQPs in response to various physiological conditions.

AB  - Hunting and photographic tourism provide ecosystem services that can facilitate conservation. Understanding factors influencing how tourism industries generate income is necessary to ensure sustainable community-based natural resource management. We evaluated effects of large mammal occurrence and landscape attributes on incomes from hunting and photographic tourism earned by communal conservancies in Namibia during 1998-2022. We compiled annual incomes and occurrence of 'Big 5' species (elephant [Loxodonta africana], buffalo [Syncerus caffer], black rhino [Diceros bicornis], lion [Panthera leo], and leopard [P. pardus]) using conservancy accounting and wildlife monitoring data. Hunting occurred in 70 of 86 conservancies and generated income almost twice as rapidly as photographic tourism (2.9 and 5.4 years after conservancy establishment, respectively). Hunting income increased with conservancy area and number of Big 5 species present but decreased with conservancy age and increasing mean elevation, topographic diversity, and distances to national parks. Photographic tourism occurred in 39 conservancies and generated 447 % greater median annual income than hunting for conservancies earning >$0. Big 5 species occurrence increased the probability conservancies earned >$0 photographic income but not the amount of photographic income. Photographic income increased with conservancy age and higher annual precipitation but decreased with higher mean elevation. Large mammals are an important driver of income to Namibia's conservancies and hunting and photographic tourism can provide complementary benefits. We recommend Namibia's conservancies, particularly those established more recently with smaller area, consider inter-conservancy wildlife comanagement and collaboration with tourism industries to improve income potential and develop more sustainable community-based natural resource economies.

AB  - Species-rich communities exhibit higher levels of ecosystem functioning compared with species-poor ones, and this positive relationship strengthens over time. One proposed explanation for this phenomenon is the reduction of niche overlap among plants or animals, which corresponds to increased complementarity and reduced competition. In order to examine the potential of increased complementarity among plants or animals to strengthen the relationship between diversity and ecosystem functions, we integrated models of bio-energetic population dynamics and food-web assembly. Through the simulation of various scenarios of plant and animal complementarity change, we sought to elucidate the mechanisms underlying the observed increases in (1) primary productivity, (2) control of herbivores by predators and (3) reduction of herbivore pressure on plants in species-rich communities. Our findings reveal that increased niche complementarity of plants can steepen the diversity-function relationships if it does not increase their intraspecific competition, while increasing complementarity among animals during community assembly can also have a positive effect but with considerable variability. The study highlights the importance of trait variation both among and within species and the interplay between intra- and interspecific competition strength in shaping the functioning of ecosystems over time. These results offer insights into the mechanisms underpinning the diversity-functioning relationship and have practical implications for ecosystem management and conservation efforts.Read the free Plain Language Summary for this article on the Journal blog.

AB  - Density is an important demographic parameter that is commonly overlooked in studies of wild populations. Here, we examined the effects of variable spatially explicit density on a range of demographic parameters in a wild population of a cryptic ungulate, boreal woodland caribou (Rangifer tarandus caribou). Using non-invasive genetic sampling, we applied spatial capture-recapture methods with landscape covariates to estimate the density of boreal woodland caribou across a 108,806 km(2) study area. We then created a familial network from the reconstructed parent-offspring relationships to determine whether spatial density influenced sex-specific individual reproductive success, female pregnancy status, and dispersal distance. We found that animal density varied greatly in response to land cover types and disturbance; animal density was most influenced by landscape composition and distance to roads varying from 0 in areas with >20% deciduous cover to 270 caribou per 1,000 km(2) in areas presenting contiguous older coniferous cover. We found that both male and female reproductive success varied with density, with males showing a higher probability of having offspring in higher-density areas, and the opposite for females. No differences were found in female pregnancy rates occurring in high- and low-density areas. Dispersal distances varied with density, with offspring moving shorter distances when parents were found in higher-density areas. Familial networks showed lower-closeness centrality and lower-degree centrality for females in higher-density areas, indicating that females found in higher-density areas tend to be less broadly associated with animals across the range. Although high-density areas do reflect good-quality caribou habitat, the observed decreased closeness and degree centrality measures, dispersal rates, and lower female recruitment rates suggest that remnant habitat patches across the landscape may create population sinks.

Tree damage by small rodents, the quantity and quality of herbaceous plant biomass and the species composition of small mammals were monitored at two sites in European beech forest plantations. The number of trees damaged during three growing seasons correlated positively with fibre content and negatively with nitrogen content in herbaceous plant biomass. The importance of winter precipitation is reflected in the positive correlation with nitrogen content in herbaceous plant biomass. The observed tree-gnawing damage correlated positively with the abundance of one rodent species only-the bank vole. The highest damage occurred after the concurrence of a dry winter and a higher number of voles. Given current climate variability, this situation could become more common in the future. Gnawing may be a limiting factor for the successful restoration of trees with thin bark-in our case, European beech. In addition, the proportion of this woody species should be increased to achieve a more stable and closer composition in the Czech Republic.

AB  - Increasing global temperature and changes in the precipitation regime affect the global carbon cycle by altering the process of organic matter decomposition. Temporary aquatic systems are especially susceptible to climate change. We hypothesized that water availability and temperature affect the early and late stages of decomposition of litter differently and determine the decomposition rates according to litter type. We conducted two decomposition experiments using green (Camellia sinensis L.) and mint (Mentha piperita L.) tea in commercial bags. In the laboratory experiment, we incubated the bags at two contrasting temperatures (4 and 15 degrees C) and in three simulated hydroperiods (M: moist, MS: submerged after 14 days, S: submerged). A field experiment was carried out in winter and spring in nine temporary wetlands (meadows) along a precipitation gradient (from forest to steppe ecosystems) in the Argentinean Patagonia. Water stimulated the leaching of soluble substances in the S treatment and was the conducting factor in early decomposition stages. Temperature stimulated tea decomposition in advanced stages, and both water and temperature exerted a different response depending on the litter type. In the field experiment, mass loss in meadows was determined by the hydroperiod condition, both in winter and spring. Detritus type was the controlling factor in steppe meadows, but on forest meadows water level stimulated both litter types, and temperature increased decomposition. Under the expected increase of temperature and decrease of precipitations in future climate scenarios, organic matter accumulation would increase in steppe meadows and decomposition would be higher in forest meadows.

AB  - The functioning of diverse ecosystems relies on the dispersal processes facilitated by animals, known as zoochory. This ecological process is the only way in which some aquatic species can move between aquatic systems through the terrestrial matrix. Despite its paramount importance, the dispersal mechanisms involving certain vectors, such as mammals, have remained relatively poorly understood. Based on observation of capybaras Hydrochoerus hydrochaeris emerging from a wetland with various aquatic plant species attached to their fur, we hypothesized that these mammals play a crucial role in dispersing aquatic plants. We conducted a controlled experiment and confirmed that capybaras disperse two species of duckweed, Lemna valdiviana and Wolffia columbiana, through both endozoochory and epizoochory. The discovery of entire plant dispersal is noteworthy because it is not dependent on the season and does not rely on the production of specific reproductive diaspores. This study presents pioneering documentation of capybaras capacity to disperse entire plants through their gastrointestinal passage and offers further evidence of their role in epizoochory within neotropical wetlands.

AB  - Plant traits, which are often species specific, can serve as environmental filtering for community assembly on plants. At the same time, the species identity of the initially colonizing arthropods would vary between plant individuals, which would subsequently influence colonizing arthropods and community development in the later stages. However, it remains unclear whether interindividual divergence due to priority effects is equally important as plant trait-specific environmental filtering in the initial stages. In this study, we propose that plant volatile organic compounds (PVOCs) may play a crucial role as an environmental filter in the initial stages of community assembly, which can prevent the community assembly process from being purely stochastic. To test this hypothesis, we conducted short term but highly frequent monitoring (19 observations over 9 days) of arthropod community assembly on intact individuals of six willow species in a common garden. PVOC compositions were analyzed before starting the experiment and compared with arthropod compositions occurring on Days 1-2 of the experiment (earliest colonizer community) and those occurring on Days 8-9 of the experiment (subsequent colonizer community). Unintentionally, deer herbivory also occurred at night of Day 2. Distance-based statistics demonstrated that PVOC compositions were plant species specific, but neither the earliest colonizer nor the subsequent colonizer community composition could be explained by plant species identity. Rather, Procrustes analysis showed that both the PVOC composition and that of the earliest colonizer community can be used to explain the subsequent colonizer community. In addition, the linkage between PVOCs and the subsequent colonizer community was stronger on individuals with deer herbivory. These findings indicate that PVOCs have widespread effects on initial community assembly, as well as priority effects brought on by stochastic immigration, and that plant species identity only has weak and indirect effects on the actual composition of the community.

AB  - Conservation policy for the high mountains of Asia increasingly recognises the need to encompass large multi-use landscapes beyond the protected area network. Due to limited long-term research in this region, our understanding of even fundamental processes, such as factors regulating large mammal populations is poor. Understanding the factors that regulate animal populations, especially those generating cyclicity, is a long-standing problem in ecology. Long-term research across multiple taxa (mainly from Europe and North America) has focussed on the relative roles of food and predation in generating cyclicity in population dynamics. It remains unclear how trophic interactions that are influenced by anthropogenic stressors can affect population dynamics in human-modified landscapes. We present a 10-year study to compare the effects of livestock grazing on density-dependent dynamics in two populations of bharal, Pseudois nayaur, in the Himalayas. We combine this with a mechanistic understanding of whether density dependence in these two sites acts predominantly by affecting adult survival or recruitment. We compared and quantified density dependence in the bharal population by fitting Bayesian Gompertz state-space models. We found evidence for negative density dependence which indicates possible cyclic dynamics in the bharal population of the site (Tabo) with low livestock density. The population dynamics of this site were driven by recruited offspring-with a 2-year density-dependent lag effect-rather than adult survival. In the site with high livestock density (Kibber), this density dependence was not detected. We postulate the potential role of excessive grazing by livestock in affecting offspring recruitment, thereby affecting the bharal population in Kibber. Synthesis and applications: Our results suggest that conservation action to facilitate wild herbivore population recovery, such as the development of protected areas and village reserves, needs to account for density-dependent regulation. Sites with trophy hunting require continuous monitoring to understand the effects of density dependence so that appropriate hunting quotas can be formulated.

AB  - Climate change modifies plant phenology through shifts in seasonal temperature and precipitation. Because the timing of plant growth can limit herbivore population dynamics, climatic alteration of historical patterns of vegetation seasonality may alter population trajectories in such taxa. Thus, sound management decisions may depend on understanding how plant growth varies across a landscape within and among distinct management units or protected areas. Here, we examine spatial variation in the timing of spring plant growth, measured using a network of automated time-lapse cameras distributed across the range of endangered Sierra Nevada bighorn sheep (Ovis canadensis sierrae) in California, USA. We tracked greenness of individual plants across 2 years to compare spatial patterns of forage phenology in snowy and drought years. Green-up timing was derived for individual plants across the camera network and compared with local estimates of green-up timing from satellite data. Satellite-derived estimates of green-up timing showed strong correspondence with camera-derived estimates in areas with dense vegetation cover and weak correspondence in areas with sparse vegetation cover. Daily time-lapse imagery revealed consistent variation in green-up timing across elevation, both among latitudinal zones and among individual plant species. Green-up timing was earlier in 2020 than in 2019, reflecting differences in the end of the snowy season. Because bighorn forage seasonally on alpine species with a brief growing period, spring migration of bighorn may be linked to variation in snowmelt and plant growth across elevational gradients.

AB  - Animal migrations occur in many taxa and are considered an adaptive response to spatial or temporal variations in resources. Human activities can influence the cost-benefit trade-offs of animal migrations, but evaluating the determinants of migration trajectory and movement rate in declining populations facing relatively low levels of human disturbance can provide new and valuable insights on the behavior of wildlife in natural environments. Here, we used an adapted version of path selection functions and quantified the effects of habitat type, topography, and weather, on 313 spring migrations by migratory caribou (Rangifer tarandus) in northern Quebec, Canada, from 2011 to 2018. Our results showed that during spring migration, caribou selected tundra and avoided water bodies, forest, and higher elevation. Higher precipitation and deeper snow were linked to lower movement rates. Weather variables had a stronger effect on the migration trajectories and movement rates of females than males. Duration of caribou spring migration (mean of 48 days) and length (mean of 587 km) were similar in males and females, but females started (22 April) and ended (10 June) spring migrations ca. 6 days earlier than males. Caribou spring migration was influenced by habitat type, topography, and weather, but we also observed that caribou migrations were not spatially constrained. Better knowledge on where and when animals move between their winter and summer ranges can help inform management and land planning decisions. Our results could be used to model future migration trajectories and speed of caribou under different climate change scenarios.

AB  - Restoration of early successional plant communities dominated by nonnative plant species is a central focus of many state and federal agencies to improve habitat for wildlife associated with these communities. Restoration efforts largely have concentrated on controlling nonnative species followed by planting native grasses and forbs. However, there are numerous establishment problems associated with planting that warrant evaluation of alternative approaches for restoration. We conducted a field experiment to compare vegetation composition and structure as related to habitat for focal wildlife among plant communities established by planting (Planted) native grasses and forbs and revegetation from the seedbank (Seedbank) without planting following control of tall fescue (Schedonorus arundinaceus) at 15 replicated sites in Tennessee and Alabama, USA. Planted and Seedbank treatments produced similar plant communities. Vegetation structure providing cover for nesting and brooding northern bobwhite (Colinus virginianus) and wild turkey (Meleagris gallopavo) was similar between Seedbank and Planted treatments except native grass cover was greatest in Planted, and we recorded greater openness at ground level in Seedbank than Planted or tall fescue control (Control). Abundance of northern bobwhite food plants and selected white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) forage were similar between Planted and Seedbank treatments, but nutritional carrying capacity for deer was greatest in Seedbank. Despite similarities in food abundance, and even though all forbs included in the planting mixtures were food plants, the majority of food plants in Planted were from the seedbank. The compositional and structural characteristics deemed most influential in previous studies to selection of breeding sites by dickcissel (Spiza americana), field sparrow (Spizella pusilla), grasshopper sparrow (Ammodramus savannarum), Henslow's sparrow (Ammodramus henslowii), and northern bobwhite were similar in Planted and Seedbank. Tall fescue Control was most similar to characteristics of eastern meadowlark (Sturnella magna) breeding sites. Revegetation following Seedbank produced a plant community that provided habitat for many wildlife species equal to or better than Planted and was 3.7 times less expensive than Planted.

AB  - Wildfire activity across the western United States has increased in recent decades, with wildfires burning at a higher severity and larger scale. The effect of wildfires on forest structure and wildlife habitat is largely influenced by wildfire severity; however, few studies have evaluated the effects of wildfire severity on resource selection of ungulates, particularly during hunting seasons, when knowledge of resource selection is essential for making informed management decisions. To fill this knowledge gap, we fit resource selection probability functions for female elk (Cervus canadensis) in years 2 and 3 post-wildfire to evaluate the effects of wildfire severity and other environmental and anthropogenic factors on elk resource selection during 4 autumn periods with varying levels of hunter pressure (prehunt, archery-only, backcountry rifle, and rifle). The probability of female elk selecting low-severity burned forests during the prehunt, archery-only, backcountry rifle, and rifle periods was 0.99 (95% credible interval [CrI] = 0.98-1.00), 0.99 (CrI = 0.97-1.00), 0.99 (CrI = 0.99-1.00), and 0.0010 (CrI = 0.00067-0.0015]), respectively, and did not strongly differ from the probability of selecting high-severity burned forests. During the prehunt period, elk also selected areas with greater forage quality and areas farther from open roads. Elk selected similar resources during the archery period, and selected areas with higher hunter pressure. Elk started leaving hunting districts that had higher snowpack (i.e., snow water equivalent; beta = -0.84, CrI = -0.96--0.72) and allowed rifle hunting (beta = -5.39, CrI = -5.80--4.97) but still selected areas with higher hunter pressure (beta = 0.92, CrI = 0.78-1.07) during the backcountry rifle period. During the rifle period, elk continued avoiding areas with high snowpack (beta = -3.96, CrI = -4.22--3.71) and started selecting areas with lower hunter pressure (beta = -1.71, CrI = -1.79--1.64) and lower canopy cover. Overall, wildfire affected elk distributions in early autumn 2 and 3 years after fire in our study area, with limited differences in resource selection between wildfire severity categories. By late autumn, hunter pressure and snowpack were the primary factors influencing elk distribution, and wildfire had little influence on selection. When estimating wildfire effects on elk movements during autumn and establishing appropriate hunting regulations, managers should consider the hunting season, hunter pressure, timing and amount of snowpack, location of traditional winter range, and the seasonal elk range burned, as all these factors may contribute to how elk use the landscape in autumn.

AB  - One of the main things wildlife does for survival is movement. Wild animals need movement to meet their needs, such as reproduction, breeding, foraging, and dispersal. Although wildlife species use roads for various purposes, they also use them when moving from one habitat to another. In recent years, especially when it comes to habitat fragmentation brought about by urbanization, wild animals frequently use highways. Highways have a wide range of effects on factors such as biodiversity, wildlife, and ecology. Roads can cause habitat loss, habitat fragmentation, and habitat degradation; alter the composition of vegetation; act as barriers to the flow of genes and movement; increase human access to pristine areas; and even increase the risk of extinction for many threatened species. Species belonging to the family Cervidae also include the species most affected by road networks. Roe deer (Capreolus capreolus Linnaeus, 1758) is the smallest of the 3 Cervid species living in Turkey. Roe deer are often injured or die in road accidents, and they are one of the most important species affected by the adverse effects of roads in Turkey. For this reason, it was investigated whether the road tunnel construction affected the distribution of roe deer in the region. In the study, the general distribution of roe deer in the Ilgaz Mountain, and the factors affecting their possible distribution were determined by ecological niche modeling. Data were taken between before (2012-2015) and after the highway tunnel built (2020-2022) in Ilgaz Mountain, which connects the Western Black Sea and Central Anatolia and is located in the middle of Kastamonu and cankiri provinces. As a result of the modeling, it was found that before the construction of the tunnel, the most influential factor in the distribution of the deer was road density. After the tunnel construction, roads ceased to be the main factor affecting the distribution of the species. This study showed that roe deer are disturbed by the density of vehicles on the road passing through the middle of their habitat. With the decrease in the number of vehicles, they are more willing to cross the road and tend to use the areas close to the road as they are less disturbed.

AB  - Populations of the threatened Baird's tapir (Tapirus bairdii) and the white-lipped peccary (Tayassu pecari) face increasing isolation due to rampant deforestation and forest fragmentation across the Greater Maya Forest shared by southeastern Mexico, northern Guatemala, and Belize. We identified (1) the critical areas to ensure the persistence of Baird's tapir and the white-lipped peccary in the Maya Forest; (2) the corridors and sites with the best conditions to maintain connectivity among core habitats, and (3) the nodes with higher risk of habitat loss compromising landscape connectivity. We used a methodological framework combining circuit theory and species distribution modeling to estimate landscape resistance, land use, and the effect of roads and trails on the current distribution of the two focal species in the Maya Forest. We detected that major roads associated with agricultural landscapes are the primary barriers to the movements of tapirs and white-lipped peccaries in the study area. Conserving corridors that link the forests of the Lacandon and the Calakmul regions, along with the protected area network of northern Belize and establishing nodes between remaining forest fragments, are critical measures to mitigate the impact of habitat fragmentation and loss for both species. The critical constriction areas (pinch points) and the corridors identified in this study support our prediction of the least-cost paths. Our assessment of threats to landscape connectivity provides useful information to inform effective decision-making for conserving Baird's tapir and white-lipped peccary populations in the Greater Maya Forest.

AB  - Functional traits drive species interactions that structure ecological communities around the world. Both ecological and human-use traits may be associated with the structure of ecological networks in human-modified systems. In secondary and primary forests in northeast Madagascar, we quantified the importance of lemur species and the tree genera they consume using network measures of centrality, determined the ecological trait predictors of tree centrality, and investigated the relationships between tree centrality and human use. Our study advances understanding of ecological interactions by: combining ethnobiological data with direct observations to reduce undersampling of cryptic interactions; using a bipartite network approach to understand the connections between land use types; investigating frugivory, seed predation, and herbivory interactions; and accounting for phylogenetic signal in tree centrality. Diurnal lemurs tended to be more central to primary forests, whereas nocturnal lemurs were more central to secondary forests. Tree centrality in primary forest networks was negatively associated with tree diameter, wood density, and endemism status. Network structure was related to human use traits in the secondary forest but not in primary forest; trees central to secondary forest networks were more likely to be used by people, especially in herbivory networks. Our results highlight the importance of combining research-based observations with ethnobiological data to advance our understanding of the trait-based functioning of ecological networks. Conservation approaches should be attentive to the implications of ecological interactions for both ecological functioning and human well-being.

AB  - Restoring wild communities of large herbivores is critical for the conservation of biodiverse ecosystems, but environmental changes in the twenty-first century could drastically affect the availability of habitats. We projected future habitat dynamics for 18 wild large herbivores in Europe and the relative future potential patterns of species richness and assemblage mean body weight considering four alternative scenarios of socioeconomic development in human society and greenhouse gas emissions (SSP1-RCP2.6, SSP2-RCP4.5, SSP3-RCP7.0, SSP5-RCP8.5). Under SSP1-RCP2.6, corresponding to a transition towards sustainable development, we found stable habitat suitability for most species and overall stable assemblage mean body weight compared to the present, with an average increase in species richness (in 2100: 3.03 +/- 1.55 compared to today ' s 2.25 +/- 1.31 species/area). The other scenarios are generally unfavourable for the conservation of wild large herbivores, although under the SSP5-RCP8.5 scenario there would be increase in species richness and assemblage mean body weight in some southern regions (e.g. + 62.86 kg mean body weight in Balkans/Greece). Our results suggest that a shift towards a sustainable socioeconomic development would overall provide the best prospect of our maintaining or even increasing the diversity of wild herbivore assemblages in Europe, thereby promoting trophic complexity and the potential to restore functioning and self-regulating ecosystems. This article is part of the theme issue 'Ecological novelty and planetary stewardship: biodiversity dynamics in a transforming biosphere'.

AB  - Enhancing functional connectivity is key to achieving a sustainable agroecosystem. There has been an increase in using connectivity metrics to understand how spatial heterogeneity affects dispersal, yet most studies have been single-species focused. Variability in species' ecological traits, such as movement ability, are predicted to interact with landscape configuration in determining connectivity. We used network analysis to evaluate the landscape connectivity fortwo native bird species with distinct dispersal abilities and habitat requirements in an agricultural landscape dominated by sheep and beef cattle farming in north Canterbury, New Zealand. Both bird species would have previously occupied this landscape and the recovery of their populations is desired; however, New Zealand pigeon/ kereru over bar (Hemiphaga novaeseelandiae) is highly mobile, whereas the southern brown kiwi/ tokoeka (Apteryx australis) is flightless. We compared the connectivity properties, and network metrics between a more densely forested agricultural area and an adjacent area dominated by pastoral grassland. The primary contributors to the dispersal networks were the habitability of the matrix, size and spatial arrangement of vegetation patches, and the species' gap-crossing ability. Tokoeka were able to utilise smaller patches as stepping-stones for dispersal, while kereru over bar had larger home ranges and moved between more dispersed habitat patches. Several large forest patches were key in providing multiple and stronger links among habitat patches for both species. Our work suggests that one size does not fit all, rather, conservation strategies should account for multiple species' life-histories and movement traits when creating connected ecological networks that comprise a functional agricultural landscape.

AB  - Soil biodiversity and food webs are altered by intensive farming practices. To assess the response of nematofauna to intensive tomato production, soil samples were collected from tomato fields and adjacent natural vegetation in Kirinyaga County, Kenya. Nematodes were assigned to different genera before computation of indices and metabolic footprints. In tomato, there was a high abundance of Meloidogyne and Rotylenchus. Population densities of Aporcelaimellus and Aporcelaimus were greater in natural vegetation. Natural vegetation had more cp 5 nematodes while higher proportions of cp 2 and cp 3 groups were observed in tomato. Omnivores and herbivores occurred in greater numbers in natural vegetation and tomato, respectively. Natural vegetation had a higher Maturity Index (MI), MI 2-5 and Structure Index. In the two systems, there were no differences in the Channel and Enrichment Indices but the Basal Index was higher in tomato. Herbivore footprint was greater in tomato while natural vegetation had greater structure and omnivore footprints. Soil food web in tomato was more degraded with high pest pressure while natural vegetation was highly structured. The results suggest that intensive tomato cultivation in Kirinyaga County, alters the nematode community and food web structure.

AB  - Blooms of the non-toxic dinoflagellate Prorocentrum donghaiense are common in the East China Sea; however, the in situ impacts of these blooms on zooplankton community functions have not yet been conducted in this area. Using functional trait-based methods, we found that P. donghaiense bloom significantly changed the zooplankton community structure and functions in the coastal water of the East China Sea. Zooplankton species richness and biodiversity increased after the bloom. Based on body length, feeding type, trophic group and reproductive mode, we categorized zooplankton into four functional groups and characterized their dynamics. Before and after the bloom, the zooplankton community was dominated by herbivorous- and free-spawner- lineages represented by copepods and tunicates, while during the bloom, the zooplankton community was dominated by carnivorousand egg-brooding- lineages represented by small jellyfish, chaetognaths and copepods.

AB  - As climate change accelerates in northern latitudes, there is an increasing need to understand the role of climate in influencing predator-prey systems. We investigated wolf population dynamics and numerical response in Denali National Park and Preserve in Alaska, United States from 1986 to 2016 under a long-term range of varying climatic conditions and in the context of prey vulnerability, abundance, and population structure using an integrated population modeling approach. We found that wolf natality, or the number of wolves added to packs, increased with higher caribou population size, calf:cow ratio, and hare numbers, responding to a 1-year lag. Apparent survival increased in years with higher calf:cow ratios and cumulative snowfall in the prior winter, indicators of a vulnerable prey base. Thus, indices of prey abundance and vulnerability led to responses in wolf demographics, but we did not find that the wolf population responded numerically. During recent caribou and moose population increases wolf natality increased yet wolf population size declined. The decline in wolf population size is attributed to fewer packs in recent years with a few very large packs as opposed to several packs of comparable size. Our results suggest that territoriality can play a vital role in our study area on regulating population growth. These results provide a baseline comparison of wolf responses to climatic and prey variability in an area with relatively low levels of human disturbance, a rare feature in wolf habitat worldwide.

AB  - In this study, we investigate the broader impacts of microplastics on ecosystem health and ecological risks, specifically through altered assimilation efficiency of aquatic organisms, an individual-level effect that has garnered significant attention recently. The Ecopath with Ecosim model is employed to assess these impacts, focusing on Baiyangdian Lake, China. We examine three scenarios: no microplastics effects (EPScenario 1) and current and assumed high microplastics concentrations effects (EPScenario 2 and EPScenario 3). Results indicate that considering the adverse effects of microplastics on aquatic organisms' assimilation efficiency worsens Baiyangdian Lake's ecosystem health. "Bad" memberships are 0.459, 0.506 and 0.555 for EPScenarios 1-3, respectively. Ecosystem maturity is severely impacted, reducing it to less than half its original level due to decreased total respiration of consumers and increased total system throughput in the entire ecosystem. Furthermore, there are over 3% reductions in ecosystem function due to the decrease in the relative ascendency and over 18% reductions in food web structure caused by the decrease in Finn's cycling index and Finn's mean path length. A critical aspect of this research is the relationship between assimilation efficiency and microplastics dynamics in the food web. Diminished assimilation efficiency results in lower microplastics concentrations in detritus but increased levels in water. This shift significantly affects trophic transfer, reducing microplastics concentrations in organisms that primarily feed on detritus. Conversely, the accumulation of microplastics on plant surfaces in water elevates the concentrations in organisms that feed predominantly on plants. These dynamics are crucial for understanding the ecological risks associated with microplastics, which vary significantly based on the primary food sources of aquatic organisms. The risk escalates in food chains dependent on detritus and diminishes in those reliant on plant-based food chains. This insight is also vital in assessing human health risks related to dietary intake of microplastics from aquatic food sources, highlighting increased risks for consumers of herbivorous and filter-feeding fish. Overall, this research offers critical insights into the complex effects of microplastics on freshwater ecosystems, emphasizing assimilation efficiency's role in managing ecological and health implications. These findings have significant practical implications for ecosystem management, providing a basis for strategies to mitigate microplastic impacts on aquatic organisms and ecosystem health. Additionally, understanding these effects can inform public health initiatives by highlighting risks from consuming contaminated aquatic organisms. Effective management and policy measures can be also developed to reduce microplastic pollution, protecting both ecosystems and public health.

AB  - Fecal microbial biomarkers represent a less invasive alternative for acquiring information on wildlife populations than many traditional sampling methodologies. Our goal was to evaluate linkages between fecal microbiome communities in Rocky Mountain elk (Cervus canadensis) and four host factors including sex, age, population, and physical condition (body-fat). We paired a feature-selection algorithm with an LDA-classifier trained on elk differential bacterial abundance (16S-rRNA amplicon survey) to predict host health factors from 104 elk microbiomes across four elk populations. We validated the accuracy of the various classifier predictions with leave-one-out cross-validation using known measurements. We demonstrate that the elk fecal microbiome can predict the four host factors tested. Our results show that elk microbiomes respond to both the strong extrinsic factor of biogeography and simultaneously occurring, but more subtle, intrinsic forces of individual body-fat, sex, and age-class. Thus, we have developed and described herein a generalizable approach to disentangle microbiome responses attributed to multiple host factors of varying strength from the same bacterial sequence data set. Wildlife conservation and management presents many challenges, but we demonstrate that non-invasive microbiome surveys from scat samples can provide alternative options for wildlife population monitoring. We believe that, with further validation, this method could be broadly applicable in other species and potentially predict other measurements. Our study can help guide the future development of microbiome-based monitoring of wildlife populations and supports hypothetical expectations found in host-microbiome theory.

AB  - BackgroundWinters are expected to warm more than summers in central and northern Europe, with largely unknown effects on grassland plant communities.AimsBy studying the interactions between winter warming and summer grazing, we aimed to disentangle their effects and give recommendations for future grassland management.MethodsOur study area Upper Teesdale, England has winter temperatures close to 0 degrees C and a well-studied vegetation, known for its arctic-alpine species growing at their climatic warm range limits. We set up a winter warming experiment using open top chambers (ca. +0.5 degrees C) from mid-September until mid-May 2019 to 2022 and excluded sheep grazing during summer in a fully factorial design.ResultsGraminoid biomass increased, and bryophyte biomass decreased with winter warming. There was little to no evidence that winter warming affected any of the other plant response variables we measured, neither did grazing nor the interaction between winter warming and grazing.ConclusionsOur experiment was relatively short in duration and treatments were realistic in magnitude, therefore the plant communities responded only slightly. Nevertheless, our data suggest a change towards more dominant vascular species and less bryophytes with winter warming, which might lead to lasting changes in the plant communities in the longer-term if not buffered by suitable grazing management.

AB  - Drone use has been rapidly increasing in protected areas in North America, and potential impacts on terrestrial megafauna have been largely unstudied. We evaluated behavioral responses to drones on two terrestrial charismatic species, feral horse (Equus caballus) and bison (Bison bison), at Theodore Roosevelt National Park (North Dakota, United States) in 2018. Using a Trimble UX5 fixed-wing drone, we performed two flights at 120 m above ground level (AGL), one for each species, and recorded video footage of their behaviors prior to, during, and after the flight. Video footage was analyzed in periods of 10 s intervals, and the occurrence of a behavior was modeled in relation to the phase of the flights (prior, during, and after). Both species displayed behavioral responses to the presence of the fixed-wing drone. Horses increased feeding (p-value < 0.05), traveling (p-value < 0.05), and vigilance (p-value < 0.05) behaviors, and decreased resting (p-value < 0.05) and grooming (p-value < 0.05). Bison increased feeding (p-value < 0.05) and traveling (p-value < 0.05) and decreased resting (p-value < 0.05) and grooming (p-value < 0.05). Neither species displayed escape behaviors. Flying at 120 m AGL, the drone might have been perceived as low risk, which could possibly explain the absence of escape behaviors in both species. While we did not test physiological responses, our behavioral observations suggest that drone flights at the altitude we tested did not elicit escape responses, which have been observed in ground surveys or traditional low-level aerial surveys. Our results provide new insights for guidelines about drone use in conservation areas, such as the potential of drones for surveys of feral horses and bison with low levels of disturbance, and we further recommend the development of in situ guidelines in protected areas centered on place-based knowledge, besides existing standardized guidelines.

AB  - Simple Summary Buffalo milk has a significantly greater fatty acid content, up to 11%, than cow's milk, making buffalo milk more suitable for dairy products such as cheese. Several factors affect the quantity and proportion of milk fatty acids, and among the intrinsic factors, breed is important. However, the role of breed is still not fully understood. It is known that gastrointestinal microbiota serve as a key factor in modulating the content of milk fatty acids, since breed affects the type of gastrointestinal microbiota and consequently the milk fatty acids (FA). Therefore, we used 16S rDNA sequencing to analyze the microbial causes of different milk fatty acids in two breeds of dairy buffaloes. The results showed that the abundance of fatty acids such as C18:3 and C18:2c9t11 in Murrah buffalo milk was associated with the abundance of bacteria such as Acetobacter and Ruminalococcus in the rumen, as well as bacteria such as UCG-005 in the feces.Abstract This experiment investigated gastrointestinal microbes' role in milk fatty acid differences between Murrah and Nili-Ravi buffaloes. After 30 days of a basal diet, rumen microbial diversity was similar, but Murrah buffaloes had greater partially unsaturated fatty acids like C18:2c9t11. Rumen bacteria like Acetobacter, Ruminococcus, and Prevotellaceae_YAB2003_group correlated positively with milk fatty acids C22:5n-6 and C18:3 in Murrah. Fecal microbial beta diversity differed, with UCG-005 and Prevolla positively correlated with C18:2c9t11 and C22:5n-6. The greater quantity of milk fatty acids C18:3, C18:2c9t11, and C22:5n-6 in Murrah milk was linked to rumen and fecal microbes. This suggests that gastrointestinal microbes like Acetobacter, Ruminococcus, and UCG_005 regulate milk fatty acid concentrations in buffaloes.

AB  - Herbivory can hinder restoration success by limiting the recovery of plant biodiversity. This study investigates whether plant-plant interactions, such as associational defenses, can increase the survival of a palatable species in restoration contexts where herbivory inhibits recovery. Specifically, we investigate the potential of associational defenses by the perennial Nuphar advena (yellow pond-lily) to influence the growth and survival of Zizania aquatica (annual wild rice) in a freshwater tidal marsh restoration where goose herbivory has limited Z. aquatica recovery. Wild rice was planted within exclosures and unfenced control plots located within patches of N. advena or adjacent mudflat. In an additional treatment to test the negative effects of light competition, we planted Z. aquatica in exclosures located within experimental clearings in N. advena patches. We also surveyed grazing pressure on naturally-occurring Z. aquatica within transects that spanned N. advena patches and adjacent mudflat. Based on observational and experimental results, N. advena provided clear protection from grazing for Z. aquatica. However, there was a cost to Z. aquatica growing in N. advena patches- plantings within N. advena had greater mortality and significantly reduced biomass due to low light availability.

AB  - Selection, dispersal and drift jointly contribute to generating variation in microbial composition within and between hosts, habitats and ecosystems. However, we have limited examples of how these processes interact as hosts and their microbes turn over across latitudinal gradients of biodiversity and climate. To bridge this gap, we assembled an extensive dataset of 580 skin bacteriomes from 22 amphibian species distributed across a 10 degrees latitudinal range in Chile. Amphibians are susceptible to the fungal pathogen Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd), which infects their skin, potentially leading to changes in the normal skin microbiome (i.e., dysbiosis). Using comparative methods, accounting for pathogen infection and implementing resampling schemes, we found evidence of phylosymbiosis, characterised by more similar bacterial communities in closely related amphibian species. We also compared how neutral processes affected the assembly of skin bacteria by focusing on two widespread species from our dataset: the Chilean four-eyed frog (Pleurodema thaul) and Darwin's frog (Rhinoderma darwinii). Neutral models revealed that dispersal and chance largely facilitated the occurrence of similar to 90% of skin bacteria in both species. Deterministic processes (e.g., phylosymbiosis, active recruitment of microbes, microbe-microbe interactions) explained the remaining fraction of the bacteriomes. Amphibian species accounted for 21%-32% of the variance found in non-neutral bacterial taxa, whereas the interaction with Bd carried a weaker but still significant effect. Our findings provide evidence from ectotherms that most of their skin bacteria are subject to dispersal and chance, yet contemporary and historical contingencies leave strong signatures in their microbiomes even at large geographical scales.

AB  - The deep Peru Basin is characterised by a unique abyssal scavenging community featuring large numbers of hermit crabs (Probeebei mirabilis, Decapoda, Crustacea). These are atypical hermit crabs, not carrying a shell, but on some occasions carrying an anemone (Actiniaria). The reason why some hermit crabs carry or not carry anemones is thought to be indicative of a changed environment, outweighing the cost/benefit of their relationship. Here we present the temporal variation of abundances of P. mirabilis with and without anemones, spanning more than two decades, following a benthic impact experiment. An overall decrease in hermit crab densities was observed, most noticeable and significant after 26 years and characterised by a loss of Actiniaria on the Probeebei mirabilis' pleon. Whether this is a delayed response to the benthic impact experiment carried out 26 years' prior or a natural variation in the population remains to be corroborated by an extension of the time-series. Attention is drawn to the limitations of our knowledge over time and space of the abyssal community dynamics and the urgent necessity to fill in these gaps prior to any type of deep-sea exploitation.

AB  - With climate change, terrestrial fauna in riparian floodplain ecosystems must adapt to a predicted increase in frequency and magnitude of fluvial perturbations. Seasonal migration to seek refuge from floodwaters represents a central adaptation strategy, but may entail risky navigation of anthropogenic spaces in heterogeneous landscapes. Here, we demonstrate the opportunities and constraints large-bodied mammalian herbivores face during an adaptive response of obligatory flood-driven refuge migration, across a human-dominated environment. Our study system, centred around a productive protected area--Kaziranga National Park in Assam, Northeast India-on the floodplains of the Brahmaputra River, is home to an abundance of large herbivores that undertake seasonal migrations in response to floods. We contrast species distribution data during a major flood event with those from the dry season to illustrate season-specific movement and space use decisions of large herbivores ranging in body mass from the 3000-kg Asian elephant Elephas maximus to the 20-kg muntjac Muntiacus muntjak. In the dry season, most large herbivores--a majority of which are endangered and threatened by anthropogenic pressures--avoided areas with a strong human footprint, while preferring spaces with high land-use diversity. During the floods, such species were pushed out of inundated habitats within the protected area, and they chose tomove through woodlands and areas under bamboo cover on private lands, as they migrated to forested refugia on higher ground. Our results showhowseasonal environmental constraints shaped by floods determine the internal motivation of animals to risk traversing a human-dominated space to seek refuge, which contextually defines how animals view and navigate the landscape. Such insights underscore the importance of dynamic and adaptive planning, and participatory conservation efforts, to facilitate connectivity in the changing environment and climate of the present Anthropocene.

AB  - This article describes a novel methodological approach for the integrated sustainability assessment of pasture-based dairy sheep systems. Most studies on livestock system sustainability focus on animal production, farm profitability, and mitigation strategies of greenhouse gas emissions. However, recent research indicates that pasture-based livestock farming also contributes positively to rural areas, and the associated increase in plant diversity promotes ecosystem functioning and services in natural and managed grasslands. Likewise, little attention has focused on how pasture-based livestock systems affect soil carbon changes, biodiversity, and ecotoxicity. Furthermore, the quality and safety of food products, particularly sheep milk and cheese, and socioeconomic issues such as cultural heritage and consumer behavior are often neglected in livestock system sustainability assessments. To improve the analysis of sustainability and adaptation strategies of livestock systems, we suggest a holistic approach that integrates indicators from diverse disciplines with complementary methods and models capable of capturing the complexity of these systems at multiple scales. A multidisciplinary perspective generates new indicators to identify critical trade-offs and synergies related to the resilience of dairy sheep livestock systems. A multiscale approach provides insights on the effects of socioeconomic and environmental changes associated with current dairy sheep grazing systems across multiple scales. The combined approach will facilitate the development and progressive implementation of novel management strategies needed to adapt pasture-based dairy sheep farms to changing conditions under future socioeconomic and environmental scenarios.

AB  - Many agricultural management tactics, such as reduced tillage, aim to promote biodiversity and ecosystem services. Responses to such tactics can be context dependent, however, and differentially impact (i) functional groups of service-providing organisms and (ii) crop yields. In canola (Brassica napus L., B. rapa L.) crop fields, we assessed how soil tillage and landscape context (amount of semi-natural habitat within 1 km of each field) affected arthropod biodiversity and crop yield. We assessed effects of full (multiple tillage passes that leave soil surface bare), intermediate (tilled once and some stubble remains), or no (seed planted directly into last year's stubble) tillage on functional groups with unique diets and reproductive strategies: (i) herbivores, (ii) kleptoparasites, (iii) parasitoids, (iv) pollinators, and (v) predators. Effects of tillage and landscape context on arthropod abundance and diversity varied across functional groups. Pollinators responded strongest to tillage, benefitting from intermediate tillage. Predators and herbivores responded strongly to landscape context, as both were more abundant in landscapes with more semi-natural habitat. Our results suggest that natural history differences among functional groups mediate effects of landscape context on biodiversity. However, variation in arthropod communities had little effect on canola crop yield. The effects of soil management practices on aboveground arthropods are complex, and practices thought to increase some aspects of agricultural sustainability may not be beneficial in other contexts. Identifying practices such as intermediate tillage that may increase soil quality and arthropod diversity is a key to designing agricultural ecosystems that will effectively benefit both biodiversity and human well-being.

AB  - Enterocytozoon bieneusi is considered to be a microsporidial species of humans and animals in the worldwide. Limited data have been reported on the prevalence and genotypes of E. bieneusi in livestock and wild animals around Qinghai Lake in the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau area, which shares water sources, grasslands, and harsh climate with high altitudes. In this study, fecal samples from 110 Tibetan sheep, 128 yaks, 227 wild birds, 96 blue sheep (Pseudois nayaur) and 268 Przewalski's gazelle (Procapra przewalskii) around Qinghai Lake were collected, and then tested for E. bieneusi by PCR and sequencing analysis based on the ribosomal internal transcribed spacer. Among them, ten (9.09%) samples from Tibetan sheep, five (3.91%) from yaks, five (2.20%) from wild birds, one (1.04%) from wild blue sheep and two (0.75%) from Przewalski's gazelle were positive for E. bieneusi. Among sheep, there were nine E. bieneusi genotypes, including two known genotypes (BEB6 and J), and seven novel genotypes (named CHS18-CHS24). From yaks, four genotypes were identified, including two known ones (BEB4 and J) and two novel genotypes (named CHN15 and CHN16). While in wild animals, eight genotypes were found, including five different genotypes from wild bids, with three known genotypes (EbpC, J and NCF2), two novel genotypes (named CHWB1 and CHS24), and two genotypes from Przewalski's gazelle, with one known genotype J and one novel genotype CHWPG1, and one novel genotype CHWBS1 from blue sheep. According to the phylogenetic analysis, five isolates belonged to group 1, and the others were clustered into group 2. This study provides unique data on the epidemiological reports and potential risk factors for E. bieneusi in both domesticated livestock and wild animals around Qinghai Lake in the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau area; it is important to better understand the molecular epidemiology and zoonotic potential of E. bieneusi in the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau area.

AB  - Summer diets are crucial for large herbivores in the subarctic and are affected by weather, harassment from insects and a variety of environmental changes linked to climate. Yet, understanding foraging behavior and diet of large herbivores is challenging in the subarctic because of their remote ranges. We used GPS video-camera collars to observe behaviors and summer diets of the migratory Fortymile Caribou Herd (Rangifer tarandus granti) across Alaska, USA and the Yukon, Canada. First, we characterized caribou behavior. Second, we tested if videos could be used to quantify changes in the probability of eating events. Third, we estimated summer diets at the finest taxonomic resolution possible through videos. Finally, we compared summer diet estimates from video collars to microhistological analysis of fecal pellets. We classified 18,134 videos from 30 female caribou over two summers (2018 and 2019). Caribou behaviors included eating (mean = 43.5%), ruminating (25.6%), travelling (14.0%), stationary awake (11.3%) and napping (5.1%). Eating was restricted by insect harassment. We classified forage(s) consumed in 5,549 videos where diet composition (monthly) highlighted a strong tradeoff between lichens and shrubs; shrubs dominated diets in June and July when lichen use declined. We identified 63 species, 70 genus and 33 family groups of summer forages from videos. After adjusting for digestibility, monthly estimates of diet composition were strongly correlated at the scale of the forage functional type (i.e., forage groups composed of forbs, graminoids, mosses, shrubs and lichens; r = 0.79, p < .01). Using video collars, we identified (1) a pronounced tradeoff in summer foraging between lichens and shrubs and (2) the costs of insect harassment on eating. Understanding caribou foraging ecology is needed to plan for their long-term conservation across the circumpolar north, and video collars can provide a powerful approach across remote regions.

AB  - We developed simple practical methods to estimate deer appearance frequency and damage risk for cedar saplings protected by tree shelters, by using field signs such as browsed understory plants, debarked trees, and animal trails. The appearance frequency of the sika deer was recorded using camera traps at 29 clear-logged and young plantation sites in the Shikoku Island of western Japan. Field signs such as fecal pellets, footprints, animal trails, and browsed plants were recorded in three transects that were 2 m x 50 m each, located at the margins of the sites. Cubic regression analysis showed that the frequency of deer appearance could be predicted from the number of browsed plant species categorized into three ranks, that is, 0, 1, and >= 2 species. To use this method, plant species are not required for identification, as the user can simply judge whether browsed plants found in 5-m sections are all the same species or not. The damage of sheltered cedar saplings was assessed at 36 sites in the Kyushu and Shikoku Islands of western Japan, and surveys of deer field signs were also conducted. The proportion of heavily damaged saplings could be determined from the indices of binary summarized data of bark stripping and animal trails using a logistic regression model. The indices derived from the field signs will help forest managers to detect relatively low frequency of deer appearances and high risk of cedar sapling damage at a sheltered plantation in the western Japan.

AB  - In southern European temperate forests, coppicing is a traditional form of forest management that shaped the present cultural landscape, providing multiple ecosystem services. Roe deer densities have been growing notably during the last decades mainly due to the abandonment of rural areas, changes in human land use and restocking.The impact of roe deer on coppice forests can affect the resprouting and, in turn, compromise the products and ecosystem services provided by these forests. During coppicing, stems are cut down close to the ground, where the growing shoots are exposed to deer browsing, especially during the early years following cutting.In this study, using a browsing exclusion experiment, we investigated the impact of browsing on temperate mountain hardwood coppice forests in the western Italian Alps over a period of eleven years following coppicing.We found that the impact of browsing was highest in the first two years following coppicing, with Quercus pubescens and Castanea sativa being the most affected tree species. The height of shoots was the variable that showed the biggest difference between fenced and unfenced areas. A significant negative effect of browsing on shoot height was found at the beginning of the experiment, with shoots growing in unfenced area showing the lowest height increments. After the third year, when the browsing intensity diminished, we observed the opposite trend, with shoots growing in unfenced areas showing higher height increments compared with fenced areas. A similar trend was observed also for the diameter of shoots over the course of the experiment. Eleven years after coppicing, however, the structural characteristics of the natural regeneration converged at all sites and in both fenced and unfenced areas.This study shows that coppice forests are resilient to browsing and are capable to recover growth loss within a few years after browsing has naturally diminished and stopped. The research conducted also points out the importance of medium-to long-term monitoring to assess post-disturbance dynamics and evaluate implications for management.

AB  - Although leaf toughness is an essential plant adaptation to herbivore pressure and environmental stress, the relationships of leaf toughness with leaf anatomy and photosynthetic traits, and its spatial variations within tropical rainforests, remain poorly understood. We measured these traits in 103 tree species belonging to 27 families from the canopy to understory using a canopy crane system in a tropical rainforest in Sarawak, Malaysia. We focused on the leaf anatomical trait of bundle-sheath extensions (BSEs) around the vascular bundle due to their diverse ecophysiological functions. We divided the trees into heterobaric species with BSEs and homobaric species lacking BSEs, to investigate the relationships of leaf toughness with tree height, leaf functional traits such as carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) content, thickness, leaf mass per area (LMA) and the maximum photosynthetic rate (P-max). Leaf toughness, LMA, thickness and C and N contents increased with height regardless of BSE presence. Heterobaric leaves had greater toughness than homobaric leaves, whereas leaf thickness, LMA and C were similar between the two leaf types throughout the height gradient. We found that standardized toughness per thickness or C was greater in heterobaric species, as BSEs consist mainly of fibrous tissue. P-max was higher for heterobaric than homobaric leaves in the upper canopy presumably due to the functions of BSEs, including water conductivity, but did not differ with plant type in the lower layers. In other words, heterobaric species efficiently exploit the advantages of tougher leaves and higher P-max by having BSEs. The increased proportion of heterobaric species, with their tougher leaves and higher P-max, in the upper canopy is consistent with adaptation to physically stressful conditions in the tropical rainforest canopy, including high herbivore pressure and strong light.

AB  - The production and trade of agricultural commodities is a major driver of the loss of tropical biodiversity. In the Mid Zambezi Valley, Zimbabwe, which is home to many emblematic African mammals, cotton production has historically been a major driver of land cover change. The collapse of cotton production in Zimbabwe over the last decade provides a unique opportunity to understand the linkages between the profitability of cotton and land-use changes in this multifunctional landscape. By re-visiting 141 households that had been surveyed in 2007 and combining this panel survey data with a land cover analysis and secondary data, we demonstrate that the decreasing profitability of cotton led to a shift from cotton farming (mean area per farm decreasing from 1.79 +/- 2.05 ha in 2007 to 0.72 +/- 0.90 ha in 2020) to livestock farming (mean number of cattle and goats per farm increasing several-fold between 2007 and 2020), resulting in drastic land cover changes. Indeed, open vegetation (including crops, fallows and grazing areas) expanded from 10 to 20% of the total land cover area between 2007 and 2020. Populations of wildlife species have declined drastically during this period, although this cannot be attributed solely to the observed changes in land cover. However, increasing human-wildlife conflicts are likely to threaten the long-term coexistence of people and wildlife in the area. We argue that commodity crops can be an opportunity for nature conservation, not only a threat, and that conservation needs to support a `living income' for people coexisting with wildlife.

AB  - In this study, we investigated the impact of domestic and wild prey availability on snow leopard prey preference in the Kangchenjunga Conservation Area of eastern Nepal-a region where small domestic livestock are absent and small wild ungulate prey are present. We took a comprehensive approach that combined fecal genetic sampling, macro- and microscopic analyses of snow leopard diets, and direct observation of blue sheep and livestock in the KCA. Out of the collected 88 putative snow leopard scat samples from 140 transects (290 km) in 27 (4 x 4 km(2)) sampling grid cells, 73 (83%) were confirmed to be from snow leopard. The genetic analysis accounted for 19 individual snow leopards (10 males and 9 females), with a mean population size estimate of 24 (95% CI: 19-29) and an average density of 3.9 snow leopards/100 km(2) within 609 km(2). The total available prey biomass of blue sheep and yak was estimated at 355,236 kg (505 kg yak/km(2) and 78 kg blue sheep/km(2)). From the available prey biomass, we estimated snow leopards consumed 7% annually, which comprised wild prey (49%), domestic livestock (45%), and 6% unidentified items. The estimated 47,736 kg blue sheep biomass gives a snow leopard-to-blue sheep ratio of 1:59 on a weight basis. The high preference of snow leopard to domestic livestock appears to be influenced by a much smaller available biomass of wild prey than in other regions of Nepal (e.g., 78 kg/km(2) in the KCA compared with a range of 200-300 kg/km(2) in other regions of Nepal). Along with livestock insurance scheme improvement, there needs to be a focus on improved livestock guarding, predator-proof corrals as well as engaging and educating local people to be citizen scientists on the importance of snow leopard conservation, involving them in long-term monitoring programs and promotion of ecotourism.

AB  - Wood pastures have been characteristic farming types in the Pannonian biogeographical region over the centuries. In the present work, we studied wood-pastures of typical geographical locations in the North Hungarian Mountain Range of Hungary characterized by similar environmental conditions but grazed by different livestock. The sample area of Cser & eacute;pfalu was grazed by Hungarian Grey Cattle, while the Erd & odblac;b & eacute;nye was grazed by Hungarian Racka Sheep. Coenological records of the sites were collected from 2012 to 2021 in the main vegetation period according to the Braun-Blanquet method with the application of 2 x 2 m sampling quadrats, where the coverage estimated by percentage for each present species was also recorded. To evaluate the state of vegetation, 'ecological ordering' distribution, diversity, and grassland management values were used. Between the two areas, the grazing pressure of the two studied livestock produced different results. Based on the diversity values, woody-shrubby-grassland mosaic diversity values were high (Shannon diversity: 2.21-2.87). Cattle grazing resulted in a variable and mosaic-like shrubby area with high cover values. Based on our results, grazing by cattle provides an adequate solution for forming and conserving wood-pasture habitats in the studied areas of Hungary. However, if the purpose is to also form valuable grassland with high grassland management values, partly sheep grazing should be suggested.

AB  - This study provides a first attempt to describe the historical distribution and movement patterns of selected large herbivore (LH) species in Limpopo National Park (LNP), an area in Mozambique today connected to a network of transboundary conservation areas. Between 1976 and the early 2000s, most LH species were absent in this area following the civil war in Mozambique followed by intense poaching due to weak law enforcement capacity. Through the reconstruction of the historical and current distribution and movement patterns of seven LH species in five periods, we investigate possible changes in distribution and movement patterns over time. Data collection is based on a systematic literature search, censuses reports, online databases, dung count transects, and camera trap surveys. We mapped all LH observations and movements using ArcGIS 10.1. Our results reveal a dramatic collapse of LH populations between the peak of the colonial period and the post-colonial/civil war period (1800-2001), followed by a slight recovery from the post-proclamation of Great Limpopo Transfrontier Park to the current period (2002-2021). While LH population decline applied to all seven species, there are species-specific differences in the process of restoration: African elephant (Loxodonta africana), African buffalo (Syncerus caffer), and plains zebra (Equus quagga) appear to recover to a greater extent than giraffe (Giraffa camelopardalis), eland (Tragelaphus oryx), blue wildebeest (Connochaetes taurinus), and white rhino (Ceratotherium simum). We found evidence of the functioning of proposed wildlife corridors in the LNP. The results give reason to assume that restoration of populations of LH is still in a very early and vulnerable state and that further efforts are necessary to strengthen the slowly increasing populations of LH. Our results highlight the importance of combining past and current data as a guide for the restoration of threatened species in African savannas impacted by human activities.

AB  - Variation in late Holocene artiodactyl (e.g., deer, pronghorn, bighorn sheep) hunting in northern California has often been examined from a behavioral ecological perspective to understand past foraging and land -use practices and related changes in human behavior, including settlement patterns, technological change, social signaling, large-scale resource intensification, and anthropogenic resource depression. However, rarely are past climate records and proxies of human population density coupled with zooarchaeological estimates of artiodactyl abundance to evaluate the ecological and anthropogenic drivers of changes in species representation over time. To better understand changes in human behavior related to past large game hunting, we disentangle the causal relationships between late Holocene climate change, human demography, and artiodactyl abundance to assess whether climate change, human hunting, or both impacted the abundance of artiodactyls in zooarchaeological assemblages from northeastern California. We evaluate how climatic variability and inferred human settlement density impacted artiodactyl abundance using modeled paleoclimatic reconstructions, distributions of radiocarbon dates, and faunal data derived from 35 archaeological sites and 37,319 individual faunal specimens. Using piecewise structural equation models, we assess the direct and mediating effects between climate, human settlement density, and artiodactyl abundance and determine the individual effects of these variables on large game species representation in zooarchaeological assemblages. We find that expanding human settlement density and related increases in logistical foraging -not late Holocene climate change -directly impacts the relative abundance of artiodactyls in these assemblages. Moreover, our findings reveal that the effects of climate change are entirely mediated through human settlement density. While our study is unable to decipher if observed changes in human behavior were motivated by goals related to energetic maximization or costly signaling, our study does provide a useful framework for separating the effects of human- and climate -induced explanations for variation in species composition in faunal assemblages.

AB  - Wild carnivores are threatened by human activities, particularly by lethal responses to livestock predation. As natural prey populations decline, predation of livestock and consumption of discarded livestock 'waste' (carcasses and body parts) should increase. We investigated whether parameters linked to the production of livestock waste affected the likelihood of livestock predation. We interviewed 160 households near Ruaha National Park in Tanzania to obtain information on households, livestock ownership, predation and parameters linked to livestock waste production. Our analysis identified parameters that affected the likelihood of predation on cattle, sheep and goats. When these parameters were controlled for, we found an increased likelihood of cattle predation as waste from diseased and slaughtered cattle increased. Sheep predation was more likely and cattle predation was less likely as sheep deaths from starvation increased. Goat predation was more likely in medium-sized than smaller or larger villages, suggesting a trade-off to predators between the increasing benefit of more livestock waste and the costs of higher human disturbance and diminishing natural prey abundance as village size category increased. Our findings suggest that improved disposal of livestock waste from slaughtered cattle and measures to decrease cattle deaths from disease should reduce predation of highly prized cattle.

AB  - Aim We analyse the oldest available data on the high-elevation vegetation on Tenerife's Mt. Teide, namely the species shown in A. von Humboldt's (1817) Tableau Physique des Iles Canaries (TPIC), which is based on his own 1799 visit and an 1815 visit by L. von Buch and C. Smith. The analysis is of interest in the context of climate change and biotic changes, such as the eradication of non-native goats from the Teide National Park. Between 1944 and 2010, the summit region of Mt. Teide has warmed at a rate of 0.14 degrees C/decade. Location Mt. Teide on Tenerife, Canary Islands. Taxon Vascular plants. Methods We updated the taxonomy of the 197 species shown in the TPIC, data-mined publications and letters, searched relevant herbaria for surviving collections, and compared historic and modern species presence, absence and elevational ranges. Results Both Humboldt and Buch had to use formulas to convert barometer readings into elevations above sea level, and none of Humboldt's collections and few of Buch's are linked to precise elevations. The upper range limits of all 23 species for which we found data have shifted upward, with the average shift being 36.4 m per decade (1799/1815-2021). Four species that today are abundant were not recorded in 1815, suggesting population expansion, probably due to goat eradication. Main conclusions While our data cannot disentangle the effects of climate change and changing herbivory, they provide the earliest available record on the vegetation on Mt. Teide and illustrate the magnitude of change.

AB  - Conspecific negative distance- and density-dependence is believed to be one of the most important mechanisms controlling forest community assembly and species diversity globally. Plant pathogens, and insect and mammalian herbivores, are the most common natural enemy types that have been implicated in this phenomenon, but their general effects at different plant life stages are still unclear. Here, we conduct a meta-analysis of studies that involved robust manipulative experiments, using fungicides, insecticides or exclosures, to assess the contributions of different natural enemy types to distance- and density-dependent effects at seed and seedling stages. We found that conspecific negative distance- and density-dependence was more common at the seedling stage. Only 30% of studies showed significant conspecific negative distance- and density-dependence. Among those studies, applying fungicides significantly reduced the effect of conspecific negative distance-dependent mortality. Excluding large mammals reduced the effect of conspecifics, but with only marginal significance (p < 0.1). Our study confirms that plant pathogens have a significant impact on distance-dependent mortality and suggests that the impacts of herbivores on seedlings have been understudied. At the seed stage, large and small mammals, respectively, appear to weaken and enhance negative conspecific distance-dependent mortality. Future research should identify specific agents of mortality, investigate the interactions among different enemy types, and assess how global change may affect natural enemies and thus influence the strength of conspecific distance- and density-dependence.

AB  - More than 100 tidal marsh creation projects were constructed throughout the Fraser River Estuary, British Columbia, Canada from the 1980s to present. Past studies described and evaluated many of these projects and found varied success, but the underlying factors that determine project outcomes remain uncertain. Combining field sampling, spatial analysis, and statistical modeling of plant communities, we aim to address this knowledge gap by asking what factors influence the resilience of created marshes, as measured by (1) persistence of marsh vegetation, (2) native species dominance, and (3) species richness. We observed marsh recession in 40 of the 78 projects visited, representing 23,666 m2 (9.3%) of the 254,357 m2 of created marsh surveyed. Increases in mean site elevation had a negative effect on percent recessed area, while sites in the north branch of the river and sites further upriver were more prone to recession. From field observations and data interpretation we suggest that wake erosion and Canada Goose (Branta canadensis) herbivory may be drivers behind these losses and warrant further investigation. Dominance of native species declined with distance upriver, though invasive cattail (Typha angustifolia, T. x glauca) defied this trend, dominating outer estuary sites, particularly closed embayments, when present. Native and non-native richness shared similar patterns and were comparable between reference and created marshes, increasing on average with elevation and distance upriver. These findings offer insight into how site design and location influence the outcome of marsh creation projects, and the challenges presented by stressors and environmental change in estuaries.

AB  - Herbivores are generally considered to reduce plant fitness. However, as in natural communities they often feed on several competing plant species, herbivores can also increase plant fitness by reducing interspecific competition among plants. In this study, we developed a testable model to predict plant fitness in the presence of an interspecific competitor and a herbivore that feeds on both plant species. Our model allows prediction of the herbivore and competitor densities at which the focal species will benefit from herbivory. This can be estimated by quantifying the effects of the herbivore on the fitness of the focal plant and on its competitor, and by estimating the levels of intra- and interspecific competition in a pairwise fashion, respectively. We subsequently validated the model in indoor microcosms using three interacting species: an aquatic macrophyte (the giant duckweed Spirodela polyrhiza), its native competitors (green algae) and its native herbivore (the pond snail Lymnaea stagnalis). Additional outdoor mesocosm experiments supported our model under natural conditions. Together, this study provides a conceptual framework to understand how herbivores shape plant fitness in a community context.

AB  - Biodiversity within ecological communities has been shown to influence plant resistance and tolerance to herbivory, and may strongly interact with climate change. However, the effects of diversity within microbial symbionts on their plant hosts' responses to herbivores is less well documented, particularly within the context of agricultural systems. Here we examine the interactive effects of rhizobial diversity and drought in promoting soybean resistance and tolerance to insect and mammalian herbivores in an outdoor pot experiment. We demonstrate that soybean plants provided with a diverse mixture of rhizobial strains experience 30% less damage by chewing insect herbivores under both drought (reduced watering and increased tempera-ture) and ambient weather conditions, as well as half as much colonization by aphids under drought conditions. This effect was not due to the presence of any particularly beneficial rhizobial strain (i.e., not a selection effect), but rather due to an enhanced benefit provided by the rhizobial strains in combination (i.e., a complementarity effect). No effects of rhizobial diversity were observed on the rate of defoliation by rabbits. While rhizobial diversity did affect soybean resistance to insect herbivores, these differences in insect damage did not carry through to affect soybean growth or final yield. Thus, soybean plants exhibited high tolerance to herbivory regardless of our experimentally imposed rhizobial diversity or drought treatments. With future projec-tions for increased pest outbreaks and drought, understanding the factors that can sustainably enhance agricultural yield is criti-cal. Our results suggest that promoting rhizobial diversity within soybean agriculture may be one nature-based solution to promote the resistance of this critical crop to insect pests.(c) 2022 The Authors.

AB  - The Tasmanian emu (Dromaius novaehollandiae diemenensis) persisted alongside Aboriginal people for similar to 40,000 years, for the last similar to 14,000 years of which Tasmania was a large, continental island. This population of emus was extirpated soon after European colonization in the 19th century. Is hunting by people sufficient to explain the rapid demise of the emu or should we look to a synergy of pressures? Could wild emus be reintroduced to Tasmania? We investigated the distribution, hunting, and extinction of emus in Tasmania, before and after colonization, using population simulations, species distribution modelling, and land use analysis. We also evaluated the potential for rewilding with emus in present Tasmanian landscapes. The Tasmanian emu was a generalist with respect to vegetation and was widespread in the lowlands of eastern Tasmania. Prior to colonization, the maximum sustainable yield of adult emus was low, less than one per person per year. Following colonization, hunting rates quickly increased to a level that can account for rapid extinction. Large parts of Tasmania have both habitat and land uses suitable for an introduction of Australian mainland emus (D. n. novaehollandiae). This putative reintroduction of emus to Tasmania could reinstate several ecological and cultural roles but successful rewilding would require support from the wider community. We recommend field trial experiments, with methodologies co-designed by local community members.

AB  - Mangrove ecosystem in Pakistan have experienced significant changes, yet a comprehensive long-term field-based analysis has been lacking. This study addresses this gap by assessing mangrove cover changes between 1988 and 2024 using time-series Landsat satellite imagery in Google Earth Engine (GEE), supplemented with field observation and analyzed using the Random Forest algorithm. To ensure classification accuracy, the error matrix method was employed, yielding an overall accuracy (OA) of >= 93 % and a Cohen's Kappa coefficient (Kc) of >= 0.89 across all study areas. The results revealed that over the past 36 years, mangrove cover increased from approximately 44,486.09 ha to 106,636.64 ha, representing an annual growth rate of 3.88 %. All the study sites: Indus Delta, Miani Hor, Sandspit, Kalmat Hor, and Jiwani and Dasht River Delta, exhibited an increasing trend. In addition, three newly documented sites: Ankara Creek, Darag Hor and Kataho\Shadi Kor, showed a significant increase in mangrove cover, from 48.15 ha to 132.87 ha, with an annual growth rate of 12.69 % during the period of 2016-2024. These results highlight the success of targeted conservation strategies in coastal ecosystems in Pakistan. The climatic factor: positive trend of rainfalls, also supports the reforestation effort. However, despite this overall positive trend, mangrove pattern decreased dynamically at some sites due to anthropogenic pressures: pollution, camel grazing, and fuelwood collection. These findings are valuable for conservation efforts, ecosystems protection, climate resilience, and carbon sequestration initiatives.

AB  - Background. The Cerrado is a neotropical savannah with high mammalian diversity where wildfires are rather common and highly relevant to its ecological patterns and processes. The effects of fire on Cerrado mammals, however, are poorly understood.Aims. We investigated the effects of an unplanned large wildfire (burned area similar to 66 000 ha) on medium and large mammals in a Cerrado area in Brazil, focusing on fire-driven changes in community composition up to 3 years after fire.Methods. We evaluated burned and unburned sites before and after the wildfire, using 54 camera traps between 2017 and 2020. Total trap effort was 6334 days (unburned areas) and 7670 days (burned areas).Key results. We recorded 25 species in burned and 19 in unburned areas. Fire markedly affected the community up to 3 years after burning. A canonical correspondence analysis indicated that herbivores (tapirs and pampas deer) were common in the burned areas, with an increase in the relative abundance of carnivores the second year after fire.Conclusions. Community-level responses were complex, with guild-dependent changes and effects still detected 3 years after fire.Implications. Management strategies that include patch mosaic burns (with areas unburned and burned 1 and 2 years earlier) could contribute to maintenance of local mammal diversity.

AB  - Planted woodland islets can provide seeds for restoring forest ecosystems in Mediterranean old fields lacking seed sources, but other factors than seed arrival can also hinder the establishment of woody species. We experimentally examined factors affecting the emergence, survival, growth and recruitment of holm oak (Quercus ilex) seedlings juveniles from 25-year-old 100-m(2) oak woodland islets planted in a Mediterranean old field. Wet springs and summers increased seedling emergence and survival. Distance to the islets per se did not affect seedling performance. However, emergence and survival increased in microsites close to the islets in less sun-exposed orientations of the islets and far from the islets in more sun-exposed orientations. Damage by wild boar reduced emergence, and unsheltered seedlings had 26% lower survival than sheltered ones, reflecting herbivory. Herb community biomass and light reduction by herbs increased with distance from nearest islet; the sparse herb cover around islets was due to competition from woodland islets, not to herbivory. There was a mismatch between the pattern of seedling survival and how the abundance of naturally recruited oaks varied with distance from the nearest islet; this suggests that other drivers can counteract the spatial pattern of seedling survival. We conclude that natural regeneration of Q. ilex in old fields from planted woodland islets is slow (5.7 seedlings ha(-1) yr(-1)) due to acorn and seedling predation, and drought during spring and summer. Despite their small size, planted islets affected survival of oak juveniles depending on the orientation and distance relative to the islets.

AB  - European wild boar ( Sus scrofa) are invasive in many parts of the world. We assessed the potential for invasive spread by the wild boar in South Africa by determining potentially suitable habitats using bioclimatic variables and the maximum entropy model, which we then related to the present distribution records of the species in the country. We found that the wild boar has great potential to extend its invasive distribution range in South Africa. The most suitable habitats were in provinces with coastal boundaries, namely theWestern Cape, Eastern Cape and KwaZulu-Natal provinces. Additionally, through an online questionnaire, we found out that of the participants, only 26.9% knew of the prevalence of wild boar, 29.5% about human-wild boar conflict, and 29.6% knew of hunting sites for the species; however, the majority (62.9%) knew of the species on the National Alien and Invasive Species List. Moreover, we also recorded localities of prevalence and hunting sites within KwaZulu-Natal province. Wild boar's prevalence in South Africa must be strictly monitored and controlled as stipulated by the National Environmental Management: Biodiversity Act regulations to prevent its spread and negative impacts on biodiversity and the agriculture sector, as evident elsewhere.

AB  - Agricultural intensification is a major driver of biodiversity loss, but the majority of studies highlighting these threats come from industrialised agriculture in temperate countries of the global North. However, more than 30% of global food production is produced by smallholder farmers, particularly in Africa. We know very little about the impact of these farming practices on arthropod communities and associated ecosystems in dryland agroecosystems. We investigated the trophic group composition of arthropod communities (detritivorous, herbivorous, predatory & mixed feeders) and levels of associated ecosystem functions in replicated maize fields, paired adjacent natural bushveld habitats and the edge habitats between them in north-eastern Namibia and central-eastern Botswana during the dry and wet seasons. Predator activity densities differed significantly between habitats depending on the season, with higher numbers in natural habitats in the wet season but lower numbers in the dry season compared to maize fields. In general, edge habitats had higher numbers of predators than the other habitats. Predator attack rates on artificial caterpillars in both seasons and dung removal in the wet season were higher in habitats with natural vegetation (natural and edge). However, dung removal in the dry season and herbivory in the wet season were highest in the maize fields, the latter due to high level of fall armyworm infestation. Wet season multifunctionality was higher in natural habitats in Botswana, and to a lesser extent in Namibia, than in maize fields. Smallholder agriculture is not detrimental to decomposers, herbivores and mixed feeders compared to adjacent natural habitats, but may be detrimental to the provision of some ecosystem services. These results highlight the challenge of sustainably managing dryland agricultural land that is marginal for crop production, while providing smallholders with an optimal environment to benefit from the ecosystem services associated with arthropod communities. New conservation agriculture practices need to support the production of higher and more stable yields over time, while maintaining the limited impact of smallholder agriculture on biotic communities.

AB  - Variation in animal abundance is shaped by scale-dependent habitat, competition, and anthropogenic influences. Coyotes Canis latrans have dramatically increased in abundance while expanding their range over the past 100 years. Management goals typically seek to lower coyote populations to reduce their threats to humans, pets, livestock and sensitive prey. Despite their outsized ecological and social roles in the Americas, the factors affecting coyote abundance across their range remain unclear. We fit Royle-Nichols abundance models at two spatial scales in a Bayesian hierarchical framework to three years of data from 4587 camera trap sites arranged in 254 arrays across the contiguous USA to assess how habitat, large carnivores, anthropogenic development and hunting regulations affect coyote abundance. Coyote abundance was highest in southwestern USA and lowest in the northeast. Abundance responded to some factors as expected, including positive (soft mast, agriculture, grass/shrub habitat, urban-natural edge) and negative (latitude and forest cover) relationships. Colonization date had a negative relationship, suggesting coyote populations have not reached carrying capacity in recently colonized regions. Several relationships were scale-dependent, including urban development, which was negative at local (100-m) scales but positive at larger (5-km) scales. Large carnivore effects were habitat-dependent, with sometimes opposing relationships manifesting across variation in forest cover and urban development. Coyote abundance was higher where human hunting was permitted, and this relationship was strongest at local scales. These results, including a national map of coyote abundance, update ecological understanding of coyotes and can inform coyote management at local and landscape scales. These findings expand results from local studies suggesting that directly hunting coyotes does not decrease their abundance and may actually increase it. Ongoing large carnivore recoveries globally will likely affect subordinate carnivore abundance, but not in universally negative ways, and our work demonstrates how such effects can be habitat and scale dependent.

AB  - Timely monitoring of the sandy desert and sandy land (SDSL) dynamics and their driving factors is vital for ecological restoration policy-making to combat the expansion of the SDSL. Northern China, being the principal implementation area of ecological restoration projects, is ecologically fragile and encompasses almost all of the SDSL regions in China. To explore and compare the dominant driving factors for SDSL changes by extracting both aeolian activity information and vegetation indices, the SDSL datasets in northern China from 2010 to 2020 were first constructed in this study by the human-computer interactive interpretation method based on the series Landsat image data. The spatiotemporal dynamic characteristics of SDSL were subsequently analyzed, and the dominant driving factors of SDSL changes were further explored via the geodetector model by the fractional vegetation cover trend and the difference of aeolian activity index. The results showed a net decrease of 3,780.25 km2 in the total SDSL area between 2010 and 2020, and the decrease rate was 2.44 times higher in the shorter period of 2015-2020 compared to 2010-2015. The spatial differentiation between the western and eastern parts of the Helan Mountains was prominently exhibited by the relatively higher changed SDSL area in the eastern part (62.74% for aeolian activity weakened and 83.32% for aeolian activity intensified) and the increasingly changed SDSL area in the western part (from 33.09% to 39.60% in aeolian activity weakened and from 13.02% to 19.60% in aeolian activity intensified). Especially, the increased aeolian activity intensified SDSL area has happened on the southern edge of the Gurbantunggut Desert and along both sides of the Tarim River from 2015 to 2020 deserve attention. The co-driving of the multiple driving factors dominated the change of SDSL from 2010 to 2020, with the county mean value of the difference in aeolian activity index (MDAAI) and the county mean value of the trend in fractional vegetation cover (MFVCT) as dependent variables, respectively. Climatic factors of the mean annual average temperature, the mean annual cumulative precipitation, and the mean annual aridity index have a relatively larger explanatory power for the change of SDSL in both MDAAI and MFVCT. Anthropogenic factors of the mean annual afforestation area and the mean annual number of large livestock and sheep and goats (year-end) have a greater explanatory power in MDAAI, while the mean annual number of large livestock and sheep and goats (year-end) and the mean annual population density in MFVCT. In particular, the dependent variable MDAAI is better at identifing the dominant drivers of aeolian activity intensified SDSL area compared to MFVCT, with anthropogenic factors playing a stronger dominant role.

AB  - Herbivore diets are often generalistic, and communities of herbivores tend to share much of their diets. In the tropical lowlands of Malaysian Borneo, tens of different noncarnivorous land snail species are able to coexist in communities on limestone outcrops. We tried to answer the question whether diet differentiation plays a role in their coexistence. We show, with a large metabarcoding study of the plant diet from gut contents of 658 individual snails (from 26 species, with a focus on three of the most common species in the region), that the different snail species indeed share much of their plant diet, but that mean diet richness varies strongly among species (up to 15.3x). These differences are mostly explained by snail size, with larger snails having wider diets. Furthermore, phylogenetic analyses of the plant diet by individual snails showed signs of clustering in c. 28% of the individuals, possibly suggesting phylogenetic specialization, although such clustering was weak when diets were considered by species. We discuss how observed trends in diet richness and diet clustering could also be explained by random feeding, with larger species simply eating more or less specifically, and by other, noncompetitive interactions, such as snails avoiding desiccation. Our study shows how to efficiently put the power of metabarcoding to work in unravelling the complex community processes commonly encountered in tropical ecosystems and is thus of substantial relevance to both community

AB  - Depredation of domestic horses (Equus caballus) by jaguars (Panthera onca) is an example of human-wildlife conflict that has not received much attention. We monitored spatio-temporal activity and distribution of horses in a 2.64-km(2) fenced area in the dry forest of northwestern Costa Rica in response to 16 jaguar killings of horses during January-November 2017. We monitored 4 horses (2 males, 2 females) equipped with global positioning system transmitters from February-September 2018 to identify daily and seasonal patterns of use of cover types and a water source by horses. We then compared these results to the previous locations where jaguars killed horses to identify the circumstances under which horses seemed more vulnerable to jaguar predation. Based on 1,693 locations, horses spent most time in grassland (92%) rather than forest and edge vegetation (8%) and used a core area of 0.74 km(2) (kernel density estimation) to 0.86 km(2) (minimum convex polygon). Of 16 horse predation events by jaguars, 9 events (56%) occurred in grasslands, 4 in forested areas (25%), and 3 in the forest edge (19%), indicating predation events occurred disproportionately from expected counts based on horse use of vegetation. The predation sites were characterized by a higher proportion of edge and a lower proportion of forest compared to a random points. We suggest that when horses explored areas near the edge of forested areas, the chances of being preyed on by jaguars increased.

AB  - Global change is shifting the timing of biological events, leading to temporal mismatches between biological events and resource availability. These temporal mismatches can threaten species' populations. Importantly, temporal mismatches not only exert strong pressures on the population dynamics of the focal species, but can also lead to substantial changes in pairwise species interactions such as host-pathogen systems. We adapted an established individual-based model of host-pathogen dynamics. The model describes a viral agent in a social host, while accounting for the host's explicit movement decisions. We aimed to investigate how temporal mismatches between seasonal resource availability and host life-history events affect host-pathogen coexistence, that is, disease persistence. Seasonal resource fluctuations only increased coexistence probability when in synchrony with the hosts' biological events. However, a temporal mismatch reduced host-pathogen coexistence, but only marginally. In tandem with an increasing temporal mismatch, our model showed a shift in the spatial distribution of infected hosts. It shifted from an even distribution under synchronous conditions toward the formation of disease hotspots, when host life history and resource availability mismatched completely. The spatial restriction of infected hosts to small hotspots in the landscape initially suggested a lower coexistence probability due to the critical loss of susceptible host individuals within those hotspots. However, the surrounding landscape facilitated demographic rescue through habitat-dependent movement. Our work demonstrates that the negative effects of temporal mismatches between host resource availability and host life history on host-pathogen coexistence can be reduced through the formation of temporary disease hotspots and host movement decisions, with implications for disease management under disturbances and global change.

AB  - Climate change is currently considered one key threat to biodiversity. Species with a restricted distribution possibly will be more affected than those with wide ranges. Climate change can potentially affect both herbivores and their host plants and reduce their geographical ranges. The nature and intensity of their responses, however, may not necessarily match. We investigated the synergistic effects of climate change on two Neotropical butterfly species and their respective host plants at the end of twenty-first century. The species selected contrast in distribution extent, feeding habits and conservation status: Battus polystictus is widespread, oligophagous and common and Parides ascanius has a restricted distribution, is monophagous and is listed as vulnerable in the IUCN red list. Maps of the potential distribution of the butterflies and their host plants, as well as maps showing the changes in the ranges, in overlap area and direction of shifts were produced. Under forecasted climate change, all ranges and interaction areas decreased and the impacts were proportional to the intensity of change in future scenarios, either when compared all together or pairwise (p < 0.001). Based in our results estimation of climatically suitability, the monophagous butterfly with restricted distribution did suffer more severely these effects than the widespread generalist species. We did not anticipate, however, the possible strength of the predicted effects. Under the conditions modelled, P. ascanius would probably find no suitable conditions for occurrence, irrespectively of its host plant, and might go extinct. B. polystictus, on the other hand, suffered marked decreases in suitable area (46% for RCP4.5 and 91% for RCP8.5) and dramatic southward shifts (> 1439 km for RCP4.5 and > 1956 km for RCP8.5) on its range. This effect is further worsening because although most host plants are also much affected by the changes, the shift in their ranges is on average much smaller and each species responded in subtly different ways to the changing conditions, so that most of their future range may be spatially incompatible with the B. polystictus. We propose that the extinction risk of P. ascanius should be adjusted to critically endangered and point that species interactions and climate change must be accounted for in conservation planning. Implications for insect conservation The assessment carried out in this study contributes to the knowledge of climate change scenarios of butterfly species correlated with their host plants until the end of this century. These results can propose priority sites for conservation efforts like contribute to change status of P. ascanius to critically endangered, actually listed as vulnerable on the IUCN red list.

AB  - In the Arctic tundra, predators face recurrent periods of food scarcity and often turn to ungulate carcasses as an alternative food source. As important and localized resource patches, carrion promotes co-occurrence of different individuals, and its use by predators is likely to be affected by interspecific competition. We studied how interspecific competition and resource availability impact winter use of carrion by Arctic and red foxes in low Arctic Fennoscandia. We predicted that the presence of red foxes limits Arctic foxes' use of carrion, and that competition depends on the availability of other resources. We monitored Arctic and red fox presence at supp lied carrion using camera traps. From 2006 to 2021, between 16 and 20 cameras were active for 2 months in late winter (288 camera-winters). Using a multi-species dynamic occupancy model at a week-to-week scale, we evaluated the use of carrion by foxes while accounting for the presence of competitors, rodent availability, and supplemental feeding provided to Arctic foxes. Competition affected carrion use by increasing both species' probability to leave occupied carcasses between consecutive weeks. This increase was similar for the two species, suggesting symmetrical avoidance. Increased rodent abundance was associated with a higher probability of colonizing carrion sites for both species. For Arctic foxes, however, this increase was only observed at carcasses unoccupied by red foxes, showing greater avoidance when alternative preys are available. Supplementary feeding increased Arctic foxes' carrion use, regardless of red fox presence. Contrary to expectations, we did not find strong signs of asymmetric competition for carrion in winter, which suggests that interactions for resources at a short time scale are not necessarily aligned with interactions at the scale of the population. In addition, we found that competition for carcasses depends on the availability of other resources, suggesting that interactions between predators depend on the ecological context.
   We used a 16-year-long camera trap survey to analyze the interactions between Arctic and red foxes at supplied carrion in the Fennoscandian low-Arctic tundra. We found that competition for carcasses depends on the availability of other resources, suggesting that interactions between predators depend on the ecological context.image

AB  - Forest corridor has been considered the main strategy for maintaining gene flow between isolated populations, yet their effectivity is poorly tested. Assessing signatures of genetic variation loss, gene flowreduction and inbreeding may be helpful for conservation of the biodiversity that needs large continuousareas. Here we evaluated the genetic structure and diversity of the largest neotropical mammal, the lowland tapir (Tapirus terrestris), living in the largest Atlantic forest corridor in Brazil. We used fecal-derivedDNA, genotyped nine polymorphic microsatellite loci of 75 tapirs, and quantified genetic differentiation, genetic diversity, and landscape resistance to gene flow. We found genetic differentiation between theinland and coastal populations, which may be explained by elevation. Expected heterozygosity rangedbetween 0.64 (inland population) and 0.78 (coastal population), and a small Ne was observed in bothpopulations. We demonstrated that even large continuous rainforests are not totally permeable to the gene flow of large organisim. Our preception about the plant of continous corridors and their role for long-term survival of large mammals, suggesting that tapir conservation effortsshould be taken even for populations in the large protected areas.

AB  - Apex carnivores that rely primarily on predation play a central but complex role within scavenging ecology by potentially suppressing intra-guild competitors, but also facilitating them by providing a reliable supply of carrion. We investigated the competitive relationship between sympatric wolves (Canis lupus) and wolverines (Gulo gulo) in Norway across three seasons. We deployed remote cameras at fresh wolf kills (n = 29) and built Bayesian generalized linear mixed models (GLMMs) to explore the use of fresh wolf-killed prey by sympatric wolves and wolverines. Our results showed that wolves facilitated wolverines by providing scavenging opportunities. Biomass available from wolf kills was influenced by seasonal wolf prey preference and group size. Wolverines visited 100% of wolf kills in fall and winter, whereas only 18% in summer. We found that in winter, wolverines visited wolf kills 3.6 and 6.7 times more often than single wolves and wolf groups revisited their kills, and spent 10 and 25 times as much time at carcasses compared to single wolves and groups of wolves. Thus, wolverines played an important role in the depletion of wolf-killed prey, with potential effects on the scavenging behavior of other guild members. Understanding how globally threatened top predators may function as key species in scavenging processes is important to conservation as this may have community-wide cascading effects and support important ecosystem functions and services.

AB  - Small ape habitat throughout Malaysia is rapidly being lost, degraded, and fragmented, and the effects of these changes on the abundance on this taxon are currently unknown. This study assessed the group density of Hylobates agilis in virgin forest, previously logged forest (1960s-1990s), and recently logged forest (2015-2017) of the Ulu Muda Forest Reserve (UMFR), Kedah, Malaysia. We conducted fixed-point active acoustic triangulation at nine survey areas to estimate group density. We used vegetation "speed plots" and satellite imagery to quantify habitat characteristics and used model selection to identify ecological predictors of group density variation. The estimated group density of H. agilis in UMFR was 4.03 +/- 0.14 groups km(-2), with an estimated total of 2927 +/- 102 groups in areas below 450 m a.s.l. in UMFR. Group density did not differ significantly among habitat types. The best ecological predictors for group density were canopy cover and proportion of deforested area. Areas with recent deforestation were associated with relatively high group densities, suggesting compression of the populations persisting in these habitat types. The consistently high group densities detected in all forest types emphasizes the importance of degraded forest as habitat for H. agilis. Because of the threats to small apes in Malaysia, and the uncertain status of most populations, we recommend a nationwide population census and regular monitoring to inform conservation planning and implementation. Most urgently, we call for immediate and permanent protection of UMFR and other forests in the Greater Ulu Muda landscape to protect the globally significant populations of H. agilis, as well as other charismatic and threatened megafauna, birds, and flora in the area.

AB  - Interspecific interactions among species of the same guild play a critical role in shaping their realized niches, and their understanding may disclose mechanisms of coexistence. Investigating interactions among apex predators is of ecological and management interest, especially in human-dominated landscapes where type and intensity of their interspecific competition may be affected by human interference. During 2005-2010, we investigated, by means of GPS-telemetry, interactions between brown bears (n = 19) and wolves (n = 7) in a long-established national park in the central Apennines, Italy, where bears and wolves have always coexisted close to humans. Based on a K-select analysis and a randomization approach, we assessed the extent of overlap between the species' niches on a seasonal basis. Bears and wolves clearly segregated in fall but not during summer when overlap between their realized niches suggests a convergent adaptation to a seasonal peak of anthropogenic pressure. However, using multi-species resource selection functions (RSFs) at the home range level (i.e., third-order selection), we revealed that habitat selection by bears and wolves was reciprocally affected also when their niches overlapped, possibly disclosing mechanisms of fine-scale resource partitioning. In early summer, bears selected areas with a high probability of resource selection by wolves, but in late summer avoided areas positively selected by wolves. On the contrary, wolves avoided areas where the probability of resource selection by bears was high, both in late summer and fall. These results indicate that bears and wolves do interact in our study area and, although the actual behavioral mechanisms are unknown, they reciprocally and asymmetrically affect their realized niche and habitat selection patterns. Further research is needed to better understand how anthropogenic factors impact intraguild interactions and what are the effects at the population and community levels.

AB  - The beaver (Castor canadensis Khul) is a key species that is known to shape the composition of riparian forests. Ash trees (Fraxinus spp.) can be abundant in these forests. However, invasion by the emerald ash borer (Agrilus planipennis Fairmaire) in North America threatens their survival. The disappearance of ash will have a large impact on the riparian forest composition in itself. It is not known what the consequences would be for the remaining forest if ash plays an important role in the beaver diet. Inventory plots across an ash gradient were measured in Plaisance National Park, Quebec, Canada, to collect data and to establish if (1) trees and saplings of this genus were selected or avoided by beavers, (2) if other genera had a lower or a greater probability of being consumed compared to ash, and (3) if ash density could affect the probability of consumption of other genera. Of all genera present in the park, ash trees were selected in the highest number of plots. Only two genera, Carpinus and Populus, had a higher probability of being consumed than ash. These genera are not abundant in the park, and neither in riparian forests of the temperate biome, and thus are not good candidates to replace ash as a staple for beavers. The most abundant genus in riparian temperate forests, along with ash, is Acer. In this study, Acer trees were not selected, and as for Acer saplings, were less likely to be consumed than ash. Mixed results were obtained about genera that could become more likely to be consumed as ash density decreases. It would seem that the disappearance of ash would not cause a switch to a single or a few genera in the future, which may be due to the high diversity of genera present in temperate riparian forests. However, ash may not disappear completely due to its capacity to sprout following the death of the aboveground portion of ash trees. This scenario is discussed in light of the susceptibility of intermediate-sized ash stems to be colonized by the emerald ash borer and of the greater likelihood of beavers to feed on these same-sized stems.

AB  - The dusky kob Argyrosomus japonicus is an emerging aquaculture species in South Africa. To support industry growth, existing hatcheries frequently sell or donate excess eggs to neighbouring farms, raising concern over the potential transfer of infectious disease agents. Chemical disinfectants are frequently used to prevent transmission of diseases, but their application has shown large variations between finfish species and very little is known about the efficacy and impact of disinfectants on dusky kob eggs or larvae. A thorough understanding of the bacterial communities associated with specific fish species can inform the need for specific chemical agents and guide a more targeted approach for disease control and treatment. Therefore, this study used next generation sequencing (NGS, 16S rDNA gene) and downstream bioinformatics analysis to describe the bacterial microbiome associated with the eggs and rearing water of dusky kob. Four chemical disinfectants [chloramine-T (C-T), povo-iodine (P-I), hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) & formaldehyde (CH2O)], applied at different concentrations and times, were then tested for their ability to disinfect eggs and seawater. The impact of each disinfectant on early larval development was also assessed. A total of 11,605 individual bacterial operational transcriptional units (OTUs) were identified from the dusky kob egg (7352 OTUs) and hatchery water (4253 OTUs) samples. Non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) analysis revealed distinct differences in the composition of the microbiota associated with the egg and seawater samples. A moderate level of bacterial diversity was observed in all samples, with the seawater samples dominated by Rhodobacteraceae (65%) and Flavobacteriaceae (14%); whereas egg samples were dominated by Pseudoalteromonadaceae (49%), Vibrionaceae (27%) and Colwelliaceae (8%). A classical univariate statistical comparison identified 6 differentially abundant OTUs at phylum level, 12 at family level and 19 at genus level; with members of the family Vibrionaceae found to be significantly (P = 0.0011) more abundant on dusky kob eggs samples. All tested chemical disinfectants were capable of reducing the bacterial load in seawater in a dose dependent manner, with the number of culturable bacteria on eggs decreasing significantly following exposure to P-I and CH2O for five minutes (43% and 88% reduction in CFUs, respectively), compared with C-T and H2O2 (3% & 10%). Similarly, P-I and CH2O significantly decreased the culturability of Vibrio species on eggs (79% & 75%), compared with C-T and H2O2 (12% & 14%). None of the disinfectants appeared to have any adverse impact on larval growth and morphology.

AB  - Across southern Africa, the Pleistocene-Holocene transition was associated with changes in community composition of large mammalian herbivores, which included the extinction and extirpation of numerous grazers. Past research has often linked these changes to the contraction and disappearance of grasslands; however, the relationship between faunal and pollen records spanning this transition has not been systematically analyzed. Here, we investigate changes in fossil ungulate community composition and grass pollen abundance from late Quaternary sites across southern Africa to evaluate the extent to which these communities track paleovegetation change across this interval. Our dataset draws from faunal and pollen records across southern Africa. Results from the comparison of compositional changes in both records suggest a sub-continental-scale decoupling of grass cover and ungulate community composition during the Pleistocene-Holocene transition. Although there is strong evidence for a regional-scale decline in grazers from the Last Glacial-Interglacial Transition to the early Holocene, there is no evidence for regional-scale declines in grassy vegetation. Several potential mechanisms may account for this decoupling of grazers and grass abundance. The possible strengthening of winter rainfall systems during glacial Pleistocene may have played a role by enhancing year-round availability of grasses in the interior and by elevating moisture availability and productivity in the Cape Floristic Region. Alternatively, current paleoecological data allow for the possibility that Pleistocene 'grazers' consumed more dicots, such that their decline at the onset of the Holocene reflects dietary niche contraction rather than vegetation change. These findings contribute to a growing body of evidence challenging the link between grass abundance and grazer diversity and complicate our understanding of the drivers of late Quaternary extinctions in southern Africa.

AB  - Foraging by mammalian herbivores critically impacts threatened plants and ecosystems globally, resulting in numerous conservation challenges. Like many animals, herbivores incorporate olfactory cures to forage efficiently. When 'misinformation', i.e. misleading odour cues, degrade the reliability of odour information, forage efficiency often declines. How browsing mammalian herbivores respond to olfactory misinformation is unknown, but of interest, given their impacts. Using an Australian plant-herbivore system, we tested whether olfactory misinformation altered the behaviour of wild herbivores foraging for a preferred plant. Swamp wallabies (Wallabia bicolor) are mixed feeders, filling similar ecological roles to browsing herbivores such as Odocoileus deer in the Americas, and browse Eucalyptus seedlings, the foundation genus of many forests and woodlands. We deployed unrewarding odour from leaves surrounding focal seedlings, reducing the reliability with which the odour would predict the plant's location. Despite wallabies visiting seedlings surrounded by unrewarding odour at a similar rate to control seedlings, seedlings surrounded by unrewarding odour were 80 % less likely than controls to be browsed over two weeks. These results suggest that misinformation interferes with the ability of herbivores to recognise target plants as desirable food sources. Olfactory misinformation has potential to be used as a practical, non-lethal management strategy which, through harnessing the natural foraging behaviours of mammalian herbivores, could act to decrease their browsing pressure and mitigate their impact on vulnerable plants and ecosystems.

AB  - Collecting fine-scale occurrence data for marine species across large spatial scales is logistically challenging but is important to determine species distributions and for conservation planning. Inaccurate descriptions of species ranges could result in designating protected areas with inappropriate locations or boundaries. Optimizing sampling strategies therefore is a priority for scaling up survey approaches using tools such as environmental DNA (eDNA) to capture species distributions. In a marine context, commercial vessels, such as ferries, could provide sampling platforms allowing access to undersampled areas and repeatable sampling over time to track community changes. However, sample collection from commercial vessels could be biased and may not represent biological and environmental variability. Here, we evaluate whether sampling along Mediterranean ferry routes can yield unbiased biodiversity survey outcomes, based on perfect knowledge from a stacked species distribution model (SSDM) of marine megafauna derived from online data repositories. Simulations to allocate sampling point locations were carried out representing different sampling strategies (random vs regular), frames (ferry routes vs unconstrained), and number of sampling points. SSDMs were remade from different sampling simulations and compared with the "perfect knowledge " SSDM to quantify the bias associated with different sampling strategies. Ferry routes detected more species and were able to recover known patterns in species richness at smaller sample sizes better than unconstrained sampling points. However, to minimize potential bias, ferry routes should be chosen to cover the variability in species composition and its environmental predictors in the SSDMs. The workflow presented here can be used to design effective sampling strategies using commercial vessel routes globally for eDNA and other biodiversity survey techniques. This approach has potential to provide a cost-effective method to access remote oceanic areas on a regular basis and can recover meaningful data on spatiotemporal biodiversity patterns.

AB  - Plants defend themselves from herbivory by either reducing damage (resistance) or minimizing its negative fitness effects with compensatory growth (tolerance). Herbivore pressure can fluctuate from year to year in an early secondary successional community, which can create temporal variation in selection for defence traits. We manipulated insect herbivory and successional age of the community as agents of natural selection in replicated common gardens with the perennial herb Solidago altissima. In these genotypic selection experiments, herbivory consistently selected for better defended plants in both successional communities. Herbivore suppression increased plant survival and the probability of flowering only in mid-succession. Despite these substantial differences in the effects of herbivory between early and mid-succession, the selection on defence traits did not change. Succession affected selection only on aboveground biomass, with positive selection in early but not mid-succession, suggesting an important role of competition in the selective environment. These results demonstrate that changes in the community that affect key life-history traits in an individual species can occur over very short timescales in a dynamic secondary successional environment. The resulting community context-driven variation in natural selection may be an important, yet overlooked, contributor to adaptive mosaics across populations.

AB  - In the context of marine conservation, trawl fishing activity is the most important ecosystem stressor in demersal Med-iterranean waters. Limited management measures in bottom trawling have caused deep-sea stocks of the iconic Norway lobster Nephrops norvegicus to decrease over the last decade. This crustacean acts as an umbrella species for co-existing megafauna. Here, we used non-invasive Remote Operated Vehicle (ROV) video-surveys to investigate the status of a pilot deep-sea no-take reserve implemented in the northwestern Mediterranean by quantifying demo-graphic indicators of Norway lobsters and the co-existing benthic community, seafloor restoration, and the presence of marine litter. The results revealed that in the no-take reserve the Norway lobster stock showed higher abundance and biomass, and slightly larger body sizes than in the control area without fishing prohibition. Some taxa, such as the fishes Helicolenus dactylopterus and Trigla lyra and anemones of the family Cerianthidae, increased in abundance. We also observed that all trawling marks were smoothed and most of the seafloor was intact, clear indicators of the recovery of the muddy seafloor. The accumulation of marine debris and terrestrial vegetation was similar in the no-take reserve and the fished area. On the basis of the results of this study, we suggest that the use of no-take reserves might be an effective measure for recovering the Norway lobster stock, its co-existing megafauna community, and the surrounding demersal habitat. We also suggest that ROV video-survey might be a useful, and non-invasive method to monitor megafauna and seafloor status in protected deep-sea environments.

AB  - This study was aimed to (1) document the macromoth species richness and diversity along altitudinal gradients, (2) investigate the community structure along altitudinal gradients, and (3) analyze the similarity within each altitude using nonmetric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) ordination. In this study, macromoth community structures were investigated in Mt. Baegun, Korea, along the altitudinal gradients in 2012 and 2015. Diversity indexes and NMDS ordination were used for community structure in each altitudinal gradient. In NMDS ordination, the result of altitude was more distinct than that of month. The results suggest that the altitudinal habitat might be more affected in species composition rather than in seasonal temperature.

AB  - Simple Summary In the small-medium scale farm management systems, farmers make rational decisions by combining available inputs to optimize or maximize their production outcome. As the availability of inputs differs in each location, variability in farm typology is becoming more evident, resulting in different economic performances. We aimed to determine buffalo farms' heterogeneity and differences in productivity and profitability in Marmara Region, Turkey. Six components were identified as the best predictors of farms' efficiency: "Milk productivity", "Economic efficiency", "Roughage management", "Dual purpose farming", "Concentrate supply", and "Fodder production", each of which aggregate indexes that characterize feeding management and economics, in addition to location, investment in buildings and equipment, and grazing type. These factors' scores allow for farms' characterization and identifying management inefficiency areas to prompt early and effective interventions by farmers. This study aimed to determine the heterogeneity that exists in water buffalo husbandry systems in Marmara Region, Turkey. A questionnaire containing a total of 60 indicators was submitted to 52 farmers. A Principal Component Analysis was performed to reduce original variables into a simplified and latent structure, which was characterized by six orthogonal components: milk productivity, economic efficiency, roughage management, dual-purpose farming, concentrate supply, and fodder production. An ANOVA model was applied to the six components to investigate the effects of the province, investment levels, grazing type, milk production, and profitability. Differences in milk productivity, roughage management, concentrate supply, and fodder management were significant according to the province and grazing type, which indicated a difference in intensification levels among the cities. Economic efficiency and dual-purpose farming differed significantly for milk production levels as well as milk productivity, and economic efficiency differed for profitability levels. We found a tendency regarding the impact of roughage management on profitability. The results conclude that profitability was associated with improving the milking traits of buffaloes and roughage management of the farms.

AB  - Coastal cetaceans confront intensifying anthropogenic pressures, yet quantifying historical habitat loss remains methodologically challenging in data-scarce regions where shifting baseline syndrome obscures conservation targets. Using the critically endangered Chinese white dolphin (Sousa chinensis) as a sentinel species, we synthesized occurrences from historical documents (n = 3944) and local ecological knowledge (LEK, n = 252) to reconstruct its historical distribution shifts in southeast China; and used a two-stage analytical framework to disentangle natural versus anthropogenic drivers of observed range contractions. Maxent models with seven natural variables identified baseline suitable habitats (AUC = 0.918) that congruent with the reconstructed historical range. Generalized linear model analyses demonstrated significant effects of all five anthropogenic disturbances to the recent range contraction of S. chinensis (P < 0.05), with mariculture exerted the strongest negative effect (beta = -1.358), followed by inshore fishing intensity (beta = -1.231), terrestrial stressors (beta = -0.754), coastal reclamation intensity (beta = -0.522), and shipping activities (beta = -0.257). We propose three risk-adaptive governance actions: (1) Artificial Intelligence-driven integration of multi-source ecological data with coordinated monitoring networks for coastal cetaceans to bridge data gaps and enable evidence-based governance at regional scales; (2) mitigate risks from ghost gear entanglement, coastal and estuarine maritime engineering, and vessel collisions through targeted technological interventions and adaptive marine spatial planning frameworks; (3) implement ecosystem-based management approaches to reconcile biodiversity conservation with coastal urbanization. This historical ecology-spatial planning nexus provides a transferable framework for conserving data-limited coastal megafauna amid cumulative anthropogenic impacts.

AB  - The conservation of large carnivores in human-dominated landscapes needs to be reconciled with the safety of humans and domestic animals. This is especially true for the leopard Panthera pardus, which occurs extensively in agricultural landscapes and remnant forest tracts embedded within peri-urban areas such as Kathmandu district in Nepal. We carried out interviews in 321 households in this district to determine the extent of leopard habitat use and predation on domestic animals (dogs and goats) during October 2015-April 2016. We used multi-state occupancy models, and estimated probabilities of leopard habitat use (psi(1)) and predation on domestic animals (psi(2)) as a function of covariates, while accounting for imperfect detection. Our findings indicate that the rapidly urbanizing outskirts of Kathmandu city are used extensively by leopards. The estimated probability of fine-scale habitat use in 2 km(2) sample units was 0.96 +/- SE 0.05 and the probability of predation on domestic animals was 0.76 +/- SE 0.15. Leopard attacks occurred in areas with high vegetation cover and abundant goats. Addressing the problem of leopard attacks on domestic animals will require developing a comprehensive mitigation plan that includes educational activities to raise awareness, measures to address grievances of affected local communities, interventions to prevent attacks on livestock, compensation programmes, and rapid response teams to ensure human and animal welfare in conflict-prone areas. Land-use planning in these peri-urban landscapes needs to facilitate the safe sharing of space between people and leopards.

AB  - Reintroduction and dispersal of the livestock and wildlife pest, southern cattle fever tick, Rhipicephalus (Boophilus) microplus (Canestrini), along the U.S.-Mexico border in the southernmost counties of Cameron and Willacy has been attributed mostly to nilgai antelope, Boselaphus tragocamelus (Pallas), and to a lesser extent, white-tailed deer, Odocoileus virginianus (Zimmerman). Nilgai are competent hosts of R. microplus, have large home ranges, and are distributed from southern Texas into northeastern Mexico where R. microplus, a vector of bovine babesiosis, is endemic. The study documents movement of nilgai and white-tailed deer through gaps in game fencing previously built to redirect movements of the endangered ocelot, Leopardus pardalis (L.), to wildlife crossings. Game fencing limits movement of nilgai and white-tailed deer and thus reduces the spread of cattle fever ticks. Additional game fencing is proposed to limit movement of tick-infested nilgai, white-tailed deer, and further redirect ocelots to crossings to avoid mortality on roads. In other parts of Cameron and Willacy counties where road mortality to ocelots is not an issue, game fencing is designed with large openings to block nilgai but allow free movement for endangered feline species. This research demonstrates how efforts to protect livestock from an exotic pest can also merge with goals of protecting endangered species in the same environment.

AB  - The Janzen-Connell hypothesis (JCH) predicts that attack by specialist enemies on seedlings increases with conspecific seedling density, but studies have rarely experimentally tested for the contingency of such effects on the tree community context (e.g. diversity, composition) ormeasured responses by different enemies (e.g. herbivores, pathogens). We conducted a field study in a large-scale system evaluating tree species diversity and conspecific density effects on leaf damage on mahogany Swietenia macrophylla seedlings. We established quadrats of eight levels of seedling density across mahogany tree monocultures and tree species polycultures including mahogany, and recorded percent leaf damage by insects and percent leaf necrosis by a pathogenic fungus on mahogany seedlings. We found contrasting effects of tree species diversity on insects and pathogens. Whereas tree diversity did not affect leaf damage by insects, it had a significant negative effect on leaf necrosis by pathogens whereby, on average, percent leaf necrosis on mahogany seedlings in polyculture was half of that observed in monoculture. We discuss the potential influences of changes in mahogany tree density versus frequency (relative to other tree species) driving this diversity effect. Unexpectedly, we found no effect of seedling conspecific density on either leaf insect or pathogen damage (i.e. density-independent attack). Likewise, we found no significant tree diversity by seedling density interaction, indicating that plant enemies were consistently unresponsive to variation in seedling density acrosslevels of tree diversity. Overall, this study provides a unique test of the JCH by experimentally evaluating seedling density and tree diversity effects on contrasting plant enemies and, in turn, the controls they exert over plant recruitment.

AB  - For Inuit in the subarctic transition zone of northeastern Canada, an intimate knowledge of the environment and local biodiversity is crucial for successful traditional activities. This study examines what kinds of landscape features and habitats Inuit of Nunatsiavut recognize and name. During interviews, community members (mostly Elders) were shown photographs from the region and were asked to describe and name salient types of places in Labrador Inuttitut. The most frequently reported geographical units dealt with the region's topography (e.g., mountain, island, flat-place), hydrology (e.g., river, bay), and superficial characteristics (e.g., bedrock, permanent snow patch). Ecological considerations were also prominent, such as plant associations and animal habitats (e.g., shrubby-place, wetland, caribou-return to-place). Areas were often characterized by a dominant species or substrate type, being named using the plural form of the species and (or)substrate (e.g., "napattuk" meaning 'tree' and "napattuit" meaning 'forest' or "siugak" meaning 'sand' and "siugalak" meaning 'sandy-area'). Some types of places reported by Inuit were significant mainly for traditional activities (e.g., berry-patch, seal-place, dry-wood-place, danger place), aiding navigation and resource finding. Integrating Inuit conceptions of ecosystems and their component landscape units with those of contemporary science can improve our understanding of subarctic ecology, benefit climate change adaptation strategies, and Inuit language as well as culture conservation initiatives.

AB  - Loss of remnant vegetation and landscape complexity through agricultural intensification reduces the abundance and diversity of beneficial insects such as pollinators and natural enemies of pests (predators/ parasitoids). The Canterbury Plains (CP), New Zealand, is a highly intensified agricultural region that has lost almost all remnant native woody vegetation. Establishing native semi-natural habitat (SNH) designed to increase the abundance and diversity of beneficial insects could offer farmers opportunity to reduce pest damage to crops and pastures, reduce insecticide use, and improve yields through increased pollination. While it is currently challenging to estimate the full potential benefits of establishing native SNH on CP farms, simple calculations suggest that eliminating just one insecticide application across frequently treated crops could save farmers over $NZ24.1 million p.a. collectively. We also calculate that CP farmers could potentially save more than $39.9 million p.a. through increased yields if pollination deficits could be eliminated. Designed native SNH may also deliver environmental benefits if it can support the functional service of beneficial insects and mitigate environmental effects such as climate change. Moreover, if economic and environmental benefits can be demonstrated, the transfer of this information to farmers and the broader community could increase knowledge and appreciation of native SNH that supports diverse beneficial insects. Here we outline research to evaluate the economic, environmental, and social benefits of insect-mediated ecosystem service contributions (pollination, pest suppression) across CP arable, dairy, sheep, and beef farms. The research partners include industry bodies, local and regional councils, and restoration trusts responsible for delivering knowledge to farmers and broader community catchment groups.

AB  - The presence and abundance of organisms within an ecosystem often correlate with habitat variables that may have few, or unknown, functional values. Understanding the functional role of these variables is especially important for organisms occupying landscapes managed for timber production and containing diverse habitat patches of different quantities and structures of vegetation. We investigated the strength of associations reported in the literature between small mammal generalists and vegetation. On an industrially logged landscape in northern CA, we used occupancy and mark-recapture analyses across three years to estimate the presence and total numbers for woodrats (Neotoma fuscipes Baird, 1858) and deer mice (Peromyscus maniculatus (Wagner, 1845)) related to vegetative attributes on coniferous and non-coniferous sites. Abundances of the small mammals correlated positively with shrub cover and hardwoods for woodrats and with shrubs and masting species for deer mice. Indices describing the value of vegetation features for both food and cover, but not these resources independently, described both species' presence and abundances best. We demonstrated that shrubs and non-coniferous trees are particularly important for small mammals and should be of particular focus to forest managers in the Sierras and mountains with similar forest structures.

AB  - AimGlobal-scale studies are necessary to draw general conclusions on how trophic interactions vary with urbanization and to explore how the effects of urbanization change along latitudinal gradients. We predict that the intensity of trophic interactions decreases in response to urbanization (quantified by human population density). Since trophic interactions are more intense at lower latitudes, we also expect major impacts of urbanization at higher latitudes, where base levels are essentially lower.LocationGlobal (881 study sites).Time period2000-2021.Major taxa studiedBirds, arthropods and woody plants.MethodsWe compiled global data on insect herbivory and bird predation from studies that employed similar methods and fitted generalized linear mixed models to test how these trophic interactions vary with human population density, latitude and their interactions.ResultsThe intensity of herbivory and predation decreased with an increase in human population density at lower latitudes. Surprisingly, it remained unaffected at intermediate latitudes and even increased at higher latitudes.Main conclusionsThe observed patterns may be attributed to local climate changes in urban areas, such as the Urban Heat Island effect, which disrupts thermal stability in the tropics while increasing niche availability at polar latitudes.

AB  - Simple Summary Information on species' niche differentiation will contribute to a greater understanding of the mechanisms of coexistence benefitting the conservation and management of ecological communities. The widespread reduction in apex predators and more restricted hunting management has con-tributed to an increase in the abundance of wild ungulates in the Qinling Mountains, presumably resulting in an intensifying interspecific competition pressure. However, the activity patterns of the species in this region are completely unknown due to difficulty in accessing the locations where they occur. Thus, we used camera trapping to systematically investigate spatial and temporal activity patterns of sympatric ungulates in the Qinling Mountains, where top predators are virtually absent. This intensive camera-trap survey elucidated much more detailed studies of spatial and temporal activity patterns in multiple sympatric wild ungulates under natural conditions. Further, our results provided detailed information of the spatial and temporal ecology of ungulate communities in forest ecosystems, which would be a guide to establishing conservation priorities as well as efficient management programs. Dramatic increases in populations of wild ungulates have brought a new ecological issue in the Qinling mountains. Information on species' niche differentiation will contribute to a greater understanding of the mechanisms of coexistence, so as to ultimately benefit the conservation and management of ecological communities. In this study, camera trapping was used to investigate spatial and temporal activity patterns of sympatric wild ungulates in the Qinling Mountains of China, where top predators were virtually absent. We obtained 15,584 independent detections of seven wild ungulate species during 93,606 camera-trap days from April 2014 to October 2017. Results showed that (i) the capture rate differed significantly across species, with the capture rate of reeve muntjac being significantly higher than that of other species; (ii) the wild boar had a higher occupancy rates (psi = 0.888) than other six ungulates, and distance to settlements had a negative relationship with wild boar (beta = -0.24 +/- 0.17); (iii) the forest musk deer and mainland serow had low spatial overlaps with other five wild ungulates, while spatial overlap indices of any two given pairs of wild ungulates were relatively high; (iv) all wild ungulates species (expect wild boar) were mainly active during crepuscular and diurnal periods, and showed bimodal activity peaks at around 05:00-07:00 and 17:00-19:00; and finally, (v) all wild ungulates showed moderate to high temporal overlaps. The results provided detailed information of the spatial and temporal ecology of wild ungulate communities in forest ecosystems of China, which also would be a guide to establish conservation priorities as well as efficient management programs.

AB  - An understanding of factors influencing smallholder farmers' livestock ownership at the household level is vital in formulating pro-poor livestock production policies and technologies. Hence, this study examined factors that influence livestock ownership of smallholder farmers. The data was collected randomly from three purposively selected study areas in the OR Tambo District (King Sabata Dalindyebo, Port St Johns and Ingquza Hill local municipalities) in the Eastern Cape Province of South Africa using a cross-sectional survey of 650 households. A multivariate probit model (MPM) was used to estimate correlates of livestock species ownership at the household level. Results indicated that education, age, household income, marital status, religion, rainfall, gender, household size and employment status influence livestock species ownership at the household level. Therefore, efforts to promote livestock ownership and production should be guided by these significant explanatory variables in the study area. Interdependence among species was also noted (cattle and sheep; goats and pigs; sheep and pigs; cattle and goats; goats and sheep), suggesting complementarity among the different types of livestock species. This complementarity among the species can possibly be explained by functional diversity generic with multi-species livestock farming which is worth supporting to enhance biodiversity conservation, climate change mitigation, rural resource use efficiency and socio-economic sustainability at the household level.

AB  - Electrofishing catch per unit effort (CPUE) can be an effective index of relative abundance when CPUE is proportional to population density. However, the relationship between fish catch rates and density can be variable and not proportional because catchability may not be constant under a range of environmental conditions. Hyperstability occurs when catch rates change faster than population density, whereas hyperdepletion occurs when catch rates change slower than population density. We used capture-mark-recapture methods to estimate density of Common Carp Cyprinus carpio and Bigmouth Buffalo Ictiobus cyprinellus across 24 lake-years. Next, we developed log-linear mixed-effects models to assess the relationship between catch rates and density to predict electrofishing CPUE based on density and environmental covariates. Common Carp and Bigmouth Buffalo electrofishing CPUE exhibited hyperstability; CPUE initially increased faster at low density but reached an asymptote as density continued to increase. Common Carp catch rates increased with water temperature and were negatively associated with season; highest catch rates occurred in the warmest temperatures of spring, whereas the lowest catch rates occurred in the coldest temperatures of fall. Bigmouth Buffalo electrofishing CPUE was negatively related to water temperature but had a quadratic relationship with season; catch rates were highest in the spring and fall when water temperatures were coldest. Secchi depth, shoreline length, and maximum depth did not influence our model predictions in either species. Electrofishing had little power to detect simulated changes in Bigmouth Buffalo density regardless of sampling effort, whereas power to detect changes in Common Carp density increase with population changes and sampling effort. At low population densities for both species, electrofishing CPUE is expected to increase or decrease faster than density and can obscure conclusions about population trajectories but may still be useful for monitoring population fluctuations if hyperstability is accounted for by a correction factor.

ER infects a wide range of species and wild boar is of significant interest because of their similarities to pigs, a known ER reservoir. Moreover, the increase of its densities and the limited data available about ER in this species should be considered. The need is to investigate whether wild boar could represent a risk of erysipelas at the wildlife-domestic-human interface. Here, 1067 sera and 149 tonsils of wild boar from five hunting districts in Northwest Italy were tested using ELISA and bacteriological culture, respectively. Using generalized linear models, we evaluated host and environmental factors influencing ER spread and dynamics. We found an ER seroprevalence of 69.4% among wild boar. Increased human density and pig farm density lead to an increase of ER seropositivity highlighting its association with anthropic environmental-related factors. The high ER percentage of isolation (34.2%) found in healthy wild boar suggests that this species can serve as a healthy carrier. This fact, together with the high seroprevalence, supports a role of wild boar as an ER reservoir. Potential zoonotic and economic risks should be considered in light of these data.

AB  - Conspecific negative density dependence (CNDD) and its extension heterospecific positive density dependence (HPDD) are the two most prominent mechanisms used to explain the maintenance of species diversity in forest communities. However, the impact of species identity, growth stage, seasonal and inter-annual variation in precipitation and temperature on conspecific and heterospecific density dependence remains poorly understood. Based on a decade of seedling (dbh < 1 cm) and tree (dbh >= 1 cm) census data from a 5-ha subtropical evergreen broad-leaved forest in eastern China, we used generalized linear mixed models with crossed random effects to test whether seedling survival was density dependent and varied by growth stage, species identity, season or interacted with inter-annual variation in seasonal precipitation and temperature. In addition to conspecific and heterospecific seedling and tree density, the height (or age) of the seedlings, habitat variables, seasonal precipitation and temperature and the interactions between conspecific and heterospecific seedling and tree density and seasonal precipitation and temperature were also used as predictors. The results of our long-term, spatially, and temporally explicit study showed that the strength of CNDD and enemy induced HPDD was stronger in summer and at early seedling stages, whereas interspecific facilitation induced HPDD mainly in winter for early and late seedling stages. Additionally, the effects of seasonal temperature and precipitation, and the soil PC1 axis (which correlated positively with soil nutrients and negatively with soil moisture) on seedling survival varied with season, seedling stage, and focal species identity, indicating the potential for niche partitioning among species in this community. However, neither conspecific nor heterospecific neighbor effects varied among focal seedling species, which resulted in a community compensatory trend in young seedlings. Variation in the effect of CNDD and HPDD across seedling stages, seasons, and inter-annual fluctuations of climate conditions highlights the necessity of long-term monitoring of the dynamics of CNDD in tree communities.

AB  - Understanding the spatial ecology of an animal is crucial for its conservation and management, particularly for threatened species. The gaur (Bos gaurus), globally classified as vulnerable, is distributed across mainland South and Southeast Asia. In Thailand, the overall gaur population is decreasing, and suitable habitats are declining. Conversely, the gaur is well recovered in the Khao Phaeng Ma Non-hunting Area (KPM-NHA), a part of the Dong Phayayen-Khao Yai Forest Complex, recognized as a UNESCO Natural World Heritage site. Due to its abundance, this area faces the challenge of crop-raiding by gaurs. Thus, this research focuses on investigating the home range, movement, and habitat selection of gaurs in KPM-NHA and its surrounding areas. From October 2020 to July 2022, we obtained location data for 11 adult gaurs (eight males and three females) using a GPS-collar. We utilized the autocorrelated kernel density estimation (AKDE) method and the step-selection function (SSFs) to estimate the gaurs' home range, movement, and habitat selection. The results show that the gaur dwelled in KPM-NHA and moved around the protected areas and surrounding agricultural areas. The average home range size of males and females were 9.33 km2 (range 2.92-18.20 km2) and 4.09 km2 (range 1.44-6.11 km2), respectively. Regarding their movement, the average traveled distance was 6.38 km/day for males and

AB  - Upwelling provides high amounts of nutrients that support primary production in coastal habitats, including giant kelp Macrocystis pyrifera forests. Growth and recruitment of kelp forests are controlled by environmental conditions, including temperature, nutrient availability, and storms, as well as biotic interactions. However, our understanding of juvenile persistence in the field is extremely limited, particularly the effects of grazing on the survival of early kelp stages and how environmental variability associated with upwelling dynamics may modulate grazing effects. We quantified herbivore impacts on juvenile M. pyrifera by deploying thirteen 24 h caging experiments approximately every 2 wk throughout the upwelling season in a giant kelp forest in Monterey Bay, CA, USA. Experiments spanned a range of natural environmental variation in oxygen, pH, and temperature, conditions known to affect grazer physiology and that are projected to become more extreme under global climate change. Overall, the herbivore community had a large effect on kelp survival, with 68.5% of juvenile kelp removed on average across experiments. Grazing increased throughout the season, which was most strongly correlated with decreasing monthly oxygen variance and weakly correlated with decreasing monthly pH variance and increasing temperature. This suggests that large swings in oxygen during peak kelp recruitment in spring may provide a temporal refuge from grazing, allowing kelp to reach larger sizes by late summer and fall when upwelling has relaxed. This study highlights the potential of current environmental variability, and its predicted increase under future scenarios, to mediate species interactions and habitat persistence.

AB  - For various temperate ungulate species, recent research has highlighted the potential for spring vegetation phenology ("green-up") to influence individual condition, with purported benefits to population productivity. However, few studies have been able to measure the benefit on vital rates directly, and fewer still have investigated the comparative influence of other phenological periods on ungulate vital rates. In this study, we tracked phenological changes throughout the duration of the growing season and examined how their timing affected the probability of pregnancy in an ungulate population. We did this for elk (Cervus canadensis) across the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem (GYE) by sampling 1106 adult females in winter at 25 sites over a 13-year period and assessing sources of variation in pregnancy using a Bayesian hierarchical model. Pregnancy rates were generally high across the GYE (82.4%), and the primary influences on probability of pregnancy were the timing of vegetation senescence ("brown-down") in autumn and exposure to the reproductive disease brucellosis. Earlier forage brown-down in fall negatively influenced the probability of pregnancy of elk aged 6-9 years by an estimated 17.2% within the range (ca. 32 days) of observed brown-down end dates. While summer habitat quality has been inferred to influence elk pregnancy previously, our findings specify the key influence of foraging conditions later in the seasonal cycle, immediately before the breeding season. The reproductive disease brucellosis was also an important factor, reducing the probability of pregnancy by 12.4% in elk in the 6- to 9-year age class. Because pregnancy was tested before most disease-induced abortions occur, the apparent mechanism for this effect is a prolonged reduction in fertility beyond the period of initial exposure in which fetal mortality is typically expected. Our results prompt greater scrutiny of the combined effects of late-season phenology and disease on reproductive rates and population productivity in temperate ungulates.

AB  - As urbanization encroaches the habitats of wild animals, humans encounter and coexist with wild mammals more often. Wild mammals such as deer may negatively affect humans living urban or suburban areas by causing traffic accidents and spreading tick-borne pathogens. To control deer populations around urban areas, trends in deer population should be analyzed. However, long-term monitoring studies of deer population trends in urban areas and the surrounding forests are scarce. Hence, in this study, we analyzed the trends in sika deer population in forests surrounding Lake Shikotsu in Hokkaido, Japan, and determined its relationship with the distance from the study area to urban areas. We employed the spotlight count method to record the number of deer, and we calculated the relative densities of sika deer in the study area. Our results revealed that the density of sika deer in the study area increased by 3.5-fold over a 10-year survey period. In addition, our results confirmed the increase in deer populations around urban areas, not just the source population of deer far from urban areas, suggesting the possibility of further increases around urban areas. Therefore, to prevent conflicts with deer in urban areas, it is necessary not only to identify suitable habitats but also to implement intensive population control in source populations and populations around urban areas.

AB  - Anthropogenic actions are likely to harm dung beetle populations directly through habitat loss and indirectly through the cascading effects of large mammal depletions. Despite the reliance of dung beetles on mammal dung, there are only a handful of studies that have directly assessed the impact of habitat degradation and associated mammalian loss on dung beetle populations in Africa. We evaluated whether patterns in dung beetle species abundance, richness, and body size can be associated with mammalian herbivore abundance and species richness, habitat structure, and the distance between sample sites. Additionally, we ascertained how the presence of elephants (Loxodonta africana) may affect a dung beetle assemblage by determining which species could be used as bioindicators of elephant presence. We found herbivore and overall mammal abundance explained 17% of dung beetle assemblage structure, 2% of dung beetle abundance, 10% of dung beetle species richness and, 15% of the variation in dung beetle body size. Habitat structure explained 27% of dung beetle assemblage structure, 11% of dung beetle abundance, and 14% of the variation in dung beetle body size. Spatial distance between trapping locations explained 13% of the dung beetle assemblage structure, 4% of species richness, 3% of abundance, and but had no effect on dung beetle body size. We also identified four dung beetle species that may be used in future management plans as bioindicators of elephant density Afromontane Forest in East Africa. This information may become especially important for future monitoring as it is predicted that the areas in which elephants occur in Afromontane Forest are set to decline due to deforestation, and the expansion and intensification of agriculture.

AB  - Grassland degradation threatens ecosystem function and livestock production, partly induced by soil nutrient deficiency due to the lack of nutrient return to soils, which is largely ascribed to the intense grazing activities. Therefore, nitrogen (N) fertilization has been widely adopted to restore degraded Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau (QTP) grasslands. Despite numerous field manipulation studies investigating its effects on alpine grasslands, the patterns and thresholds of plant response to N fertilization remain unclear, thus hindering the prediction of its influences on the regional scale. Here, we established a random forest model to predict N fertilization effects on plant productivity based on a meta-analysis synthesizing 88 publications in QTP grasslands. Our results showed that N fertilization increased the aboveground biomass (AGB) by 46.51 %, varying wildly among plant functional groups. The positive fertilization effects intensified when the N fertilization rate increased to 272 kg ha(-1) yr(-1), and decreased after three years of continuous fertilization. These effects were more substantial when applying ammonium nitrate compared to urea. Further, a machine learning model was used to predict plant productivity response to N fertilization. The total explained variance and mean squared residuals ranged from 49.41 to 75.13 % and 0.011-0.058, respectively, both being the highest for grasses. The crucial predictors were identified as climatic and geographic factors, background AGB without N fertilization, and fertilization methods (i.e., rate, form, and duration). These predictors with easy access contributed 62.47 % of the prediction power of grasses' response, thus enhancing the generalizability and replicability of our model. Notably, if 30 % of yak dung is returned to soils on the QTP, the grassland productivity and plant carbon pool are predicted to increase by 5.90-6.51 % and 9.35-10.31 g C m(-2) yr(-1), respectively. Overall, the predictions of this study based on literature synthesis enhance our understanding of plant responses to N fertilization in QTP grasslands, thereby providing helpful information for grassland management policies.

AB  - In the last century, a synchronous beech expansion has been observed for many mixed mountain forests in southeastern Europe. This change is associated with the interaction of various disturbances. We analyzed structural changes in the Pecka old-growth forest in Slovenia during the last century, using several inventories of the tree layer, regeneration, and site factors. Throughout the observation period, the density of silver fir in the regeneration layer and in the overstory steadily decreased. In 1893, silver fir accounted for about 60% of the growing stock, whereas in 2013 it accounted for less than 13%. This is likely because of silver fir's decline in the canopy layer due to air pollution, successive windthrows, and overbrowsing. However, climate change may also have played an important role, as silver fir also declined in southeastern European old-growth forests where air pollution was less pronounced and ungulate densities were low. A gradual decline of silver fir in the overstory resulted in a decrease of overall tree density to 231 trees ha(-1), while growing stock remained relatively high at 712 m3 ha(-1). Median diffuse light at 1.3 m was 3.7% and regeneration density was 19,954 ha(-1). Beech was dominant (94%), followed by silver fir (4%), and sycamore maple (2%). No silver fir seedlings larger than 0.2 m were recorded. Silver fir, sycamore maple, and beech regeneration showed 87, 76, and 45% browsing damage, respectively. Regression models indicated some evidence of niche partitioning between silver fir and beech. However, many processes may be masked by the silver fir's avoidance strategy. Given current red deer densities, climate change, and existing forest structure, the Pecka old-growth forest will likely reach an alternative stable state dominated by beech in a few decades. This calls for immediate reduction of ungulate populations. Despite the interaction of multiple disturbances, the Pecka old-growth forest has maintained a relatively high overall growing stock, a favorable microclimate, and succession pathway with shade-tolerant beech. This indicates the intrinsic resilience of natural forests. The mechanisms discussed here can be applied to the future governance of old-growth and managed montane mixed forests.

AB  - Aim Decision-making products that support effective marine spatial planning are essential for guiding efforts that enable conservation of biodiversity facing increasing pressures. Key Biodiversity Areas (KBAs) are a product recently agreed upon by an international network of organizations for identifying globally important areas. Utilizing the KBA framework, and by developing a conservative protocol to identify sites, we identify globally importants places for breeding seabirds throughout the coastal seas of a national territory. We inform marine spatial planning by evaluating potential activities that may impact species and how a proposed network of Marine Management Areas (MMAs) overlap with important sites. Location Southwest Atlantic Ocean. Methods We collated a national inventory of all breeding locations for seabirds, including abundance records where available, and complementary estimates of at-sea distribution. We delineated areas of importance in coastal seas following approaches tailored to the ecology of species and assessed areas against global KBA criteria. To determine opportunities for species conservation and management, we reviewed which human activities have been documented to impact the target species globally via IUCN Red List accounts, and also assessed the overlap of important sites with a proposed MMA network. Results We identified global KBAs for nine seabird species (Anatidae, Diomedeidae, Laridae, Procellariidae, Spheniscidae, Stercorariidae) throughout national coastal seas. Globally important areas where multiple species overlapped were only partially accounted for in key zones of the proposed MMA network. Main Conclusions Development of a conservative protocol to identify marine sites for assessment against KBA criteria, revealed opportunities for enhancing a network of proposed Marine Management Areas in coastal seas. The framework we apply in this study has broad relevance for other systems where the design or review of management plans for the marine environment is required.

AB  - Swine coronaviruses affecting pigs have been studied sporadically in wildlife. In Argentina, epidemiological surveillance of TGEV/PRCV is conducted only in domestic pigs. The aim was to assess the prevalence of TGEV/PRCV in wild Suina. Antibodies against these diseases in wild boar and captive collared peccary were surveyed by ELISA. Antibodies against TGEV were found in three collared peccaries (n = 87). No TGEV/PRCV antibodies were detected in wild boar (n = 160). Preventive measures should be conducted in contact nodes where the transmission of agents may increase. Epidemiological surveillance in wildlife populations and in captive animals before their reintroduction should be attempted.

AB  - Rainfall is regarded as the primary determinant of vegetation dynamics in non-equilibrium semi-arid rangelands and mitigates the potential impacts of heavy grazing. In reality, the impact of grazing and rainfall on vegetation dynamics in these systems are far more complex. It is well documented that the combined effect of heavy grazing and drought conditions in semi-arid rangelands can be particularly impactful on herbaceous vegetation. In Witsand Nature Reserve, located in the southern Kalahari, vegetation was subjected to heavy grazing by wild herbivores (game species) for prolonged periods. The region also experienced the most severe drought recorded in the region in the last 60 years. A study was conducted to determine the extent that heavy grazing impacted the response of vegetation to rainfall variability. Furthermore, the applicability of non-equilibrium based models in this semi-arid rangeland was tested. The study also investigated the effects of heavy grazing by wildlife and compared it to the reported detrimental effects of overgrazing caused by livestock. The results found that rainfall was the main determinant of cover abundance and biomass changes, but did not affect species composition. Heavy grazing resulted in areas of low species diversity and the dominance of undesired annuals. Heavily grazed areas were also far more susceptible to drought conditions compared to lightly grazed areas. In lightly grazed areas, vegetation responses post-drought conformed to the description of non-equilibrium systems while heavily grazed sites did not. This was indicative of vegetation responses being closely coupled to the inherent resilience of the vegetation. Heavy grazing by wildlife resulted in the degraded state of the rangelands, as has also been found with livestock farming. The key difference of overgrazing caused by livestock and wildlife was concluded to be in the spatial extend of the impact. This is due to the management and behavioural differences between livestock and wildlife. (c) 2025 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc. on behalf of The Society for Range Management.

AB  - Although the significance of red deer (Cervus elaphus) and roe deer (Capreolus capreolus) as hosts and their role in the circulation of vector-borne pathogens in Europe is well described, the trypanosomes of moose (Alces alces) are poorly known. As heat sensitive ungulates, moose might be especially vulnerable to the effects of climate change and the associated rise in parasite pressure. Therefore, the aim of our study was to determine the prevalence of trypanosomes in moose in Poland, this being one of the largest populations in Central Europe since the 2001 hunting ban. Molecular analysis revealed the presence of Megatrypanum trypanosomes in almost half of the studied moose. As the population of moose in Central Europe has been recently growing, it is crucial to determine their role in the circulation of vector-borne pathogens in environment. This is the first study of the detection and molecular identification of Trypanosoma theileri complex in moose in central Europe.

AB  - Biodiversity losses have increased in tropical forests due to fire-related disturbances. As landscape fragmentation and climate change increase, fires will become more frequent and widespread across tropical rain forests worldwide, with important implications for forest dynamics by altering plant-animal interactions. Here we tested the hypothesis that recurrent fires in tropical rain forests change bottom-up and top-down forces controlling the abundance of insect herbivores, which in turn increases herbivory. To quantify herbivory, we collected 50 leaves per tree of five species in burned and unburned experimental plots (N = 75) in southeastern Amazonian forests. We measured leaf nitrogen content and leaf thickness of tree leaves as bottom-up factors that could explain differences in herbivory; we measured predation pressure on model caterpillars and estimated the abundance of predatory ants as top-down factors. We found higher herbivory in burned than in unburned forests, as well as lower predator attacks in caterpillar models and lower abundance of predatory ants. Leaf nitrogen content did not vary across treatments. Birds attacked model caterpillars more frequently in burned than in unburned forests, and leaf thickness was higher in burned forests, but these factors together were not enough to offset the higher herbivory in burned plots. Fire degrades tropical forests not only by killing trees and altering their structure and community dynamics, but also by reducing predatory arthropods and disrupting predator-prey interactions, which triggers increased herbivory. These indirect impacts of recurrent fires probably contribute to further alter forest structure, functioning, and to decrease regeneration in Amazonian forests.

AB  - The tragic decline of plains bison (Bison bison bison) in North America is well known. By the turn of the 20th century, plains bison, once numbering in the tens of millions, were extirpated from the wild in Canada. Banff National Park, AB, Canada, is within the original range of bison in North America, and still contains suitable habitat for the species. In 2017, we used measures of genetic diversity, as well as age and reproductive status, to select 16 plains bison for reintroduction to an unoccupied corner of their former historic range in Banff National Park. However, five of the preferred founders from this genetically diverse group needed to be substituted for less ideal candidates when aggressive behavior was observed, which could have compromised animal welfare during translocation. The level of genetic diversity in the founding population was therefore lower than if all proposed founders had been used, although the difference was not substantial. As expected, adults in this small, reintroduced herd had lower observed heterozygosity and number of alleles than the larger source herd, but expected heterozygosity was higher, likely a result of preferentially choosing individuals with rare alleles. Another substantial contribution to genetic diversity was in unborn fetuses: sired by males that were not translocated, the calves born a few months later provided a boost to the genetic diversity of this small founder herd. Where opportunities allow, the inclusion of pregnant females can significantly increase the genetic diversity of small founder populations. When compared to other founded herds of bison, the techniques described here have ensured that the newly established Banff NP herd is one of the most diverse bison herds in Canada, despite its relatively small number of founders.

AB  - A long-standing but poorly tested hypothesis in plant ecology and evolution is that biotic interactions play a more important role in producing and maintaining species diversity in the tropics than in the temperate zone. A core prediction of this hypothesis is that tropical plants deploy a higher diversity of phytochemicals within and across communities because they experience more herbivore pressure than temperate plants. However, simultaneous comparisons of phytochemical diversity and herbivore pressure in plant communities from the tropical to the temperate zone are lacking. Here we provide clear support for this prediction by examining phytochemical diversity and herbivory in 60 tree communities ranging from species-rich tropical rainforests to species-poor subalpine forests. Using a community metabolomics approach, we show that phytochemical diversity is higher within and among tropical tree communities than within and among subtropical and subalpine communities, and that herbivore pressure and specialization are highest in the tropics. Furthermore, we show that the phytochemical similarity of trees has little phylogenetic signal, indicating rapid divergence between closely related species. In sum, we provide several lines of evidence from entire tree communities showing that biotic interactions probably play an increasingly important role in generating and maintaining tree diversity in the lower latitudes.
   A comparative analysis of community metabolomics and herbivore-induced damage in tropical, subtropical and subalpine tree communities shows that both phytochemical diversity and herbivory were higher in tropical communities, providing support to the latitudinal biotic interactions hypothesis.

AB  - Wildlife-train collisions can have deleterious effects on local wildlife populations and come with high socioeconomic costs, such as damages, delays, and psychological distress. In this study, we explored two major components of wildlife-train collisions: the response of wildlife to oncoming trains and the detection of wildlife by drivers. Using dashboard cameras, we explored the flight response of roe deer (Capreolus capreolus) and moose (Alces alces) to oncoming trains and explored which factors, such as lighting and physical obstructions, affect their detection by drivers. In a majority of cases, roe deer and moose fled from an oncoming train, at an average flight initiation distance (FID) of 78 m and 79 m respectively. Warning horns had unexpected influences on flight behaviour. While roe deer initiated flight, on average, 44 m further away from the train when warned, they usually fled towards the tracks, in the direction of danger. FID of moose, however, was unaffected by the use of a warning horn. As train speed increased, moose had a lower FID, but roe deer FID did not change. Finally, detection of wildlife was obstructed by the presence of vegetation and uneven terrain in the rail-side verge, which could increase the risk of collisions. Our results indicate the need for early detection and warning of wildlife to reduce the risk of collisions. We propose that detection systems should include thermal cameras to allow detection behind vegetation and in the dark, and warning systems should use cues early to warn of oncoming trains and allow wildlife to escape the railway corridor safely.

AB  - Extreme weather events are becoming more frequent, with poorly known consequences for wildlife. In December 2021, an atmospheric river brought record-shattering amounts of rain and snow to interior Alaska, creating conditions expected to cause mass mortality in grazing ungulate populations that need to access ground forage. We characterized snowpack conditions following the storm and used a 36-year monitoring dataset to quantify impacts on caribou (Rangifer tarandus) and their primary predator, wolves (Canis lupus). December precipitation was 7.3 SD above the 99-year mean and 2.5-fold higher than the prior record, with a return period of 333 years. However, ice thickness within the snowpack was highly variable across vegetation types, and caribou shifted to use higher elevations that can blow free of snow. Caribou and wolf mortality rates were 1.3-1.8 SD above normal and caribou population growth rates were low but similar to recent years, indicating a surprisingly weak demographic response. These findings indicate that landscape diversity may bolster resistance of wildlife populations to short-term, potentially devastating effects of extreme weather.
   Using weather data combined with multi-decadal caribou and wolf demographic data, heterogeneous habitat and topography are shown to mitigate the impact of an extreme precipitation event on wildlife populations in Alaska.

AB  - No-tillage (NT) is a soil conservation management practice that can sustain important earthworm populations due the maintenance of soil cover and absence of soil disturbance. Sites with NT can also support native earthworm species, but few studies have identified the earthworms collected under NT. Therefore, the present study evaluated earthworm diversity in 14 sites under NT and seven with riparian forest (RF) in Atlantic Forest located in Rolandia, Cambe, Toledo (Parana), Coxilha, Sarandi (Rio Grande do Sul) and Itai (Sao Paulo). The earthworms were collected by handsorting using quantitative and qualitative methods. The 1471 individuals collected were classified into 23 species belonging to five families: Glossoscolex sp.71, sp.72, sp.73 and sp.74, Fimoscolex sp.23 sp.24 and sp.25 (Glossoscolecidae); Pontoscolex corethrurus, Urobenus brasiliensis (Rhinodrilidae); Haplodrilus sp.1 and sp.2, Ocnerodrilidae sp.1, sp.15, sp.16, sp.48, sp.49 and sp.50 (Ocnerodrilidae); Amynthas gracilis, Metaphire californica (Megascolecidae); Dichogaster affinis, D. gracilis, D. bolaui and D. saliens (Benhamiidae). Of the total, 15 were native and eight were exotic species. In general NT sites had higher species richness than the forest sites (except at Itai), mainly due to the invasion of NT fields by exotic species, particularly Ocnerodrilidae sp.1 and Dichogaster spp. Six of the seven forests had native species, but only four NT fields had native earthworms, and these were generally found in low abundance.

AB  - Predators regulate communities through top-down control in many ecosystems. Because most studies of top-down control last less than a year and focus on only a subset of the community, they may miss predator effects that manifest at longer timescales or across whole food webs. In southeastern US salt marshes, short-term and small-scale experiments indicate that nektonic predators (e.g., blue crab, fish, terrapins) facilitate the foundational grass, Spartina alterniflora, by consuming herbivorous snails and crabs. To test both how nekton affect marsh processes when the entire animal community is present, and how prior results scale over time, we conducted a 3-year nekton exclusion experiment in a Georgia salt marsh using replicated 19.6 m2 plots. Our nekton exclusions increased densities of plant-grazing snails and juvenile deposit-feeding fiddler crab and, in Year 2, reduced predation on tethered juvenile snails, indicating that nektonic predators control these key macroinvertebrates. However, in Year 3, densities of mesopredatory benthic mud crabs increased threefold in nekton exclusions, erasing the tethered snails' predation refuge. Nekton exclusion had no effect on Spartina biomass, likely because the observed mesopredator release suppressed grazing snail densities and elevated densities of fiddler crabs, whose burrowing alleviates soil stresses. Structural equation modeling supported the hypotheses that nektonic predators and mesopredators control invertebrate communities, with nektonic predators having stronger total effects on Spartina than mud crabs by controlling densities of species that both suppress (grazers) and facilitate (fiddler crabs) plant growth. These findings highlight that salt marshes can be resilient to multiyear reductions in nektonic predators if mesopredators are present and that multiple pathways of trophic control manifest in different ways over time to mediate community dynamics. These results highlight that larger scale and longer-term experiments can illuminate community dynamics not previously understood, even in well-studied ecosystems such as salt marshes.

AB  - Key messageIn European mountain forests, the growth of silver fir (Abies alba Mill.), sycamore maple (Acer pseudoplatanus L.), European beech (Fagus sylvatica L.) and Norway spruce (Picea abies (L.) H. Karst.) seedlings is more strongly affected by ungulate browsing than by elevation. But, the constraint exerted by ungulates, in particular the probability for seedlings to be browsed, increases with elevation for most species.ContextWhile concerns about mountain forest regeneration rise due to their high vulnerability to climate change, the increase in wild ungulate populations and the expansion of their range in the last decades exert an additional constraint on the survival and growth of young trees. Understanding how this constraint can vary with elevation is thus a key to assess the consequences of this population increase for the regeneration of mountain forests.AimsIn this study, we investigate the effect of elevation on (i) the occurrence of browsing for seedlings and on (ii) the reduction in seedling growth induced by ungulate browsing.MethodsWe monitored height growth and browsing occurrence on silver fir, sycamore maple, European beech and Norway spruce seedlings across seven elevation gradients (from 400 to 2013 m) located from France to northern Sweden.ResultsSeedlings of the two most palatable species-fir and maple-were more likely to be browsed at high elevation while the opposite effect was observed for spruce. Browsing strongly reduced seedling growth for all species but Norway spruce, while elevation had no direct effect on seedling growth. This browsing-induced growth reduction was stronger at high elevation for fir seedlings.ConclusionsBrowsing is overall a stronger constraint on seedling growth than elevation for four dominant species of European mountain forests. Elevation can, however, affect both browsing probability and the effect of browsing on seedling growth. Our results highlight the importance of taking into account ungulate pressure and its interactive effect with elevation when forecasting the regeneration of mountain forests under a changing climate.

AB  - Grazing affects soil carbon (C) storage in grassland ecosystems through livestock trampling, defoliation, and excretion of urine and dung. However, independent effects of those grazing behaviors on soil organic C (SOC) remains unclear, particularly in alpine grassland ecosystems. To address this knowledge gap, a one-year field experiment was conducted on the eastern edge of the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau to study the effect of grazing behaviors, including light vs. heavy trampling, light vs. heavy defoliation, and excretion of urine and dung, of yak (Bos grunniens) on SOC stock. Our results showed that trampling, particularly light trampling, significantly increased SOC stock in the 0-10 cm soil layer. The increase of soil bulk density and SOC concentration were the main reasons for the increase of surface SOC stock under trampling. Heavy defoliation significantly increased SOC stock in the 20-30 cm depth in comparison to light defoliation (4.4 vs. 2.9 kg C m-2), but neither affected SOC stock in the 0-30 cm soil profile. In contrast, excretion significantly lowered SOC stock by 9.3 kg C m-2 (0-30 cm), linked to the decreased soil bulk density and SOC concentration, and the decreased microbial biomass C, which might have lowered the microbial contribution to SOC storage. Our study of independent grazing effects showed that short-term livestock excretion caused the loss of SOC stock while intensive trampling or defoliation did not. Our findings have implications for managing livestock grazing behavior to maintain SOC stock in alpine grassland ecosystems.

AB  - Re-establishment of ecosystem engineers via introduction of replacement species is increasingly being proposed to facilitate ecosystem restoration of island ecosystems around the world, yet attendant challenges and risks remain largely unknown. We evaluate the first phase (2015-2020) of a program to restore a population of giant tortoises, ecosystem engineers of terrestrial ecosystems of the Galapagos Islands, to Santa Fe Island during which a total of 551 juvenile and 31 subadult tortoises of the non-native Espanola Island species (Chelonoidis hoodensis) were translocated. After 5 years, most (85%) of tortoises released remain alive, exhibiting robust vital rates comparable to those of conspecifics in their native range, having colonized 10% of the island via gradual dispersal from the point-of-release. Populations of an arboreal cactus (Opuntia echios)-a keystone species for many organisms on the island and intended beneficiary of tortoise restoration-and pallid land iguanas (Conolophus pallidus)-an endemic, herbivorous reptile considered potentially at risk from the introduction of tortoises, both increased coincident with the arrival of tortoises. Herbivore exclosure experiments revealed that the island's plant community manifested a response to the arrival of tortoises; however, significant engineering of the island's vegetation will require many decades. These results highlight the first stage of what appears to be a successful conservation intervention that can serve as a "proof of concept" for introduction of ecological replacements to other islands in Galapagos, and potentially for other island ecosystems around the world.

AB  - We used dynamic occupancy modeling and scat analysis to understand the habitat use and feeding habits of leopards in a forest-agricultural mosaic adjacent to Rajaji Tiger Reserve. The top model indicated that leopards were not detected at sites with elephants but were detected where large prey was present. Initial occupancy was higher at sites with moderate proportion of forest cover. Colonization probability decreased with increasing road density. Extinction probability was inversely correlated with distance from settlements and positively correlated with road density. Wild prey dominated the diet (69.4%), especially nilgai and sambar, whereas the contribution of domestic animals was lower (30.6%). In essence, the habitats near the settlements were more widely used in the pre-monsoon peak due to denser cover, which declined successively in latter seasonal peaks probably due to reduction in cover provided by sugarcane crops which were harvested later. Leopards favoured wild prey, which were likely supplemented with domestic prey near the settlements and roads. The conservation efforts here should prioritize the habitats and prey within the agricultural landscape to sustain leopard and prey populations in order to mitigate any conflict at manageable levels.

AB  - Rainforest fragmentation drastically affects biodiversity and species composition, mainly due to habitat loss. Several studies have already shown the effects of forest fragmentation on plant and ant communities. To date, however, there is limited empirical knowledge of how forest fragmentation affects ant-plant interaction in networks. We investigated the effects of the configuration of rainforest fragments on the structure of ant-plant interaction networks mediated by extrafloral nectaries (EFNs). We carried out this study in ten forest fragments, ranging in size from approximately 5 to 3,000 ha, located in the Brazilian Amazon. In each fragment we established a plot of 6,250 m2, in which all ant-plant interactions were recorded, and calculated the following network descriptors: number of interactions, network size, network specialization, diversity of interactions, and nestedness. We used four explanatory variables to investigate the effects of forest fragmentation on these network descriptors: three metrics of the configuration of fragments (i.e., fragment area, edge irregularity, and connectivity) and the forest structure within each fragment, represented by canopy cover. We did not detect any effect of the explanatory variables on the network descriptors. The structural stability of the networks sampled in forest fragments with different configurations is possibly related to the observed constancy of ant species in the central core of highly interacting species. Our results corroborate other studies highlighting the structural stability of these facultative ant-plant networks mediated by EFNs in different spatial and temporal gradients. Nonetheless, the low constancy of plant species in the generalist core should be understood as a warning, mainly because the functionality of this protective mutualism (i.e., food secretions in exchange for protection against herbivory) remains unknown.

AB  - Widespread decline in underwater forests, formed by kelps and other macroalgae, is occurring in all oceans. Loss of the vulnerable surface canopy typically leads to alternate rocky reef states dominated by substrate-near, understory vegetation, or reefs without any large fleshy macroalgae such as sea urchin barrens. Such alternate reef states represent a major shift in food availability and quality, and may impact kelp-preferring grazers forced to rely on less nutritious foods. Here we investigate the physiological responses of grazers to changes in food quality and quantity. We quantify the mass-independent oxygen consumption (ṀO2), as a proxy of wholeorganism physiology, of four grazing invertebrate species (two sea urchins: Mesocentrotus franciscanus and Strongylocentrotus purpuratus; and two gastropods: Pomaulax gibberosus and Tegula pulligo) provisioned with one of three diet treatments over seven weeks: 1) higher quality, canopy kelp, 2) lower quality, substrate-near kelp, or 3) restricted: no kelp. We further test for differences in the heat resistance of four grazers using an acute, nearlethal heat exposure after completion of the provisioning period. Food restrictions had the strongest influence on oxygen consumption in the two urchins (mass-independent ṀO2 was reduced by 26-78%). By contrast, the two gastropod grazers did not display metabolic depression under food restrictions. Although kelp restrictions had clear physiological consequences in sea urchins, overall, the type of kelp provisioned (Macrocystis and Saccharina) did not relate to oxygen consumption after seven weeks. While heat resistance was also similar across food treatments, unfed individuals showed a slight tendency for lower heat tolerance compared to fed individuals. These results suggest a weak coupling between heat resistance and food quality and quantity, at least for these species and at short time spans. Our work highlights the importance of diet diversity and metabolic depression as strategies to cope with the energetic costs of warming.

AB  - The large-scale exploitation of whale populations in the whaling era led to the near extirpation of large whales all over the world. This must have had major repercussions for marine ecosystems globally. Consequent changes to those ecosystems and physical environments create uncertainty around whether present-day conditions are adequate to support full recovery of pre-whaling population sizes. Combined with potential effects of anthropogenic stressors, the future viability of exploited whale populations is questioned. This migrating species was left near extinction from whaling and has shown slow, yet steady, recovery in recent decades. Here, we collate abundance data from aerial surveys performed along the Australian coast between 1976 and 2024, covering 2250 km of coastal habitat, to study the recovery trajectory of Australian southern right whales (Eubalaena australis). We describe temporal trends in abundance, reproduction and growth of the western sub-population. Our study reveals that despite previously displaying exponential growth, and a present population size still residing far below pre-whaling levels, our annual births have started declining since 2016 and annual abundances of unaccompanied individuals have dropped by 66%. Our results suggest the end of an era of this population's recovery, highlighting that an initial period of steady recovery does not guarantee successful re-establishment of previous abundance levels.

He had the tenacity to ensure the aerial surveys continued over many decades. We pay our respects to his dedicated effort. We are grateful to the Western Australian Museum for supporting the aerial surveys throughout many years, and the people who have contributed to the realisation and continuation of the annual aerial surveys in any shape or form. In particular, the aerial surveys could not have been undertaken without the enthusiasm and persistent hard work of the pilots (the late John Bell, Julie Biser and Jenny Schmidt) and observer/photographers (Ray Smith, Alan Murdoch and Andrew Halsall).

AB  - It is important to examine the animal welfare implications of all aspects of zoo operations, including out-of-hours public events. Research to date has indicated variable responses across species and event types. The current research aimed to understand and quantify the impact of a Christmas lights event. Four species: Rothschild giraffe (Giraffa camelopardalis rothschildi; n = 2) in one exhibit and capybara (Hydrochoerus hydrochaeris; n = 4), lowland tapir (Tapirus terrestris; n = 3) and vicuna (Lama vicugna; n = 5) in a mixed species exhibit were observed. Data were collected from 16:00-20:00 between 28 October 2021 and 11 January 2022. The event ran from mid-November to the end of December 2021. Five-minute behavioural observations were undertaken once per hour using instantaneous scan sampling with a one-minute inter-scan interval. A further six days of 12 h observations were conducted to enable a more detailed investigation post-event. Data collected were compared on non-event and event days using Mann-Whitney U tests (event vs. non-event) and Kruskal-Wallis tests (pre-event, event, post-event periods). Kruskal-Wallis tests and one-way ANOVAs were undertaken to compare behaviours during three time periods (12:00-16:00, 16:00-20:00, 20:00-00:00) over 12 h. Mixed behavioural responses were seen across the study species. Capybara spent more time in their house from 16:00-20:00 on event nights compared to non-event nights (p < 0.001) and tapir only engaged in vigilant behaviour from 16:00-20:00 when the event was held, (p = 0.044). There were no differences in frequency of behaviour between pre-event, event, and post-event observation periods, with the exception of capybara, who spent more time OOS in the pre-event period than during (p < 0.001) or after the event (p < 0.001). The results of the project, undertaken as part of an evidence-based management programme, highlighted that the event did not have any overtly negative impacts on the individuals studied. Except for the giraffe, all individuals had free access to inside and outside environments, and it is believed this choice enabled animals to be active in managing their response to the event. It is recommended that future work observe animals over 24 h to understand whether events lead to behavioural changes the day after events or if animals reverted to normal activity once the event ended.

AB  - Neotropical forest ecosystems harbour significant biodiversity. To develop effective insect conservation practices, it is important to understand the factors that influence the diversity and population structure of the species.<br /> Dispersal, a key determinant of population structure, is well studied in termites nesting in wood, for which it can be influenced by wood transport, or in termites living in urban environments. However, understanding the dispersal of termites whose mobility remains unaffected by wood transport remains understudied.<br /> We investigated the dispersal of Embiratermes neotenicus, a soil-feeding species with short dispersal distance, in the Neotropical region, where both intact and degraded forests exist. Using mitochondrial and nuclear data, we analysed genetic diversity, structure and factors contributing to population differentiation in Suriname and French Guiana at multiple scales for 70 colonies.<br /> The population in French Guiana is the ancestral population in the region that subsequently expanded.<br /> Significant genetic differentiation between populations was observed, with distinct patterns identified in Suriname and French Guiana. The Suriname population showed higher genetic diversity and no subpopulation differentiation, whereas the French Guiana population showed substructure into distinct genetic clusters.<br /> Analyses at the scale of all colonies suggest the influence of landscape features, such as the Maroni River, on genetic differentiation. At the local scale, genetic differentiation between colonies increases with forest alteration, even when this does not include major changes in forest cover.<br /> Our results highlight the sensitivity of soil-feeding termite populations to habitat change. We argue that multi-scale studies are needed for a comprehensive understanding of genetic patterns, especially for species with short dispersal distances.

AB  - Wildlife reintroduction projects are an important tool for restoring traditional wildlife heritage, increasing species diversity, providing subsistence and sport hunting and other recreational opportunities, and assisting ecosystem adaption to future climate change. In Minnesota, the Fond du Lac Band of Lake Superior Chippewa and some conservationists advocate for the expansion of existing elk range to other parts of the state. For reintroduction projects to be successful, it is helpful if managers understand stakeholders' preferences for management objectives. We used best-worst scaling (BWS) to assess residents' preferences for management objective alternatives. The University of Minnesota, in collaboration with the Fond du Lac Band of Lake Superior Chippewa and the Rocky Mountain Elk Foundation, conducted a mail-back questionnaire of landowners (n = 4500) and the general public (n = 4000) in northeastern Minnesota to determine their attitudes toward elk reintroduction. Results suggest that the most preferred objectives were minimizing negative impacts on existing wildlife populations and reintroducing native species. In contrast, the least important objectives were related to providing elk viewing opportunities or maximizing economic opportunities through elk-related tourism. These findings help inform management objectives related to the reintroduction proposal, provide insight to minimize potential conflict and help develop future communication material related to elk reintroduction.

AB  - Knowledge of the floristic composition, structure and conservation status of tropical forests is essential for their sustainable management and conservation, although this remains poorly documented in some tropical countries. Here, we investigated the plant species diversity, distribution and conservation status of the Ankasa Resource Reserve, Ghana, to inform management and conservation efforts. A total of 150 plots (20 m x 20 m each) were demarcated across six recognizable sites, namely; Lophira Tree (LT), Bucket Trail (BT), Big Tree Area (BGA), Bamboo Cathedral (BC), Elubo Camp (EC) and "Dadwen" (DW) for enumeration of trees. Smaller nested plots were used for saplings (5 m x 5 m) and seedlings (1 m x 1 m). Patterns in composition and structure were assessed using various diversity and abundance metrics, whereas the global conservation status of species were determined from the IUCN Red List. In all, 7521 individuals, belonging to 239 species and 65 families, were recorded in the study. The LT was the most diverse of the six habitats (richness = 113, Shannon = 4.32) whereas the BC (62, 3.63) was the least. Hill numbers and rarefaction curves confirmed these variations. Non-metric multidimensional scaling analysis revealed three distinct compositional units or community types in the reserve. Across all sites, Dacryodes klaineana, Picrilima nitida, Drypetes gilgiana and Gluema ivorensis dominated the tree layer, with IVI (%) of 6.71, 5.69, 5.00, 3.88, respectively. Leguminosae, Apocynaceae and Euphorbiaceae were the most dominant families. Of the 239 species identified, 15.9% are classified as near threatened to threatened with extinction, 62.3% of least concern, and 20% not been evaluated. The DW and EC have the highest conservation values while BGA and BC have the least. The results confirm the high floristic richness and conservation status of the Ankasa reserve, and suggest the need for priority conservation actions to maintain its biodiversity.

AB  - Dispersal increases the costs of feeding and predation risk in the new environment and is reported to be biased toward habitats similar to the natal region in some mammals. The benefits and costs of dispersal often differ between sexes, and most mammals show male-biased dispersal in relation to a polygamous mating system. Japanese serow is generally a solitary and monogamous species. However, recent studies have shown that the sociality of serows on Mt. Asama differs between habitat types. In the mountain forests with low forage availability, solitary habits and social monogamy were observed, while, in alpine grasslands, female grouping and social polygyny were observed, which is probably due to abundant forage availability. We investigated the effects of habitat characteristics and sociality on the dispersal of serows using fecal and tissue samples from two different habitats on Mt. Asama. The Fst value between the two areas was significantly positive, and the mean relatedness within areas was significantly higher than that between areas, which suggests limited gene flow and natal habitat-biased dispersal. Bayesian clustering analysis showed unidirectional gene flow from forest to grassland, which was probably due to the high forage availability of the grassland. Analyses of the assignment index and mean relatedness did not show male-biased dispersal, even in the grassland, where serows were polygynous. Thus, polygyny in the grassland is not linked to male- biased dispersal. In summary, our study suggests that dispersal patterns in Japanese serows are affected by habitat rather than social differences.

AB  - The widespread practice of supplemental feeding, a bottom-up forcing of resource availability, is intended to improve wildlife population health and survival. However, supplemental feeding could trigger indirect effects by altering predation rates and disease dynamics. We investigated the effects of feeding on three key elk (Cervus canadensis) population productivity metrics (calf:cow ratios, annual change in elk density, and harvestable surplus) across 13 regions in the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem (GYE) over 26 years. Incorporating previous population size, climate, predator, and harvest data in a Bayesian regression framework revealed new insights about elk productivity metrics in the GYE. Supplemental feeding was associated with increased calf:cow ratios (4.9%) but was not substantially related to changes in elk density and harvestable surplus, which are both management targets. Notably, the feeding effect on calf:cow ratios appeared to be offset by increased wolf (Canis lupus) and grizzly bear (Ursus arctos horribilis) predation. We hypothesize that increased elk productivity resulting from supplemental feeding is primarily transferred to predator and pathogen trophic levels in this system with limited observed effects on elk abundance and harvestable surplus. Anthropogenic food resources may have unintended indirect consequences on other trophic levels that potentially limit the direct impacts of feeding.

AB  - Climate change is modifying the biogeography of many marine species. Squid (Cephalopoda) are important species of the Antarctic pelagic ecosystem, one of the areas most affected by climate change at the global level. The scarce knowledge on potential species distribution shifts in the Southern Ocean and the importance of squids in its pelagic ecosystem highlight the need to characterize how climate change may affect the distribution of these cephalopods in the future. Here, we project future trends for the distribution of 15 squid species from the Southern Ocean, using species distribution models (for the years 2050 and 2100) across 2 scenarios based on the Intergovernmental Panel for Climate Change (IPCC) Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSP1-2.6 and SSP5-8.5). A decline in habitat suitability at lower latitudes was observed for most squids, with no concurrent habitat increase at higher latitudes, mainly due to increases in temperature and sea ice retreat. Nevertheless, while Antarctic and subantarctic squid are projected to experience decreases in habitat suitability, subtropical and cosmopolitan squid may experience increases. The squids Histioteuthis atlantica, Teuthowenia pellucida, Todarodes filippovae and Bathyteuthis abyssicola are candidate winners, while Onykia ingens, O. robsoni, Martialia hyadesi, Gonatus antarcticus, H. eltaninae, Slosarczykovia circumantarctica, Mesonychoteuthis hamiltoni, Alluroteuthis antarcticus, Galiteuthis glacialis, Psychroteuthis glacialis and (specially) Moroteuthopsis longimana could lose to climate change. These changes may entail substantial implications for the trophic ecology of the Southern Ocean. Furthermore, squid movement into new ecosystems may increase top-down pressure over lower trophic levels, adding to the abiotic pressures implicit in climate change.

AB  - In polygynous ungulates, males are often larger than females and bear more elaborate/larger weapons. Quantifying sexual dimorphism in different traits could provide insights into species-specific evolutionary pathways of sexual selection. Concerning the combination of secondary sexual traits, we found that Himalayan tahr (Hemitragus jemlahicus) is unique among the similar to 20 species in the tribe Caprini, as its body mass dimorphism is similar to 2-fold greater than the dimorphism in horn size, whereas horn shape appears to be near-monomorphic. Whilst horns show the same growth rate in both sexes, body mass increases faster in males. Considering age variation, dominant, golden-ruffed males are also heavier than brown-ruffed, lower-ranking males. Unlike most bovids, male-male competition in tahr does not seem to have influenced weapon development, suggesting a lower importance of horns in male-male competition compared to body mass, as their unritualized combat style also suggests. Our study highlights alternative evolutionary pathways occurring in the Caprinae, where intraspecific signals involve different traits, from weapons to pelage features. Accordingly, male tahr use their ruff colour as an 'honest' signal of rank.

AB  - We analyzed fish eggs and larvae in an estuary under severe drought conditions. We detected an inverse salinity gradient, with values increasing from the mouth to the upper estuary. Egg densities decreased from the estuarine mouth to the upstream areas following the salinity increase for all three mesh net sizes. This pattern was also found for the density of larvae, which decreased in estuarine regions with hypersalinity (38 to 62). The low diversity constituted only nine fish species, which were classified as anadromous (Anchoa hepsetus), estuarine and marine (Bathygobius soporator, Hippocampus reidi, Eucinostomus sp., and Diapterus auratus), marine estuarineopportunist (Caranx latus and Bardiella rochus), and marine stragglers (Echeneis naucrates and Haemulon sp.). In addition, we observed an oversimplification of the assemblage to include stress-tolerant estuarine and marine species. Our baseline results suggest that this hypersaline estuarine ecosystem has lower densities and diversity than a healthy mangrove system.

AB  - Overfishing and habitat degradation are major threats to marine megafauna worldwide. Marine protected areas (MPAs) are effective spatial conservation tools for reducing anthropogenic pressures on threatened species but their benefits for megafauna are still debated. While the effects of MPAs on species abundances are widely reported, few studies have simultaneously investigated the confounding effect of habitat.This study aimed at disentangling the effects of coral reef habitat and spatial protection on megafauna densities in a shallow lagoon partly covered by a no-take MPA in New Caledonia (South-west Pacific).Twenty replicates of aerial-video surveys (representing 17 h of videos) were conducted during a 5-month period to estimate and map the densities of five megafauna taxa (dugongs, sea turtles, sharks, Dasyatidae rays and Myliobatidae rays). A permutational multivariate analysis of variance was then applied to assess and disentangle the effects of coral reef habitat obtained from high-resolution satellite imagery and spatial protection on megafauna taxa densities.The analysis revealed a significant effect of protection for sharks and Myliobatidae, with observed densities respectively 9 and 3 times higher inside the MPA compared with outside. The results also highlighted a significant combined effect of habitat and protection for dugongs and Dasyatidae, as well as a significant effect of habitat alone for Dasyatidae. In contrast, no significant effect of habitat or protection was detected for sea turtles.In conclusion, this study revealed positive effects of protection (alone or combined with habitat) for four of the five studied megafauna taxa, confirming the effectiveness of the current MPA. Future studies should be conducted over broader spatial and temporal scales to examine whether detected effects hold beyond the surveyed period and area.

AB  - Simple Summary Autochthonous sheep and goat breeds are at risk of extinction as they produce less milk and meat compared to other breeds, around 50% less for milk and 30% less for meat production, leading to a reduction in the number of animals bred. However, thanks to rural policies, sheep and goat biodiversity is recovering and livestock farms can recognize and sustain their added value to the territory, the landscape, the maintenance of biodiversity and to sustainability through the adoption of a local supply chain in the medium and long term. Financial support for farms is not enough, integrated policies are needed to focus on further training and education and to improve communication channels to increase consumer awareness of biodiversity and quality. European agriculture and rural development policies have promoted the diversity and genetic types of autochthonous breeds to increase sheep and goat biodiversity. Agri-environmental measures to support livestock farmers, have been the main tools used by these policies over the last twenty years. The COLAUTOC, "Collection of a seed bank for native sheep and goat breeds and strategies to increase their numbers", research project in Basilicata, Southern Italy, investigated sheep and goat farms with autochthonous breeds with results proving a reduction in the number of sheep and goat farms in general, particularly those with native breeds at risk of extinction, a clear indication of policy failure with a devastating loss of sheep and goat biodiversity. The COLAUTOC used a variety of methodological tools, including, desk analysis, focus groups, interviews, school workshops and a survey on sheep and goat meat consumption. The results indicated that a recovery in sheep and goat biodiversity could be achieved by supporting farm livestock strategies with a view to diversify production methods and activities, whilst, recognizing the value added to the territory, landscape, biodiversity and sustainability. The strategies identified by the COLAUTOC project require a local vision, using agri-environmental funds to invest in training on innovation for farms, provide tools to improve the quality of life in the rural areas, to increase communication channels to further knowledge and awareness of biodiversity. These strategies could contribute to meeting several 2030 Agenda goals.

AB  - Insect groups are declining worldwide; Lepidoptera are among the taxa most affected in terrestrial ecosystems. The main drivers of these declines are a diverse set of factors relating to environmental change including habitat loss, pollution, and climate change. In 2019 and 2020, we surveyed 118 and 90 islands, respectively, in southern Finland's archipelago for occupancy of Parnassius apollo larvae and counted the abundance of their host plant Hylotelephium telephium. Compared with historical data (1997-2003), the occupancy of Apollo butterfly larvae has decreased remarkably from about 75% to about 20% of islands and abundance declined as well. However, the abundance of their host plant has not changed. Occupancy models showed that the present occupancy probability is not affected by host plant numbers, and shows substantial colonization-extinction dynamics making the population vulnerable to stochastic extinction. Implications for insect conservation Our results show that this Apollo butterfly population is declining, and conservation actions are needed.

AB  - In the Neotropical cloud forests of northwest Argentina, cattle ranching has been historically the primary economic activity, with potential negative impacts on the ecosystem. Understanding factors influencing tree regeneration is crucial for reforestation efforts in grazed areas. Given the limited understanding of Parlatore's Podocarp ( Podocarpus parlatorei Pilg.) regeneration ecology, a unique gymnosperm species in the Southern Yungas' Montane Forest, we evaluated the growth and survival of its saplings for 1 year after planting them both inside and outside an exclosure, and in association with or without unpalatable nurse plants. Inside the exclosure, sapling survival was 100%, regardless of nurse plants. However, outside the exclosure saplings associated with nurse plants had 19.5 times higher survival probability. Growth rates were higher inside the exclosure and for saplings associated with nurse plants. The positive effect of nurse plants on growth was similar inside and outside the exclosure. Cattle browsing and trampling on Parlatore's Podocarp were observed for the first time, highlighting a previously undocumented threat to the species. Our findings offer valuable insights for ecological restoration, potentially suggesting strategic sapling planting near unpalatable plants and considering cattle exclusion in key areas to enhance long-term restoration success in the Southern Yungas' Montane Forest.

AB  - Staphylococcus aureus is a human pathobiont (i.e., a commensal microorganism that is potentially pathogenic under certain conditions), a nosocomial pathogen and a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in humans. S. aureus is also a commensal and pathogen of companion animals and livestock. The dissemination of antimicrobial resistant (AMR) S. aureus, particularly methicillin-resistant (MRSA), has been associated to its ability for establishing new reservoirs, but limited attention has been devoted to the role of the environment. To fill this gap, we aimed to characterize animal carrier status, AMR phenotypes, predominant clonal lineages and their relationship with clinical and food-chain settings, as well as to find predictors of AMR occurrence. Nasal swabs (n = 254) from wild boar (n = 177), red deer (n = 54) and fallow deer (n = 23) hunted in Portugal, during the season 2019/2020, yielded an overall carrier proportion of 35.8%, ranging from 53.7% for red deer and 32.2% for wild boar to 21.7% for fallow deer. MRSA from wild boar and phenotypically linezolid-resistant S. aureus from wild boar and red deer were isolated, indicating that resistance to antimicrobials restricted to clinical practice also occurs in wildlife. The most prevalent genotypes were t11502/ST2678 (29.6%) and t12939/ST2678 (9.4%), previously reported in wild boar from Spain. Clonal lineages reported in humans and livestock, like CC1, CC5 or CC8 (19.1%) and ST425, CC133 or CC398 (23.5%), respectively, were also found. The sequence type ST544, previously restricted to humans, is described in wildlife for the first time. We also identified that land use (agricultural land cover), human driven disturbance (swine abundance) and host-related factors (sex) determine resistance occurrence. These findings suggest that antibiotics used in clinical settings, agriculture and livestock farming, spill over to wildlife, leading to AMR emergence, with potential biological, ecological, and human health effects. This work is one of the most comprehensive surveys in Europe of S. aureus occurrence and determinants among widely distributed wild ungulates.

AB  - Various studies have noted threshold changes in vegetation composition and structure and soil physical and chemical properties in the Albany Thicket biome of South Africa. The aim of this study is to assess if these changes to the environment have transformed the ecosystem's forage production potential. To estimate forage production potential we compare three models that make use of the mean and variance of the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) obtained from two WorldView-2 satellite images. For the models, NDVI values were sampled along four independent piosphere gradients that vary in their intensity of use and rest from herbivory. Our results indicate that the model that makes use of NDVI variance after a good rainfall year is able to discern changes in the forage production potential that corroborate threshold changes in the vegetation and soil environment. Our results support the growing body of evidence that increases in the variance of ecosystem processes and services are important indicators of impending threshold changes in social-ecological systems.

AB  - The richness of specialized herbivores and their host plants in a Brazilian dry forest was inventoried to evaluate if soil types and seasonality are important factors determining the composition of gall-inducing insects and their host plants in Caatinga environments on a local scale. This study recorded 12 different morphotypes of gall distributed among eight host species belonging to five botanical families. Both soils and seasonality influenced the number of species and individuals of host plant, and the richness of gall-inducing insect. The greatest richness of gall-inducing insects and their host plants was observed during the rainy season in the Caatinga vegetation on soils of sedimentary origin, which is considered to have low fertility as regards phosphorus content. Our results corroborate the hypothesis of soil fertility which predicts that the richness of gall-inducing insects will be higher on infertile soils and demonstrate the importance of substrate and seasonality for the richness of gall-inducing insects in Caatinga on a local scale.

AB  - Ethiopia's Bale Mountains National Park protects the continent's largest remaining alpine environments. This park was first suggested in 1973 to safeguard its great biodiversity, including the endangered Mountain Nyala (Tragelaphus buxtoni) and Red Foxes. Despite these conservation measures, the lack of infrastructure and the enormous area projected have resulted in significant wildlife habitat fragmentation. The purpose of this study is to analyse the habitat suitability of the Mountain Nyala in Bale Mountains National Park using GIS and remote sensing approach in order to inform conservation efforts and assist park management seekers in making policy decisions. To identify potential habitats for the Mountain Nyala, the study employed GIS spatial analyst techniques such as the Digital Elevation Model (DEM) and Landsat 9 (OLI/TIRS) data, as well as key environmental factors such as vegetation types, soil types, topographic factors (elevation and slope), climate factors (temperature), and proximity factors (distance to settlements, roads, and rivers). The Weights of these factors was calculated using IDRISI32 Multi-Criteria Evaluation (MCE) with the pair-wise comparison method. These weighted factor maps were then integrated through weighted overlay analysis to model wildlife habitat suitability. The analysis revealed five classes of habitat suitability; of the total land area studied, 1326.7 km2 (60%) was deemed suitable for the Mountain Nyala while 881.3 km2 (40%) was unsuitable. Specifically, 327.4 km2 (15%) was classified as highly suitable, 240.7 km2 (11%) as moderately suitable, 758.6 km2 (34%) as marginally suitable, 352.4 km2 (16%) as currently not suitable, and 528.9 km2 (24%) as permanently not suitable. The majority of suitable habitats are concentrated in the northern part of the park, along the western border, and in the Harrena forest area. This study provides vital insights into habitat suitability that are crucial for the conservation of the Mountain Nyala and the overall management of the park.

AB  - Ecosystems are frequently considered to be controlled by predation (top-down). Experiments examined this in four bird/spider/grasshopper/prairie habitats over 34 years, employing in each habitat three 100 m2 bird exclosures and controls (121 habitat/year cases) where plant, grasshopper, and spider abundances were measured. Top-down control (plants decrease and grasshoppers increase with bird exclusion) was observed in only 13.2% of cases, while plants increased and grasshoppers decreased in 33.1% of cases, plants decreased and grasshoppers decreased in 25.6% of cases, and plants increased and grasshoppers increased in 28.1% of cases. Therefore, top-down control was not common and system responses were not constant, but varied among sites, years, and directionally over time with climate change. This diversity of responses is expected given the variety of underlying processes in complex ecosystems. For example, decision tree/discriminant analysis found that plant decreases and increases with bird exclusion were correctly identified in 78.3% of cases by grasshopper hatchling abundance, plant cover, and annual net primary production (ANPP), while grasshopper decreases and increases with bird exclusion were correctly identified in 76.7% of cases by edible plant biomass per grasshopper hatchling, grasshopper hatchling abundance, and large grasshopper abundance. Analysis of other system-wide terrestrial trophic experiments indicates that the variety of responses observed by us over time and space may be common so that system-wide trophic responses may, in general, be more variable than either top-down or bottom-up as often considered.

AB  - Pollination by animals is a key ecosystem service(1,2) and interactions between plants and their pollinators are a model system for studying ecological networks,(3,4) yet plant-pollinator networks are typically studied in isolation from the broader ecosystems in which they are embedded. The plants visited by pollinators also interact with other consumer guilds that eat stems, leaves, fruits, or seeds. One such guild, largemammalian herbivores, are well-known ecosystem engineers(5-7) and may have substantial impacts on plant-pollinator networks. Although moderate herbivory can sometimes promote plant diversity,(8) potentially benefiting pollinators, large herbivores might alternatively reduce resource availability for pollinators by consuming flowers,(9) reducing plant density,(10) and promoting somatic regrowth over reproduction.(11) The direction and magnitude of such effects may hinge on abiotic context-in particular, rainfall, which modulates the effects of ungulates on vegetation.(12) Using a long-term, large-scale experiment replicated across a rainfall gradient in central Kenya, we show that a diverse assemblage of native large herbivores, ranging from 5kg antelopes to 4,000-kg African elephants, limited resource availability for pollinators by reducing flower abundance and diversity; this in turn resulted in fewer pollinator visits and lower pollinator diversity. Exclusion of large herbivores increased floral-resource abundance and pollinator-assemblage diversity, rendering plant-pollinator networks larger, more functionally redundant, and less vulnerable to pollinator extinction. Our results show that species extrinsic to plant-pollinator interactions can indirectly and strongly alter network structure. Forecasting the effects of environmental change on pollination services and interaction webs more broadly will require accounting for the effects of extrinsic keystone species.

AB  - IntroductionField experiments of gap-based harvest systems in temperate northern hardwood forests have provided inconsistent support for the theory that such regeneration approaches can improve regeneration success among increasingly underrepresented tree species intermediate in shade tolerance. We established a field experiment in Wisconsin, USA testing the long-term response of tree regeneration to group selection harvesting that created small (50 m(2)-D:H 0.32), medium (200 m(2)-D:H 0.64) and large (380 m(2)-D:H 0.88) gaps. Materials and methodsLight levels were modeled to test the assumption of resource heterogeneity within and across these gap sizes. Spatial statistics were used to assess whether the point patterns of saplings of several midtolerant tree species (Betula alleghaniensis, Carya cordiformis, Fraxinus spp.) mapped in harvest gaps provided evidence for partitioning across resource gradients 9 years post-harvest. Finally, we measured occurrence and height of all saplings within the harvest gaps to test the effects of gap size and deer exclusion fencing on the density and total height of shade-tolerant and midtolerant tree regeneration. Results and discussionLight levels progressively increased with gap size, varied by position within gaps, and provided significant evidence of resource heterogeneity. The complex light gradients formed both within and across the three gap sizes may partially explain the statistically significant clustering of Fraxinus spp. saplings in gap centers and north and east into the forested edge of medium and large gaps, C. cordiformis on the west sides of forested transitions surrounding large gaps, and B. alleghaniensis in the centers of large gaps. Densities of tolerant and midtolerant saplings were similar in medium and large gaps after nine growing seasons, though tolerant saplings averaged two meters taller across all three gap sizes. Our results show that gap-based silvicultural systems can create resource gradients that are sufficient to regenerate mixtures of species with high to intermediate tolerance of shade. However, prescriptions beyond harvesting and deer exclusion fencing may be necessary for the recruitment of midtolerant species to canopy positions.

AB  - The 2023 wildfire season in Quebec set records due to extreme warm and dry conditions, burning 4.5million hectares and indicating persistent and escalating impacts associated with climate change. This study reviews the unusual weather conditions that led to the fires, discussing their extensive impacts on the forest sector, fire management, boreal caribou habitats, and particularly the profound effects on First Nation communities. The wildfires led to significant declines in forest productivity and timber supply, overwhelming fire management resources, and necessitating widespread evacuations. First Nation territories were dramatically altered, facing severe air quality issues and disruptions. While caribou impacts were modest across the province, the broader ecological, economical, and social repercussions were considerable. To mitigate future extreme wildfire seasons, the study suggests changes in forest management practices to increase forest resilience and resistance, adapting industrial structures to changes in wood type harvested, and enhancing fire suppression and risk management strategies. It calls for a comprehensive, unified approach to risk management that incorporates the lessons learned from the 2023 fire season and accounts for ongoing climate change. The study underscores the urgent need for detailed planning and proactive measures to reduce the growing risks and impacts of wildfires in a changing climate.

AB  - Over millennia, the combination of controlled burnings and extensive grazing has maintained mosaic landscapes and preserved mountain grasslands in southern Europe. In the last century, deep socio-economic changes have led to an abandonment of traditional uses, to a general decline of the domestic herbivory and to a misuse of burn-ing practices. This study aims to quantify how the decoupling of burning and grazing regimes affects in the long-term the structure, diversity and dynamics of high-mountain, shrub-encroached grasslands. In spring 2012, four treatments (burned-grazed, burned-ungrazed, unburned-grazed and unburned-ungrazed) were set up at three sites in the Special Area of Conservation Roncesvalles-Selva de Irati, in southwest Pyrenees. During seven years, we monitored floristic composition and the height of the native tall-grass Brachypodium rupestre in four plots at each site. In the burned plots, we surveyed the resprout of the dominant shrub Ulex gallii and the dynam-ics of recovering of the herbaceous vegetation. Plant communities evolved differently in grazed and ungrazed plots. Extensive grazing, despite being lower than in previous decades, maintained plant diversity and limited shrub encroachment. The total absence of grazing fostered the encroachment of U. gallii at two sites and the expansion of B. rupestre at the other site. When B. rupestre cover was > 60%, the encroachment of U. gallii was re-duced. This research highlights the competition that occurs between shrubs and tall-grasses in the absence of grazing, and the modulating effect exerted by the burnings and the site-specific features. Understanding local plant dynamics is the first step to design the most appropriate practices that help to preserve diversity at the landscape and the community level in high-mountain grasslands of south Europe.& nbsp; (c) 2021 The Author(s).

AB  - The Transbaikalia (Russia) hosts a number of shallow endorheic saline alkaline lakes. The outcome of our studies demonstrated changes in phytoplankton and zooplankton in selected lakes covering a wide salinity gradient (from 0.69 to 128.33 g/L) over a number of years. Our main goal is to assess the variability of structural and functional indicators of phytoplankton and zooplankton communities at the various salinity levels. The gradient of abiotic factors significantly determines the dynamics of planktonic community diversity, abundance, biomass, and production. High values of secondary production was ensured by nonpredators (bacteriovorous, herbivorous, and detrivorus). We found that species and functional diversity of phytoplankton and zooplankton decrease with increasing salinity, whereas their abundance, biomass, and daily secondary production did not. In phytoplankton, a shift occurred from the small-medium cell size unicellular and colonial non-flagellated forms to the large-extra large filamentous cyanobacteria and colonial algae. A shift from selective raptorial and microphagous carnivores to herbivorous copepods and cladocerans and further to more generalist filter-feeder of rotifers and anostracans was observed in zooplankton. These findings are important because they provide a meaningful view of phytoplankton-zooplankton trophic interactions and contribute to an improved understanding their functional effects on aquatic ecosystems. Our results also complement existing knowledge and provides new information about the diversity and functioning of planktonic communities in soda lakes.

AB  - Global ecosystems underwent major changes through the Quaternary, as climates cycled from cool and dry glacial conditions to relatively warm and humid interglacial conditions. How these changes affected the diversity and composition of small-mammal communities is mostly unknown, especially for the southern-temperate regions of Australia. We used fossil assemblages from owl regurgitates to investigate changes in small mammals from Tasmania's forest environments over the last 20,000 years, encom-passing the transition from cold glacial conditions of the Last Glacial0 Maximum (LGM) into the warmer Holocene. During the early part of this period, Tasmania was connected to mainland Australia via a low -elevation land bridge, but was transformed into a large island by rising sea levels during the Late Pleistocene -Holocene transition. Despite these changes, the regional small-mammal fauna appears to have been persistent over this entire period, with no loss of species. However, the relative abundance of most species changed dramatically, apparently in response to habitat changes, which also provoked substantial shifts in community composition and diversity. A strong indicator of the magnitude of change is Mastacomys fuscus, a graminivorus specialist murid, which dominated the assemblage prior to and during the LGM, but declined as temperature and sea level rose during the Late Pleistocene -Holocene. In contrast, the generalist rodent Pseudomys higginsi, along with the small forest-dependent marsupials Cercartetus spp. and Antechinus spp., became more common during the Holocene. The continued survival of these species to the present, despite divergent environmental needs, implies that Tasmania's complex geomorphology provided multiple refugia that conferred resilience in the face of environmental change.

AB  - Here we provide evidence, along an 8-year period time-series based on multifaceted data from a Mediterranean marine protected area (MPA), whether protection can tackle invasive and range expanding herbivore fishes, and their effects on the algal resource availability, taking into account the population trends of predatory fishes, fisheries catches of herbivore fishes and sea surface temperature (SST) through time. Our findings pointed out that an ineffective in restoring top-down control process MPA may facilitate, rather than alleviate, the sudden and enduring population burst of invasive and range-expanding herbivorous fishes at tipping points of abrupt change. This subsequently results in the deterioration of rocky reef habitats and the depletion of algal resources, with the tipping points of abrupt change for algal and herbivore fish species not overlapping chronologically. As sea temperature increases, ineffective or recently established MPAs may inadvertently facilitate the proliferation of invasive and range-expanding species, posing a significant challenge to management effectiveness and conservation objectives.

AB  - The total number of species on earth and the rate at which new species are created are fundamental questions for ecology, evolution and conservation. These questions have typically been approached separately, despite their obvious interconnection. In this study, we approach both questions in conjunction, for all terrestrial animals. To do this, we combine two previously unconnected bodies of theory: general ecosystem models and individual-based ecological neutral theory. General ecosystem models provide us with estimated numbers of individual organisms, separated by functional group and body size. Neutral theory, applied within a guild of functionally similar individuals, connects species richness, speciation rate, and number of individual organisms. In combination, for terrestrial endotherms where species numbers are known, they provide us with estimates for speciation rates as a function of body size and diet class. Extrapolating the same rates to guilds of ectotherms enables us to estimate the species richness of those groups, including species yet to be described. We find that speciation rates per species per million years decrease with increasing body size. Rates are also higher for carnivores compared to omnivores or herbivores of the same body size. Our estimate for the total number of terrestrial species of animals is in the range 1.03-2.92 million species, a value consistent with estimates from previous studies, despite having used a fundamentally new approach. Perhaps what is most remarkable about these results is that they have been obtained using only limited data from larger endotherms and their speciation rates, with the predictive process being based on mechanistic theory. This work illustrates the potential of a new approach to classic eco-evolutionary questions, while also adding weight to existing predictions. As we now face an era of dramatic biological change, new methods will be needed to mechanistically model global biodiversity at the species and individual organism level. This will be a huge challenge but the combination of general ecosystem models and neutral theory that we introduce here is a way to tractably achieve it.

AB  - Spatial dimensions play a significant role in niche differentiation, facilitating species coexistence. Understanding how sympatric ungulates optimize habitat utilization and how they co-exist in resource-limited environments is essential for effective wildlife conservation and reserve management. Tibetan antelope (chiru, Pantholops hodgsonii), Tibetan wild ass (kiang, Equus kiang), and wild yak (Bos grunniens) are sympatric ungulates co-evolving over generations across the Tibetan Plateau, but limited information is available on their spatial partitioning and the key variables affecting both single-species and multi-species distributions. In this study, using a combination of maximum entropy model, joint species distribution models, and random forest analysis, we examined the spatial partitioning of the three ungulates and identified the critical factors influencing their distributions with their spatial distribution data collected from the Arjin Shan National Nature Reserve in the Tibetan Plateau. Our key findings: (i) Notable differences were observed in the spatial distributions of the three ungulates, with only 16% overlap in their suitable habitats. Temperature had a stronger influence on the habitat selection by chiru and kiang, whereas precipitation played a more significant role in determining the distributions of kiang and wild yak. (ii) During summer, the interspecific relationships between chiru and wild yak, and between chiru and kiang exhibited positive correlations, while the relationship between wild yak and kiang was negatively correlated. In winter, all interspecific relationships were negatively correlated. (iii) Temperature seasonality and mean temperature of the driest quarter emerged as the most critical variables influencing multi-species habitat selection. Human interference had a significantly negative impact on all three ungulate species. Our findings underscore the importance of spatial heterogeneity in facilitating species coexistence under both climatic and anthropogenic pressures, offering valuable insights for multi-species conservation planning in resource-limited ecosystems.

AB  - The continued decline of long-distance ungulate migrations threatens to decouple important ecological processes that increase biodiversity and wildlife abundance. Past research has focused on preserving migration paths where habitat fragmentation and loss disrupt movement corridors. However, shifting residency-migration trade-offs are the stronger driver of migration loss in some populations. Suburban residential developments may provide ungulates with anthropogenic food sources and refuge from predators, which can increase population growth among short-distance migrants relative to long-distance migrants. This trend can increase wildlife vehicle collisions and other human-wildlife conflicts while simultaneously reducing hunting opportunities. Yet, individual animals vary in their tolerance of human disturbance. We investigated how interindividual variation relative to conflict and human habituation influences elk migration and space use on shared winter range. We used a clustering algorithm applied to GPS collar data to identify elk use of anthropogenic food resources in suburban habitat. Cluster locations identified all known anthropogenic subsidy locations during the study period. Elk that used suburban anthropogenic food sources also migrated 60% shorter distances between summer and winter ranges than elk with no known use of these food subsidies. Elk use of protected wintering grounds was spatially structured such that conflict-prone, short-distance migrants disproportionately used areas with more human activity. Clustering algorithms applied to GPS collar data may allow managers to identify foci of concentrated use that generates human-wildlife conflict, and where prion deposition and environmental contamination facilitate the spread of chronic wasting disease, particularly in suburban areas with anthropogenic food subsidies. The apparent spatial structuring of shared winter range according to the conflict potential and migration strategy of individual elk may also permit managers to assess relative recruitment among cryptic population segments using different migration strategies and facilitate targeted, adaptive management actions. These associations between conflict, human habituation, and migration shed light on the urbanization of wildlife species, inform efforts to manage human-wildlife conflict and disease spread, and emphasize that a multipronged approach beyond maintaining habitat corridors may be necessary to conserve long-distance migrations for species that can become human-habituated.

AB  - For the conservation of wild species, it is important to understand how landscape change and land management can affect gene flow and movement. Landscape genetic analyses provide a powerful approach to infer effects of various landscape factors on gene flow, thereby informing conservation actions. The Persian squirrel is a keystone species in the woodlands and oak forests of Western Asia, where it has experienced recent habitat loss and fragmentation. We conducted landscape genetic analyses of individuals sampled in the northern Zagros Mountains of Iran (provinces of Kurdistan, Kermanshah, and Ilam), focusing on the evaluation of isolation by distance (IBD) and isolation by resistance (IBR), using 16 microsatellite markers. The roles of geographical distance and landscape features including roads, rivers, developed areas, farming and agriculture, forests, lakes, plantation forests, rangelands, shrublands, and rocky areas of varying canopy cover, and swamp margins on genetic structure were quantified using individual-based approaches and resistance surface modeling. We found a significant pattern of IBD but only weak support for an effect of forest cover on genetic structure and gene flow. It seems that geographical distance is an important factor limiting the dispersal of the Persian squirrel in this region. The results of the current study inform ongoing conservation programs for the Persian squirrel in the Zagros oak forest.

AB  - While top-down control plays an important role in shaping both natural and agricultural food webs, we lack insights into how top-down control effects vary across spatial scales. We used a multi-scale survey of top-down control of coffee pests and diseases by arboreal ants to examine if colony location creates a small-scale mosaic in top-down control around trees and if the strength of that control varies between sites at the landscape scale. We investigated pest and disease levels on coffee shrubs at different distances from shade trees with and without a Crematogaster spp. ant colony in 59 sites along a coffee management intensity gradient in southwestern Ethiopia. Within sites, ants significantly suppressed herbivory and coffee leaf rust at distances less than 10 m from nesting trees. Top-down control varied between sites, with stronger top-down control of free-feeding herbivory near ant colonies at sites with lower management intensity and stronger top-down control of a skeletonizer at sites with higher canopy cover. We conclude that the strength of top-down control by ants is highly heterogeneous across spatial scales, as a consequence of the biology of the predator at the small scale and herbivore density or changes in herbivore-ant interactions at the landscape scale.

AB  - Diet composition is among the most critical dimensions of animal ecology, yet seasonal dietary diversity has rarely been investigated in sympatric herbivores. This study used DNA metabarcoding to conduct an analysis of seasonal variations in diet composition and trophic niches for sympatric sika deer, Reeves' muntjac, and Chinese hare in Taohongling National Nature Reserve (TNNR). The results showed that Smilax china (11.79%) was the leading food eaten by sika deer in summer, whereas dominated by Rubus spp. (36.42%) and Loropetalum chinense (25.48%) in winter; Rubus spp. accounted for the majority of Reeves' muntjac's diet throughout the year. In comparison, the Chinese hare primarily consumed Smilax china from winter to spring but changed to Poa annua (10.81%) and Setaria viridis (23.05%) in summer and fall. Compared to other seasons, significant differences (Shannon index, p < 0.05) occurred in spring and summer, showing higher diversity of food items across the three herbivorous. Nonmetric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) analysis suggested significant partitioning in the food items of Chinese hares compared to the two ruminants. Both sika deer and Reeves' muntjac occupied a wider niche breadth and dietary diversity in summer, reflecting generalised feeding habits (Sd: Ba = 0.06; Rm: Ba = 0.04) and lower in fall (Ba = 0.01) with stronger selectivity and specialization, which was consistent with the optimal foraging theory. Notably, no significant difference was indicated in seasonal niche breadth for Chinese hare (p > 0.05). The niche overlap indices were 0.989 (fall) and 0.831 (winter) between sika deer and Reeves' muntjac, indicating a higher dietary similarity and overlap. However, differences in foraging plant taxa and abundance ratios may facilitate dietary niche partitioning. The diet of herbivores reflected plant-herbivore interactions and seasonal diet differences were correlated with feeding strategies, which facilitate coexistence and reduce competition of co-occurring species in the food dimension.

AB  - Plant species height (mature height), which strongly correlates with other measures of size, is widely considered an important functional trait. Taller species contribute greatly to ecosystem function and are frequently identified as strong competitors. Additionally, important ecological processes like self-thinning scale with plant species size. In spite of the clear functional importance of species size, evidence for size-based plant community assembly rules has been scant. While herbivory can be species specific and there are reasons why herbivores may target larger plant species, it is unknown whether herbivory has size-biased impacts on species composition. In an old-field plant community, we compared plant species composition in herbivore exclusion (caged) and control plots over five years to test whether herbivore activity favors species at one end of the size spectrum. Across 5 years, smaller species were modestly, but consistently, underrepresented in caged plots compared to control plots. This underrepresentation of relatively smaller plant species in caged plots, where seedling herbivory was greatly diminished, was driven by lower small plant species richness and abundance in those plots; the abundance and richness of tall species did not differ across treatments. Our findings demonstrate that reducing herbivore activity in our study community modestly but consistently altered plant species composition, slightly favoring larger species. There was no evidence that larger species are preferentially targeted by herbivores. Some research suggests, although it will require further investigation, that seedling herbivory, regardless of the species eaten, produces vegetation gaps that small plant species are more successful in colonizing.

AB  - Climate change is one of the main drivers of biodiversity decline worldwide, through shifting or shrinking habitats of species. Predicting the distribution of suitable habitats for species under climate change is essential for conservation planning. Cyamophila astragalicola is a specialist psyllid dependent on a spiny shrub, endemic to Zagros Mountains of Iran. The current study represents a modeling approach for lesser-known small invertebrates to assess their threat status. Ecological niche modeling was used to assess current suitable habitats of C. astragalicola, to develop model-based predictions of its habitat suitability under different climatic scenarios, and to assess the extinction risk of the species based on IUCN Red List criteria. Results revealed a sharp decline in suitable habitats (97.26% and 99.8% for the years 2050 and 2070, respectively) under the scenario of RCP 8.5. Further, under the two RCP scenarios, C. astragalicola was classified as IUCN Threat 2. A shift toward higher altitudes with lower temperature and higher precipitation was predicted. Results of modeling are based on abiotic factors only. Human interactions are not modeled; hence, the status of the species may be even more dramatic than the models may reveal. Generally, the results of this study indicate the high sensitivity of C. astragalicola to global warming. The narrow distribution range of the species coupled with the low dispersal ability can increase the risk of extinction. Ecological, economic, and social risks associated with the extinction need to be further evaluated to formulate future management policies.

AB  - This account presents information on all aspects of the biology of Cytisus scoparius (L.) Link (Broom or Scotch Broom) (Sarothamnus scoparius (L.) W.D.J. Koch) that are relevant to understanding its ecological characteristics and behaviour. The main topics are presented within the standard framework of the Biological Flora of the British Isles: distribution, habitat, communities, responses to biotic factors, responses to the environment, structure and physiology, phenology, floral and seed characters, herbivores and disease, history, and conservation. Broom is shade-intolerant and drought-tolerant, aided by c. 40% of net carbon fixation coming from stem photosynthesis and an ability to shed leaves in inclement periods. It is at its best in lowland, open, disturbed habitats but also open woodland; widespread across Britain, Ireland and much of Europe. It has been widely introduced to all continents (except Antarctica) where due to its prolific seeding and rapid spread it is often an invasive shrub. Broom thrives in an oceanic climate on a range of moist soils but is capable of invading arid and poor soils, helped by its ability to acquire 50% of its nitrogen from bacteria in root nodules. Broom is an obligate seeder, pollinated by a limited range of insects, primarily bees large enough to trip the explosive pollination mechanism. Seeds are dispersed explosively from the fruit and secondarily moved by ants attracted to the elaiosome. The water impermeable seed coat results in high dormancy, and so broom forms a significant seed bank. In Britain and Ireland, populations are showing little decline and broom is not considered to be at threat of extinction. In introduced areas, broom can rapidly spread despite browsing by native species and livestock. Biological control using a range of insects introduced from native areas, particularly seed eaters, together with mechanical and possibly chemical treatment, is showing some promise in its control.

AB  - Artificial light at night (ALAN) affects species' physiology and behaviour, and the interactions between species. Despite the importance of plants as primary producers, it remains poorly understood whether and how effects of ALAN on plants cascade through the food web. We assess the extent to which ALAN of different spectra result in plant-mediated insect herbivory damage. In a 6-month field experiment, we exposed plants of differing palatability to three colours of ALAN and a dark control, and assessed plant traits (growth rate, leaf size, foliar density and thickness) and insect herbivory (represented by insect damage as loss of foliage to leaf-chewing insects, and gall abundance by phloem-feeding herbivory). We found evidence for plant trait-mediated ALAN effects on herbivory for oak, but not for blueberry. In oak, ALAN of different colours changed the direction of relationships of insect damage with relative growth rate and with leaf thickness. Moreover, we found that the effects of ALAN on herbivory damage differed markedly between forest types within the same locale, particularly in the red light treatment. Synthesis and applications. Our results provide evidence that continuous night-time light, as provided by street lighting around the world, affects food web interactions. The nature of these effects differed by species and appeared to depend on forest type and the light spectrum employed, thus underlining the context dependency of ALAN in different ecosystems and environmental settings. These findings highlight the complexity of using spectral manipulation as a mitigation measure, and the need for further consideration of ALAN in environmental management and planning, to limit the exposure and impact of cascading effects of artificial light at night on food webs and communities.

AB  - The impact of climate change on the dynamics of populations has been well documented and is widespread. However, weather variability influences populations both directly and indirectly, and is mediated by species interactions. This complexity may impede proper climate impact assessments. Hence, predicting the consequences of climate change may require including processes that occur both with time lags and across trophic levels. Based on our current understanding of the mechanisms linking local climate and trophic interactions in tundra ecosystems, we used a state-space formulation of a mediation model that allowed for assessing the relative contribution of direct and indirect environmental (weather and trophic) effects on reindeer Rangifer tarandus reproductive success. Our study showed that the mediator effect of body condition caused delayed but predictable effects of weather, plant productivity, and reindeer densities on reproductive success. Furthermore, these predictors also affected reproductive success directly and with the same sign, suggesting that direct and indirect effects pulled in the same direction with respect to their combined total effect on reproductive success. Hence, poor weather conditions not only affect calf production negatively the same year, but also increase the likelihood of poor reproductive success the subsequent year. The results support the expectation that calf slaughter mass (as a proxy for herd body condition) is an important indicator of the state of reindeer herds with respect to their production potential and resilience to weather events and climate change. Finally, the model framework employed in the present study can be further developed as a potential vehicle for near-term forecasting, and thereby constitutes a useful tool for adaptive management.

AB  - As the world's human population continues to concentrate within urban areas and these landscapes continue to expand worldwide, wildlife is under pressure to adapt to novel environmental disturbances. Along wild-to-urban gradients, and especially within less developed areas, human recreation can affect wildlife behaviour. These effects may be most apparent during peaks in human recreational activity. In this study, we used data from a large-scale citizen science camera trapping project to assess whether periodic increases in human recreational activity elicit behavioural responses across multiple mammal species in northern Utah, U.S.A. Specifically, we assessed whether increases in human recreational ac-tivity during the weekend affected mammalian temporal activity patterns at the community-wide and species-specific level. In general, we found little evidence supporting the presence of a temporal 'weekend effect'. At the community-wide scale, we found that mammalian diel activity patterns did not change in response to periodic increases in human recreational activity during the weekend. On the species-specific scale, only elk, Cervus canadensis, and rock squirrel, Otospermophilus variegatus, signifi-cantly altered temporal activity patterns during the weekend. However, people significantly altered temporal activity during the weekend, with more activity occurring in midday and less activity occurring in the early evening, leading to consistent decreases in human-wildlife temporal overlap. This study highlights the possibility of altered human activity patterns during periods of increased rates of activity serving as a human-wildlife conflict mitigation strategy.(c) 2023 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB  - Ecological restoration commonly emphasizes reestablishing native plant communities. Implicit in this approach is the assumption that actively restoring plant communities can passively restore structure and function of other community components like wildlife. However, this assumption is rarely tested. We evaluated how plant restoration in grasslands of the northwestern United States affected the structure (composition and relative abundance) of native small mammal communities and the important functional role they play as seed predators. We quantified vegetation, small mammal community structure, small mammal seed predation, and effects of seed predation on native plant recruitment in comparable grasslands that were either native-dominated, planted with introduced forage grasses, or had undergone restoration treatments to suppress introduced grasses and increase native plants with and without supplemental watering. Native plant cover averaged >= 5 times higher at restoration sites relative to introduced grass sites. Small mammals, primarily deer mice (Peromyscus maniculatus), were least abundant in introduced grass sites and most abundant in water-supplemented restoration treatments, with intermediate levels in native and unwatered restoration sites. Seed offerings and seed sowing experiments indicated that seed predation and its effects on plant recruitment correlated with small mammal abundance, with effects generally weakest in introduced grass and strongest in restoration sites. Our results suggest that active plant restoration can passively restore the structure and function of native small mammal communities. While small mammal seed predation is a desired long-term function, it can also inhibit restoration efforts. We discuss emerging strategies for mitigating seed predation during restoration seeding.

AB  - 1. Many invasion hypotheses propose biotic interactions as the main mechanism to explain non-native species' success. Despite the evidence that the strength of biotic interactions varies with abiotic context, it remains unclear whether the importance of the different mechanisms proposed to explain invasion predictably varies with the abiotic context and whether this variation is consistent across different growth forms.
   2. We reviewed studies at a global scale to evaluate whether evapotranspiration, latitude, precipitation and temperature influence the importance of disturbance, enemy release, facilitation, and novel weapons mechanisms to explain non-native plant invasions. In total, we calculated 171 effect sizes for -300 non-native plant species covering a wide range of environmental conditions and growth forms.
   3. Environmental context and plant growth form influenced the role played by each invasion mechanism. The importance of disturbance in facilitating invasion exhibited a quadratic relationship with latitude and temperature, and decreased with increasing precipitation. In mixed communities and trees, disturbance was mediated by either evapotranspiration, latitude, precipitation or temperature. Enemy release exhibited a quadratic relationship with evapotranspiration, latitude and precipitation, and it was positively related to temperature. The importance of enemy release was also contingent on growth form and was highly context-dependent. Enemy release responses for grasses, and trees were modulated by either evapotranspiration, latitude, precipitation or temperature. The importance of facilitation decreased with increasing temperature. In forbs, facilitation decreased with evapotranspiration and temperature. The importance of novel weapons was more strongly confirmed for studies conducted at lower evapotranspiration, precipitation and higher latitudes, and exhibited a quadratic relationship with temperature.
   4. Synthesis. Our results show that environmental conditions not only filter non-native species depending on physiological tolerances but may also influence the importance of invasion mechanisms.

AB  - Protected areas (PAs) represent the most dominant conservation model in the world, though existing research on how and why their conservation outcomes vary remain scarce. In contribution to this discourse, we evaluated the densities and temporal trends of seven herbivorous mammal species across a protected area (PA) network in the Tarangire Ecosystem, Tanzania, and assessed human-wildlife interactions for 19 species. We conducted seasonal wildlife surveys inside five PAs and structured questionnaires in adjacent villages. Our study focused on two national parks, two community-based conservation areas, and one game-controlled area with limited management capacity. We extracted several ecological (wildlife densities and their trends over time) and human-wildlife interaction (number of herbivore and carnivore species associated with benefits, costs and illegal use) indicators and compared them across the PAs using generalized linear models. We found that both national parks and community-based conservation areas can support high densities of mammal species with stable or positive annual trends. In some instances, these wildlife population dynamics were associated with negative humanwildlife interactions near the boundaries of the PA, but this did not emerge as a consistent pattern. National parks can also be associated with negative annual population trends and negative human-wildlife interactions near their boundaries. The game-controlled area scored the lowest on both ecological and human-wildlife interaction indicators highlighting the importance of management-in-practice. Our findings suggest that the outcomes of PAs vary considerably, even within the same ecosystem, and that local social-ecological context likely affects their sustainability.

AB  - Major aridification events in Australia during the Pliocene may have had significant impact on the distribution and structure of widespread species. To explore the potential impact of Pliocene and Pleistocene climate oscillations, we estimated the timing of population fragmentation and past connectivity of the currently isolated but morphologically similar subspecies of the widespread brushtail possum (Trichosurus vulpecula). We use ecological niche modeling (ENM) with the current fragmented distribution of brushtail possums to estimate the environmental envelope of this marsupial. We projected the ENM on models of past climatic conditions in Australia to infer the potential distribution of brushtail possums over 6 million years. D-loop haplotypes were used to describe population structure. From shotgun sequencing, we assembled whole mitochondrial DNA genomes and estimated the timing of intraspecific divergence. Our projections of ENMs suggest current possum populations were unlikely to have been in contact during the Pleistocene. Although lowered sea level during glacial periods enabled connection with habitat in Tasmania, climate fluctuation during this time would not have facilitated gene flow over much of Australia. The most recent common ancestor of sampled intraspecific diversity dates to the early Pliocene when continental aridification caused significant changes to Australian ecology and Trichosurus vulpecula distribution was likely fragmented. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that the subspecies T. v. hypoleucus (koomal; southwest), T. v. arnhemensis (langkurr; north), and T. v. vulpecula (bilda; southeast) correspond to distinct mitochondrial lineages. Despite little phenotypic differentiation, Trichosurus vulpecula populations probably experienced little gene flow with one another since the Pliocene, supporting the recognition of several subspecies and explaining their adaptations to the regional plant assemblages on which they feed.

AB  - The conversion and degradation of natural habitats has caused global declines in terrestrial insect diversity. Conserving insect diversity has therefore gained increasing attention in international conservation agendas. Dung beetles (Geotrupidae, Scarabaeidae) are diverse and abundant coprophagous insects who remove dung and enhance nutrient cycling. Today, half of Central European dung beetle species are threatened. While past research has concentrated on local (alpha-diversity) of dung beetles, the compositional differences between sites (beta-diversity) have been largely neglected. However, maximizing the overall outcome of conservation measures requires a detailed understanding of the factors determining compositional differences between sites. We separated beta-diversity of dung beetle communities, sampled across the Czech Republic, into independent components of spatial turnover and nestedness. We tested the relative importance of space, temperature, precipitation, elevation, season, grazing herbivore and antiparasitic treatment via multiple regressions for distance matrices to reveal which factors drive the beta-diversity of dung beetle communities. Our results show that beta-diversity of dung beetle communities is mostly driven by spatial distance, followed by similarly strong effects of season and mean temperature. Herbivore type and antiparasitic treatment had lesser influence than environment but can be influenced by conservation management. Nevertheless, antiparasitic treatment increased nestedness and resulted in an overall lower gamma-diversity. Based on the principle of complementarity, we recommend - in order of decreasing importance - giving (1) conservation priority to the most distant sites, under (2) the largest differences in mean annual temperature, ensure (3) year-round grazing by (4) multiple herbivore species, and (5) avoid using antiparasitics.

AB  - The Caledonian pinewoods of northern Scotland represent the remnants of once extensive forests found at the western edge of the natural range of Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.). The surviving pinewoods are of international significance and are of high conservation and cultural value. However, for many decades, there has been concern about their long-term future because of a lack of regenerating seedlings and young trees. This problem is thought to be driven by high deer populations resulting in intensive browsing and severe damage to young trees, as well as a lack of favourable micro-sites for seedling germination. An experiment was established on the Mar Lodge estate in 2007-08 adjacent to native pinewood stands to test the effects of protection and site cultivation upon seedling numbers and growth. The experiment was located within a regeneration zone where intensive deer control had reduced numbers to <5 animals km(-2). Ten years after initiation, occurrence and numbers of both Scots pine and birch seedlings were substantially increased in cultivated treatments compared with uncultivated controls. There were no effects of protection upon seedling numbers. Protection improved height growth of Scots pine, but not of birch. Cultivation had no effect upon the growth of pine seedlings but did influence the height of birch seedlings due to the rapid growth of some pre-existing seedlings in the uncultivated control. Vegetation cover had increased from similar to 60%to at least 80% cover 6 years after cultivation. The results suggest that site cultivation may be desirable to boost seedling germination within a Caledonian pinewood, but sustained measures to control browsing pressure are a prerequisite for satisfactory establishment of these seedlings.

AB  - With a global population estimated at 2000 individuals between Argentina and Chile, less than 1% of its historical population, the huemul (Hippocamelus bisulcus) is categorized as "Endangered". Through a population viability analysis, we sought to estimate the viability of two huemul populations under different threat scenarios. Through a sensitivity analysis, we expected to identify those threats, and environmental or population variables that are more relevant for each population survival. Our main goal is to contribute to the management of the species in Chile through threats prioritization seeking to focus future conservation strategies. This research involved huemul populations from the Nevados de Chillan-Laguna del Laja Biological Corridor Biosphere Reserve (NCLL) and the Cerro Castillo National Park (PNCC). The NCLL population showed a very low probability of survival with a mean time to extinction of 45.9 years; in contrast, PNCC population exhibited a higher probability of survival with a mean time to extinction of 68.6 years. Predation and harassment by dogs seem to have the most significant negative impact on both populations' fate. Additionally, populations were highly sensitive to the percentage of reproductive females and female mortality. Based on our findings, we proposed concentrating conservation efforts on reducing or eliminating dogs' chances to attacks and predate huemul, as well as to focus surveillance actions on females.

AB  - The enemy release hypothesis proposes that invasion by exotic plant species is driven by their release from natural enemies (i.e. herbivores and pathogens) in their introduced ranges. However, in many cases, natural enemies, which may be introduced or managed to regulate invasive species, may fail to impact target host populations. Landscape heterogeneity, which can affect both the population dynamics of the pathogen and the susceptibility and the density of hosts, may contribute to why pathogens fail to control hosts despite established negative disease impacts.
   We explored patterns of post-fire infection of the fungal head-smut pathogen Ustilago bullata on the invasive annual cheatgrass Bromus tectorum, which has caused the notorious grass-fire cycle and ecosystem degradation across Western North America. We asked whether infection level was a driver of host density or vice-versa, and how weather affected infection and how spatial patterns of infection varied with time since fire, using a combination of structural equation modelling (SEM), proportional odds modelling and entropy-based local indicator of spatial association (ELSA) on data from >700 plots spanning >100,000 ha remeasured annually for 4 years.
   Observed infection levels increased with greater prior-year cheatgrass cover, and disease severity did not suppress cheatgrass populations. Warm, humid fall/winters and proximity to fire refugia (unburned patches) were associated with more infections. Infection clustering was most evident 2-3 years following fire with warm-wet fall-winter conditions and decreased after two drier, colder winters.
   Synthesis. Severity of fungal disease did not result in measurable reductions of populations of a non-native, invasive host species, cheatgrass, which suggests that natural enemies may not strongly regulate cheatgrass in its introduced range. Landscape heterogeneity associated with disturbance and weather limited population-level infection of hosts by the fungal pathogen. Disturbance (specifically wildfire) and variable weather are key components of this and similar invasion systems, and likely need to be considered when evaluating disease dynamics and potential for natural enemies to influence invasion potential.

AB  - Woody plant encroachment threatens grassland biomes at a global scale. Pyric herbivory combines prescribed burnings and targeted grazing to restore open habitats and has proved to be successful in promoting landscape and plant community diversity. However, less is known on the effects of pyric herbivory practices on below ground biodiversity. We evaluated the midterm effect on mesofauna, bacteria and fungi of prescribed burns and targeted horse grazing regimes implemented to restore a grassland encroached by gorse (Ulex gallii Planch.). We hypothesized that 1) low-intensity shrub-to shrub burnings had no effect or had a transient effect of low magnitude on soil microbial diversity, and that 2) targeted horse grazing after burning increased soil mesofauna and microbial diversity in the midterm. We established an experiment in two shrub-encroached grasslands in western Pyrenees with three treatments (no burning and no grazing as control, burning but no grazing, and burning and grazing). We measured soil properties and soil diversity of fungi and bacteria (DNA-metabarcoding) just after fire, and vegetation structure, soil properties and soil diversity of fungi, bacteria and mesofauna after two periods of targeted grazing (a year and a half after the burning). The response to pyric herbivory differed among soil organisms. Fungi were more sensitive to burning than bacteria, but both recovered a year and a half after burning -fungi only recovered in the presence of grazing-. Grazing increased soil fungi and bacteria diversity indexes (-20 % and-5 % increase, respectively) at the two sites. A year and a half after burning, burned and ungrazed areas had a 30 % more mesofauna diversity than control areas whereas grazing of the burned areas decreased mesofauna diversity by 30 % at one of the sites compared to the control. Since the responses to pyric herbivory vary among soil organisms, a wide range of management intensities across space and time are recommended for maximizing soil biodiversity.

AB  - The weevil Gonipterus platensis is among the most important eucalypt (Eucalyptus spp.) pest species worldwide. In Portugal, weevil-induced damage has great economic significance and efforts are being taken to find adequate alternatives to the biological control of this defoliator by its parasitoid Anaphes nitens, which is ineffective at altitudes above 400 m. With the aim of improving current knowledge on the ecology of G. platensis, we evaluated its interactions with local and landscape factors through the application of generalized linear mixed models for (1) the probability of weevil occurrence in sampling points, and (2) the relative abundance of each of its two annual generations on eucalypt trees. Our models confirmed the significant positive effect of elevation, here found to come off just above 360 m a.s.l., on both the occurrence and the abundance of G. platensis. Moreover, our results denoted that stand-level variables can likewise affect this pest. Points located more than 400 m inside the stands and, to a lesser extent, those comprising smaller (yet mature) eucalypt trees and where trees of other species were absent, showed an increased probability of G. platensis occurrence. Concordantly, significantly higher abundances of both weevil generations were observed on 3-8 years-old eucalypt trees. In addition, there was a negative effect of coppiced stands on G. platensis abundance which was only significant for the first annual generation and probably was related with weevil's recent colonization of stands ravaged by wildfires two years before our field surveys. Weevil populations were not influenced by the density of stand canopy, neither by understory structure and composition, nor by bare soil cover, hence it is not expected that thinning, shrub removal and soil scarification practices can affect G. platensis attacks in eucalypt stands. Overall, our study provides key knowledge on the ecology of G. platensis and its response to local and landscape features, paving the way for enhanced management of eucalypt plantations.

AB  - Ocean warming is altering the biogeographical distribution of marine organisms. In the tropics, rising sea surface temperatures are restructuring coral reef communities with sensitive species being lost. At the biogeographical divide between temperate and tropical communities, warming is causing macroalgal forest loss and the spread of tropical corals, fishes and other species, termed "tropicalization". A lack of field research into the combined effects of warming and ocean acidification means there is a gap in our ability to understand and plan for changes in coastal ecosystems. Here, we focus on the tropicalization trajectory of temperate marine ecosystems becoming coral-dominated systems. We conducted field surveys and in situ transplants at natural analogues for present and future conditions under (i) ocean warming and (ii) both ocean warming and acidification at a transition zone between kelp and coral-dominated ecosystems. We show that increased herbivory by warm-water fishes exacerbates kelp forest loss and that ocean acidification negates any benefits of warming for range extending tropical corals growth and physiology at temperate latitudes. Our data show that, as the combined effects of ocean acidification and warming ratchet up, marine coastal ecosystems lose kelp forests but do not gain scleractinian corals. Ocean acidification plus warming leads to overall habitat loss and a shift to simple turf-dominated ecosystems, rather than the complex coral-dominated tropicalized systems often seen with warming alone. Simplification of marine habitats by increased CO2 levels cascades through the ecosystem and could have severe consequences for the provision of goods and services.

AB  - Forest pest infestation is a major driver of tree mortality, altering ecosystem functioning, changing microcli-mates, and causing significant woodland loss globally. We examined environmental effects on Picea abies sus-ceptibility to bark beetle Ips typographus before and during a multi-year severe outbreak in a protected, natural, Norway spruce-dominated mountain forest in Central Europe. In contrast to recent publications that focus on identifying spectral signatures related to the early ("green") beetle attack stage, we investigated large-scale signals indicating the predisposition of stands to herbivore infestation in the year preceding the outbreak, using remotely sensed (RS) climate and ecological data. Through partial least square regression, we analyzed interactions between microclimate variables related to susceptible, infested, and healthy spruce stands. Using RS classification maps, we reconstructed the annual forest area changes from 1985 to2020 and linked it to previous climate events. Our findings indicate that the surface temperature in stands subsequently attacked was higher compared to intact stands in the year prior colonization. Over the research period, the forest's original cover decreased by 50%, with an average annual change of 1.5%. The recorded episodes of above-average tree mortality were linked to extended summer warming and short-term winter temperature declines, accompanied by windstorms. We argue that the use of remotely sensed temperature data can aid in predicting landscape scale spruce susceptibility to bark beetle outbreak one year before the actual attack occurs. This prediction could substantially improve management of forest disturbance, by providing more time to implement preventive or protective measures.

AB  - Mosses although lack a proper rhizosphere, and poorly exploit the substratum on which they grow, still play complex role in ecological processes by providing nutrients and shelter to various organisms. Among the moss fauna, nematodes are the most abundant inhabitants. Keeping this in mind, the present study investigates how nematode communities differ among substratumdependent moss microhabitats from forest soil. For this, samples were collected from five different microhabitats (FS: forest soil, MS: mosses on soil, MR; mosses on rocks, MLT: mosses on lower tree trunk and MUT: mosses on upper part of tree trunk), from the mixed coniferous forest of Dachigam National Park, Srinagar, Jammu & Kashmir. Results showed that the distribution pattern of nematode assemblages mirror the variation of microclimate. Total nematode abundance, trophic abundance (bacterivores, fungivores, herbivores, predators) and diversity (Shannon index, Simpson index) were highest in FS and lowest in MUT. Maturity index indicated more stable nematode communities in forest soil compared to different moss microhabitats. Results from NMDS showed clear separation of samples between microhabitats forming isolated clusters. Enrichment index depicted more enriched condition in MUT and least in FS. In general, our findings provide insights that more abundant, diverse and stable nematode communities are supported in undisturbed forest soil compared to desiccation-prone moss microhabitats.

AB  - Despite its recognized importance for understanding the evolution of animal sociality as well as for conservation, long term analysis of social networks of animal populations is still relatively uncommon. We investigated social network dynamics in males of a gregarious mountain ungulate (Alpine ibex, Capra ibex) over ten years focusing on groups, sub-groups and individuals, exploring the dynamics of sociality over different scales. Despite the social structure changing between seasons, the Alpine ibex population was highly cohesive: fission-fusion dynamics lead almost every male in the population to associate with each other male at least once. Nevertheless, we found that male Alpine ibex showed preferential associations that were maintained across seasons and years. Age seemed to be the most important factor driving preferential associations while other characteristics, such as social status, appeared less crucial. We also found that centrality measures were influenced by age and were also related to individual physical condition. The multi-scale and long-term frame of our study helped us show that ecological constrains, such as resource availability, may play a role in shaping associations in a gregarious species, but they cannot solely explain sociality and preferential association that are likely also to be driven by life-history linked physiological and social needs. Our results highlight the importance of long-term studies based on individually recognizable subjects to help us build on our understanding of the evolution of animal sociality.

AB  - Climate change strains the global water supplies' capability to meet demands, especially in regions like South Africa, where resources are already scarce. The interconnectedness of water, energy, and food (WEF) exacerbates this challenge, amplifying the impact of climate change on water resource management across these sectors. Thus, in strengthening the long-term resilience and reliability of water resources, a necessity in South Africa, research on climate change and the WEF nexus is needed for water resource planning and development. Employing the WEF nexus approach, we applied the Climate Land-Use Energy and Water Strategies (CLEWS) modelling framework to assess climate change impacts on the water supply-demand relationship, considering the domestic, agriculture (irrigation) and energy generation sectors, and adopting the Buffalo River catchment, KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa, as a case study. A threefold approach was utilized: (1) water supplies and demands and the total unmet demands were quantified; (2) the percentages of water demands covered per sector were derived; and (3) the reliability of the water system to meet each sector's water demands was computed. The findings projected slight decreases (2%) in the Buffalo River catchment's total water demands towards the end of the 21st century, mainly due to changes in land suitability for agriculture. While the water system is projected to be reliable for highly populated municipalities (demand coverage index > 70%; reliability index >= 20%), it is unreliable for sparsely populated and agriculturally intensive municipalities (demand coverage index <= 12%; reliability index = 0%). Such unreliability will strain agricultural production as more than 70% of irrigation water demands come from these municipalities. Nexus-smart water allocation and capacity development plans are recommended to manage these challenges and ensure a just and sustainable water supply-demand relationship in light of climate change.

AB  - Human activities have altered the abundance and distribution of animals, reshaping ecosystems into novel and generally more depauperate configurations. Whereas, overhunting and habitat loss threaten numerous species, predation release and subsidies from agriculture and food waste benefit others. Although these impacts combined can generate multiple different outcomes, we propose that, depending on the prevalence of different anthropogenic drivers, mammalian communities are pushed towards one of three main defaunation syndromes: Herbivore -dominated, seed predator-dominated or mesopredator-dominated systems. The extirpation of top predators favors herbivore-dominated assemblages, while habitat loss and overhunting eliminate large-bodied herbivores, resulting in the dominance of smaller-bodied seed predators and mesopredators. Within fragmented landscapes where top predators are absent, mesopredator-dominated systems emerge supported by food subsidies from the surrounding agricultural matrix. Based on a large dataset of camera-trap studies, we show that continuous Neotropical forests with top predators exhibit a greater balance between these guilds and landscape structure explain composition variation according to these syndromes. The prevalence of one guild over others has profound effects on ecological processes, threatening ecosystem services and human health and may be the dominant scenario in the Anthropocene.

AB  - The quality of savanna habitats across the globe has declined due to increased grazing pressure from introduced ungulate species. High grazing pressure can result in a loss of perennial grass cover, which can lead to the formation of "soil scalds" on clay soils. Scalds are maintained by the formation of a soil crust, which impedes water penetration and increases runoff. Scald formation can have significant negative ecological impacts on savanna ecosystems, yet the reversibility of this process remains uncertain. In this study, we examine perennial grass decline in a north Australian savanna, where historic grazing pressure has resulted in formation of soil scalds. We tested the reversibility of scald formation by implementing a soil treatment, which involved ripping the soil to a depth of 5-10 cm and placing erosion matting on the soil surface. In addition, ungulate exclusion fencing was erected to test if the presence of feral ungulates impacted scald recovery. After a year of above-average rainfall, both control and soil treatment plots showed significant recovery in perennial and annual grass cover, as well as a significant decline in bare ground cover. However, the degree of recovery was greatest in soil treatment plots, mainly due to increases in annual grass cover. This short-term study suggests that passive recovery of scalds is possible under favorable conditions and confirms that soil mediation can accelerate revegetation. In contrast, fencing was not found to have a significant effect on vegetation recovery, which is likely due to the low ungulate density present during the study. It is important to note, however, that our results are from a single season and a long-term study is required to confirm ongoing recovery. (c) 2022 The Society for Range Management.

AB  - Simple SummaryClimate change has been regarded as one of the major threats to biodiversity by altering habitats and food sources for wildlife as well as the function of ecosystems. The giant panda is an endangered endemic species in China and a flagship species of the world's biodiversity conservation. Previous studies mostly focused on the effect of climate change on the giant panda itself. Few studies have addressed potential niche overlapping and interspecific competition between giant pandas and sympatric competitive species under future climate change. By assessing the spatial overlapping between giant pandas and sympatric competitive animals changes under future climate conditions in the Qinling Mountains, we found that the distribution areas of giant pandas and sympatric species would decrease remarkably under future climate changes. The shifting of the spatial aggregation between giant pandas and sympatric species vary under different climate change scenarios. New protected areas may need to be planned in order to maintain suitable habitats able to promote the survival of the species to climate changes.Understanding how climate change alters the spatial aggregation of sympatric species is important for biodiversity conservation. Previous studies usually focused on spatial shifting of species but paid little attention to changes in interspecific competitions under climate change. In this study, we evaluated the potential effects of climate change on the spatial aggregation of giant pandas (Ailuropoda melanoleuca) and three sympatric competitive species (i.e., black bears (Ursus thibetanus), golden takins (Budorcas taxicolor), and wild boars (Sus scrofa)) in the Qinling Mountains, China. We employed an ensemble species distribution modeling (SDM) approach to map the current spatial distributions of giant pandas and sympatric animals and projected them to future climate scenarios in 2050s and 2070s. We then examined the range overlapping and niche similarities of these species under different climate change scenarios. The results showed that the distribution areas of giant pandas and sympatric species would decrease remarkably under future climate changes. The shifting directions of the overlapping between giant pandas and sympatric species vary under different climate change scenarios. In conclusion, future climate change greatly shapes the spatial overlapping pattern of giant pandas and sympatric species in the Qinling Mountains, while interspecific competition would be intensified under both mild and worst-case climate change scenarios.

AB  - Livestock grazing is an influencing factor playing a key role in shaping the plant community, microbial community, and soil properties in grassland ecosystems. Northern China's Loess Plateau has been used for livestock grazing for centuries and is a vulnerable ecosystem. In this study, the fates of bacterial and fungal communities of the typical steppe of the Loess Plateau were investigated under increasing grazing intensities practiced in summer and winter seasons. The results revealed changes in soil physiochemical properties, plant community properties, and microbial diversity in response to alterations in the grazing intensity. The alpha diversity of microbial communities (including bacteria and fungi) exhibited an uneven trend during summer grazing due to an increase in grazing intensity, but it decreased during winter grazing; however, the observed changes were not significant. The beta diversity of the bacterial community was highly influenced by grazing intensity, the summer community clustered near nongrazing, and the winter community presented significantly different results. The beta diversity of the fungal community was not influenced by grazing intensity or season. Grazing induced the growth of fast-growing bacteria (such as Actinobacteria and Firmicutes) and saprophytic fungi and a reduction in overall pathogenic traits. Co-occurrence network analysis and a structural equation model revealed changes in soil and plant properties (such as soil nitrogen level, soil organic carbon level, aboveground biomass, and litter biomass), with an increase in grazing intensity contributing to alterations in bacterial and fungal diversities. This finding demonstrates that grazing intensity can directly affect soil microbes and play an indirect role by modifying soil nutrients and reducing plant biomass, which eventually contributes to changes in microbial communities. Overall, implementing low grazing intensity is suggested for maintaining the microbial community structure the same as that of the native microbiome (ungrazed) in the steppe ecosystems.

AB  - Trait-based approaches that complement taxonomy-based studies have increased in popularity among the scientific community over the last decades. The collection of biological and ecological characteristics of species (i.e., traits) provides insight into species and ecosystem vulnerability to environmental and anthropogenic changes, as well as ecosystem functioning. Here, we present the FUN Azores trait database, describe our approach, evaluate its scope, compare it to other marine trait databases, and explore the spatial distribution of its traits with "functional maps." While most of the available trait databases to date contain essential information to understand the functional diversity of a taxonomic or functional group, our ecosystem-based approach provides a comprehensive assessment of diverse fauna (i.e., meio-, macro-, and megafauna) from benthic and pelagic environments in the Azores Marine Park; including ridges, seamounts, hydrothermal vents, and the overlying water column. We used a collaborative approach involving 30 researchers with different expertise to develop the FUN Azores database, which contains compiled data on 14 traits representing morphological, behavioral, and life history characteristics for 1,210 species across 10 phyla. The "functional maps" show a distinct distribution of the two most common size classes, suggesting different communities with different functionalities. The following traits had the best scoring coverage (i.e., >95% of the species scored): maximum body size, body form, skeleton material, feeding structure, motility, environmental position, substratum affinity, distribution, and depth range; while traits related to species behavior (e.g., sociability or aggregation tendencies) and life history (e.g., developmental mechanism) had lower scoring coverage, highlighting the need for further research to fill these knowledge gaps. We found a larger number of species in the benthic compared to the pelagic environment and differing species composition between areas within the Azores Marine Park resulting from varying biodiversity, ecosystem types, sampling effort, and methodologies used. The FUN Azores database will foster and facilitate trait-based approaches in the area, develop a framework for expansion of cross-ecosystem and cross-taxa trait databases elsewhere, and improve our ecological understanding of the Azores Marine Park and its conservation requirements.

AB  - Background The growing interest in mineral resources of the deep sea, such as seafloor massive sulphide deposits, has led to an increasing number of exploration licences issued by the International Seabed Authority. In the Indian Ocean, four licence areas exist, resulting in an increasing number of new hydrothermal vent fields and the discovery of new species. Most studies focus on active venting areas including their ecology, but the non-vent megafauna of the Central Indian Ridge and South East Indian Ridge remains poorly known. In the framework of the Indian Ocean Exploration project in the German license area for seafloor massive sulphides, baseline imagery and sampling surveys were conducted yearly during research expeditions from 2013 to 2018, using video sledges and Remotely Operated Vehicles. New information This is the first report of an imagery collection of megafauna from the southern Central Indian-and South East Indian Ridge, reporting the taxonomic richness and their distribution. A total of 218 taxa were recorded and identified, based on imagery, with additional morphological and molecular confirmed identifications of 20 taxa from 89 sampled specimens. The compiled fauna catalogue is a synthesis of megafauna occurrences aiming at a consistent morphological identification of taxa and showing their regional distribution. The imagery data were collected during multiple research cruises in different exploration clusters of the German licence area, located 500 km north of the Rodriguez Triple Junction along the Central Indian Ridge and 500 km southeast of it along the Southeast Indian Ridge.

AB  - Natural caves play a crucial role in providing habitat for numerous bat species in temperate regions. While the potential of man-made structures to support biodiversity gains attention, there is a lack of information regarding the suitability of artificial tunnels as viable alternatives to natural ones. In this study, we assessed the use of artificial tunnels of hydroelectric power plants by bats in the NE Iberian Peninsula (Spain) during the breeding season for most species. Between 2013 and 2014, we monitored bat activity in 37 individualized tunnel entrances using harp traps and mist nets. To understand factors influencing their habitat use, we built competitive models to assess the effect of surrounding landscape, environment and tunnel factors on the richness and abundance of both cave-dwelling and generalist species, as well as on its suitability as breeding habitat for bats. We captured and identified a total of 738 bats representing 60% of species occurring in the South-West countries of Europe, including three regionally and two globally threatened species. Of the total, 67% of surveyed tunnels were used by bats. Our findings highlight that tunnel characteristics such as tunnel height, absence of grilles, and cover of surface runoff influenced all bat groups. Relative humidity primarily favours richness and abundance of females with pups. When properly designed and managed, man-made tunnels of hydroelectric power plants can play an important role in bat conservation by offering essential roosts and breeding sites; however, other potential ecological impacts of these infrastructures on local ecosystems must be considered.

AB  - This study investigates the possibility of utilising a drone equipped with a thermal camera to monitor the spatial distribution of red deer (Cervus elaphus) and to determine their behavioural patterns, as well as preferences for vegetation types in a moor in Denmark. The spatial distribution of red deer was mapped according to time of day and vegetation types. Reed deer were separated manually from fallow deer (Dama dama) due to varying footage quality. Automated object detection from thermal camera footage was used to identification of two behaviours, "Eating" and "Lying", enabling insights into the behavioural patterns of red deer in different vegetation types. The results showed a migration of red deer from the moors to agricultural fields during the night. The higher proportion of time spent eating in agricultural grass fields compared to two natural vegetation types, "Grey dune" and "Decalcified fixed dune", indicates that fields are important foraging habitats for red deer. The red deer populations were observed significantly later on grass fields compared to the natural vegetation types. This may be due to human disturbance or lack of randomisation of the flight time with the drone. Further studies are suggested across different seasons as well as the time of day for a better understanding of the annual and diurnal foraging patterns of red deer.

AB  - Climate change and human activities have disrupted historical fire regimes, leading to complex and far-reaching impacts on global ecosystems. Despite extensive research in fire ecology, studies exploring vertebrate responses to megafires, and to nuanced fire characteristics, remain limited.We collected camera trap data 3-27 months following Australia's 2019-20 'Black Summer' megafires from 30 burnt sites and 10 unburnt sites. Our data included 14 animal species/groups, encompassing mammalian predators, small and medium-sized mammals, large herbivores, and birds. We used generalised additive mixed models to assess the influence of time-since-the-fires, burn status, fire severity, proportional area burnt, and vegetation type on species' activity.Models that included fire variables were well-supported for all species. The proportional cover of low-moderate or high-extreme severity fire had substantial support for five species, particularly herbivores, which generally showed a preference for burnt sites but at differing fire severities. The proportional area burnt, disregarding severity, was well supported for four species. At highly burned sites fox activity peaked shortly after the fires while small to medium-sized mammal activity increased more gradually. Vegetation type strongly influenced the response of four species to fire; in particular, wet forest birds preferred unburnt areas.Policy implications. We document variable short- to medium-term responses of a range of species to fire which could help guide management interventions. We demonstrate that animal species' responses to fire are diverse and better captured using broader landscape scale fire variables. We found that species were strongly influenced by proportional area burnt, fire severity and vegetation type. Introduced foxes were attracted to recently burnt areas, so timely predator control may benefit vulnerable prey species. Wet forest species were sensitive to fires and could benefit from preservation and restoration of these habitats. Some species exploited low-moderate severity burnt areas, while others preferred high-severity burns. This suggests that species will face diverse challenges and opportunities in future extreme fire events. We emphasise the importance of using multi-faceted approaches to account for the complex responses of co-occurring species to fire events.

AB  - Rodents attack oak (Quercus wutaishanica) seeds based on their sizes and frequencies before germination. However, the predation of oak seeds post-germination (seedling cotyledons) is not well studied. Here, we not only tested the preference of rodents for oak seedlings from differentsized seeds, but also traced the seedling fate under different litter treatments. We transplanted seedlings with frequency of large and small seed (FLSD) ratios as 1:9, 3:7, 5:5, 7:3, and 9:1, respectively, with each set treated with the litter cleared and covered. Our results showed that small-seeded seedlings were more preferred when the FLSD was 1:9 and 3:7, whereas largeseeded seedlings had a higher preference when the FLSD was 9:1 and 7:3. Moreover, the predation and survival rates of the seedlings decreased when covered with litter, thus indicating that, although forest litter prevented the seedling predation by rodents, it was unfavorable for seedling survival. Furthermore, we found that cotyledon predation by rodents had no significant effect on seedling performance, but their growth was severely inhibited when the apical bud was bitten off, thus suggesting that the apical bud loss was the main cause of seedling recruitment failure. Our study indicates that positive frequency-dependent predation helps maintain the polymorphism of germination type of Q. wutaishanica seedlings. Additionally, in the forest, the presence of litter may change the predation behavior of rodents, which consequently affects the growth and survival of the seedlings. Moreover, future studies should focus on how the forest species' specific predatory habits and the litter of different thicknesses affect the growth and survival of the oak seedlings, to better understand the renewal mechanism of the oak trees.

AB  - In mammals, the gut microbiome is vertically transmitted during maternal lactation at birth. In this study, we investigated the gut microbiome and diets of muskox, a large herbivore inhabiting in the high Arctic. We compared the microbiota composition using bacterial 16S rRNA gene sequencing and diets using stable isotope analysis of muskox feces of six female adults and four calves on Ella Island, East Greenland. Firmicutes were the most abundant bacterial phylum in both the adults and calves, comprising 94.36% and 94.03%, respectively. Significant differences were observed in the relative abundance of the two Firmicutes families. The adults were primarily dominated by Ruminococcaceae (73.90%), and the calves were dominated by both Ruminococcaceae (56.25%) and Lachnospiraceae (24.00%). Stable isotope analysis of the feces in the study area revealed that both adults and calves had similar ranges of C-13 and N-15, likely derived from the dominant diet plants. Despite their similar diets, the different gut microbiome compositions in muskox adults and calves indicate that the gut microbiome of the calves may not be fully colonized to the extent of that of the adults.

AB  - Human beings have continued to decline and fragment mini-antelopes habitats. We studied the effects of land cover change on the conservation of the endangered Ader's Duiker (Cephalophus adersi), the Zanzibar blue duiker (Cephalophus monticola sundevalli) and the Suni (Neotragus moschatus zanzibaricus) in Zanzibar, Tanzania. Data were obtained from the 1975, 2009 and 2014 satellite images and geographical information systems, focus group discussions, transect-walk and observation. We found that the habitat of mini-antelopes had declined from 87.3% to 58.5% between 1975 and 2014 and become fragmented. The forest fragments increased from 35 to 139 patches while shrubs increased from 41 to 199 patches. Community members had the perception that the decline and fragmentation of the habitat had caused the numbers of mini-antelopes and their forage to decline. We also found that there were incidences of mini-antelopes eating crop plants such as cowpeas, yams and tomatoes in the farms during the night as an adaptive mechanism for forage decline. Conclusively, land cover changes from human activities have caused negative effects on the mini-antelopes. There is, therefore need for the local people, the government and private individuals or corporations to introduce collective conservation initiatives, including the establishment of conservation areas to conserve the mini-antelopes.

AB  - Variation in environmental conditions drive changes within aquatic ecosystems and their associated inhabitants, with salinity and temperature influencing the spatial and temporal patterns of biological communities. An extreme salinity gradient exists within the Eastern Gulf of Shark Bay UNESCO World Heritage Area, Western Australia, reaching <91.5 psu within Hamelin Pool Marine Nature Reserve. We deployed 288 baited remote underwater stereo-video systems (stereo-BRUVs) across four habitats (sand, seagrass, low relief stromatolites, and high relief stromatolites) and three locations (Eastern Gulf, Faure Sill, and Hamelin Pool) to examine variation in fish assemblages across this salinity gradient. A total of 20,533 fish from 90 species (44 Families) were identified, 86 % of which were carnivores, with only one herbivorous species recorded. Two species accounted for 50 % of fish observed (Helotes octolineatus (30 %) and Pentapodus vitta (20 %)). Variations in assemblages were driven by changes in salinity and habitat. The number of species decreased with increasing salinity, while seagrass habitats consistently had the highest abundance and number of species. However, the composition of seagrass affiliated fish assemblages differed among locations. Seven species observed are targeted by recreational fishers within Shark Bay. Chrysophrys auratus were significantly larger, and Epinephelus coioides and Lethrinus laticaudis more abundant in Hamelin Pool, a potential marine reserve effect. Despite extreme changes in salinity, fish assemblages here are diverse, with Hamelin Pool potentially facilitating the replenishment of species that are fished outside of the Marine Nature Reserve. Under the current effects of climate change, hypersaline environments around the world are likely to see salinity levels increase further, with a potential decrease in the diversity of their fish assemblages.

AB  - Context Tourism is a major contributor to coastal economies, with climate change generating unquantified impacts on this sector. Specifically, marine ecotourism businesses often depend on encounters with iconic megafauna, but it is unknown how interactions with these species might change under ocean warming.Aims To assess how climate change may affect key dive-ecotourism species (manta rays and zebra sharks) in south-eastern Australia, where changes in temporal persistence are anticipated.Methods Habitat-suitability models were developed for manta rays and zebra sharks and applied to predict changes in suitable thermal habitat at popular scuba-diving locations in New South Wales (NSW).Key results Sea-surface temperature was the dominant factor associated with the presence of manta rays and zebra sharks. Modelling indicated that timings of seasonal migrations are likely to be altered by ocean warming, with temporal persistence in central NSW potentially increasing, from current low levels, by up to 4 months by 2060.Conclusions Prospects for divers to encounter manta rays and zebra sharks are likely to increase in central NSW because of climate-driven ocean warming.Implications New ecotourism opportunities will develop in NSW, through increased potential to encounter iconic marine megafauna, providing novel openings for coastal ecotourism industries.

AB  - Protected areas are needed to conserve nature and biodiversity worldwide. The province of Quebec (Canada) recently established a large wilderness area affording significant habitat protection for boreal woodland caribou (Rangifer tarandus caribou), a wide-ranging species at risk. We describe a decision support framework combining ecological modeling with socioeconomic constraints that ultimately led to the creation of this protected area. Multiple criteria were used to identify candidate protected areas for boreal caribou. These had to be large in size (>10,000 km(2)) and located in regions where available high-quality habitat was threatened by development pressures. Candidate areas also had to contribute substantively to the maintenance of functional habitat connectivity, be exempt from major industrial developments and recent fires, and required evidence of recent use by caribou. Five candidate protected areas emerged from this exercise. Key regional stakeholders were consulted, thereby strengthening advocacy for land designation, and boundaries were refined through their input, which helped further reduce socioeconomic conflicts. This process involved difficult compromises, but eventually led to the legal designation on March 4, 2021 of a new protected area for boreal caribou known as the Caribous-Forestiers-de-Manouane-Manicouagan. We show how our science-informed decision support framework was instrumental in the success of this endeavor, and describe the obstacles overcame in the process, so that other jurisdictions may draw from this experience in their efforts to achieve similar conservation goals.

AB  - The origin of the African savanna has been traced back to 10-6 million years (Ma) ago, but the mechanisms driving its evolution are hotly debated, and include global atmospheric CO2, regional fire activity, herbivore competition, and hydrological climate change. Here, we present the first microcharcoal-based fire activity records covering the last similar to 7 Ma at four International Ocean Discovery Program (IODP) sites near southern Africa. The records show that fire activities in both savanna and non-savanna regions were stable during this interval. Grass vegetation in burnt biomass continued to expand from 6 Ma into the present savanna region, whereas no grass expansion was observed in non-savanna regions. A compilation of regional data suggests asynchronous C4 grass expansion since 6 Ma on the African Continent. We consider that CO2 concentrations and wildfires might have caused the first appearance of C4 plants at similar to 10 Ma and similar to 7-6 Ma, respectively. Since 6 Ma, the regional climate promoted expansion of C4 plants into the present-day savanna habitat.

AB  - Wildlife abundance and movement are strongly impacted by landscape heterogeneity, especially in cities which are among the world's most heterogeneous landscapes. Nonetheless, current global land cover maps, which are used as a basis for large-scale spatial ecological modeling, represent urban areas as a single, homogeneous, class. This often requires urban ecologists to rely on geographic resources from local governments, which are not comparable between cities and are not available in underserved countries, limiting the spatial scale at which urban conservation issues can be tackled. The recent expansion of community-based geographic databases, for example, OpenStreetMap (OSM), represents an opportunity for ecologists to generate large-scale maps geared toward their specific research needs. However, computational differences in language and format, and the high diversity of information within, limit the access to these data. We provide a framework, using R, to extract geographic features from the OSM database, classify, and integrate them into global land cover maps. The framework includes an exhaustive list of OSM features describing urban and peri-urban landscapes and is validated by quantifying the completeness of the OSM features characterized, and the accuracy of its final output in 34 cities in North America. We portray its application as the basis for generating landscape variables for ecological analysis by using the OSM-enhanced map to generate an urbanization index, and subsequently analyze the spatial occupancy of six mammals throughout Chicago, Illinois, USA. The OSM features characterized had high completeness values for impervious land cover classes (50%-100%). The final output, the OSM-enhance map, provided an 89% accurate representation of the landscape at 30m resolution. The OSM-derived urbanization index outperformed other global spatial data layers in the spatial occupancy analysis and concurred with previously seen local response trends, whereby lagomorphs and squirrels responded positively to urbanization, while skunks, raccoons, opossums, and deer responded negatively. This study provides a roadmap for ecologists to leverage the fine resolution of open-source geographic databases and apply it to spatial modeling by generating research-specific landscape variables. As our occupancy results show, using context-specific maps can improve modeling outputs and reduce uncertainty, especially when trying to understand anthropogenic impacts on wildlife populations.

AB  - Translocation records indicate aoudad (Ammotragus lervia) populations in the United States are a product of multiple human-mediated introductions. Two mitochondrial markers (cytochrome b, cytb; displacement loop, D loop) and one nuclear gene (prion protein gene exon 3, PRNP) were used to determine: (1) genetic variation, (2) if genetic units correspond to taxonomic designations, (3) the number and geographic origin of translocations, and (4) divergence times. Three phylogenetic analyses (Bayesian inference, maximum likelihood, and parsimony) produced similar topologies with two clades (I and II). Clade I contained progeny of individuals resulting from introductions to Texas and Spain, and individuals from Algeria. Individuals in Clade II were progeny of past introductions to the United States and Europe, and northern Algeria. Clade II was subdivided into two subclades (A and B) representing two haplogroups. No genetic variation was detected in the PRNP sequences. Three haplogroups appeared to correspond to the subspecies A. l. lervia and A. l. sahariensis whose native distribution includes northwestern Africa. Network analyses assigned haplogroups to two major groups similar to those depicted in the phylogenetic analyses. Genetic distances ranged from 0.80% to 5.17% and 2.99% to 15.42% for cytb and D loop, respectively; and were higher than normally recovered for caprids, warranting a reexamination of subspecific status. Divergence dates indicated a major split between A. l. lervia and A. l. sahariensis circa 2.38 mya. Together, the high level of genetic divergences among US populations and apparent presence of two subspecies of aoudad in the United States support the hypothesis of multiple introductions from multiple sources.

AB  - A growing body of evidence shows that some ungulates alternate between migratory and nonmigratory behaviors over time. Yet it remains unclear whether such short-term behavioral changes can help explain reported declines in ungulate migration worldwide, as opposed to long-term demographic changes. Furthermore, advances in tracking technology reveal that a simple distinction between migration and nonmigration may not sufficiently describe all individual behaviors. To better understand the dynamics and drivers of ungulate switching behavior, we investigated 14 years of movement data from 361 elk in 20 herds across the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem (GYE). First, we categorized yearly individual behaviors using a clustering algorithm that identified similar migratory tactics across a continuum of behaviors. Then, we tested seven hypotheses to explain why some ungulates switch behaviors, and we evaluated how behavioral changes affected the proportions of different behaviors across the system. We identified four distinct behavioral tactics: residents (4.8% of elk-years), short-distance migrants (53.7%), elevational migrants (21.9%) and long-distance migrants (19.6%). Of the 20 herds, 18 were partially migratory, and 5 had all four movement tactics present. We observed switches between migratory tactics in all sets of consecutive years during our study period, with an average of 22.5% of individual elk changing movement tactics from one year to the next. Elk in herds with higher movement tactic diversity were significantly more likely to switch tactics and often responded more effectively to adverse environmental conditions, compared to those in herds with low movement tactic diversity. During our study period, switching increased the prevalence of both short- and long-distance migrants, decreased the prevalence of elevational migrants, and had no effect on the prevalence of residents. Our findings suggest that rather than contributing to the declining migratory behavior found in the GYE, switching behavior may enable greater resiliency to continuously changing environmental and anthropogenic conditions.

AB  - Our study focused on evaluating plant diversity and vegetation changes in the dry grasslands of the Hainburger Berge Mountains protected within the NATURA 2000 reserve Hundsheimer Berge. Traditionally, these grasslands have been managed through intensive grazing but have experienced significant land-use changes since the 1950's, including a prolonged period of abandonment. We investigated rocky and xeric grasslands of Festuco-Brometea, and mesic grasslands of Molinio-Arrhenatheretea using six nested plot series of various spatial scales. We also resampled releves that were initially recorded in 2007 and analyzed them alongside older releves (1930-2001) from the Austrian Vegetation Database. The compositional data variation was primarily influenced by moisture and nutrient gradients along the first DCA axis, and soil reaction and light availability along the second DCA axis. Grazing intensity had a significant effect on species richness at small spatial scales, while at larger scales, habitat conditions played a more crucial role. A continuous successional development could be detected in grassland composition, leading to a denser vegetation canopy and increased moisture and nutrient availability. However, plot resampling since 2007 revealed only minor changes, primarily due to interannual dynamics rather than a clear directional trend. We conclude that the current conservation management of rocky and xeric grasslands is proving successful in maintaining grassland biodiversity as well as high number and proportion of endangered plant species. Controlling grazing intensity, involving more farmers, and implementing flexible rules for grazing, mowing, and subsidy eligibility, could be instrumental in achieving conservation targets in the future.

AB  - The Okapi (Okapia johnstoni), endemic to the Democratic Republic of Congo, symbolises national pride and biodiversity. However, this iconic species faces an alarming decline, with population estimates dropping drastically. This study aims to reconstruct the okapi population using a logistic model and analyse the critical threats contributing to its decline. Results indicate that artisanal mining is responsible for 98% of the population reduction since 2009, primarily through habitat destruction. Regression analysis reveals a strong inverse relationship between the number of artisanal mining sites and the remaining primary forest, both critical to okapi survival. The study concludes by recommending policy measures that balance ecological conservation with economic development, such as promoting less invasive industrial mining and strengthening protected areas. These measures are vital to preventing the extinction of this unique species.

AB  - Plant diversity varies immensely over large-scale gradients in temperature, precipitation, and seasonality at global and regional scales. This relationship may be driven in part by climatic variation in the relative importance of abiotic and biotic interactions to the diversity and composition of plant communities. In particular, biotic interactions may become stronger and more host specific with increasing precipitation and temperature, resulting in greater plant species richness in wetter and warmer environments. This hypothesis predicts that the many defensive compounds found in plants' metabolomes should increase in richness and decrease in interspecific similarity with precipitation, temperature, and plant diversity. To test this prediction, we compared patterns of chemical and morphological trait diversity of 140 woody plant species among seven temperate forests in North America representing 16.2 degrees C variation in mean annual temperature (MAT), 2,115 mm variation in mean annual precipitation (MAP), and from 10 to 68 co-occurring species. We used untargeted metabolomics methods based on data generated with liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry to identify, classify, and compare 13,480 unique foliar metabolites and to quantify the metabolomic similarity of species in each community with respect to the whole metabolome and each of five broad classes of metabolites. In addition, we compiled morphological trait data from existing databases and field surveys for three commonly measured traits (specific leaf area [SLA], wood density, and seed mass) for comparison with foliar metabolomes. We found that chemical defense strategies and growth and allocation strategies reflected by these traits largely represented orthogonal axes of variation. In addition, functional dispersion of SLA increased with MAP, whereas functional richness of wood density and seed mass increased with MAT. In contrast, chemical similarity of co-occurring species decreased with both MAT and MAP, and metabolite richness increased with MAT. Variation in metabolite richness among communities was positively correlated with species richness, but variation in mean chemical similarity was not. Our results are consistent with the hypothesis that plant metabolomes play a more important role in community assembly in wetter and warmer climates, even at temperate latitudes, and suggest that metabolomic traits can provide unique insight to studies of trait-based community assembly.

AB  - Analyzing the nutritional and defensive chemistry of Quercus rugosa provides insight into gall wasp interactions. Quercus rugosa is the most widely distributed white oak species in Mexico. It is the dominant canopy species in its geographic distribution range and has the largest number of associated gall wasp species (Cynipidae: Cynipini). Our main aims were to characterize the nutritional and defensive chemistry of Q. rugosa leaves and determine whether this chemistry differed between leaves with and without galls. We evaluated 60 trees from six populations of Q. rugosa in central Mexico. For each tree, we analyzed the nutritional chemistry (nitrogen, phosphorus, carbon, and carbon/nitrogen ratio) and defensive chemistry (secondary metabolites). Also, we characterized the community of cynipids in the leaf tissue of each tree. We documented 18 cynipid species, and the cynipid communities differed in composition among localities. We recorded the presence of a total of ten phenolics. The composition of nutritional and defensive chemicals differed significantly between leaves with and without galls in each locality. The nutritional and defensive chemical compounds of Q. rugosa were influenced by their associated cynipids. Our results suggest that gall-inducing cynipids influence the production of secondary metabolites in leaves with galls through the reassignment of nutritional compounds by the hosts.

AB  - The constraint caused by wild ungulates on forest regeneration is increasing worldwide. Hypotheses for plant association effects predict that species susceptible to herbivory can gain protection from other neighbouring plant species. In theory, such interactions could help limit the impact of browsing on the regeneration of specific tree species. However, the presence of neighbouring species can also result in increasing competition for resources between species. The resultant effects on forest regeneration of these interactions, both positive (protection against herbivores) and negative (inter-specific competition) are still unclear. To gain insight, we coupled models of browsing by roe deer (Capreolus capreolus) and of forest dynamics to simulate trajectories of oak (Quercus petraea (Matt.) Liebl.) regeneration admixed with species of contrasted palatability and growth rate under different scenarios of browsing pressure and initial sapling density. We also investigated how releasing oak saplings from all or specific neighbours during the simulation affect regeneration. We found that admixed species composition had a relatively weak effect on the density of oak recruits, but a strong effect on the duration of the regeneration phase. Oak regenerated faster when admixed with species of intermediate growth and low palatability (Fagus sylvatica) than with species of fast growth and high palatability (Carpinus betulus L.), except at intermediate sapling density and high browsing pressure where we found the opposite. Releasing oak from all competitors was most effective in promoting oak regeneration when admixed with both species together, although the benefit of competition release was much weaker at high browsing pressure. Lastly, we found that at low initial sapling density (i.e., 10 saplings/m2), oak regeneration was driven only by browsing and the effect of admixing species became negligible. Our study showed that admixing oak with palatable neighbours impedes rather than improves oak regeneration due to increased competition for resources. As such, we suggest that the benefits of herbivore diversion can be off-set by increased inter-specific competition.

AB  - Human activities alter marine ecosystems by modifying their biodiversity, often disrupting trophic interactions that determine their structure and functioning. Human influence on trophic interactions mediated by fishes have traditionally been investigated through the lens of indirect proxies, such as the biomass of trophic groups. However, fish biomass alone may not adequately capture the nuanced responses of fish to different levels of human pressures, such as changes in the nature and intensity of trophic interactions. Here, we combined visual counts and remote video surveys to assess how human pressures influence spatial patterns in reef fish biomass and feeding pressure in an oceanic island in the eastern Atlantic Ocean. The biomass and feeding pressure of reef fish assemblages strongly declined across the human pressure gradient, by two- and five-fold, respectively. These patterns were primarily driven by fishery targeted species, which comprised 87 % of fish biomass and 93 % of fish feeding pressure. Despite this marked imprint of human pressures, we found distinct responses among trophic groups. The biomass of omnivores and herbivores declined by 19- and 3-fold respectively, while feeding pressure by these groups declined by 6- and 4-fold, respectively. In contrast, the effect of human pressures on piscivores, invertivores and planktivores was weak or negligible. Importantly, some trophic groups exhibited stronger declines in fish feeding pressure than biomass, whilst others exhibited lower declines. This highlights the nuanced responses of fishes to human exploitation, with compensatory mechanisms, and calls for more detailed studies to identify how humans disrupt trophic interactions and their potential flow on effects on energy and material fluxes.

AB  - Introduced predators may affect native arthropod communities and alter the ecosystem services these native species provide. While mantids are known to have a broad diet in terms of consuming taxa from a number of different orders, we currently lack the high taxonomic resolution on the prey species consumed. Without knowing the identity and frequency of species in the diets of introduced mantids, it is difficult to estimate the ecological impacts of these species on local food webs and ecosystem services. To address these issues, we used DNA metabarcoding to identify prey in the diets of two introduced mantids (Tenodera sinensis and Mantis reli-giosa) in old fields. While both species fed on a broad diversity of taxa across 22 orders, T. sinensis mantids exhibited higher alpha diversity in diet items than M. religiosa mantids. Total beta diversity of mantid diets was moderate (0.39-0.485) across both species, although M. religiosa samples exhibited higher total beta diversity than T. sinensis samples. Herbivorous, predatory and pollinator prey species were the most important contrib-utors to detected patterns of beta diversity. However, degree of diet overlap varied across sites and mantid species, where mantid diets at sites dominated by the same species of mantid were more similar than compared to mantid diets at sites dominated by a different mantid species.

AB  - Iconographic symbols are crucial in constructing national identities, and public policies have a role in selecting these symbols. This study examines the relationship between national identity, conservation, and iconography in Uruguay from a postcolonial perspective. The study focuses on the representation of fauna in the official iconography, analyzing 387 elements from postage stamps, institutional telephone cards, and national currency produced between 1895 and 2021. The work revealed the connection between shaping Uruguay's national identity, the representation of fauna, and the development of conservation policies. Initially, colonial representations emphasized productive animals to reinforce Uruguay's European image. However, as Uruguay sought to establish its unique identity, native animals became more prominent. Conservation policies reflected this trend, promoting the conservation of native species and regulating exotic ones. Among the vertebrates with the greatest presence in the iconography, the most abundant were birds and mammals. Regarding invertebrates, the most abundant were butterflies. On the other hand, large, threatened, and grassland specialist species were also represented among vertebrates (Puma, Capybara, Pampas Deer, Greater Rhea). The grassland is the ecosystem that supported the growth of cattle ranching, a productive system intertwined with the origin of Uruguay as a nation-state. In this sense, the most referenced species not only aims to highlight the greater visibility of wildlife for the country but also gives it a Latin American specificity associated with a dominant type of ecosystem. Our findings have, therefore, implications for understanding the intersection of conservation policies, national identity, and iconography.

AB  - Mimosa tenuiflora is a species widely distributed in the Caatinga biome as forage for herds. Goats and sheep are efficient seed dispersers and can improve seed germination. This study aimed to evaluate the passage through the digestive system of goats and sheep at different ingestion periods, and its effect on recovery, quality and anatomical aspects of M. tenuiflora seeds. For this experiment, 24 animals (12 goats and 12 sheep) were confined, and 400 seeds were provided for each animal. After the seeds supply the seeds present in the feces of the animal were periodically collected. The study was performed in a completely randomized design, in a factorial scheme 2 x 5 + 1, with two animal species (goat and sheep), five periods of seed excretion (24, 48, 72, 96, and 120 h) plus a control treatment composed of intact seeds. Recovery, seed quality, anatomy, and seedling vigor were evaluated. M. tenuiflora seeds were physically characterized as small and tended to pass quickly through the animal's digestive system. The seed recovery occurs up to 120 h for goats and 96 h for sheep after being provided, and the highest number of seeds were recovered after 48 h. The seeds collected after 120 h from goats and after 24 and 96 h from sheep showed improved germination and overcoming of seed dormancy. The anatomy analysis demonstrates that the passage through the animal digestive system promotes scarification of the seed tegument.

AB  - Recent increases in ungulate herbivore populations have intensified browsing pressure in northern forest eco-systems. High browsing pressure affects recruitment into tree populations and saplings are among the most impacted and critical tree stages. This calls for research on factors that enhance sapling survival and promote recovery of herbivore preferred species. One understudied factor in ungulate dominated boreal forests is the ability of young trees to escape large herbivores by utilising "nurse plants". First, we examined the impact of ungulate browsing on the abundance and size of rowan (Sorbus aucuparia), a functionally important tree species in an old-growth boreal pine forest, western Norway. The responses were compared between exclosures and ungulate-access plots over ten years (2001-2011) combined with investigations along a browsing intensity gradient (Exp. A). In a second experiment we investigated whether rowan saplings escape browsing and enhance growth and survival by growing within nurse plants. Consequently, we planted rowan saplings in ungulate browsing areas, inside and outside coniferous juniper (Juniper communis) bushes, and analysed the treatment effect on browsing, growth, and survival of rowan saplings across five years (2013-2018; Exp B). Excluding large herbivores resulted in a large increase in rowan saplings which were six times more abundant in exclosures (0.44 ind./m(2)) compared to ungulate-access plots (0.07 ind./m(2)) after ten years (Exp. A). The abundance of rowan saplings also decreased with higher browsing intensity. Moreover, the rowans in exclosures grew to almost twice the height of the ungulate-access rowans. The protected rowan saplings experienced significantly less browsing damage, and only 25% of the protected plants experienced heavy browsing or died after the first winter, compared to 70% of the unprotected plants (Exp. B). After five years, 50% more unprotected than protected plants experienced heavy browsing or mortality, and growth in protected plants was nearly 50% greater over the period. The negative impact of ungulate browsing on abundance and growth of rowans can be counteracted by positive plant-plant interactions. Rowan saplings growing within nurse plants showed significantly less browsing and better performance indicating high functional importance of the forest understorey. Forest managed with multi-layered and multi-species understoreys may therefore also be beneficial for tree recruitment in browsed boreal forest landscapes.

AB  - Ungulate browsing can prevent the successful regeneration and development of forest-owner-intended and climate-resilient admixed tree species, compromising the future provision of multiple ecosystem services. A reduction of the height increment of palatable tree species caused by ungulate browsing results in a competition shift in favor of less palatable species. While this key process of losing admixed tree species is well understood, forest growth models have not yet captured its full complexity. Therefore, our objectives were to simulate (i) the loss of susceptible tree species from different browsing regimes and its impact on stand development, (ii) changes in the height increment of saplings and trees, and (iii) the shifts in social status during stand development without pre-defined limits a sapling can resist browsing. To address these objectives, we used the process-based model iLand to simulate the exposure of Norway spruce, Silver fir, and European beech stands to varying browsing densities. We successfully reproduced expected dynamic shifts in species composition and height development 24 years after establishment, depending on ungulate pressure and species-specific competitive strength. Stand composition and growth differences already occur with slight changes in ungulate density. When saplings remained in stand structure, independent of the number being browsed, our results led to more individuals with substantially smaller dimensions. We found that dynamic tree species shifting can be simulated realistically by a process-based modeling approach, which can be used to show the strong impact of ungulates on stand development.

AB  - The information on the number of mammalian species introduced and established into the Neotropical Region and the knowledge on their history of introduction and ecological-genetic aspects are rather variable. To improve our understanding on these topics, we provide an updated list of mammalian species that have established wild populations in the Neotropics and, where possible, compare genetic variability between native and introduced populations in order to evaluate whether the genetic paradox of invasions (GPI) applies to these species. Our search exposed an evident lack of genetic data for most populations introduced in the Neotropics, which restricted our analysis to 10 out of the 51 mammalian species introduced and to only three neutral molecular markers. Losses of genetic variability were a frequent feature of introduced populations, suggesting that these populations have overcome low genetic variation and successfully established in the new environment adding support to the conditions needed to be considered paradoxical in the sense of the GPI. However, it was not possible to affirm that the magnitude of the loss is related to the number of introduction events or the number of individuals introduced or translocated. Alternative approaches to obtain better estimates of genetic diversity associated with the evolutionary potential of the species at the initial stages of invasion are needed. They will provide valuable insight into ecological and evolutionary processes involved in biological invasions, and useful information for species-based risk assessment of invasion.

AB  - Urbanisation is one of the main drivers of insect species loss worldwide. However, its impacts on ecological interactions involving insects still deserve further research, especially seed predation and parasitism of seed predators. Here, we evaluated the seed predation rate by the specialist bruchid beetle Pseudopachymerina spinipes and its parasitism rate in the native tree Vachellia caven (Fabaceae) along an urbanisation gradient in Cordoba (Argentina). Since resource availability can influence these ecological interactions, we also investigated whether seed and prey availability could affect seed predation and parasitism rates, respectively. We sampled trees in 10 sampling sites along an urbanisation gradient estimated by the Normalised Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) within a 100 m radius. In our system, sites with low NDVI, beyond representing the low amount of vegetation cover, also indicate high surface temperature and low availability of host trees. Seed predation in V. caven and the parasitism rate of P. spinipes were significantly reduced with increasing urbanisation. Notably, seed availability at the pod level did not affect seed predation rate, while prey availability was negatively correlated with parasitism rate. These findings suggest a deleterious effect of urbanisation on the studied antagonistic interactions, giving no support to the idea of resource limitation effects.

AB  - Climatic factors drive changes in forage fish communities and may influence the productivity of piscivorous predators, but specific mechanisms of response remain poorly known. Between 1984 and 2020, we studied the rhinoceros auklet Cerorhinca monocerata, a seabird breeding in the western North Pacific at Teuri Island, Japan. We tested the hypothesis that climate-mediated prey-switching affects 'food packaging' (i.e. the way energy is brought to dependent offspring) and breeding success by quantifying relationships between climate, prey energy density, amount of food delivered, and the growth and survival of chicks. Prey composition switched 4 times: 1988-1992, 1997-1998, 2013-2014, and 2017-2018. All but the last of these switches were associated with (lagged) shifts in seawater temperature/Pacific Decadal Oscillation. Rhinoceros auklets brought multiple fish in each meal-load to chicks, and numbers were inversely correlated with the size of the fish. These relationships varied between fish species. The heaviest meal-loads were achieved when diets were dominated by anchovy Engraulis japonicas, which occurred during warm phases (1992-2013). Chick production, growth rates, and mass at fledgling were also highest during the warm phases. This study shows that climate affects seabird reproduction by shifting the manner in which food is selected relative to changes in forage fish community structure and abundance.

AB  - Growing evidence suggests that organisms with narrow niche requirements are particularly disadvantaged in small habitat patches, typical of fragmented landscapes. However, the mechanisms behind this relationship remain unclear. Dietary specialists may be particularly constrained by the availability of their food resources as habitat area shrinks. For herbivorous insects, host plants may be filtered out of small habitat fragments by neutral sampling processes and deterministic plant community shifts due to altered microclimates, edge effects and browsing by ungulates. We examined the relationship between forest fragment area and the abundance of dietary-specialist and dietary-generalist larval Lepidoptera (caterpillars) and their host plants in the northeastern USA. We surveyed caterpillars and their host plants over 3 years in equal-sized plots within 32 forest fragments varying in area between 3 and 1014 ha. We tested whether the abundances and species richness of dietary specialists increased more than those of dietary generalists with increasing fragment area and, if so, whether the difference could be explained by reduced host plant availability or increased browsing by white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus). The overall abundance of dietary specialists was positively related to fragment area; the relationship was substantially weaker for dietary generalists. There was notable variation among species within diet breadth groups, however. There was no effect of fragment area on the diversity of dietary-specialist or dietary-generalist caterpillars. Deer activity was not related to the abundances of either dietary-generalist or dietary-specialist caterpillars. Plant community composition was strongly associated with fragment area. Larger fragments were more likely to include host plants for both dietary-specialist and dietary-generalist caterpillars. Deer activity was correlated with decreased host plant availability for both groups, with a slightly stronger impact on host plants of dietary specialists. Although dietary specialists were more likely to lack host plants in fragments, the relationship between fragment area and host availability did not depend on caterpillar diet breadth. This study provides further evidence that decreasing patch area disproportionately impacts specialist consumers. Because this relationship was derived from equal-sized plots, it is robust to some criticisms levelled at fragmentation research. The mechanisms for specialist consumer declines, however, remain elusive.

AB  - Exclosure cages are often used for estimating biomass accumulation on continuously stocked pastures in grazing experiments. The microclimate inside the cages may affect the estimates of biomass accumulation, but this has not been previously identified or quantified. We evaluated how the exclusion from grazing for 21 days in Mulato II brachiariagrass (Brachiaria brizantha x Brachiaria decumbens x Brachiaria ruziziensis) pastures affected canopy air temperature (T) and relative humidity (RH) and how this related to biomass accumulation. We also evaluated the effect of the exclosure cage on wind speed (WS) and incoming solar radiation (SR), and how these impacted evapotranspiration (ET) and estimates of biomass accumulation on grazed canopies maintained at 20- and 30-cm height under continuous stocking. Regardless of canopy height, changes in canopy structure during the exclusion period up to 21 days did not affect T and RH (averages of 24.3 degrees C and 88.7%, respectively), indicating that the air circulation was not affected by the exclusion. The cage structure reduced SR by 5%, although there were times during clear days when SR was slightly greater inside the cage than outside. The cage also reduced WS by 4.4%. Smaller SR and WS resulted in less ET inside the cages than outside, although with close values (2.9 vs. 3.0 mm day(-1); P = 0.0494). The biomass accumulation rate was greater inside than outside the cages for both canopy heights. This overestimation would be 5.8 and 9.7% greater if the structure of the cage did not reduce the SR, WS, and ET.

AB  - Wildlife can perceive humans as predators and human disturbance, whether lethal (e.g., hunting) or non-lethal (e. g., hiking, biking, and skiing), triggers antipredator behavior among prey. Visibility is the property that relates habitat structure to accessibility of visual information that allows animals to detect predators and evaluate predation risk. Thus, the visibility of a habitat (hereafter referred to as habitat visibility) for prey species alters the perceived risk of predation and therefore has a strong influence on their antipredator behavior. Yet, knowledge of how habitat visibility affects the response of animals to different types of human disturbance is limited, partly, because it is challenging to measure habitat visibility for animals at a fine spatial scale over a landscape, particularly in highly heterogeneous landscapes (e.g., forests). In this study, we employed a newly described approach that combines terrestrial and airborne LiDAR to contiguously measure fine-scale habitat visibility in a forested landscape. We applied the LiDAR-derived habitat visibility to examine how habitat visi-bility in forests affects the summer space use of 20 GPS-collared female red deer (Cervus elaphus) modeled with integrated step-selection functions in the Bavarian Forest National Park, Germany when exposed to various types of human disturbance including recreational activities, forest roads, hiking trails, and hunting. We found that red deer in our study area avoided areas with higher all types of human disturbance, especially during daylight hours. Furthermore, habitat visibility significantly modified the use of space by red deer in response to human recreational activities, forest roads, and hiking trails, but not to the hunting area. Red deer tended to tolerate a higher intensity of human recreational activities and to use areas closer to forest roads or hiking trails when they have lower habitat visibility (i.e., more cover). Our findings highlight the importance of considering visual perception when studying the response of wild animals to human disturbance. We emphasize the potential to mitigate negative consequences of human disturbance on wildlife, through measures such as maintaining vegetative buffers around recreational infrastructure (e.g., roads and skiing tracks) in order to reduce habitat visibility around areas frequented by humans.

AB  - This field note presents an early example of a forest climate adaptation tree planting project incorporating assisted migration in southern New England which is valuable in providing lessons that can inform future work in this region and elsewhere. This effort is notable for moving forward through the implementation and monitoring stages during a period when many similar projects encountered barriers. The project is located on watershed protection forestland owned by the Providence Water Supply Board, a public utility in Rhode Island. Using a suite of tools developed through the Climate Change Response Framework, watershed forest managers carried out a "transition" strategy climate adaptation planting in 2015, seeking to improve regeneration in an area of forest near the state's main drinking water reservoir. Seedlings of both native and assisted migration tree species projected to be adapted to future climate conditions were planted in adjacent areas that had experienced oak regeneration failure. Half of the seedlings of each species were planted within a deer exclosure fence and half were planted in an unfenced area. Annual monitoring has allowed for comparison of survival and growth of a subset of planted trees at these two sites for 10 growing seasons. Deer herbivory is believed to be the most significant factor contributing to differences in tree survival rates between the fenced and unfenced areas. Both native and non-native species have been able to survive when protected from deer browse, while differences are inconclusive after nearly a decade. This informal experimental planting provides a case study illustrating some of the opportunities and challenges associated with implementing assisted migration in a non-research, operational-scale setting.

AB  - Anthropogenic linear features often alter wildlife behaviour and movement. Landscape features, such as habitat, can have important mediating effects on wildlife response to disturbance and yet are rarely explicitly considered in how habitat and disturbance interact. We tested the movement and space-use responses of GPS-collared grey wolves to linear features with respect to adjacent habitat variation. We simultaneously modelled wolf movement and selection within a conditional logistic regression framework (integrated Step Selection Analysis). We explicitly considered how adjacent habitat alters these responses through putative effects, such as movement friction. Classifying linear features based on the selection and movement response of wolves revealed that pairing transmission lines and primary roads increased the avoidance response to be greater than either feature on its own and provided evidence of a semi-permeable barrier to movement. In contrast, features with reduced human activity, including secondary and tertiary roads, were highly selected for and may function as movement corridors. Synthesis and applications. Explicitly parameterizing adjacent habitat provides evidence that where a linear feature is routed and which habitats it interacts with will have the greatest implications for wolf behavioural responses. Reduced avoidance behaviour in highly risky environments signifies the importance of habitat for maintaining landscape connectivity, particularly when routing multiple different features parallel and near each other. Increased vegetation density along linear features also reduces movement advantages putatively by increasing friction, indicating that actively decommissioning other features, such as secondary roads, could be an effective mitigation strategy for reducing wolf encounters with prey. Knowing the influence of adjacent habitats on the likelihood of wolves selecting for a given linear feature creates context to minimize the impact of new anthropogenic features on behaviour.

AB  - Semi-natural habitats (SNHs) are becoming increasingly scarce in modern agricultural landscapes. This may reduce natural ecosystem services such as pest control with its putatively positive effect on crop production. In agreement with other studies, we recently reported wheat yield reductions at field borders which were linked to the type of SNH and the distance to the border. In this experimental landscape-wide study, we asked whether these yield losses have a biotic origin while analyzing fungal seed and fungal leaf pathogens, herbivory of cereal leaf beetles, and weed cover as hypothesized mediators between SNHs and yield. We established experimental winter wheat plots of a single variety within conventionally managed wheat fields at fixed distances either to a hedgerow or to an in-field kettle hole. For each plot, we recorded the fungal infection rate on seeds, fungal infection and herbivory rates on leaves, and weed cover. Using several generalized linear mixed-effects models as well as a structural equation model, we tested the effects of SNHs at a field scale (SNH type and distance to SNH) and at a landscape scale (percentage and diversity of SNHs within a 1000-m radius). In the dry year of 2016, we detected one putative biotic culprit: Weed cover was negatively associated with yield values at a 1-m and 5-m distance from the field border with a SNH. None of the fungal and insect pests, however, significantly affected yield, neither solely nor depending on type of or distance to a SNH. However, the pest groups themselves responded differently to SNH at the field scale and at the landscape scale. Our findings highlight that crop losses at field borders may be caused by biotic culprits; however, their negative impact seems weak and is putatively reduced by conventional farming practices.

AB  - Hunting directly impacts the population dynamics of ungulates and can have a significant effect on the quality of phenotypic traits such as horns or antlers. In Poland, following a demographic collapse in the 1990s and the introduction of a hunting ban in 2001, the population of moose (Alces alces) has increased from 1,800 to over 20,000 individuals, recolonising its former range. As the moose is a charismatic species and a popular subject for nature photography, we analysed changes in antler size and shape in this cervid between 2005 and 2021 based on photos of male moose and antler casts provided by photographers or available in social media. Our findings indicate that during the hunting ban, the probability of observing the cervina antler type significantly decreased over time, from 47% in 2012 to 28% in 2021. Meanwhile, the probability of observing the intermediate and palmate antler types significantly increased from 44 to 53% and from 9 to 19%, respectively. The mean number of tines significantly increased from 3.2 in 2005 to 4.7 in 2021, and the antler size index significantly increased from 3.4 to 3.9. The most likely mechanism behind the observed changes could be the ageing of a population released from hunting pressure. We also observed regional variation in antler size, which is likely related to differences in environmental conditions. Our study serves as an example of how passive citizen science can contribute to our understanding of ecological trends and the quantification of population patterns. It also has important implications for management of species affected by trophy hunting.

AB  - Successful regeneration of commercial species is central to the long-term sustainability of forests managed for wood production. We studied two species of tree seedlings planted after group selection and single-tree selection harvesting in a 20 ha replicated silviculture experiment in stands dominated by coast redwood (Sequoia sempervirens (D.Don) Endl.). Treatments consisted of complete harvest in 1 ha group selection opening (GS), low-density dispersed retention (LD), aggregated high-density retention (HA), and dispersed high-density retention (HD). One year after planting, seedlings planted on a southwest aspect had the lowest survival rate, while northeast aspects had nearly complete survival rates. As expected, redwood had a higher survival rate than coast Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii var menziesii (Mirb.) Franco). Survival rates exhibited a rise-peak-fall pattern with stand density, most notably on southwest-facing slopes, ranking LD > HA approximate to HD > GS treatments. Deer browsing of planted seedlings was a pervasive problem where Douglas-fir were preferentially browsed over redwood. In treatments with higher retention densities, browsing was less likely, ranking GS > LD > HA > HD treatments. Further from watercourses at higher elevation, the probability of browsing diminished. Overall, dispersed treatments outperformed aggregated and GS treatments by simultaneously maximizing survival and minimizing browsing of planted seedlings. We did not perform site preparation or herbicide treatment of re-sprouting hardwoods following harvest, and therefore recommend testing the effectiveness of understory vegetation management to enhance seedling survival. Consideration could also be given to planting more seedlings in anticipation of lower survival rates, and/or implementing seedling protection measures when and where heavy browsing is expected.

AB  - The removal or addition of a predator in an ecosystem can trigger a trophic cascade, whereby the predator indirectly influences plants and/or abiotic processes via direct effects on its herbivore prey. A trophic cascade can operate through a density-mediated indirect effect (DMIE), where the predator reduces herbivore density via predation, and/or through a trait-mediated indirect effect (TMIE), where the predator induces an herbivore trait response that modifies the herbivore's effect on plants. Manipulative experiments suggest that TMIEs are an equivalent or more important driver of trophic cascades than are DMIEs. Whether this applies generally in nature is uncertain because few studies have directly compared the magnitudes of TMIEs and DMIEs on natural unmanipulated field patterns. A TMIE is often invoked to explain the textbook trophic cascade involving wolves (Canis lupus), elk (Cervus canadensis), and aspen (Populus tremuloides) in northern Yellowstone National Park. This hypothesis posits that wolves indirectly increase recruitment of young aspen into the overstory primarily through reduced elk browsing in response to spatial variation in wolf predation risk rather than through reduced elk population density. To test this hypothesis, we compared the effects of spatiotemporal variation in wolf predation risk and temporal variation in elk population density on unmanipulated patterns of browsing and recruitment of young aspen across 113 aspen stands over a 21-year period (1999-2019) in northern Yellowstone National Park. Only 2 of 10 indices of wolf predation risk had statistically meaningful effects on browsing and recruitment of young aspen, and these effects were 8-28 times weaker than the effect of elk density. To the extent that temporal variation in elk density was attributable to wolf predation, our results suggest that the wolf-elk-aspen trophic cascade was primarily density-mediated rather than trait-mediated. This aligns with the alternative hypothesis that wolves and other actively hunting predators with broad habitat domains cause DMIEs to dominate whenever prey, such as elk, also have a broad habitat domain. For at least this type of predator-prey community, our study suggests that risk-induced trait responses can be abstracted or ignored while still achieving an accurate understanding of trophic cascades.

AB  - Aim: To estimate the effects of environmental and human drivers on upper forest-cover upward shift over the period 1945-2018.Location: Romanian Carpathians.Methods: Using historical topographic maps and high-resolution Sentinel-2A satellite images, we delineated the location of the upper forest-cover limit in 1945 and 2018 to obtain a binary raster with the "forest gains " and "no-forest gains " for 1945-2018. The maps were overlapped over 12 independent variables to estimate how they affected the recent upper forest-cover upward shift, and to predict its probability of expansion in the near future. To achieve this, logistic regression models were applied and then integrated into the GIS spatial analysis.Results: Forest gains of almost 35,000 ha have been detected at the upper forest limit in the study sites, leading to an average upward movement of 30 m (0.5 m per year), mainly at the altitudinal bands between 1,400 and 1,800 m a.s.l. (72%); only 9.7% of the gain was detected above the estimated potential climatic limit. The process was significantly inversely related to elevation (-17.3 <= beta <=-5.7, p < 0.01), slope aspect (-1.5 <= beta <=-0.4, p < 0.01), sheepfold numbers (-18.1 & LE; beta & LE; -0.7, p < 0.01), and sheep (-18.3 <= beta <= -0.6, p < 0.01) and cattle (-16.4 <= beta <=-0.8, p < 0.01) populations. Strong direct effects were found for the slope angle (1.3 <= beta <= 10.6, p < 0.01) and distance to sheepfolds (0.5 <= beta <= 12.8, p < 0.01). A low contribution was indicated for the trend in mean air temperature (-1.1 <=beta <= 4.3, p < 0.01), growing season length (-2.1 <= beta <= 5.1, p < 0.01) and protective measures (-1.1 <= beta <= 2.4, p < 0.01, for national parks; -1.8 <=beta <= 1.2, p < 0.01, for natural parks).Conclusions: The analysis demonstrated that decreased land-use intensity and, in particular, declining traditional practices were the foremost mechanisms of the recent upper forest-cover upward shift, whereas the effect of climate warming remains not so obvious.

AB  - Effective plot-based field sampling involves a trade-off between implementation efficiency and sample error. Optimal field sampling therefore requires quantifying the sample error under various sampling designs. For remote sensing applications, it is also important to understand how field sample error and training sample size (the number of pixels) affect the retrieval of surface properties. In this research, drone imagery was used to simulate field plots and investigate plot sampling error for forage lichen cover in relation to plot size, number of plots, and sampling strategy. The effect of this error on remote sensing based lichen cover retrieval was evaluated using varying training sampling sizes in two different study regions in northern Canada. Results showed that cover with high spatial variability increased the number of plots or plot size required to achieve a specified level of error. For lichen cover retrieval at moderate spatial resolution (10-30 m), field sampling (plot size and number of plots) did not have as significant of an effect as regional differences (spectral separability of cover types), sensor, and the number of pixels used for model training. This plot simulation approach using drone images can be applied to other surface properties and regions to provide field sampling guidance.

AB  - The scaling relationship between digestive system and body mass shapes foraging strategies in herbivores. The Jarman-Bell principle and the forage maturation hypothesis (FMH), two of the most important predictions formulated in herbivore foraging ecology, have been used to explain this relationship.We aimed to test these predictions for the largest European herbivore-the European bison-which is highly sexually dimorphic and recognised as a refugee species in non-optimal forest habitats. We conducted our study in the Bia & lstrok;owie & zdot;a Primeval Forest, where the European bison has been recognized as a refugee species. We estimated vegetation quality and biomass along the foraging paths of male and female European bison, and the vegetation biomass at random points in different habitats and months. We found no support for the Jarmann-Bell principle at the intraspecific level in European bison, as males and females foraged on patches of similar crude protein and fibre content. However, females selected for higher biomass. The quality of vegetation on the bison foraging patches showed a significant spatio-temporal variation. It increased from May to July and then gradually decreased. It also increased with the fertility and wetness of the habitats being the highest in wet forests. Mean biomass on European bison foraging patches (131.5 g/m2), was significantly lower than on random plots (210.5 g/m2), which supported the FMH. Our study suggests that in rich forest habitats, the abundant food resources available in summer may not constrain the metabolic rate/gut capacity ratio of either sex, potentially leading to dietary segregation. In contrast to open habitats, where vegetation maturation is less temporally variable, European bison in rich forest habitats may optimise patch selection and energy intake by tracking a habitat- and species-specific changes in the plant phenology. Understanding the relationship between European bison forage selection and forage nutritional constraints in forest habitats may be critical for conservation programmes, as European bison are better adapted to more open habitats and are recognised as refugee species in suboptimal forest habitats.

AB  - Foraging is a key behaviour, and several aspects of foraging remain to be investigated in many wild species. Low energy gain or reduced protein, nutrient, and mineral intake may explain poor individual condition, low reproductive output, high mortality, and, in extreme cases, population declines. Our study explores how foraging ecology, diet composition, and nutritional status could influence individual performance in an endangered population of caribou (Rangifer tarandus caribou). We measured stable isotope ratios of carbon (delta C-13) and nitrogen (delta N-15) as well as the concentration of 21 trace elements in hairs of 44 caribou (similar to 50% of the population). Our results showed that the Atlantic-Gaspesie caribou population consumed mainly lichens, horsetails, deciduous shrubs, and deciduous trees. We found a correlation between diet (described using stable isotope ratios) and accumulation of trace elements in hair using a redundancy analysis, and we detected relationships between diet, trace elements and vital rates using logistic and Cox models. Pregnancy and calf survival probabilities were higher when the delta C-13 signature of female caribou was higher, and the adult survival probability was higher in caribou that had higher concentrations of zinc and sodium, and lower concentrations of cesium and manganese in their hair. Based on the correlation we found between nutrition and individual performance, our study suggests that nutrition may be an important factor to consider in the recovery of this endangered caribou population.

AB  - Anthrax, an acute disease of homeotherms caused by soil-borne Bacillus anthracis is implicated in dramatic declines in wildlife mainly in sub-Saharan Africa. Anthrax outbreaks are often localized in space and time. Therefore, understanding predictors of the spatial and temporal occurrence of anthrax in wildlife areas is useful in supporting early warning and improved response and targeting measures to reduce the impact of epizootic risk on populations. Spatial localization of anthrax is hypothesized to be driven by edaphic factors, while the temporal outbreaks are thought to be driven by extreme weather events including temperature, humidity, rainfall, and drought. Here, we test the role of select edaphic factors and normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) metrics driven by vegetation structure and climate variability on the spatial and temporal patterns of wildlife mortality from anthrax in key wildlife areas in Kenya over a 20-year period, from 2000 to 2019. There was a positive association between the number of anthrax outbreaks and the total number of months anthrax was reported during the study period and the nitrogen and organic carbon content of the soil in each wildlife area. The monthly occurrence (timing) of anthrax in Lake Nakuru (with the most intense outbreaks) was positively related to the previous month's spatial heterogeneity in NDVI and monthly NDVI deviation from 20-year monthly means. Generalized linear models revealed that the number of months anthrax was reported in a year (intensity) was positively related to spatial heterogeneity in NDVI, total organic carbon and cation exchange capacity of the soil. These results, examined in the light of experimental studies on anthrax persistence and amplification in the soil enlighten on mechanisms by which these factors are driving anthrax outbreaks and spatial localization.

AB  - Cattle in wetlands impact water quality through waste excretion, which deposits excess nutrients, as well as decreasing the biomass and height of vegetation through trampling and herbivory. Amphibians are sensitive to these changes due to their porous skin and reliance on vegetated microhabitats. Previous studies examining the effect of cattle on amphibians in wetlands report conflicting results, exemplifying the need to avoid overgeneralizations and instead examine specific environments. In the Neembucu Wetland Complex in Paraguay, low-intensity cattle ranching is a common practice. This study seeks to understand how the presence of cattle in these operations impacts water chemistry and amphibian species richness, as well as determining which cattle effects (eutrophication, nutrient loading, and decreased vegetation height diversity) have the greatest impact on amphibian communities. We anticipated that increased cattle presence would negatively impact wetland condition, and consequentially lower amphibian species richness. Data was collected over seven weeks at Estancia Santa Ana, a low-intensity cattle ranch in Pilar, Paraguay. Cattle presence was measured through cow footprints and feces densities, while a vegetation survey and water quality testing (nitrate, phosphate, and dissolved oxygen) served as environmental metrics. Pitfall trapping was used to gather information on amphibian species richness and community composition. A Pearson parametric correlation test and Factor Analysis of Mixed Data in R were then used to understand the relationship between variables. Very few statistically relationships were found between variables, and those that existed showed a very weak correlation. This suggests that cow presence does not have as strong of an impact on water quality or amphibian species richness as expected. Terrestrial and aquatic vegetation were found to explain much of the variation among the data, which verifies the importance of amphibians' microhabitats. While future research comparing generalist and specialist species in the area is necessary, these initial results suggest a hopeful future for collaboration on environmental efforts with low-intensity cattle ranchers.

AB  - Analysis of fossil assemblage structure can help illuminate the processes shaping the assembly of ecological communities. Using Bayesian network analysis methods, we investigated patterns of association between presences and abundances of 12 large-bodied mammal clades at Pleistocene fossil localities and their dependence on local environment types, global temperature estimates, locality ages and large-scale geographic positions. The dependencies among the clades seem to be structured by the degree of generalism in carnivores and omnivores, inter-specific competition-driven ecological differentiation among the carnivores, and local environmental preferences in herbivores. With the exception of hominids, we do not find significant dependencies among the external variables (gross geographic position, age, mean global temperature) and the clades under investigation. We do not find evidence of exclusion between any two clades, which would indicate predation effects or competition at a family or higher level. The network of dependencies among mammalian clades shows a remarkable lack of change over time, pointing to emergent invariability of taxonomic assemblies at the family or higher level despite significant environmental changes.

AB  - Introduced predators currently threaten endemic animals on Madagascar through predation, facilitation of human-led hunts, competition, and disease transmission, but the antiquity and past consequences of these introductions are poorly known. We use directly radiocarbon dated bones of introduced dogs (Canis familiaris) to test whether dogs could have aided human-led hunts of the island's extinct megafauna. We compare carbon and nitrogen isotope data from the bone collagen of dogs and endemic "fosa" (Cryptoprocta spp.) in central and southwestern Madagascar to test for competition between introduced and endemic predators. The distinct isotopic niches of dogs and fosa suggest that any past antagonistic relationship between these predators did not follow from predation or competition for shared prey. Radiocarbon dates confirm that dogs have been present on Madagascar for over a millennium and suggest that they at least briefly co-occurred with the island's extinct megafauna, which included giant lemurs, elephant birds, and pygmy hippopotamuses. Today, dogs share a mutualism with pastoralists who also occasionally hunt endemic vertebrates, and similar behavior is reflected in deposits at several Malagasy paleontological sites that contain dog and livestock bones along with butchered bones of extinct megafauna and extant lemurs. Dogs on Madagascar have had a wide range of diets during the past millennium, but relatively high stable carbon isotope values suggest few individuals relied primarily on forest bushmeat. Our newly generated data suggest that dogs were part of a suite of animal introductions beginning over a millennium ago that coincided with widespread landscape transformation and megafaunal extinction.

AB  - Coastal soft-bottom and shallow water habitats are often key nursery grounds for marine fishes, which are important not only in supporting a rich biodiversity, but also of social-economic importance in terms of ecosystem services and fishery resources provided by these habitats. Tolo Harbour and Channel (the Tolo Area) at north-eastern Hong Kong in South China has been previously recognised as a nursery ground of marine fish species, including those that are commercially important. However, marine biodiversity and fisheries resources in this area have been jeopardized by various anthropogenic threats such as coastal development and pollution. This study aimed at providing up-to-date ecological information of juvenile marine fishes in the Tolo Area, and identifying locations with a high conservation priority. A three-year study, using beach and purse seining, was carried out to assess the current status of the juvenile fish community in coastal soft-bottom and shallow water habitats throughout the Tolo Area. A total of 171 species/taxa were recorded, including the IUCN-red-listed vulnerable species of seahorse Hippocampus kuda. Juvenile individuals were found in 155 of the recorded species/taxa. Juvenile fishes were dominated by small and/or fast-growing species. Significant spatial and seasonal variations in juvenile fish assemblages were recorded in the Tolo Area. Diel differences in juvenile fish assemblages were also recorded in sites where additional night-time surveys were conducted. Species richness was generally higher in outer Tolo Harbour and inner Tolo Channel, and priority should be given to the coastal soft-bottom and shallow water habitats in these areas to protect the species diversity and fishery resources. The results of this systematic study provide an ecological baseline of juvenile fishes in the Tolo Area for future monitoring and conservation of the marine fish communities.(c) 2023 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - As a consequence of agricultural intensification and habitat fragmentation since the mid-20th century, biological diver-sity has declined considerably throughout the world, particularly in Europe. We assessed how habitat and landscape-scale heterogeneity, such as variation in fragment size (small vs. large) and landscape configuration (measured as connectivity index), affect plant and arthropod diversity. We focused on arthropods with different feeding behaviour and mobility, spi-ders (predators, moderate dispersal), true bugs (mainly herbivores and omnivores with moderate dispersal), wild bees (pollinators with good dispersal abilities), and wasps (pollinators, omnivores with good dispersal abilities). We studied 60 dry grassland fragments in the same region (Hungarian Great Plain); 30 fragments were represented by the grassland com-ponent of forest-steppe stands, and 30 were situated on burial mounds (kurgans). Forest-steppes are mosaics of dry grass-lands with small forests in a matrix of plantation forests. Kurgans are ancient burial mounds with moderately disturbed grasslands surrounded by agricultural fields. The size of fragments ranged between 0.16-6.88 ha (small: 0.16-0.48 ha, large: 0.93-6.88 ha) for forest-steppes and 0.01-0.44 ha (small: 0.01-0.10 ha and large: 0.20-0.44 ha) for kurgans. Fragments also represented an isolation gradient from almost cleared and homogenous landscapes, to landscapes with rel-atively high compositional heterogeneity. Fragment size, connectivity, and their interaction affected specialist and gener-alist species abundances of forest-steppes and kurgans. Large fragments had higher species richness of ground-dwelling spiders, and the effect of connectivity was more strongly positive for specialist arthropods and more strongly negative for generalists in large than in small fragments. However, we also found a strong positive impact of connectivity for generalist plants in small kurgans in contrast to larger ones. We conclude that besides the well-known effect of enhancing habitat quality, increasing connectivity between fragments by restoring natural and semi-natural habitat patches would help to maintain grassland biodiversity.

AB  - Background The study area is located within the Central Karakoram National Park, nestled in thetowering Karakoram mountain range. Situated at high altitude in the District of Nagar,Gilgit-Baltistan, Pakistan, this region is characterised by its rugged terrain, glaciers andsnow-covered peaks. The area encompasses diverse habitats, including alpinemeadows, subalpine forests and glaciated zones, which provide potential habitat formedium- to large-sized mammals. Despite its ecological significance, wildlife in this arearemains understudied. Therefore, the current study aimed to document the wild mammalspecies of the high-altitude Hoper and Hisper Valleys . New information Camera-trapping surveys were conducted from April to November 2024 to record wildmedium- to large-sized mammals in the study area. Thirty trail cameras were deployed across the study area, which resulted in 85 occurrence records for seven mammalspecies, including three carnivores, two lagomorphs, one rodent and one ruminant. Allspecies were native, non-endemic to the region. According to the IUCN ConservationStatus, Panthera uncia (Snow Leopard), Mustela altaica (Mountain Weasel) and Capra sibirica (Himalayan Ibex) belong to the endangered categories. Out of the sevenmammals recorded in this study, five are newly documented, while the Snow Leopardand Himalayan Ibex have been previously reported from the area. The data collectedfrom this survey provide valuable occurrence information on the mammal species presentin the study area, which can serve as a baseline for monitoring and conservation effortsin the future.

AB  - Plasticity in resource allocation can be beneficial for plants under stress. In savannas, tree-grass competition forces tree saplings growing in the grass layer to compete for water, nutrients, and light. Savanna tree saplings are also vulnerable to fire and herbivory, which may favour investment in storage belowground to support regrowth aboveground. It is unclear whether carbon (C) limitation from grass shading similarly favours allocation belowground. Further, investigating how light reduction changes allocation by juvenile trees to above- and belowground biomass, storage, and defence can help us understand juvenile tree allocation strategies during ubiquitous C limitation. Using a screenhouse experiment, we evaluated the effects of shade on carbon allocation and leaf physiology in saplings of a dominant ant-acacia, Acacia (Vachellia) drepanolobium. We hypothesized that shade would induce greater belowground allocation by saplings to root growth and storage. Indeed, we found that shaded saplings had higher root mass fractions and higher concentrations of starch in their roots than plants in full sunlight. Plants in full sunlight, meanwhile, invested more in aboveground growth, with higher stem mass fractions than shaded plants. Shade did not affect leaf mass fraction, but plants in the shade had a lower leaf mass per area, higher stomatal conductance, and a higher maximum photosynthetic rate, indicating leaf-level adjustments that increased carbon capture under light limitation. These responses are consistent with possible adaptive allocation strategies that buffer the impacts of fire and herbivory, underscoring the essential role of belowground reserves for regrowth.
   Tree-grass coexistence is a defining feature of savanna ecosystems, yet how young trees (saplings) persist within the grass layer remains unclear. Aboveground, saplings compete with grasses for light. Although shade can reduce photosynthesis and resulting carbon assimilation and associated energy available to a sapling, it is not known whether saplings adjust their energy allocation in response to grass shading. We measured above- and below-ground investment in growth and energy reserves (carbohydrates) in shaded and unshaded saplings of a common savanna tree and found that shaded saplings invested more in belowground growth and carbohydrates than saplings in full light. Higher belowground allocation by shaded saplings could enhance their long-term success if access to belowground resources and stored energy determine the potential for future aboveground growth.

AB  - Algal cover has increased and scleractinian coral cover has steadily declined over the past 40 years on Caribbean coral reefs, while octocoral abundance has increased at sites where abundances have been monitored. The effects of algal cover on recruitment may be a key component in these patterns, as upright octocoral recruits may escape competition with algae by growing above the ubiquitous algal turfs. We used laboratory and field recruitment experiments to examine impacts of algal turf on recruitment of the common, upright, and zooxanthellate Caribbean octocoral Plexaura homomalla. Laboratory recruitment rate was significantly higher in lower turf cover treatments. The survival of recruits in the field was significantly reduced by increased turf cover; for every 1% increase in turf cover, polyps died 1.3% faster. In a model parameterized by the observed field survival, polyps exposed to 100% turf cover had a 2% survival rate over 51 days, while polyps exposed to no turf cover had a 32% survival rate over the same time. We found that high densities of turf algae can significantly inhibit recruitment of octocorals. Experimentally obtained octocoral survival rates were higher than those published for Caribbean octocorals. The factors that influence recruitment are critical in understanding the dynamics of octocorals on Caribbean reefs as continuing declines in scleractinian cover may lead to more octocoral-dominated communities.

AB  - African savanna elephants are a highly mobile species that ranges widely across the diversity of ecosystems they inhabit. In xeric environments, elephant movement patterns are largely dictated by the availability of water and suitable forage resources, which can drive strong seasonal changes in their movement behavior. In this study, we analyzed a unique movement dataset from 43 collared elephants, collected over a period of 10 years, to assess the degree to which seasonal changes influences home range size of elephants in the semi-arid, Laikipia-Samburu ecosystem of northern Kenya. Auto-correlated Kernel Density Estimation (AKDE) was used to estimate elephants' seasonal home range size. For each individual elephant, we also calculated seasonal home range shifts, as the distance between wet season home range centroids and dry season home range centroids. Core areas (50% AKDE isopleths) of all individual elephants ranged from 3 to 1743 km(2) whereas total home range sizes (the 95% AKDE isopleths) ranged between 15 and 10,677 km(2). Core areas and home range sizes were 67% and 61% larger, respectively, during the wet season than during the dry season. On average, the core area centroids for all elephants were 17 km away from the nearest river (range 0.2-150.3 km). Females had their core areas closer to the river than males (13.5 vs. 27.5 km). Females differed from males in their response to seasonal variation. Specifically, females tended to occupy areas farther from the river during the wet season, while males occupied areas further from the river during the dry season. Our study highlights how elephants adjust their space use seasonally, which can be incorporated into conservation area planning in the face of increased uncertainty in rainfall patterns due to climate change.

AB  - Due to the high crude fiber content, straw of various crops is difficult to become a high quality forage resource. The degradation of cel-lulose in nature mainly depends on the cellulase secreted by microbes, which degrade cellulose into small molecular substances through chemical action, and the microbes that secrete cellulase mainly include some bacteria, fungi and actinomycetes, etc. The large and diverse microbial population contained in the mammalian gastrointestinal tract plays an important role in nutrient digestion. At present, many cellulose-degrad ing strains have been screened and obtained from animal digestive system and feces, such as Bacillus subtilis from the feces of Panda, Bacillus amyloliquefaciens from the cecum of goose. In this study, the fungal diversity was analysed in the fresh faeces of Tibetan sheep, Tibetan gazelle and Tibetan antelope in Qiangtang, Tibet. Results showed that the structure and species of gut fungi are different in three animals, which may be related to the different physiological functions among different animals, e.g., Tibetan antelope and Tibetan gazelle have stronger tolerance to rough feeding than Tibetan sheep. This study will lay a foundation for cellulose-degrad ing fungal development and provides technical support for improving rough feeding tolerance of Tibetan sheep.

AB  - The offshore Greenland halibut (Reinhardtius hippoglossoides) fishery, west Greenland, employs demersal trawl gear at depths of 800-1400 m. In contrast to many deep-sea fisheries, the target stock appears stable and the fishery is of significant economic importance. Recent Marine Stewardship Council certification of this fishery highlighted the paucity of knowledge of benthic habitats and trawling impacts, which this study aimed to address using a towed benthic video sled. The spatially discrete northern and southern areas of the fishery were found to be distinct in terms of the communities present, which non-metric multidimensional scaling suggests is primarily driven by temperature. Extensive physical evidence of trawling was observed. Trawling effort was significantly linked with community composition, with a negative association between trawling effort and abundance of some taxa, including some vulnerable marine ecosystem (VME) indicator species. Three potential VMEs are identified: (i) Flabellum alabastrum cup coral meadows; (ii) a Halipteris finmarchica sea pen field; and (iii) areas exhibiting mixed assemblages of VME indicators. Of immediate conservation concern is a H. finmarchica field, which seems to be at least regionally rare, is situated within the fringes of existing trawling effort and is currently afforded no protection by management measures.

AB  - Predators impose top-down forces on prey populations, with the strength of those effects often varying over space and time and among demographic groups. In ungulates, predation risk is typically greatest for neonatal offspring, with some suggesting that predators can key in on adult activity to locate hidden neonates. However, few field studies to date have been able to directly assess the influence of maternal care on ungulate neonate survival. Using a population of white-tailed deer under heavy coyote predation pressure, we tested the maternal dispersion hypothesis, which suggests the dispersion of maternal activity temporally and spatially attenuates risk of predation for ungulate neonates during this vulnerable altricial phase. We compared support for this hypothesis with more commonly tested hypotheses regarding the influence of habitat conditions and intrinsic factors on neonatal survival. Fawn survival to 16 weeks was 27.7%, with coyotes accounting for 59% of fawn mortalities. In support of our maternal temporal diffusion hypothesis, we found that neonatal survival decreased as more maternal visits (proportionally) occurred at night. The only other significant (p < .1) predictor of fawn survival was birth timing, with fawn survival decreasing as the season progressed. Given that fawn survival declined as the proportion of nighttime visits increased, and that wild pig presence and human disturbance can push doe and fawn activity toward nocturnal hours, additional research is needed to determine whether managing pig and human disturbance can decrease fawn mortality. More broadly, given the importance of recruitment in ungulate population dynamics, our finding opens a potentially important new line of inquiry on how maternal behaviors influence predation risk in large animal predator-prey ecology.

AB  - Dongting Lake, an important wintering habitat for migratory waterbirds in the East Asian-Australasian Flyway, has suffered serious degradation in recent decades. To restore habitats for biodiversity conservation and flood control, 459 dykes were demolished and 14 were preserved in 2017. However, the direct impact of dyke demolition on wintering waterbirds was not comprehensively assessed. In this study, based on annual waterbird census and habitat data (2013/14-2020/21), we compared the differences in habitat areas and species composition of waterbirds in the dyke-demolished and preserved areas, and explored whether habitat changes caused by the dyke demolition were responsible for the changes in the number of species and percentages of waterbird individuals. The results indicate that the areas of water (including shallow water) and mudflat habitats significantly decreased, but the vegetation area significantly increased in the dyke-demolished areas. The species numbers and percentages of waterbird individuals at the community and foraging guilds levels, and the percentages of nine species, were higher in the dyke-preserved areas than those in the dyke-demolished areas. Changes in the numbers of species and percentages of individuals of fish eaters, insectivores, and omnivores positively correlated with drastic changes in the percentages of water habitats (including shallow water) after dyke demolition. Effective measures should be carried out to restore hydrological regimes, providing waterbirds sufficient suitable habitats with different water depths. These findings improve our understanding of the influence of dyke demolition on waterbirds and provide insights for wetland management and waterbird conservation.

AB  - IntroductionThe increasing number of dams approaching obsolescence drives a need for knowledge about riparian restoration associated with dam removal. Restoring woody vegetation on exposed reservoir beds following dam removal is essential to stabilizing sediment, reconnecting riverine and terrestrial systems, and providing future sources of shade, nutrients, and wood. Revegetation after dam removal on many rivers can be challenging due to rapidly drying sediment, low sediment nutrient content, and heavy ungulate browse pressure. Revegetation in Elwha River restoration, the largest dam removal to date, used large woody debris (LWD) to mitigate moisture and nutrient limitation but ungulate browsing has constrained woody plant growth in many coarse sediment deposits. We evaluated potential for LWD to reduce ungulate browsing following Elwha dam removal.MethodsWe studied LWD mitigation of browsing in the largest former reservoir and a comparable valley upriver with a natural floodplain. We measured browse intensity in randomly located plots stratified by four levels of LWD extent, from no LWD to complete LWD enclosure.ResultsLWD reduced browse intensity four-fold in the former reservoir, but only in plots fully surrounded by LWD. Partial LWD enclosure provided little browse reduction. We obtained similar results in the upriver valley, where browse intensity was somewhat lower except within wood clusters. Wood-mediated browse reduction was slightly greater in the former reservoir than in the upriver valley. Protection from browse was greatest for plant species preferred by ungulates.DiscussionThese results suggest forest restoration after dam removal can be expedited by surrounding young trees with large logs. Planting within LWD clusters or placing LWD clusters in restoration sites can facilitate establishment of forest islands in strategic locations. These forest islands can support dispersal of seeds and marine derived nutrients, reconnect established forest to the river, and potentially advance restoration by decades.

AB  - Context Agent-based models (ABMs) and state-and-transition simulation models (STSMs) have proven useful for understanding processes underlying social-ecological systems and evaluating practical questions about how systems might respond to different scenarios. ABMs can simulate a variety of agents (autonomous units, such as wildlife or people); agent characteristics, decision-making, adaptive behavior, and mobility; and agent-environment interactions. STSMs are flexible and intuitive stochastic landscape models that can track scenarios and integrate diverse data. Both can be run spatially and track metrics of management success. Objectives Due to the complementarity of these approaches, we sought to couple them through a dynamic linkage and demonstrate the relevance of this advancement for modeling landscape processes and patterns. Methods We developed analytical techniques and software tools to couple these modeling approaches using NetLogo, R, and the ST-Sim package for SyncroSim. We demonstrated the capabilities and value of this coupled approach through a proof-of-concept case study of bison-vegetation interactions in Badlands National Park. Results The coupled ABM-STSM: (1) streamlined handling of model inputs and outputs; (2) allowed representation of processes at multiple temporal scales; (3) minimized assumptions; and (4) generated spatial and temporal patterns that better reflected agent-environment interactions. Conclusions These developments constitute a new approach for representing agent-environment feedbacks; modelers can now use output from an ABM to dictate landscape changes within an STSM that in turn influence agents. This facilitates experimentation across domains (agent and environment) and creation of more realistic and management-relevant projections, and opens new opportunities for communicating models and linking to other methods.

AB  - Non-invasive genetic sampling (NGS) methods are becoming a mainstay in wildlife monitoring and can be used with spatial capture-recapture (SCR) methods to estimate population density. Yet SCR based on NGS remains relatively underused for ungulate population monitoring, despite the importance of robust density estimates for this ecologically and economically important group of species. This may be in part attributed to biological characteristics of ungulate species and data collection methods that lead to violations of SCR model assumptions. We conducted a simulation study to evaluate the robustness of SCR methods to spatially heterogeneous density (i.e., configuration of individuals into groups of variable sizes and composition), individual heterogeneity in space-use patterns, and adaptive sampling (i.e., variation in detectability across space that correlates with density). We evaluated each violation separately and in combination. We parameterized our simulations based on published information and preliminary analyses of NGS data sets of 3 ungulate species: chamois (Rupicapra rupicapra), red deer (Cervus elaphus), and wild boar (Sus scrofa). While SCR estimates were robust to grouping and adaptive sampling, abundance estimates could be negatively biased (up to 10% in our simulations) in the presence of unaccounted individual heterogeneity in space use. The degree to which abundance estimates were underestimated depended mostly on the amount of variation in space use and detectability among age classes. This bias was also accompanied by a reduction in precision and coverage probability of the SCR estimators. We discuss the implications of these findings, possible approaches to identify problematic violations in available data sets (goodness-of-fit tests), and potential further developments of SCR models to ensure reliable abundance estimates for ungulate populations from NGS data.

AB  - Avian scavengers, particularly vultures, play a crucial role in ecosystem health by efficiently consuming carcasses, thereby reducing pathogen abundance and limiting disease transmission to wildlife, livestock, and humans. In addition to the indispensable role of vultures, they are a particularly threatened group of birds. This study investigates the environmental factors that optimize this ecosystem service by examining the scavenging dynamics of vultures and other species at deer carcasses in a hunting area in Sierra Madrona, Ciudad Real, Spain. Carcasses were placed in habitats with different vegetation densities (open vs. dense) and altitudes (high vs. low) and were monitored for 30 days using camera traps. Data on scavenger diversity, arrival times, and carcass persistence were analyzed using Bayesian multilevel models. Results reveal that vegetation density and altitude significantly influence vulture arrival times and carcass duration, with dense vegetation and low altitudes delaying scavenger access. These findings provide actionable insights for game management to enhance vulture conservation and improve both public and ecosystem health through timely and effective carcass removal.

AB  - This study demonstrated the plasticity of reef-decapod according with the exposed anthropogenic pressure. Comparing the reef-decapods at sites with different anthropogenic pressures in two different ecoregions (tropical and subtropical reef ecotypes), we demonstrated that historical anthropogenic activity is molding directly and indirectly their population. A direct impact over target decapods for fishing (e.g. Lobsters and large crabs) that are removed directly by human activities. A positive indirect impact related to a top-down trophic imbalance with the increase of naturally dominant preys (small decapod) due to the removal of top predators. Thus, insufficient predators to control the abundant prey in a classic unbalanced prey-predator relationship. An indirect and negative impact, related to a bottom-up trophic imbalance, is the exclusion of niche-restricted species in association with benthic cover (e.g. corals). This also has the positive outcome, however, of increasing numbers of herbivores, detritivores and scavengers. As hypothesis, we propose that a current biodiversity balance in anthropogenically impacted ecosystem is just reflecting past trophic cascade events. Where the remaining biodiversity is monopolizing the vacant niches after the removal of components in a trophic chain. Therefore, we are suggesting that reef-decapod biodiversity, observed using visual identification, can be used to highlight the "Ghost of the past anthropogenic impact" in threatened ecosystems.

AB  - Deer can show transitional use between agricultural fields and forests for foraging and shelter. Such transitional use may affect forest damage as nutrient balancing theory suggests that if deer ingest large amounts of nutrient-rich food, complementary browse, such as bark, may be required to balance the diet. We investigated the relationship between the level of red deer Cervus elaphus bark-stripping damage in 68 Norway spruce Picea abies stands and the presence of rapeseed Brassica napus fields - an energy-rich crop preferred by red deer - in the surroundings, hypothesizing that damage increases with decreasing distance to rapeseed fields. We also considered other potentially influencing factors, such as supplemental feeding, alternative forage availability, and deer use of spruce stands as indexed by a pellet group count. Spruce stands closer to rapeseed had a significantly higher proportion of damaged stems. The increased level of bark-stripping damage was not explained by a higher stand use of deer closer to rapeseed fields, indicating that deer increase their consumption of bark in order to balance their diet. Similarly, spruce stands closer to supplemental feeding stations had significantly higher damage levels. In line with earlier findings, damage levels were negatively related to the amount of available browse in the forest. This emphasizes the importance of alternative forage for reducing the damage risk in forest plantations.5. Our study shows that the availability of fields with nutrient-rich food, such as rapeseed, as well as supplemental feeding needs to be considered when predicting the level of forest damage. With a high availability of nutrient-rich food in the vicinity of forest stands, a higher damage level can be expected and counteractions could be taken such as increased disturbance, harvest or changed choice of both crop and supplemental feed types. These actions may also be combined with a push-pull strategy where the deer are steered to disturbance-free zones insensitive to damage and with alternative forage. The importance of alternative forage availability on damage levels highlights the necessity for managers to actively promote tree and shrub forage within and around their production stands.

AB  - Human agricultural practices globally impact the composition of soil microbial communities across ecosystems. However, knowledge is limited regarding the structure, composition, stability, assembly processes, and influencing factors of these communities along altitudinal gradients under agricultural disturbance in fragile areas. This study examines bacterial communities in agricultural soils of Camellia oleifera tree plantations along altitudinal gradients in vulnerable regions of Southwest China to examine these aspects. Our findings reveal significant differences in microbial community composition in different altitude zones. Acidobacteriota had the highest proportion in all zones. The highest microbial diversity occurred below 580 m. The complexity and stability of microbial networks peaked between 580 m and 850 m, and the highest network modularity (0.78) occurred above 980 m. Stochastic processes predominantly affected microbial community assembly across altitudinal gradients. Environmental factors and the age of the Camellia oleifera tree stand were dominant factors influencing soil bacterial communities. These findings significantly advance our understanding of microbial community changes in agricultural soils of fragile areas along altitudinal gradients and may provide a scientific basis for managing and improving agricultural soil quality.

AB  - Global change has manifested itself as climate warming in Central Europe in recent decades. Average daily air temperatures increased by an average of 2 degrees C between 1982 and 2018. Air temperature changes have affected the timing of the vegetation periods (phenophases) and have also influenced the behaviour of animals. We worked with data on wildlife-vehicle crashes (WVC) recorded by the Czech Police in the period 1982-2019. Three peaks can usually be observed (spring, summer, and autumn) in the WVC time series. Eighty percent of these records involved roe deer (Capreolus capreolus). Such a high ratio allowed us to assume that any significant changes detected in WVC will be predominantly related to roe deer. We discovered that roe deer mortality on roads occurs earlier at present in the spring than in the past. The spring peak has shifted almost a month to the beginning of the year compared to the situation 38 years ago. The changes in the respective summer and autumn peaks were not statistically significant. The results suggest the effect of climate change on roe deer behaviour through increasing air temperatures and shifting vegetation phenophases. Thus, an earlier onset of deer activity associated with territory delineation and expected higher movement activity can be indirectly determined by the analysis of the WVC time series. The observed shift in the spring WVC peak in the roe deer model reveals a shift in ungulate behavioural patterns that is not evident from other biological data and thus surprisingly offers a suitable study framework for determining the impacts of environmental change on animals.

AB  - With projected climate change, urban spruce-dominated forests are facing increasing risks of forest damages, encouraging management for mixed stand structures. In the major cities of southern Finland, forests are preferentially maintained continuously covered, and tree regeneration is mostly reliant on naturally emerging sapling stock. To understand the role of forest management in shaping natural tree regeneration in urban forests, we studied the occurrence and abundance of tree saplings in spruce-dominated tree stands on a management continuum ranging from partially logged to undisturbed near-natural stands. Study sites (N = 74) were located in three urban centers in southern Finland: Tampere, Lahti and Helsinki region. We analyzed the data by comparing tree regeneration potential between management classes reflecting the timing and intensity of past logging, and by relating the occurrence of saplings with current structures of the living tree stand. Compared to undisturbed stands, partially logged sites had increased regeneration of broad-leaved trees and repressed regeneration of spruce, while the most abundant sapling tree species across all management classes was rowan. We conclude that partial logging can be a successful way of directing tree regeneration towards lower dominance of spruce. However, when the canopy is only partially opened, created gaps may end up being filled primarily by rowans that are comparatively shade-tolerant. Because the ingrowth of rowan and many other broad-leaved tree species is strongly restricted by dense populations of large browsing animals in non-urban areas, urban forests may develop stand structures and tree species composition that are otherwise rare in the Fennoscandian boreal forests.

AB  - Animal movement can mediate the ecological consequences of fragmentation; however, barriers such as fences, roads, and railways are becoming a pervasive threat to wildlife. Pronghorn (Antilocapra americana) habitat in western North America has been fragmented by roads, railways, and fences. Although pronghorn are sensitive to barriers, neither the relative permeability of different barriers to crossing nor their influence on space use have been quantified. We used a large global positioning system (GPS)-collar dataset of pronghorn (n = 1,010 animal-years) in Wyoming, USA, to first quantify the likelihood that pronghorn cross each of 5 different anthropogenic barriers, including fences, county roads, railroads, state highways, and interstate highways (i.e., interstates). Next, we assessed how each barrier influenced pronghorn space use during the winter as indexed by the area occupied, and daily displacement relative to the density of barriers on an individual's winter range. The semi-permeability of the 5 barriers varied substantially, with the interstate being the most severe barrier to pronghorn movement. Pronghorn were >300 times less likely to cross interstates compared to state highways. Although pronghorn space use was rarely influenced by barriers within individual core winter ranges, pronghorn space use was constrained by barriers on the buffered periphery of individual winter ranges. Despite their different permeability to movement, the density of fences and combined interstates and railroads had similarly negative effects on pronghorn space use. Our results illustrate that the degree to which pronghorn avoid crossing barriers may scale up to affect access to habitat. Additionally, our results indicate that the effects of barriers on habitat access are not proportional to their permeability. Our results add to a growing consensus that effective management of mobile species depends on understanding how different kinds of semi-permeable barriers influence access and use of habitats.

AB  - BackgroundPlants growing on extreme soils have mainly been described in relation to their adaptations to edaphic conditions, although herbivores may also be an important factor in these ecosystems. Gypsum soils occur in drylands often where livestock practices occur. However, it is unknown whether plant traits related to gypsum soil constraints are associated with resistance to herbivory.AimsIn order to assess whether gypsum specialist species might be favoured at higher grazing levels and to detect the traits involved, we evaluated the responses of gypsum specialists vs. generalists to three intensities of livestock pressure.MethodsWe analysed the relative cover shifts of species along a livestock gradient, and variation in canopy height, canopy area, leaf carbon (C), nitrogen (N), and sulphur (S), specific leaf area (SLA) and leaf dry matter content (LDMC).ResultsWe found that gypsum-specialists responded by increasing or maintaining their cover at medium and high grazing pressure, whereas most generalists responded by decreasing it. Gypsum-specialists showed higher leaf S than generalists, regardless of grazing intensity. All species showed similar patterns for traits linked to loss of above-ground biomass when grazing increased.ConclusionsPlant affinity to gypsum soils mediates vulnerability to grazing with foliar S possibly being a defence trait.

AB  - The temporal windows during which animals complete essential life processes (i.e. temporal niche) allow animals to match their actions to a given environmental context. When completing seasonal migrations, some migrants switch their activity patterns (e.g. from diurnal to nocturnal in multiple species of migratory birds) to take advantage of better conditions. We tested the temporal niche -switch hypothesis by comparing activity patterns before and during migration for four populations of migratory mule deer, Odocoileus hemionus, in western Wyoming, U.S.A. (2007-2019). We predicted that the physically taxing and risky event of terrestrial migration would prompt shifts in diel activity patterns. In contrast to the niche-switch hypothesis, mule deer did not drastically change their activity patterns during migration. Both before and during migration, mule deer were crepuscular (i.e. most active during twilight hours). When migrating in the spring, however, mule deer tended to concentrate activity near dawn, although they did not concentrate activity near dawn in the autumn, when less snow was present. By moving in the morning during spring migration, mule deer moved when snow was hardest, potentially allowing them to avoid the energetic costs of sinking into deep snow. Mule deer overall maintained a consistent pattern of crepuscular activity, but fine-tuned their activity patterns during migration, which may allow them to better match their behaviours with environ-mental conditions while completing an important life event.

AB  - Drylands are characterized by high spatial variability in resource availability due to sporadic rainfall, topography of the landscape and important effects of animals. Resource availability gradients may trigger patterns in decomposer population abundances and activity, which could affect ecosystem functions such as decomposition. Here, we examined the influence of resource availability gradients on the importance of termites in the decomposition of wood and grass litter. We placed wood blocks and grass litter baits in bags accessible and inaccessible to termites across wood and grass resource gradients as determined by the presence or absence of a top mammalian predator and across topographic gradients during a 9-month period in arid Australia. We hypothesized that grass-eating termite activity would track grass abundance and wood-eating termite activity would track wood abundance. Termites were the predominant decomposition agent at these sites. Termites contributed to 99.5% of wood decomposition and 83.9% of grass decomposition during our study period. For wood, the termite effect was spatially variable and increased with habitat wood availability, which was greatest on dunes and where top predators were absent. However, the contribution of termites to grass litter decomposition did not track grass availability or termite abundance. The highest effects of termites on grass decomposition rates were found in habitats where the absence of top predators led to low grass availability. Our findings highlight how spatial variability in resources in addition to other factors that we do not document but are known to be influenced by the presence of top predators, such as insectivore predation rates, across the landscape could affect ecosystem functions such as decomposition.
   The role of termites is often underappreciated in the world's driest ecosystems. Here, we show that termites have important roles for the decomposition of plant detritus in an Australian desert. However, their contribution to decomposition is dependent on resource availability for wood but not for grass. Our results shed light on factors regulating decomposition in dry ecosystems.image

AB  - Little is known about the effects of environmental variation on allometric relationships of condition-dependent traits, especially in wild populations. We estimated sex-specific static allometry between horn length and body mass in four populations of mountain ungulates that experienced periods of contrasting density over the course of the study. These species displayed contrasting sexual dimorphism in horn size; high dimorphism in Capra ibex and Ovis canadensis and low dimorphism in Rupicapra rupicapra and Oreamnos americanus. The effects of density on static allometric slopes were weak and inconsistent while allometric intercepts were generally lower at high density, especially in males from species with high sexual dimorphism in horn length. These results confirm that static allometric slopes are more canalized than allometric intercepts against environmental variation induced by changes in population density.

AB  - Deer hunting has a long history in the US. It is supported by hunting cultures, described as necessary for protecting forest/plant biodiversity and ecosystems, but opposed by animal welfare and rights advocates as cruel. Using multiple literature sources, we examine the trade-off between protecting deer and ecosystems from harm in the context of contemporary America. We examine various approaches for exploring harms affecting nonhuman animal populations found in the green criminological, environmental sociology, wildlife conservation and management, and ecological literature. We argue that making sense of these opposing positions requires examining the extent of deer hunting to quantify those harms in some way. Here, we examine reported deer kills for US states for the period 1999-2020. These data indicate that nearly 7 million deer are taken annually in the US. We also examined some hypothesized correlates of deer harvesting across states. While these data tell us something about the number of deer killed, these data alone are insufficient. We argue no clear conclusion about the acceptability of deer hunting can be reached given the difficulty rectifying opposing moral/philosophical positions on deer hunting, opposing deer management objectives, and scientific evidence on the ecological impacts of deer populations in the US under contemporary conditions that include shrinking forest ecosystems and impaired ecosystem stability.

AB  - Invasive plants can cause loss of biodiversity and degradation of ecosystems with varying degrees of impact on soil communities. Little is known about how the organic matter of these invaders in the soil affects soil properties and nematode communities. We performed a pot experiment with non-invaded grassland soil and organic matter from two invasive plants, Fallopia japonica and Solidago gigantea, to assess and compare the composition and function of the nematode communities and soil properties. We tested five treatments: (1) non-invaded grassland soil (S), (2) 100% decayed organic matter from F. japonica (OMF), (3) 100% decayed organic matter from S. gigantea (OMS), (4) 50% soil plus 50% organic matter from F. japonica (S/OMF), and (5) 50% soil plus 50% organic matter from S. gigantea (S/OMS). Analysis of nematode composition was conducted over five months from May to September. The number of identified genera and diversity index was highest in the S treatment. The soil moisture content was highest, pH and the diversity index were lowest and herbivorous nematodes were absent in OMF and OMS treatments. The addition of OMF and OMS to soil decreased the soil pH and moisture content and increased the contents of organic carbon and total nitrogen. In S/OMF, the abundance of herbivores was lower than in S and the abundances of bacterivores and fungivores decreased during the study period. In the S/OMS, a significantly high diversity index was observed, similar to that in the S treatment. The selected ecological and functional indices differed between S/OMF, S/OMS and S, but not significantly. Our findings indicated that the organic matter from the two invasive plants could differentially contribute to interactions with nematode communities. A decrease in productivity and the slowing of nutrient cycling demonstrated by the decrease in the abundances of bacterivores and fungivorous nematodes may be common adding organic matter of invasive plants to soil. A decrease in the abundance of herbivores after the application of organic matter of F. japonica could potentially be used as an ecologically friendly management strategy against plant parasitic nematodes.

AB  - Prey species may display anti-predatory behavior, i.e., flight, increased vigilance, and decreased feeding, in response to the true presence of a predator or to the implied presence of a predator through, e.g., acoustic cues. In this study, we investigated the anti-predatory reactions of moose (Alces alces) to acoustic stimuli related to hunting, at saltlick stones, a known attractant. In before-during-after-control-impact experiments, we compared the behavioral responses of individuals to: (i) two hunting-related acoustic stimuli-hunting dog barking and human speaking; (ii) nonpredatory acoustic stimuli-bird sounds and; and (iii) no acoustic stimulus (control). We asked: (1) How does the probability of moose leaving the site differ depending on the stimulus they are exposed to?; (2) What affect do the acoustic stimuli have on the amount of time moose spend vigilant, feeding, or away from the site?; and (3) What affect do the stimuli have on the time between events at a site? We found that when exposed to the human stimulus, moose left the sites in 75% of the events, which was significantly more often compared to the dog (39%), bird (24%), or silent (11%) events. If moose did not leave the site, they spent more time vigilant, and less time feeding, particularly when exposed to a dog or human stimulus. Furthermore, moose spent the most time away from the site and took the longest to visit the site again after a human stimulus. Moose were also more likely to leave the site when exposed to the bird stimulus than during silent controls. Those that remained spent more time vigilant, but their behaviors returned to baseline after the bird stimulus ended. These findings suggest that acoustic stimuli can be used to modify the behavior of moose; however, reactions towards presumably threatening and nonthreatening stimuli were not as distinct as we had expected.

AB  - We report and describe unusual types of behaviour of fighting and whistling in a species considered shy and calm. Baird's tapir is the largest of all Neotropical mammals and lives in dense well-conserved tropical forests in America. For ten years, in the Calakmul Biosphere Reserve of Southern Mexico, we have monitored a tapir population in ponds locally named aguadas that serve as social arenas for the species. Recently, we obtained 97 video records in which some tapirs get involved in serious fights and perform other types of behaviour related probably to courtship, including several types of whistles. We describe what we recorded and interpret these types of behaviour whenever possible. These rare types of tapir behaviour can explain several of the wounds and scars on many adults of the population and help us better understand the social dynamics of this shy and endangered species of Neotropical ungulate. We hope that all this information can help tapir conservation.

AB  - Trophic rewilding provides a nature-based solution for biological conservation; however, empirical studies demonstrating rewilding effects are limited. Megaherbivores moderate the type and quality of habitat available to other fauna. However, these effects may take time to develop. Further, fauna responses to megaherbivore rewilding will depend on a suite of life-history traits and strategies that allow persistence within megaherbivore modified landscapes. We conducted a space-for-time field survey in South African savanna to determine if habitat modifications mediated by a reintroduced megaherbivore, the African savanna elephant (Loxodonta africana), impacts the abundance of the diurnal arboreal cape dwarf gecko (Lygodactylus capensis) and two generalist diurnal skinks [the variable skink (Trachylepis varia) and striped skink (Trachylepis striata), collectively] across a 47-year period. The relative abundance of lizards and six habitat attributes utilized by lizards were assessed at 30 sites stratified across three biophysically and climatically similar nature reserves with different elephant reintroduction times (no elephants, 2003, 1972). The arboreal gecko was less common at the reserve with an older reintroduction time than the other reserves and was most commonly observed on, and positively correlated with, the density of the corkwood tree (Commiphora mollis). The generalist skinks were common across all reserves and were observed in a variety of habitats. Our results suggest that elephant rewilding differently impacts lizard species with different life-history strategies and that these effects take prolonged periods to develop. Given such knowledge, a long-term understanding of post-rewilding interactions will be a key point when designing and assessing the success of rewilding initiatives.

AB  - European grasslands and their biodiversity are declining rapidly due to land use changes, which highlight the need to develop effective restoration strategies. This study investigates the impact of reintroducing the Swedish national horse breed (the Gotland Russ) on grassland plant diversity and evenness in abandoned agricultural landscapes in Southeast Sweden. Twelve horses were introduced into three 10-13-hectare enclosure replicates (four horses per enclosure) in a three-year (2014-2016) rewilding experiment. Plant species richness, evenness, and diversity were investigated in both grazed and un-grazed conditions. The results indicate that horse grazing significantly increased grassland plant species diversity and richness, with higher Shannon and Simpson's diversity indices in grazed areas. In addition, the abundance of white clover (Trifolium repens), a signal species beneficial to pollinators, increased significantly in grazed areas. These findings emphasize the need for integrating large herbivore grazing into ecological restoration practices. Considering the recently enacted EU Nature Restoration Law, which aims to restore 20% of Europe's degraded ecosystems by 2030, this research provides critical insights into scalable restoration methods. The implementation of restoration strategies that include large herbivores may enhance the resilience and biodiversity of European grasslands, thereby aligning with the EU's restoration goals.

AB  - There is a need to reduce human-wildlife conflicts in the area around Liupanshan Nature Reserve in Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region, China. This study investigated the financial losses caused by wild boar and their causes. A questionnaire investigation (n = 135) and a field test were conducted, which included 108 sample lines and 97 infrared cameras. A principal component analysis and generalised linear model was used to analyse the importance of the effect of the factors on wild boar damage. Based on an estimate of 17,049 wild boars in the study area, we found that in the agricultural land owned by the residents, the boar density of each county and distance from the village to the nature reserve were the most significant factors that affected crop damage. Then, financial losses in spring, summer, and autumn had a moderate effect on financial loss, and the crop type had the lowest effect. We recommend reducing the wild boar population by increasing leisure hunting and the number of leopards. Additionally, a focus on farmland protection is a practical way to prevent wild boar invasions. Meanwhile, it is also necessary to conduct long-term monitoring of wild boar population status and manage the relationship between the government, research teams, and local people to more efficiently and comprehensively reduce conflicts between humans and wild boars.

AB  - Tibetan sheep (Ovis aries) are the most numerous livestock in Tibet Plateau pasture ecosystem and have strong ecological adaptability. In the natural grazing system, soil as a natural nutrient carrier and involuntarily or intentionally ingested by Tibetan sheep contribute as an important feed approach. However, quantifying the dosages of soil ingestion for the Tibetan sheep still needs to be clarified. This study aims to characterize nutrient digestibility and rumen bacterial communities by Tibetan sheep in response to different levels of soil ingestion. Thirty sheep were selected and divided into five treatments with soil ingestion (0%, 5%, 10%, 15%, and 20%). The conclusion demonstrated that soil ingestion improved the dry matter digestibility (59.3-62.97%), ether extract (59.79-67.87%) and crude protein (59.81-66.47%) digestibility, particularly 10% soil ingestion has highest nutrient digestibility. The rumen fermentation environment adjusted after soil ingestion by improvement of pH, ammonia nitrogen and volatile fatty acids. Appropriate soil ingestion reduced the bacterial diversity ranged from 946 to 1000 OUTs as compared control (1012), and the rumen bacterial community dominant by typical fiber digestion associated Firmicutes (47.48-53.56%), Bacteroidetes (34.93-40.02%) and Fibrobacteres (4.36-9.27%). Especially, the highest digestible feed capacity and stronger environment adaptability present in 10% soil ingestion Tibetan sheep. Overall, soil ingestion stimulates rumen metabolism by creating a favorable environment for microbial fermentation, improved bacterial community abundance associated with cellulose and saccharide degradation, contribute nutrient digestibility and growth performance of Tibetan sheep.

AB  - Recent climatic shifts have led to a noticeable increase in temperatures across the high-altitude ecosystems of the Himalayas, particularly in winter. This warming is altering growing conditions for many species, including aphids, found at higher altitudes where they were previously rare. As air temperatures increase, aphids develop more rapidly, extending their active periods and winter survival, and changing their geographical distribution and abundance. In this study, we analyzed the anatomical structure of Rhododendron campanulatum D.Don tree rings to detect aphid infestations in the higher elevational range of the Himalayas. Microscopic examination of wood sections from branches and increment cores from the main trunk revealed sapwood alterations caused by aphid activities. Our findings indicate that aphid activity was observed at elevations ranging from 3100 to 3400 m a.s.l., with a marked preference for younger trees (<= 22 years) over mature ones (> 22 years) beyond a certain developmental stage. This suggests that aphid infestations are significantly more frequent and severe during the early life stages of the host trees, highlighting a vulnerability in younger individuals that diminishes with age. Hence, the pattern of aphid infestation is influenced not solely by rising temperatures, as previously assumed, nor is it significantly affected by altitude changes. Instead, it is notably impacted by the age of the samples. These anatomical markers highlight the impact of aphids and broader ecological shifts affecting plant resilience and forest health. Thus, this study urges collaboration among wood anatomists, entomologists, and ecologists to understand aphid life cycles, host preferences, and ecological interactions in the Himalayas. These findings are crucial for biodiversity conservation in the region and could affect ecological management strategies in other mountain regions worldwide.

AB  - Indochinese tigers (Panthera tigris corbetti), formerly distributed across mainland Southeast Asia, have experienced significant range contraction, with populations in Thailand serving as the last remaining strongholds. One such landscape is the Dong Phayayen-Khao Yai (DPKY) forest complex in eastern Thailand. Despite the landscape's strategic importance for regional tiger recovery, there is a need for policy-aligned evidence to support recovery planning. In this study, we assessed space-use patterns of prey and tigers and factors influencing them, utilising occupancy modelling based on landscape-wide photo-capture data from 2021. Additionally, we evaluated the population dynamics of tigers between 2018 and 2021 by estimating annual population density and vital parameters. Despite the availability of suitable habitat across the 6155 km(2) landscape, tigers were restricted to the eastern section, utilising only 55 % of the complex, primarily constrained by sambar space-use and landscape connectivity. Nevertheless, the population maintained stability (lambda approximate to 1) with high survival (phi > 0.9) and documented reproduction, albeit at low densities (similar to 1 tiger/100 km(2)). Anthropogenic factors significantly influenced prey, with larger species such as sambar and gaur exhibiting limited occurrence (psi <0.4). While the current population appears well protected, evidenced by high survival and reproduction, recovery is constrained by low prey availability and landscape fragmentation, particularly across Highway 304. While considerable recovery potential exists, given the available habitat in the landscape, such recovery necessitates sustained long-term interventions focusing on prey, enhanced protection, and restoration of connectivity. The DPKY represents a critical opportunity for tiger recovery in Southeast Asia, where most landscapes lack tigers.

AB  - This paper summarises the results of multidisciplinary research, including pollen, plant macroremains, diatoms, Cladocera, molluscs and geochemistry from a C-14 dated core and geomorphological records, which reconstruct the palaeoenvironmental conditions faced by Late Palaeolithic hunter-gathers in western Poland. Particular attention was paid to evidence for both human activity and the degree to which Late Palaeolithic groups may have affected the local environment, as recorded by the biogenic sediments in lakes located close to their campsites. Vegetation first appears locally in the Oldest Dryas, and consisted of subarctic tundra vegetation. During the Bolling period the landscape was generally open, with dwarf shrubs and scattered patches of Juniperus and Hippophae shrubs. Betula (tree birch) expanded locally in the area only in the later Allerod; during the second part of the Allerod period, Pinus and Populus joined birch as a sparse woodland developed. During the Younger Dryas, the landscape changed significantly in comparison to the preceding warm period, as result of cooling and drying of the climate. The presence of microscopic charcoal and charred herbaceous plant particles made it possible to detect human activity. These analyses allowed us to reconstruct fire events near the site during its occupation by Hamburg and Federmesser cultural groups. An increase in the proportion of biogenic elements such as Na, K and Mg in the sediments indicate soil erosion, reflecting the activity of Hamburg groups. A relative increase in the frequency of Cladocera which favour eutrophic and turbid water was recorded in the period linked to Federmesser group activities. The intense use of this area was also indicated during the Younger Dryas.

AB  - The endangered Persian Leopard, Panthera pardus tulliana, is a top predator and keystone species whose small, fragmented population is still distributed across the Zagros Mountain regions of northeastern Iraq. Their pop-ulation is under threat from habitat loss and fragmentation, illegal hunting, prey depletion, minefields, and conflicts with humans. Conservation efforts require accurate information on the current and future distribution patterns of this species. Therefore, this study aimed at establishing new baseline data based on the maximum entropy model (Maxent) combined with GIS techniques, field surveys (i.e., camera traps, kill reports, carcasses), and relevant environmental variables obtained from multiple sources. Modeling demonstrated that the current suitable habitat distribution of the species comprises 12.4 % (6318 km2) of the total area of the study area (50971 km2). Of these suitable areas, 0.8 % (431 km2) were categorized as high suitable, 3.8 % (1935 km2) as medium suitable, and 7.8 % (3953 km2) as low suitable. Overall, as demonstrated by modeling under the pre-selected environmental predictors, the suitable habitat distribution of the Persian Leopard would contract by 1.3 % (666 km2) and 1.7 % (843 km2) in 2070 under the RCP2.6 and RCP8.5 climate change scenarios, respectively. There would be a latitudinal shift, and the distance between the current and future centroids would be around 43.492 km. This spatial shift would be mostly towards the Zagros Mountains in the northeast of Iraq, alongside the Iran-Iraq border. The most important variables that contributed significantly to the distribution of the species across the study area included slope (47.3 %), temperature seasonality (bio4) (27.9 %), land cover (7.7 %), human population density (4.2 %), soil pH (2.7 %), temperature (Bio2) (2.7 %), and NDVI (1.8 %). These results could have great implications for establishing strategic protected areas not only for the target species of this study but for a wide range of plant communities and prey species (e.g., goats, wild boar) across the mountain ecosystem.

AB  - Al-Wusta Wildlife Reserve (WWR) is the first wildlife reserve in Oman. It was established in 1980 for reintroduction and breeding of the Arabian oryx (Oryx leucoryx) and recently other wildlife, which includes the Arabian gazelle (Gazelle gazelle cora) and Sand gazelle (Gazella subgutturosa marica). These antelopes are only kept in a few countries worldwide. Therefore, only limited information is available on their husbandry requirements and diseases occurring in these species. This study aimed to evaluate the causes of mortalities at WWR. During July to October 2019, fifty mortalities were observed at WWR. These mortalities consisted of 10 Arabian oryx and 40 Sand gazelles. All carcasses were subjected to the detailed post-mortem (PM) examination to find out the potential cause of death. Fatal injuries caused by fighting were the major cause of deaths (n=17, 34%) followed by cyclone related deaths (n=10, 20%), pneumonia (n=8, 16%), old age (n=4, 8%), impaction of stomach caused by foreign bodies (n=3, 6%) and bloat (n=2, 4%). The exact cause of death could not be established in 5 (10%) mortalities. Internal organs were screened for the presence of adult worms. However, no parasite was observed in these animals. These findings demonstrated that more than 50% mortalities could be reduced by only controlling aggression-related injuries and taking precautionary measures against natural disasters like a cyclone. On the other hand, the absence of internal worms could be related to good husbandry conditions at WWR.

For example, abiotic and biotic interactions can cause gradients in population cycle period and amplitude, but this research is mostly constrained to small mammals. Caribou and reindeer (Rangifer tarandus spp.) are threatened by human-caused change and are known to fluctuate in population over multidecadal scales. But it is unclear how ecological mechanisms drive these cycles and whether these mechanisms are similar to those found in smaller mammals. Here, we carried out a global biogeographic study of Rangifer population cycles in response to top-down and bottom-up mechanisms. We hypothesized that predation and food resources would interact to affect the amplitude and period of population cycles across the species' range. To test this, we used a two-pronged approach: (1) we conducted a range-wide statistical analysis of population data from 43 Rangifer herds; and (2) we built tri-trophic mechanistic population models of predator-Rangifer-food interactions. This approach allowed us to merge theoretical and empirical approaches to better understand the drivers of population cycling across space and time. We found statistical evidence for long-term cyclicity in 19 Rangifer populations, and some evidence that decreasing food productivity and winter temperatures may have caused increased period length and amplitude across spatial gradients. Our mechanistic model largely agreed with our empirical results, showing that decreased food resources and increased predation can drive more intense cycles over time. These paired empirical and theoretical results suggest that gradients in Rangifer population cycles match ecological mechanisms found in smaller mammals. Moreover, human-caused shifts in climate, food resources, and predators may shift Rangifer population dynamics towards more booms and busts, threatening population persistence. We recommend that dynamic management strategies, in tandem with theoretical and empirical approaches, could be used to better understand and manage population cycles across space and time.

AB  - White-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) selection of woody species can be influenced by deer densities, food availability, and local and regional landscape characteristics. Determining selection rankings across varying regional landscapes is important to the management of both deer and forests. However, these regional-scale rankings are currently lacking. Here, we develop selection rankings for 63 species within woodlots across the southern, central, and northern regions of Indiana by counting the number of available and browsed twigs by species along transects. We then classified species into five selection classes: highly selected, slightly selected, neutral, slightly avoided, and strongly avoided. Some species displayed consistent classification across regions, including selection for greenbrier (Smilax spp.), hackberry (Celtis occidentalis), white ash (Fraxinus americana), and white oak (Quercus alba) and avoidance of spicebush (Lindera benzoin) and pawpaw (Asimina triloba). For the 16 species that exhibited significant regional variation in selection, we modeled the probability of a twig being browsed using explanatory variables measured at the woodlot scale, and within 200, 500, 1000, and 1500 m buffers around woodlots. Browsing intensity within a focal woodlot was more often associated with increased selection of an individual species than other explanatory variables. Nonetheless, both woodlot and landscape-scale variables influenced selection of woody browse by deer. In general, factors that increased browsing opportunities (e.g., increased density of non-avoided twigs, increased forest edge density, and increased woodlot edge) increased the selection of an individual species, while those that decreased browsing opportunities (e.g., increased non-native stem density and increased avoided twig density) decreased selection. Our selection classifications for common species in the Central Hardwood Forest Region highlight species that may be at risk of being negatively affected by severe browsing, while simultaneously identifying species that decrease foraging habitat quality. Our results also provide evidence that local and regional conditions drive differences in selection; and thus, require evaluation prior to management. More broadly, we showcase that multiple variables and spatial scales can affect selection of individual browse species by deer and merit consideration by researchers when studying the effects of browsing on forest ecosystems.

AB  - In the last years, several wildfires destroyed large areas in Central European forest stands and the risk for fires is predicted to increase in the future. However, little is known about post-fire succession including the effect of forest management for this region. We studied recolonization patterns of natural regeneration of the pioneer tree species Betula pendula Roth (silver birch), Pinus sylvestris L. (Scots pine), Populus tremula L. (European aspen) and Salix caprea L. (goat willow) on 200 plots in a large, 334 ha burned pine forest stand two years after a severe wildfire. Natural regeneration in general was high, reaching higher densities than artificial regeneration on most plots. The influence of fire severity, post-fire forest management (complete and partial salvage logging and soil disturbance like skidder traffic, ploughing and raking) and distance to the next potential seed source on the number of tree regeneration was tested with multiple linear regression. High fire severities decreased abundance of pine, aspen and willow. The regeneration of all four investigated tree species was influenced by forest management. High birch regeneration was predicted for completely salvage logged plots in combination with skidder traffic or early ploughing and plots without any forest management. Pine regeneration was predicted to be highest on completely salvage logged and sites without any salvage logging. Forest management which in-cludes partial salvage logging showed mostly lower predicted regeneration of birch, pine and aspen as probably an effect of timing. Willow regeneration was promoted by forest management which includes late ploughing. Regeneration of birch and pine decreased with increasing distance to the next potential seed tree, while aspen and willow sapling densities were not affected by distance due to their excellent dispersal by wind. For birch and especially pine, close seed trees are crucial for sufficient natural regeneration. Recolonization of burned areas is a highly dynamic process dependent on several factors. However, natural regeneration provides a fast, cost-effective way of reforestation which can be facilitated by suitable silvicultural treatments. We recommend to keep survived trees as green islands on site to provide close seed sources. To avoid seedling disturbance, forest management activities should be complied according to life cycles of naturally established tree seedlings. We also suggest using the benefits of deciduous pioneer trees in forestry in order to establish more diverse, less fire-prone forests after wildfires in the long term.

AB  - Halting biodiversity loss is a major contemporary challenge. Nature protection can help conserve biodiversity, but increasing wildlife numbers inside protected areas and shrinking habitats intensify interactions between humans and wildlife, potentially causing human-wildlife conflict (HWC). Contemporary narratives of HWC highlight detrimental effects on households' socioeconomic outcomes. Despite a wealth of literature on HWC, many studies remain descriptive and little inferential evidence has been provided. Here we identify the determinants and effects of reported HWC on household outcomes using spatial predictors and an original farm-household dataset collected in Namibia's share of the Kavango-Zambezi Transfrontier Conservation Area. In addition to dependence on agriculture, we find that community-based conservation, the share of a community's area set aside for conservation, and habitat connectivity are key drivers of HWC. Contrary to contemporary narratives of HWC, we find that reported conflicts did not have strong negative effects on household income and livelihood diversity. Conversely, community-based wildlife conservation increases income and livelihood diversity among participating households. It is, however, also associated with food insecurity concerns. Such concerns may be driven by comparatively higher restrictions related to land use planning and zoning that constrain productive land uses, such as agriculture. Our findings suggest that community-based conservation can create development synergies for households in favorable environments, despite increasing HWC risks. However, potential trade-offs including non-material costs warrant further research.

AB  - In terrestrial landscapes, the spectral variability hypothesis (SVH) enables estimation of species diversity from satellite data, thereby allowing biodiversity assessments to be upscaled. Whether the SVH works in the marine realm is an open question. To answer it, we tested the ability of this hypothesis to retrieve coral reef fish biodiversity from two remote sensing platforms on a global transect of reef sites. From orbit, we trialed the multispectral and panchromatic bands of WorldView-2 (WV-2) which have a spatial resolution of 2.5 and 0.5 m, respectively. At 100 times finer resolution, we repeated the experiment using unpiloted aerial vehicle (UAV) data. Encouragingly, the SVH evidently works as well in water as has been reported on land. Spectral variability was positively correlated with fish diversity for all sensors, though the area in which the variability was computed (window size) was important. The strongest relationship between spectral variability and fish biodiversity (R = 0.48) was returned using UAV imagery corrected for surface artifacts via fluid lensing. Splitting fish into herbivores, corallivores, and piscivores revealed that different feeding strategies correlate to spectral variability at different scales. Based on our results, we contend that remote sensing data are underutilized when used to simply map benthic habitat. Spectral variation can clearly serve as a proxy for in situ reef biodiversity.

AB  - Archaeofaunal remains (n = 41,081) from six Neolithic villages in northern Dalmatia indicate the intensification of livestock management from 6000 to 4700 cal BC through changes in the demographic and species compositions of livestock herds that coincide with larger cultural and economic developments in the region. The majority of animal bone at each Neolithic site consisted of sheep and goats. Though cattle and pigs were minor contributors to Early or Middle Neolithic assemblages, both are more prominent in the Late Neolithic. Furthermore, wild species typically range from 4 to 10% of faunal assemblages in open air villages, regardless of phase, and the wild species contain a significant proportion of roe deer (Capreolus capreolus). We suggest the shift in the proportions of domestic animal species during the Neolithic signifies a change in management strategies that is also visible in other proxies (e.g., lipid residues), and the presence of roe deer at these sites results from a variety of behavioral responses by farming communities to their changing agropastoral practices and climatic shifts identified in the region.

AB  - Marine Protected Areas (MPA) safeguard threatened marine ecosystems by protecting fish populations, limiting anthropogenic stressors, and providing additional livelihood for local populations. However, many MPAs do not function effectively due to lack of funding and manpower, engendering the need to find long-lasting, sustainable solutions to monitor and maintain MPA performance. In this study, we utilized citizen science involvement to survey select fish families (Lutjanidae, Serranidae, Carangidae, Scombridae, Sphyraenidae, Lethrinidae, and Scaridae), key fish species (large and vulnerable piscivores), and megafauna in Nusa Penida MPA, Indonesia using the roving survey method. We found that despite a short training period and fast turnover rate, our participants were able to identify all target taxa, as well as detect spatial and temporal trends in fish and megafauna assemblages. An increase in fish density during austral winter was correlated with seasonal upwelling phenomena induced by the southeast monsoon, while site variations were influenced by local topography and type of current. We conclude that citizen science participation contributed immensely to the monitoring of Nusa Penida MPA, and subsequent self-sustained, long-term monitoring will be invaluable for future policy and decision making in MPA management and enforcement.& COPY; 2023 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Forests worldwide are experiencing increasingly intense biotic disturbances; however, assessing impacts of these disturbances is challenging due to the diverse range of organisms involved and the complex interactions among them. This particularly applies to invasive species, which can greatly alter ecological processes in their invaded territories. Here we focus on the pine wood nematode (PWN, Bursaphelenchus xylophilus), an invasive pathogen that has caused extensive mortality of pines in East Asia and more recently has invaded southern Europe. It is expected to expand its range into continental Europe with heavy impacts possible. Given the unknown dynamics of PWN in continental Europe, we reviewed laboratory and field experiments conducted in Asia and southern Europe to parameterize the main components of PWN biology and host-pathogen interactions in the Biotic Disturbance Engine (BITE), a model designed to implement a variety of forest biotic agents, from fungi to large herbivores. To simulate dynamically changing host availability and conditions, BITE was coupled with the forest landscape model iLand. The potential impacts of introducing PWN were assessed in a Central European forest landscape (40,928 ha), likely within PWN's reach in future decades. A parameter sensitivity analysis indicated a substantial influence of factors related to dispersal, colonization, and vegetation impact, whereas parameters related to population growth manifested a minor effect. Selection of different assumptions about biological processes resulted in differential timing and size of the main mortality wave, eliminating 40%-95% of pine trees within 100 years post-introduction, with a maximum annual carbon loss between 1.3% and 4.2%. PWN-induced tree mortality reduced the Gross Primary Productivity, increased heterotrophic respiration, and generated a distinct legacy sink effect in the recovery period. This assessment has corroborated the ecological plausibility of the simulated dynamics and highlighted the need for new strategies to navigate the substantial uncertainty in the agent's biology and population dynamics.

AB  - Annual antler growth begins in the spring and is completed by late summer for male caribou (Rangifer tarandus groenlandicus) from the Qamanirjuaq herd (Nunavut, Canada), aligned with both the spring migration and a seasonal dietary shift. Antlers may provide a non-lethal means of studying short- and long-term changes in caribou ecology through incorporated isotopes of carbon (delta C-13) and nitrogen (delta N-15). We sampled the antlers of 12 male caribou from the Qamanirjuaq herd culled in September 1967. We predicted that serial sampling of antlers would reflect the known seasonal dietary change from lichen to grass-like and shrub diet based on rumen contents from individuals culled during the same period. The delta C-13 and delta N-15 were analyzed in food sources and every 3 cm along each antler's length. The carbon isotope compositions of collagen (delta C-13(col)) varied by similar to 0.5% D; among individuals and within antlers, while the carbon isotope compositions of antler bioapatite (delta C-13(CO3)) increased by 1-1.5% from pedicle to tip. Values of delta N-15(col) increased within antlers by 1-3%; from pedicle to tip and varied by 3% among the individuals sampled. Antler collagen was lower in delta N-15(col) by similar to 1% relative to bone collagen. Bayesian mixing models were conducted to test for changes in dietary proportions from antler isotope compositions. Mixing models did not indicate significant dietary shifts for any individual during antler formation, showing consistently mixed diets of fungi, horsetail, lichen, and woody plants. Increases in delta N-15(col) in antler tissue could, therefore, correspond to subtle seasonal dietary changes and/or the physiological stress of antler tissue development.

AB  - Using 2.046 botanically-inventoried tree plots across the largest tropical forest on Earth, we mapped tree species-diversity and tree species-richness at 0.1-degree resolution, and investigated drivers for diversity and richness. Using only location, stratified by forest type, as predictor, our spatial model, to the best of our knowledge, provides the most accurate map of tree diversity in Amazonia to date, explaining approximately 70% of the tree diversity and species-richness. Large soil-forest combinations determine a significant percentage of the variation in tree species-richness and tree alpha-diversity in Amazonian forest-plots. We suggest that the size and fragmentation of these systems drive their large-scale diversity patterns and hence local diversity. A model not using location but cumulative water deficit, tree density, and temperature seasonality explains 47% of the tree species-richness in the terra-firme forest in Amazonia. Over large areas across Amazonia, residuals of this relationship are small and poorly spatially structured, suggesting that much of the residual variation may be local. The Guyana Shield area has consistently negative residuals, showing that this area has lower tree species-richness than expected by our models. We provide extensive plot meta-data, including tree density, tree alpha-diversity and tree species-richness results and gridded maps at 0.1-degree resolution.
   A study mapping the tree species richness in Amazonian forests shows that soil type exerts a strong effect on species richness, probably caused by the areas of these forest types. Cumulative water deficit, tree density and temperature seasonality affect species richness at a regional scale.

AB  - Reversing biodiversity loss is a global imperative that requires setting aside sufficient space for species. In South Africa, an estimated area of 20 million ha is under wildlife ranching, a form of private land enterprise that adopts wildlife-based land uses for commercial gain. This land has potential to contribute towards biodiversity conservation, but the extent to which this occurs has not been evaluated. Using structured questionnaires of 226 wildlife ranchers, we assessed how the sector contributes towards the conservation of ungulates and elephants (hereafter herbivores). Overall, 40 herbivore species were present across the sample, where individual ranches had a mean of 15.0 (+/- 4.8) species, 1.9 (+/- 1.5) threatened species, and 3.6 (+/- 3.1) extralimital species per property. In comparison to 54 state PAs, wildlife ranches had significantly higher species richness, more threatened species but more extralimital species when property/reserve size was controlled for. Ranches conducting trophy hunting had similar species richness and numbers of extralimital species per ha, but fewer threatened species when compared to ranches conducting ecotourism. We estimate that 4.66-7.25 million herbivores occur on ranches nationally, representing one of the few examples on earth where indigenous mammal populations are thriving and demonstrating how sustainable use can lead to rewilding. We discuss the potential negative impacts of widespread game fencing on landscape fragmentation and gene flow, as well as how the widespread occurrence of extralimital species may lead to hybridisation, biotic homogenisation, and changes to vegetation dynamics. Despite these challenges, commercial wildlife ranching offers a viable option for conserving large mammalian herbivore biodiversity.

AB  - Predators use different spatial tactics to track the prey on the landscape. Three hypotheses describe spatial tactics: prey abundance for prey that are aggregated in space; prey habitat for uniformly distributed prey; and prey catchability for prey that are difficult to catch and kill. The gray wolf (Canis lupus) is a generalist predator that likely employs more than one spatial hunting tactic to match their diverse prey with distinct distributions and behavior that are available. We conducted a study on 17 GPS collared wolves in 6 packs in Riding Mountain National Park, Manitoba, Canada where wolves prey on moose (Alces alces) and elk (Cervus canadensis). We evaluated wolf selection for prey density, habitat selection and catchability on the landscape through within-territory habitat selection analysis. We reveal support for both the prey habitat and prey catchability hypotheses. For moose, their primary prey, wolves employed a mixed habitat and catchability tactic. Wolves used spaces described by the intersection of moose habitat and moose catchability. Wolves selected for the catchability of elk, their secondary prey, but not elk habitat. Counter to our predictions, wolves avoided areas of moose and elk density, likely highlighting the ongoing space race between predator and prey. We illustrate that of the three hypotheses the primary driver was prey catchability, where the interplay of both prey habitat with catchability culminate in predator spatial behaviour in a multiprey system.

AB  - Grazing by nominally herbivorous fishes is widely recognised as a critical ecosystem function on coral reefs. However, several studies have suggested that herbivory is reduced in the presence of predators, especially sharks. Nevertheless, the effects of shark presence on grazing, under natural settings, remains poorly resolved. Using -200 h of video footage, we quantify the extent of direct disturbance by reef sharks on grazing fishes. Contrary to expectations, grazing rate was not significantly suppressed due to sharks, with fishes resuming feeding in as little as 4 s after sharks passed. Based on our observations, we estimate that an average m2 area of reef at our study locations would be subjected to -5 s of acute shark disturbance during daylight hours. It appears the shortterm impact of reef shark presence has a negligible effect on herbivore grazing rates, with the variable nature of grazing under natural conditions overwhelming any fear effects.

AB  - Ocean warming is driving poleward range shifts for many marine species. For foundation organisms that underpin the wider ecosystem, such as canopy-forming seaweeds, shifts in distributions or population demography can have widespread ecological consequences. The warm water kelp, Laminaria ochroleuca, is found towards its leading edge in Plymouth Sound (southwest England, UK), where it has proliferated in recent years, partially replacing the cool-water congeneric species, L. hyperborea, at some wave-sheltered locations. To determine how ecosystem dynamics have changed due to this substitution and to benchmark population structure, monthly surveys were conducted of L. ochroleuca populations at three sites over 10 months. Canopy-forming L. ochroleuca sporophytes were recorded in all months at all sites, in densities of up to similar to 8 individuals m(-2), indicating that this species is now a conspicuous space occupier within this ecosystem. Blade length, weight and fertility followed clear seasonal patterns peaking during late spring/early summer and rapidly declining in autumn/winter. Between-site variability was also observed, with greater densities, blade lengths/widths and standing stock biomass at the most wave-sheltered but tidally influenced site. The most abundant herbivore associated with L. ochroleuca was the blue rayed limpet, Patella pellucida, which was predominantly found in summer months and in greater abundance than reported values for other kelps in the region. Our survey wide estimates of carbon standing stock ranged from 408 +/- 67 to 1006 +/- 181 g C m(-2) across sites, with a regional mean of 615 g C m(-2), which was in line with previous estimates for the congeneric L. hyperborea at nearby sites. Overall, the most detailed demographic assessment of L. ochroleuca to date is provided, which allows for a greater understanding of its ecological role within the wider temperate ecosystem and serves as a robust baseline against which to detect future ecological changes.

AB  - Soil macro-invertebrates play an important role in the decomposition process of soil organic matter. As the world's largest alpine peatland, the Zoige peatland on the eastern Tibetan Plateau is experiencing the decline in water table level primarily because of historic drainage. However, little is known about the responses of soil macro-invertebrate communities to water table decline. To address this issue, we established a field drainage experimental platform in 2013, which consists of low (50 cm deep drainage ditch) and intermediate (20 cm deep drainage ditch) water table level treatments, and the ambient (no drainage ditch) plots. In July (warm season) and November (cold season) of 2019, we examined the species composition, richness, densities and the vertical distribution of soil macro-invertebrates. Results showed that the species composition differed significantly among treatments. Species richness and densities of overall and different trophic groups (i.e., detritivores, herbivores and predators) of soil macro-invertebrates were significantly higher in the drained treatments compared to the ambient plots. Moreover, soil macro-invertebrates moved down to deeper soil layers in the low water table treatments compared to the ambient plots. In addition, sampling season (warm vs. cold) did not affect the responses of soil macro-invertebrates to water table decline. These results indicate that soil macroinvertebrate community is sensitive to water table decline in the Zoige peatland. Given the recognized importance of soil fauna to ecosystem functioning, more attention should be paid to the conservation of peatlands.

AB  - In the Tien-Shan Mountains, Ili Prefecture, Xinjiang, China, the livestock industry has experienced rapid growth in recent decades. However, this expansion has led to increased overgrazing behavior, resulting in the proliferation of grazing paths and a decline in vegetation cover. These factors are considered the main causes of vegetation degradation in the region. To investigate this issue, we conducted a study utilizing unmanned aerial vehicle imagery in the Zollersay Mountains of Ili to examine the distribution of grazing paths and their effects on mountain vegetation, including grassland and Malus sieversii. The results of our study revealed that grazing paths in the area exhibited various formations, including parallel, oblique intersection, and grid. On the hilltop, the grazing paths were not only shorter but also wider, whereas on the hillside, they were denser, indicating a higher concentration of livestock trampling events. It was found that grazing path density played a pivotal role in grassland degradation, with a negative correlation observed between grazing path density and indicators such as the grassland quality index and grass vegetation coverage. As grazing path density increased, the damage inflicted on Malus sieversii by livestock also intensified. However, as the trees grow older, their height surpasses the feeding range of livestock, resulting in reduced grazing impact. The findings of our study carry significant implications for developing scientifically informed livestock policies and promoting the conservation of wild fruit forests.

AB  - Background Refaunation/rewilding by large ungulates represents a cost-efficient approach to managing natural biotopes and may be particularly useful for areas whose biodiversity depends on disturbance dynamics and is imperilled by successional changes. To study impacts of refaunation on invertebrates, we focused on butterflies inhabiting the former military training range Milovice, Czech Republic, refaunated since 2015 by a combination of Exmoor pony ("wild" horse), Tauros cattle ("aurochs"), and European wisent. Methods We analysed butterfly presence-absence patterns immediately after the military use termination (early 1990s), prior to the refaunation (2009), and after it (2016-19); and current abundance data gained by monitoring butterflies at refaunated and neglected plots. We used correspondence analysis for the presence-absence comparison and canonical correspondence analysis for the current monitoring, and related results of both ordination methods to the life history and climatic traits, and conservation-related attributes, of recorded butterflies. Results Following the termination of military use, several poorly mobile species inclining towards oceanic climates were lost. Newly gained are mobile species preferring warmer continental conditions. The refaunated plots hosted higher butterfly species richness and abundances. Larger-bodied butterflies developing on coarse grasses and shrubs inclined towards neglected plots, whereas refaunated plots supported smaller species developing on small forbs. Conclusion The changes in species composition following the cessation of military use were attributable to successional change, coupled with changes in species pool operating at larger scales. By blocking succession, large ungulates support butterflies depending on competitively poor plants. Restoring large ungulates populations represents a great hope for conserving specialised insects, provided that settings of the projects, and locally adapted ungulate densities, do not deplete resources for species with often contrasting requirements.

AB  - Our current understanding of the effect of insect herbivory on ecosystem productivity is limited. Previous studies have typically quantified only the amount of leaf area loss or have been conducted during outbreak years when levels of herbivory are much higher than on average. These set-ups often do not take into account the physiological changes taking place in the remaining plant tissue after insect attack or do not represent typical, non-outbreak herbivore densities. Here, we estimate the effect of non-outbreak densities of insect herbivores on gross primary productivity in a temperate oak forest both through leaf area loss and through changes in leaf gas exchange. We first conduct a meta-analysis to assess evidence of herbivory-induced changes in photosynthesis in the literature. We then estimate how canopy primary productivity changes with decreasing and increasing levels of herbivory by using a canopy upscaling model and the average leaf-level effect based on the literature. The meta-analysis revealed a wide range of effects of herbivory on leaf photosynthesis, ranging from a reduction of 82 % to an increase of 49 %. On average, herbivory reduces the photosynthetic rate in the remaining leaf tissue by 16 % [6 %-27 %; 95 % CI]. The gross primary productivity of an oak stand under normal (5 % leaf area loss) levels of herbivory is estimated on average to be 13 % [5 %-21 %] lower than that of a non-herbivorized stand, once physiological changes in the intact plant tissue are considered. We propose that the effect of insect herbivory on primary productivity is non-linear and determined mainly by changes in leaf gas exchange and the pattern at which herbivory spreads through the canopy. We call for replicated studies in different systems to validate the relationship between insect herbivory and ecosystem productivity proposed here.

AB  - Vegetation degradation in arid and semi -arid regions reduces plant C inputs to the soil, which can impede soil nutrient cycling because of the limited C source for microbial metabolism. However, whether vegetation degradation aggravates microbial nutrient limitation in degraded ecosystems in arid and semi -arid regions is not fully understood. Here, we investigated changes in soil enzyme activity and microbial nutrient limitation along a well-documented gradient of degraded seabuckthorn ( Hippophae rhamnoides L.) (slightly degraded, canopy dieback <25 %, moderately degraded, canopy dieback 25 % -75 %, and severely degraded, canopy dieback >75 %) in Liang (long ridge) and gully channel locations in the Pisha Sandstone region of the Loess Plateau, China. We found that as the magnitude of seabuckthorn degradation increased, activities of C-acquiring enzymes and ratios of C:N and C:P enzymes (0.54 -0.80 and 0.52 -0.77, respectively) increased whereas the N:P enzyme ratio (0.93 -0.99) decreased. Stoichiometric modelling further indicated that microorganisms were limited by soil C and P (vector angle >45 degrees ) in the seabuckthorn plantation region, and the degradation of seabuckthorn plantation aggravated microbial C and P limitations. Partial least squares path modelling revealed that seabuckthorn degradation (canopy dieback) was the main factor explaining microbial C limitation variations, while soil physicochemical properties (pH and soil moisture content) and understory plant parameters (litter biomass) were the major factors underlying microbial P limitation of long ridge and gully channel formations, respectively. Our findings highlight synergistic changes between aboveground and belowground processes, suggesting an unexpected negative effect of vegetation degradation on soil microbial community and nutrient cycling. These insights offer a direction for the development of plantation nutrients management strategies in semi -arid and arid areas.

AB  - Soil nematodes are ideal indicators for soil food webs, ecosystem conditions, and soil health. However, current research focuses on how plant removal affects soil nematodes while ignoring the importance of the trophic cascading effects. The study aims to elucidate the direct and indirect effects of long-term plant community removal on soil nematode communities, especially through soil physicochemical properties and trophic cascading effects. A 6-year field all-aboveground plant community removal experiment was conducted to evaluate the effects of plant removal on soil nematode communities and use piecewise structural equation modeling to better understand the direct and indirect effects of plant removal on different trophic group nematodes. The removal of plants did not significantly influence the total abundance, richness, or trophic group richness of soil nematodes, but it did considerably reduce the number of herbivorous and fungivorous nematodes. Our results revealed that the removal of plants significantly altered the nematode community composition mainly by changing the relative abundance of the genera Helicotylenchus, Tylenchus, Tylopharynx, and Aphelenchoides. The abundance of predatory-omnivorous nematodes was dramatically and directly enhanced by the removal of plants, but it was also indirectly changed by a decrease in the abundance of fungivorous and herbivorous nematodes. The most significant mechanism for plant removal to impact predatory-omnivorous nematodes might be through the fungal channels, which are mainly mediated by fungivorous nematodes. These results indicated that plant removal affects predatory-omnivorous nematodes primarily through fungal channels and elucidated the importance of trophic cascading in mediating the effects of plant communities on soil nematode communities.

AB  - Spines are a major ecological innovation supporting plant defence and diversification. Spine anatomy is diverse, having arisen in multiple plant lineages from many different plant organs and parts, which may differ in relative advantages across environmental gradients. Systematic analyses of the correlates of spiny plant diversity are limited, but climate and soil properties may be important. We analysed spatial patterns of the proportional richness of spiny woody plant species (fraction of total woody species richness) and the proportional richness of species with particular spine types (fraction of richness of spiny plants) across three regions with high plant geolocational data density spanning three continents, China (Asia), South Africa (Africa), and Australia. Spiny plants accounted for 12% of woody species, but there are strong phylogenetic biases in the evolution of spiny lineages and lineages bearing different spine types. The proportion of spiny plants increased towards drier environments and higher soil clay contents, and decreased towards soils with greater total N. Species bearing different spine types appear to be distributed differently across climate and soil gradients, suggesting trade-offs across productivity gradients, specialization for climate space, and constraints on environmental adaptability. The spatial richness of spiny plants was positively correlated with estimated historical richness of large herbivorous mammals (body mass >20 kg, diet >90% plant material), and species bearing different spine types also mostly show positive relationships with mammal richness. Plants with spines appear to be advantaged over non-spiny species when exposed to high mammal browsing pressure in arid environments or over certain soil conditions, and species bearing different spine types are differentially advantaged across climate and soil gradients.

AB  - Habitat management through distribution tracking of umbrella species has been used to improve urban ecosystem health and sustainability to enhance the life quality of citizens. However, there are practical limitations to the application of habitat distribution analysis methods applied to urban ecosystems due to human disturbance. Considering additional habitat suitability information of prey species, the prediction of habitat reflecting complex urban environmental characteristics would be improved in Suwon city, South Korea. The habitat probability of Strigidae, which is an umbrella species of Suwon city, and prey species is predicted using the Maximum Entropy (MaxEnt) model. We determined whether the inclusion of prey species habitat probability in that of Strigidae can improve the prediction as well as has the same effect for a Eurasian hobby (Falco Subbuteo) like Strigidae. The performance of MaxEnt was improved when not only environmental variables but also prey species habitat probability is added. When the presence information was sampled by the k-fold method, the probability of detection of surveyed points was improved by 1.38 times. Our results indicate that prey species information is important to both Strigidae and the Eurasian hobby. Therefore, using prey species habitat information can improve the reliability of habitat analysis by supplementing information and reflect complex urban ecosystems.

AB  - Middle Miocene deposits at Maboko Island in the Nyanza Rift of Western Kenya (-15-14 Ma) have yielded a rich fossil mammalian record that documents a mid-Miocene faunal shift. Palaeoecological proxies for Maboko have previously been interpreted to indicate heterogeneous habitats, ranging from grassland to closed canopy forest and implicated in this turnover. Stable carbon and oxygen isotope data of fossil herbivore enamel from catarrhine-bearing deposits at Maboko were analyzed to reconstruct the nature of C3 vegetation (i.e., waterstressed or subcanopy), as well as determining if any C4 biomass, representative of more open woodland or grassland habitats, were consumed. Taxa sampled include representatives of ruminants, suoids, rhinocerotids, and proboscideans. 813Cenamel and 818Oenamel values of Maboko fossil herbivores indicate foraging strategies consistent with a C3 dominated ecosystem, exhibiting a range of 813Cenamel signatures similar to those of extant browsing herbivores foraging in mosaics of open forest/woodland habitats. Within the Maboko sequence, isotopic evidence indicates varying environments based on variable dietary spectra associated with discrete fossiliferous units within the succession. Relative to other stratigraphic beds, isotopic signals of herbivore enamel from Bed 5b, for example, reflect more closed woodland/forest foraging. The overall -4%o range of 813Cenamel values from Maboko (-14.1%o to - 10.2%o) is statistically similar to 813Cenamel values from the slightly younger middle Miocene site of Fort Ternan and is consistent with faunal and paleosol evidence from Maboko suggesting ecological variability. However, the isotopic evidence from Maboko indicates that environmental variability is more constrained than previously reconstructed, instead ranging from more open canopy forest to open woodland habitats, albeit with some spatial and temporal heterogeneity. Closed canopy forest plants and C4 biomass were not detectable as dietary components for any herbivores sampled thus far; nor was there evidence of significantly water-stressed C3 vegetation (possibly C3 grasses) being consumed.

AB  - Conservation of large carnivores such as leopards requires large and interconnected habitats. Despite the wide geographic range of the leopard globally, only 17% of their habitat is within protected areas. Leopards are widely distributed in Nepal, but their population status and occupancy are poorly understood. We carried out the sign-based leopard occupancy survey across the entire Chure range (similar to 19,000 km(2)) to understand the habitat occupancy along with the covariates affecting their occupancy. Leopard signs were obtained from in 70 out of 223 grids surveyed, with a naive leopard occupancy of 0.31. The model-averaged leopard occupancy was estimated to be 0.5732 (SE 0.0082) with a replication-level detection probability of 0.2554 (SE 0.1142). The top model shows the additive effect of wild boar, ruggedness, presence of livestock, and human population density positively affecting the leopard occupancy. The detection probability of leopard was higher outside the protected areas, less in the high NDVI (normalized difference vegetation index) areas, and higher in the areas with livestock presence. The presence of wild boar was strong predictor of leopard occupancy followed by the presence of livestock, ruggedness, and human population density. Leopard occupancy was higher in west Chure (0.70 +/- SE 0.047) having five protected areas compared with east Chure (0.46 +/- SE 0.043) with no protected areas. Protected areas and prey species had positive influence on leopard occupancy in west Chure range. Similarly in the east Chure, the leopard occupancy increased with prey, NDVI, and terrain ruggedness. Enhanced law enforcement and mass awareness activities are necessary to reduce poaching/killing of wild ungulates and leopards in the Chure range to increase leopard occupancy. In addition, maintaining the sufficient natural prey base can contribute to minimize the livestock depredation and hence decrease the human-leopard conflict in the Chure range.

AB  - Floods are one of the catastrophic natural disasters that have threatened human society and biodiversity throughout history. This is particularly so in coastal habitats such as the Mond Protected Area of Iran and is one of the principal factors endangering Arabian sand gazelle in this area. The Arabian sand gazelle is considered an independent species in Iran and The Mond Protected Area is its only habitat in Iran. This study aimed to determine the suitability of the habitat and identify the flood -prone areas of Mand protected area. Using the maximum entropy method and MaxEnt software, a habitat suitability map was prepared. To study the impacts of Mond River flooding on gazelle habitats within the Mond Protected Area and provide 25 to 500 -year return period flood inundation maps, a two-dimensional HEC-RAS model was developed. After mixing the flood inundation maps with the suitability map, it was determined that significant parts of the center and west sections of the study area are prone to devastating floods. Generally, in this study, we have determined by using flood zoning techniques in areas that are likely to be affected by floods, which is very effective in managing floodplain areas and controlling floods to reduce flood damage to the only sand gazelle's habitat in Iran.

AB  - Reforming environmentally harmful subsidies is an international priority under the UN Convention on Biological Diversity. Research that links industrial subsidies to negative ecological impacts, however, is limited. This paper contributes to the emerging agenda of global "subsidy accountability" research by linking oil and gas subsidies to the decline of endangered caribou herds in British Columbia, Canada. While existing research concretely attributes the decline of caribou herds to industrial activity, including oil and gas development, we suggest there is a need to identify the political-economic structures which drive ongoing industrial development in caribou habitat, including public subsidies. We use government data to map oil and gas wells in critical caribou habitat and determine how many are run by operators receiving provincial fossil fuel "royalty credits". Ultimately, we find that 1678, or 54%, of oil and gas wells located within critical caribou habitat are run by companies that have received benefits from one or both of BC's largest royalty credit programs. This paper points to the need for further analysis of subsidies as indirect drivers of biodiversity loss on a global scale, as well as increased emphasis on political-economic drivers in conservation research. It also highlights the obstacles to implementing appropriate conservation solutions in political-economic contexts dominated by resource extraction.

AB  - Large-scale, high-severity wildfires are increasingly frequent across the western United States. Fire severity affects the amount of vegetation removed and helps dictate what, where, and how many plants regenerate postfire, potentially altering the available habitat and nutritional landscape for wildlife. To evaluate the effects of fire severity on summer nutritional resources for elk (Cervus canadensis), we collected field data and remotely sensed information in Years 2 and 3 after a large-scale wildfire to compare forage quality and quantity across forest types and fire severities within the summer range of one elk population in west-central Montana. To understand the landscape-level effects of fire severity on nutritional resources, we developed predictive forage quality and quantity models. We used these models to predict nutritional resources across the landscape for four landscape scenarios representing different fire severity patterns (i.e., an unburned landscape, a landscape burned only at low severity, a landscape burned only at high severity, and the observed landscape burned at mixed severity). Shortly after the wildfire, summer forage quality and herbaceous forage quantity increased in both burned mesic and dry mixed-conifer forests regardless of fire severity. Summer shrub forage quantity was greater in unburned mesic and dry forests, and there was no difference between fire severities in dry forests. Low-severity burned mesic forests had significantly greater shrub forage quantity compared with high-severity burned mesic forests. The three predicted burned landscape scenarios had the highest percentage of the summer range with adequate forage quality, which increased throughout the summer. By contrast, the predicted unburned landscape had the lowest percentage of summer range with adequate forage quality, which decreased throughout the summer. Wildfire extended the duration in which elk can access high-quality forage in the summer in Years 2 and 3 postfire. Therefore, shortly after a large-scale wildfire, elk may be better able to meet their nutritional requirements, which may positively impact elk body condition, reproductive performance, and survival.

AB  - In a landscape with patchily distributed forage resources, an animal's distribution may reflect the distribution of the resources if the population is forage-limited in time or space. This may be particularly explicit in climatically extreme and seasonally variable environments, notably alpine and polar environments during winter. Sustainable management considers the amount of available alpine ground lichen in winter as a predictor of carrying capacity for the last remaining populations of wild European Mountain reindeer Rangifer tarandus tarandus in alpine environments in South Norway. Ground lichen growth is constrained to elevated, wind-blown, snow-free ridges. However, wild Mountain reindeer also persist in areas providing little lichen resources. Our alternative functional hypothesis is that the critical resource is the amount of snow-free feeding areas during winter, which provide direct access to forage, likely to be energy-profitable regardless of the type of vegetation. We sampled animal-borne videos from wild Mountain reindeer during maximum accumulation of snow in late winter/spring, in three contrasting areas providing variable amounts of ground lichen and alternative vegetation resources. Direct observations of reindeer foraging via videos document an active selection and strong preference for feeding on snow-free patches, regardless of type of vegetation. Active 'cratering' in snow was not observed. In contrast, walking behaviours occurred much more frequently across snow-covered areas. Remote sensing data and analyses corroborated these observations. In the sustainable management of wild Mountain reindeer amounts of vegetated snow-free areas is an important functional predictor of winter carrying capacity.

AB  - Long-term ecological monitoring of coral reefs can reveal the state of the reef communities and responses of different reef components to various pulse and press disturbance events. Here, we describe long-term monitoring of reef fish assemblages from two U.S. National Parks in Hawai'i, Kaloko-Honokohau National Historical Park (KAHO) and Kalaupapa National Historical Park (KALA) over the past decade. These two parks experience different anthropogenic disturbances as KAHO is highly accessible with multiple types of adjacent land use while KALA is relatively inaccessible, surrounded by large expanses of native forest, and known for having the highest documented fish biomass within the main Hawaiian Islands. The fish assemblages in KAHO were numerically dominated by small-bodied damselfish Chromis spp. and herbivorous surgeonfishes Acanthurus nigrofuscus, Ctenochaetus strigosus and Zebrasoma flavescens, while those in KALA were numerically dominated by Chromis vanderbilti, A. nigrofuscus, Thalassoma duperrey and Paracirrhites arcatus. Multivariate control charts detected anomalies in the fish assemblages in some years. In KAHO, gradual shifts in the assemblages were detected in recent years due to changes (both increases and decreases) in relative abundances of numerically dominant species including Chromis agilis, C. vanderbilti, A. nigrofuscus, C. strigosus and Z. flavescens. There was a documented reduction in live coral cover in KAHO due to a bleaching event in 2015, and potential delayed effects of the coral mortality on the fish assemblages were found particularly in the North and South regions of the park. In KALA, increases in the abundances of Acanthurus (A. blochii, A. leucopareius, A. nigrofuscus, A. thompsoni and A. triostegus) and C. strigosus were found in 2014, likely due to a large recruitment event that had not been well reported. As localized thermal stress events were detected in both KAHO and KALA in 2019, continuous monitoring of these two parks is critical to assess how the coral-reef ecosystems under two different human-use scenarios respond to repeated heating events and whether there are immediate as well as delayed effects on reef organisms resulting from losses of live coral tissue and a subsequent decrease in structural complexity provided by the coral.

AB  - BackgroundPrey species can display antipredator movement behaviours to reduce predation risk, including proactive responses to chronic or predictable risk, and reactive responses to acute or unpredictable risk. Thus, at any given time, prey movement choice may reflect a trade-off between proaction and reaction. In previous studies, proaction and reaction have generally been considered separately, which neglects their potentially simultaneous influence on animal movement decisions and overall space use.MethodsIn this study, we analysed how proaction and reaction interact to shape the movements of GPS-collared red deer (Cervus elaphus) in response to hunting by humans. Using an exhaustive inventory of red deer hunting events and very high-resolution canopy cover density (LiDAR), we combined movement metric (displacement and path length) models and integrated step selection functions to investigate antipredator movement responses to lethal risk on various spatiotemporal scales, considering a dynamic landscape of risk.ResultsOur results show that red deer either proactively avoided areas of chronic risk, or they selected canopy cover where and when risk was predictably high. However, when risk was encountered anyway, canopy cover was no longer selected, but only modulated a reactive response along a remain-to-leave continuum. This reaction was even more evident when the environment was unfamiliar, underlining the importance of memory in such reaction patterns.ConclusionsWe describe how proaction and reaction fuse in an antipredator sequence of interconnected movement decisions in a large herbivore, and discuss how this result may help disentangle the ecological consequences of behavioural responses to predation. Finally, we lay the foundations for further investigations into the origins of similarities and differences between proactive and reactive movement responses.

AB  - The expansion of woody species into grasslands has altered community structure and ecosystem function of grasslands worldwide. In tallgrass prairie of the Central Great Plains, USA, decreased fire frequency and intensity have increased the cover and abundance of woody species. In particular, clonal shrub cover has increased at accelerated rates due to vegetative reproduction and resprouting after disturbance. We measured the intra-clonal stem demography and relative growth rates (estimated change in woody biomass) of the shrub Cornus drummondii in response to fire frequency (4 vs 20 year burn intervals) and simulated browsing during the 2018 and 2019 growing seasons at Konza Prairie Biological Station (Manhattan, Kansas). Overall, infrequent fire (4 year burn interval) increased intra-clonal stem relative growth rates and shrub relative growth rates. Intra-clonal stem relative growth rates were reduced in unbrowsed clones in 2018 due to drought and simulated browsing reduced intra-clonal stem relative growth rates in 2019. Additionally, simulated browsing nearly eliminated flower production within clones but did not affect intra-clonal stem mortality or recruitment within a growing season. Fire in conjunction with simulated browsing reduced estimated relative growth rates for entire shrub clones. Browsed shrubs that experienced prescribed fire in 2017 had reduced intra-clonal stem densities compared to unbrowsed shrubs and stem densities of browsed shrubs did not recover in 2018 or 2019. These results illustrate that infrequent fire alone promotes the expansion of clonal shrubs in tallgrass prairie and multiple interacting disturbances (e.g., fire and browsing) are required to control the spread of clonal shrubs into grasslands.

AB  - Across portions of the western Great Plains in North America, natural fire has been removed from grassland ecosystems, decreasing vegetation heterogeneity and allowing woody encroachment. The loss of fire has implications for grassland species requiring diverse vegetation patches and structure or patches that have limited occurrence in the absence of fire. The lesser prairie-chicken (Tympanuchus pallidicinctus) is a declining species of prairie-grouse that requires heterogeneous grasslands throughout its life history and fire has been removed from much of its occupied range. Patch-burn grazing is a management strategy that re-establishes the fire-grazing interaction to a grassland system, increasing heterogeneity in vegetation structure and composition. We evaluated the effects of patch-burn grazing on lesser prairie-chicken space use, habitat features, and vegetation selection during a 4-year field study from 2014-2017. Female lesser prairie-chickens selected 1- and 2-year post-fire patches during the lekking season, >= 4-year post-fire patches during the nesting season, and year-of-fire and 1-year post-fire patches during post-nesting and nonbreeding seasons. Vegetation selection during the lekking season was not similar to available vegetation in selected patches, suggesting that lesser prairie-chickens cue in on other factors during the lekking season. During the nesting season, females selected nest sites with greater visual obstruction, which was available in >= 4-year post-fire patches; during the post-nesting season, females selected sites with 15-25% bare ground, which was available in the year-of-fire, 1-year post-fire, and 2-year post-fire patches; and during the nonbreeding season they selected sites with lower visual obstruction, available in the year-of-fire and 1-year post-fire patches. Because lesser prairie-chickens selected all available time-since-fire patches during their life history, patch-burn grazing may be a viable management tool to restore and maintain lesser prairie-chicken habitat on the landscape.

AB  - Species interaction effects on populations can vary in both magnitude (i.e. strong vs. weak) and sign (positive, negative, or no effect). Context-dependent effects of species interactions occur when the sign or strength of the interaction's effect on population growth rate changes across abiotic gradients. We know that species can vary substantially in the degree of context dependence they exhibit, even across similar abiotic gradients. However, few studies have characterised context dependence of co-occurring species, limiting our ability to understand the implications of context dependence for species interaction effects on community composition. Using over three decades of data collected for 13 tallgrass prairie forbs at the Konza Prairie Biological Station, we parameterise density structured population models that predict population dynamics as functions of abiotic conditions and bison herbivory. We use these models to estimate the degree of context dependence in responses to bison herbivory for 13 species across three abiotic gradients: weather, fire frequency and soil type. All species showed significant context dependence for fire frequency in the same direction, though with variable magnitude, such that herbivory increased cover with more frequent fires. Context dependence with weather and soil type varied dramatically across species in both direction and magnitude. For example, herbivory effects on 3/13 species were stronger in wet conditions, but herbivory effects on 5/13 species were stronger in dry conditions. Thus, context dependence exhibited by individual species, as opposed to effects of abiotic conditions on the relative abundances of species, could generate much of the weather-dependent effects of herbivory on community composition. Synthesis: Our work suggests that species can vary dramatically in the presence, direction and magnitude of context dependence, even when occurring in the same community and when considering the same species interaction (i.e. response to a herbivore). In addition, we find that context dependence could drive substantial variation in the effect of species interactions on community characteristics (e.g. composition) across multiple abiotic gradients.

Fodd bynnag, ychydig o astudiaethau sydd wedi nodweddu dibyniaeth ar gyd-destun ymhlith rhywogaethau yn yr un ardal. Mae hynny'n cyfyngu ar ein gallu i ddeall beth yw goblygiadau dibyniaeth ar gyd-destun o ran effeithiau rhyngweithio rhwng rhywogaethau ar gyfansoddiad cymunedol.

Roedd dibyniaeth ar y cyd-destun & acirc;'r tywydd a'r math o bridd yn amrywio'n fawr ar draws rhywogaethau o ran cyfeiriad a maint. Er enghraifft, roedd effeithiau llysysyddiaeth ar 3/13 rhywogaeth yn gryfach mewn amodau gwlyb, ond roedd effeithiau llysysyddiaeth ar 5/13 rhywogaeth yn gryfach mewn amodau sych. Felly, gallai dibyniaeth rhywogaethau unigol ar gyd-destun, yn hytrach nag effeithiau amodau anfiotig ar doreithrwydd cymharol rhywogaethau, gynhyrchu llawer o effeithiau llysysyddiaeth tywydd-ddibynnol ar gyfansoddiad cymunedau.

AB  - Effective forest management, particularly during forest disturbance events, requires timely and accurate monitoring information at appropriate spatial scales. In Hawai'i, widespread 'ohi'a (Metrosideros polymorpha Gaud.) mortality associated with introduced fungal pathogens affects forest stands across the archipelago, further impacting native ecosystems already under threat from invasive species. Here, we share results from an integrated monitoring program based on high resolution (<5 cm) aerial imagery, field sampling, and confirmatory laboratory testing to detect and monitor 'ohi'a mortality at the individual tree level across four representative sites on Hawai'i island. We developed a custom imaging system for helicopter operations to map thousands of hectares (ha) per flight, a more useful scale than the ten to hundreds of ha typically covered using small, unoccupied aerial systems. Based on collected imagery, we developed a rating system of canopy condition to identify 'ohi'a trees suspected of infection by the fungal pathogens responsible for rapid 'ohi'a death (ROD); we used this system to quickly generate and share suspect tree candidate locations with partner agencies to rapidly detect new mortality outbreaks and prioritize field sampling efforts. In three of the four sites, 98% of laboratory samples collected from suspect trees assigned a high confidence rating (n = 50) and 89% of those assigned a medium confidence rating (n = 117) returned positive detections for the fungal pathogens responsible for ROD. The fourth site, which has a history of unexplained 'ohi'a mortality, exhibited much lower positive detection rates: only 6% of sampled trees assigned a high confidence rating (n = 16) and 0% of the sampled suspect trees assigned a medium confidence rating (n = 20) were found to be positive for the pathogen. The disparity in positive detection rates across study sites illustrates challenges to definitively determine the cause of 'ohi'a mortality from aerial imagery alone. Spatial patterns of ROD-associated 'ohi'a mortality were strongly affected by ungulate presence or absence as measured by the density of suspected ROD trees in fenced (i.e., ungulate-free) and unfenced (i.e., ungulate present) areas. Suspected ROD tree densities in neighboring areas containing ungulates were two to 69 times greater than those found in ungulate-free zones. In one study site, a fence line breach occurred during the study period, and feral ungulates entered an area that was previously ungulate-free. Following the breach, suspect ROD tree densities in this area rose from 0.02 to 2.78 suspect trees/ha, highlighting the need for ungulate control to protect 'ohi'a stands from Ceratocystis-induced mortality and repeat monitoring to detect forest changes and resource threats.

AB  - Coxiella burnetii is the causative agent of Q fever. The main reservoirs for this bacterium, which can lead to human infection, in our region are typically cattle, goats, and sheep. In animals, C. burnetii infection is often detected due to reproductive problems. European Member States are required to report confirmed cases annually, but the lack of uniform reporting methods makes the data rather inconsistent. The Istituto Zooprofilattico Sperimentale dell'Abruzzo e del Molise is involved in official controls to identify the causes of abortions, monitor suspected or positive herds, evaluate suspected infections in pets and humans, monitor the spread in wildlife, etc. In this paper, we summarize the presence of C. burnetii over the last five years (2019-2023). Additionally, a detailed overview of C. burnetii infection in wild and domestic animals is provided. Five hundred sixty animals-including cattle; goats; sheep; wild animals, such as deer, boars, wolves, roe deer, owls, and otters; buffalo; dogs; horses; cats; and a donkey-and six human samples were tested by real-time PCR on the transposase gene IS1111 to detect C. burnetii. The MST profile was identified in some of the samples. Outbreaks of C. burnetii occurred in four herds. In one of them, it was possible to follow the outbreak from inception to eradication by evaluating the effect of vaccination on real-time PCR Ct values. A total of 116 animals tested positive for C. burnetii, including 73 goats, 42 sheep, and one bovine. None of the other samples tested positive. The strains for which the ST was performed were identified as ST79, a strain that has been present in the area for more than ten years. The effect of vaccination on the reduction of positive samples and the variation of real-time PCR Ct values was evaluated in strict correlation.

AB  - Ashworthius sidemi is a nematode characteristic for cervids native to the mainland of eastern Asia like particular subspecies of sika deer (Cervus nippon) including Dybowski's sika deer (C. n. hortulorum). With the translocation of so-called 'mainland' sika deer and/or Maral deer (C. canadensis sibiricus) that had previously been kept with Dybowski's sika deer in deer farms in the former Soviet Union, the parasite was transferred to Europe and reported in the 1970s from current Czechia, central Russia and the Ukraine. The fall of the 'Iron Curtain' in the 1990s allowed for the exchange of deer between neighboring Bohemia, Czechia and Bavaria, Germany, which was associated with the introduction of the invasive very pathogenic giant liver fluke, Fascioloides magna, to Bavaria and the establishment of sika deer. Studies on the epidemiology of fascioloidosis prompted the characterization of the overall helminth fauna of red deer from two localities in the border region to Bohemia - Upper Palatinate Forest (13 deer, collected 2011 to 2013) and Bavarian Forest National Park (eight deer, collected 2022) - where F. magna was first confirmed in 2011 and in 2019, respectively. The nematode spectrum was overall characterized by cervid-adapted species with polymorphic ostertagids dominating the abomasal nematode community. Among the 15 species of nematodes recovered from the gastrointestinal tract, however, was the Haemonchus-like A. sidemi which has been recorded for the first time in Germany. Noticeably, A. sidemi was the only nematode that was found in all animals with counts (range, 15 to 765) comparable to the cervid-adapted ostertagid species and made up approximately 25% of the total gastrointestinal nematode burden of the red deer from both areas. In addition to gastrointestinal nematodes, Setaria cervi, F. magna, and Dictyocaulus, Varestrongylus and Elaphostrongylus species infections were recorded. In conclusion, this work shows that A. sidemi established in red deer in Germany and forms a substantial portion of the gastrointestinal nematode burden. Further studies are encouraged to monitor the spread of A. sidemi and to better understand its role in the parasite community of wild ungulates in Europe and the relevance of the infection for both wild and domestic ruminants. To facilitate future research on A. sidemi, a synopsis of references on the worldwide occurrence and host range of the nematode is provided.

AB  - In agriculture, spontaneous field border vegetation offers numerous benefits, such as reducing soil erosion, enhancing carbon sequestration, conserving biodiversity, and supporting biological control. However, the extent of these benefits often depends on the contexts of location and time. As for biological control, field borders can promote natural enemy conservation if the plants therein can provide adequate resources (e.g. shelter, alternative food, microclimate). In the context of location, field borders can be adjacent to areas with varying degrees of agricultural intensification, including fields with annual crops, perennial crops, or forest areas. While many studies have investigated how field borders can influence arthropod communities in adjacent crops, the opposite direction of effect (i.e. how crop areas can influence adjacent field borders) remains an underexplored topic. Therefore, in this three-season study, we selected vegetated field borders next to annual crops, perennial crops, and forest areas, to study their communities of spontaneous plants and arthropods as well as their potential to engender biological control nearby. In general, our results indicate that both plant and arthropod community composition were influenced by the type of adjacent land use and season. Field border vegetation next to areas with higher level of agricultural intensification (i.e. annual or perennial crops) harbored more herbivores, flowers, and natural enemies, although some of these results were season dependent. Field borders adjacent to annual or perennial crop areas promoted stronger biological control of aphids, likely due to complementary food resources (herbivores and floral resources) provided for natural enemies by the plants within those borders. Taken altogether, our results reinforce the importance of preserving spontaneous field border vegetation, especially in areas under intensive agriculture management.Graphical AbstractVegetated field borders adjacent to either annual crop, perennial crop, or forest area were studied to assess its influence on the communities of plant and arthropods as well as their potential to promote biocontrol. Community composition varied with adjacent land use and season, with annual or perennial crop-adjacent borders enhancing aphid control on nearby sentinel plants. Thicker arrows indicate stronger influence.

AB  - The forest understory is often densely covered by dwarf bamboo Sasa spp. in Hokkaido, northern Japan. Dwarf bamboo is an important winter forage for sika deer Cervus nippon, and dwarf bamboo inhibits forest regeneration by preventing seedling establishment. Although percentages of browsed seedlings are a useful index of deer browsing pressure, dwarf bamboo is also expected to affect browsing on seedlings by altering physical accessibility to seedlings. We hypothesized that the relationship between seedling height and browsing incidence depends on the coverage of dwarf bamboo because smaller seedlings were protected by dwarf bamboo. The incidence of browsing was recorded for broad-leaved seedlings >= 0.2 m in height and < 1 cm in diameter at breast height in 19 plots (40-200 m(2) each) located in natural forests. Coverage of dwarf bamboo varied from 3% to 74%, except for one plot where dwarf bamboo was absent. The mean height of the dwarf bamboo in each plot was 0.44-1.17 m. The product of seedling height and coverage of dwarf bamboo was selected as an explanatory variable in the generalized linear mixed model for the incidence of browsing on each seedling. This suggests that smaller seedlings were protected by dwarf bamboo and browsing incidence is low for smaller seedlings within plots with high coverage of dwarf bamboo. This can be an example of associational defense against deer. The probability of browsing incidence was low for seedlings 0.2-0.5 m tall in sites with dense dwarf bamboo, while no significant differences were detected between seedlings 0.5-0.8 m tall and those >= 0.8 m. Even though seedlings under dwarf bamboo cover tend to escape from deer browsing, dwarf bamboo directly affects seedling survival and growth negatively. Therefore, it is necessary to manage both the deer population and dwarf bamboo to enable forest regeneration. The percentages of seedlings with browsing incidence on seedlings >= 0.5 m tall can approximate the browsing level and is useful for management decisions.

AB  - There is a compelling need to develop user-friendly and sensitive techniques to monitor sika deer (Cervus nippon) populations in snowy regions, where initial stages of deer invasion have been observed. In snow, we can easily detect footsteps of terrestrial mammals, which often serve as a useful index of population size. Here, we examined the possibility of identifying tracks with similar hoof prints left by two sympatric ungulates, sika deer and Japanese serow (Capricornis crispus), using gait patterns. We then recorded tracks of free-ranging deer and serows on the snow by following similar to 200-km survey routes in the Tohoku region. We successfully recorded the gait patterns of 27 deer and 34 serows. Our key findings were as follows: 1) the step width of deer tracks (mean and SE, 20.3 +/- 0.7 cm) was substantially narrower than that of serow tracks (26.9 +/- 0.8 cm); 2) step width was less sensitive to body size and ground conditions for both species; and 3) the step width of 22.5 cm became an optimal threshold to maintain a reasonable classification accuracy (> 80%) for both species. Thus, the gait patterns serve as a possible criterion for identifying the tracks of these two ungulates.

AB  - Ecosystems are defined by the community of living organisms and how they interact together and with their environment. Insects and plants are key taxa in terrestrial ecosystems and their network determines the trophic structure of the environment. However, what drives the interactions between plants and insects in modern and fossil ecosystems is not well understood. In this study, we analyzed insect damage richness and frequency in 5000 fossil leaves deposited during the early Miocene at 20?17 Ma along a latitudinal gradient from Europe (two localities in Czech Republic) to Turkey (one locality) in a temperate climate setting. Damage frequency was mainly linked with abiotic factors (temperature, precipitation seasonality) whereas damage richness was mainly linked with biotic factors (plant richness, biome). Univariate analysis of insect damage types consistently sug-gested closer trophic similarity between the Mediterranean and either the one or the other Central European plant assemblage. In contrast, multivariate analysis of all insect damage types indicated closer similarity between the two Central European sites highlighting the importance of biogeographic legacy and geographic closeness to the plant-insect interaction patterns. Our results underscore the high complexity of the herbivory network and call for careful interpretations of plant-insect interaction patterns in palaeoecological studies. Finally, comparing the trophic similarity between different localities using total evidence plots as done in this work might be a promising complementary method in comparative studies of plant-insect interactions.

AB  - The ongoing vegetational change on the Tibetan Plateau, where pastoralism has been the predominant way of life, is of regional and global importance. Although recent influential research suggests that the vegetation on the Tibetan Plateau has been greening, or improving, local yak herders in Nagchu (Tibetan Autonomous Region, China) report that their grassland has deteriorated. To understand this discrepancy, we critically analysed and contrasted remote sensing observations and ethnographic accounts within the framework of valuation studies. We argue that these seemingly contradictory observations are not mutually exclusive because the remote sensing data mainly focuses on the spatial vegetation coverage, whereas herders care about vegetation height and its nutritional quality as yak fodder. Taking into account that these two sets of data evade a direct comparison, valuation studies help to understand in what respect the underlying perspectives and observations-i.e. remote sensing and local experiences-can be understood as social activities in which assessments are made based on different criteria. Our study argues that a pluralistic way of understanding the grassland dynamics helps to understand the complexity of the changing environment.

AB  - High diversity and differential evolution profiles have been observed for DD34E/Tc1 transposons; several families originating from these groups, such as DD34E/ZB, DD34E/SB, DD35E/TR, DD36E/IC, and DD38E/IT, have been well defined. Even though Frisky, Tiang, Tsessebe, and Topi transposons have been identified in Anopheles gambiae, their taxonomic distribution and phylogenetic relationship in nature remain largely unknown. The evolutionary profiles of Frisky, Tiang, Tsessebe, and Topi homology transposons were investigated in the current study. In total, 254 homology transposons of Frisky, Tiang, Hob, Tsessebe, and Topi were obtained in 200 species by data mining. The phylogenetic tree revealed that these transposons were classified into five main clades (Frisky, Tiang, Hob, Tsessebe, and Topi) forming a monophyletic clade with 98% bootstrap support, belonging to the DD34E/Tc1 group, and named as Skipper (SK). SK transposons show a wide distribution in animals; however, differential taxonomic distribution patterns were observed for the subfamilies of Frisky, Tiang, Hob, Tsessebe, and Topi; extensive invasion of Frisky in animals was found, whereas Tiang, Hob, Tsessebe, and Topi were mainly detected in Diptera. SK elements share a similar structural organization and display high sequence identities across subfamilies. Evolutionary dynamics and structural analysis revealed that SKs in some species, such as Bombyx mori, Lordiphosa magnipectinata, Carassius gibelio, Triplophysa dalaica, and Silurus glanis, have recently evolved and present as intact copies, indicating that SKs in these genomes may be active. Together, these observations improve our understanding of the diversity of DD34E/Tc1 transposons and their impacts on genome evolution in animals.

AB  - In the past decades, the African buffalo (Syncerus caffer) population has steadily declined; an estimated reduction of 31.2% over 3 generations has resulted in classifying it as near threatened by the International Union for Conservation of Nature. Therefore, the aim of this work was a preliminary evaluation of the size and number of ovarian follicles and oocyte quality and quantity in African buffaloes in relationship to age, tuberculosis, and pregnancy status to assess feasibility of in vitro embryo production (IVEP) as a tool for conservation and propagation of this species. The study occurred during the winter dry season (Jul-Aug) of 2018 within Huluhluwe-Imfolozi National Park in Kwa-Zulu Natal, South Africa during the routine culling procedures of African buffalo carried out at the park by the provincial authorities as means of disease management and population control. We obtained ovaries from 39 adults and 10 juveniles, and transported them to the field laboratory where we counted follicles, collected oocytes by aspiration and slicing, and classified oocytes according to their morphology. Adult animals had more small and medium follicles compared to juveniles (small: 14.5 +/- 0.1 [SE] vs. 14.0 +/- 0.1; medium: 4.6 +/- 0.7 vs. 2.0 +/- 1.3); however, juvenile animals had more cumulus-oocyte complexes (COCs). Pregnancy and tuberculosis status did not affect COC recovery rate and quality. The oocyte recovery rate is comparable to cattle and higher than in water buffalo (Bubalus bubalis). Therefore, our results suggest that IVEP could be an effective tool for conservation of valuable germplasm in African buffalo. The use of aspiration, using an 18-gauge needle and syringe, followed by slicing the ovary with a scalpel blade increased the recovery of suitable COCs (aspiration = 37.2 +/- 3.02%; aspiration and slicing = 46.1 +/- 3.02%), supporting the use of aspiration and slicing to optimize oocyte collection for conservation of African buffalo.

AB  - Climate change has massive global impacts and affects a wide range of species. Threatened species such as the roan antelope (Hippotragus equinus) are particularly vulnerable to these changes because of their ecological requirements. Attempts to address concerns about the roan's vulnerability have not been well documented in South African protected areas. This study identifies the landscape use and distribution of the roan as well as habitat and forage suitability changes to help inform management decisions for the conservation of roan. We used fine- and broad-scale data from Mokala National Park, South Africa that includes roan occurrence data, vegetation condition indices, vegetation (structure and plant species composition), elevation and temperature differences, and precipitation strata to construct a suitability framework using the Maximum Entropy (Maxent) and Random Forest statistical package. In Mokala National Park, roan occurred in the Schmidtia pappophoroides-Vachellia erioloba sparse woodland, Senegalia mellifera-Vachellia erioloba closed woodland, Senegalia mellifera-Vachellia tortilis open shrubland, Vachellia erioloba-V. tortilis closed woodland and Rhigozum obovatum-Senegalia mellifera open shrubland. The veld (vegetation) condition index (VCI) improved from 2019 (VCI < 50%) to 2021 (VCI > 60%), with the proportion of palatable grass species (Schmidtia pappophoroides and Eragrostis lehmanniana) also increasing. This study identified four key climatic conditions affecting roan distribution, namely annual mean daily temperature range, temperature seasonality, minimum temperatures of the coldest month, and precipitation of the wettest month. These results suggest that the conservation of roan antelope should consider these key variables that affect their survival in preferred habitats and foraging areas in anticipation of changing ecological conditions.

AB  - Mutualisms are prevalent in many ecosystems, yet little is known about how symbioses are affected by ecological pressures. Here, we show delayed recovery for 13 coral-dwelling goby fishes (genus Gobiodon) compared with their host Acropora corals following four consecutive cyclones and heatwaves. While corals became twice as abundant in 3 years postdisturbances, gobies were only half as abundant relative to predisturbances and half of the goby species disappeared. Although gobies primarily occupied one coral species in greater abundance predisturbances, surviving goby species shifted hosts to newly abundant coral species when their previously occupied hosts became rare postdisturbances. As host specialization is key for goby fitness, shifting hosts may have negative fitness consequences for gobies and corals alike and affect their survival in response to environmental changes. Our study is an early sign that mutualistic partners may not recover similarly from multiple disturbances, and that goby host plasticity, while potentially detrimental, may be the only possibility for early recovery.

AB  - As the most widespread large carnivore on the planet, domestic dogs Canis lupus familiaris can pose a major threat to wildlife, even within protected areas (PAs). Growing human presence in PAs, coupled with increasing pet dog ownership underscores the urgency to understand the influence of dogs on wildlife activity and health. This knowledge can mitigate the adverse repercussions of recreation, optimizing PA management. Drawing on five years (2017-2021) of data from 101 camera traps in the San Francisco Bay Area, California, United States, we measured the spatiotemporal responses of puma Puma concolor, bobcat Lynx rufus, coyote Canis latrans, and mule deer Odocoileus hemionus towards domestic dogs. Additionally, using six years (2017-2022) of community science data, we explored the impacts of PA dog policies on puma sightings outside park boundaries. Puma responses provide insights into broader ecological impacts, while analyses of bobcat, coyote, and mule deer offer a comprehensive understanding of species responses to dog-friendly spaces. Because dogs can be perceived as predators or competitors by wildlife, we anticipated shifts in spatial and temporal activity patterns in response to dogs. Wildlife responses included avoidance (bobcat, puma) or spatial overlap (mule deer) for areas with more dogs, and no effect (coyote). Mule deer may benefit from a "human shield" provided by people with dogs, while pumas and bobcats appeared more sensitive, and coyotes more adaptable. Dog policies influenced puma and mule deer temporal activity, with increased nocturnal activity in dog-friendly PAs. Bobcat temporal activity was less variable in dog-friendly PAs and coyote activity was similar between treatments. Outside PAs, puma sightings increased with human disturbance. Our study underscores the trade-offs between recreation and wildlife conservation, emphasizing the need to quantify the ecological impacts of dogs. This understanding is vital for informing conservation strategies and promoting coexistence between dogs, wildlife, and protected environments.

AB  - Biological behaviour-driven self-organized patterns have recently been confirmed to play a key role in ecosystem functioning. Here, we develop a theoretical phase-separation model to describe spatiotemporal self-similar dynamics, which is a consequence of behaviour-driven trophic interactions in short-time scales. Our framework integrates scale-dependent feedback and density-dependent movement into grazing ecosystems. This model derives six types of selective foraging behaviours that trigger pattern formation for top-down grazing ecosystems, and one of which is consistent with existing foraging theories. Self-organized patterns nucleate under moderate grazing intensity and are destroyed by overgrazing, which suggests ecosystem degradation. Theoretical results qualitatively agree with observed grazing ecosystems that display spatial heterogeneities under variable grazing intensity. Our findings potentially provide new insights into self-organized patterns as an indicator of ecosystem transitions under a stressful environment.

AB  - Predictive niche modeling studies suggest significant biodiversity loss under climate change scenarios, indicating that species currently classified as least concern may face extinction risks. Here, we assessed two flagship butterfly species endemic to the Atlantic Forest: Arcas ducalis and Cyanophrys bertha. Both species have previously been listed as regionally threatened, and C. bertha is considered 'Vulnerable' (VU) by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), although both are now classified as 'Least Concern' (LC) by Brazilian government. It remains unclear whether these species are naturally rare or difficult to detect. Assessing the effects of climate change on their conservation status and dispersal potential may help establish more accurate threat categories. This study aimed to evaluate the effects of climate change under two scenarios (SSP245, optimistic; SSP585, pessimistic) for two future periods. The results indicate that A. ducalis may experience a range reduction of over 46%, with a decline of more than 40% in interaction with one of its host plants under the pessimistic scenario. Conversely, C. bertha could be classified as 'Near Threatened' (NT) due to a range reduction of over 66% and a decrease of more than 89% in interaction with one of its host plants in the same scenario. Representation within Conservation Units (CUs) suggests that both species will maintain adequate range coverage only under current conditions, with significantly reduced coverage in future scenarios. Given these findings, stronger measures, such as incentives for establishing and maintaining protected areas, are essential for conservation of these flagship species.

AB  - Wind-induced turbulence can strongly impact ecological processes in shallow lake ecosystems. The creation of shelter against wind can be expected to affect both primary producers and herbivores in aquatic food webs. Shelter may benefit particular primary producers more than others by changing relative resource availabilities for different primary producers. Herbivore community compositions may be affected either directly or indirectly as a consequence of changes in their food quantity and quality that, in turn, may affect the transfer efficiency between primary producers and herbivores. A reduction in trophic transfer efficiency resulting from wind-induced turbulence potentially can lead to declines of higher trophic levels, but is generally understudied. Here, we focus on the impact of wind on aquatic primary producers and trophic transfer efficiency. We hypothesised that reducing wind-induced turbulence will stimulate higher trophic production in shallow lakes. However, the multitude of impacts of wind-induced turbulence on aquatic food webs make it challenging to predict the direction of change when creating sheltered conditions. We tested our hypothesis in the shallow waters of a newly constructed archipelago named Marker Wadden in lake Markermeer in the Netherlands. Lake Markermeer has experienced declining numbers of birds and fish. These declines have been related to wind-induced sediment resuspension that potentially limits primary production and trophic transfer efficiency. Marker Wadden is a large-scale restoration project that aims to add sheltered and heterogeneous habitat to the otherwise mostly homogeneous lake, thus targeting the potential problems associated with wind-induced turbulence. We executed a 2-month manipulative field mesocosm experiment in the shallow waters of Marker Wadden to study the effect of reduced wind-induced turbulence (i.e., shelter) on aquatic food webs. Specifically, we studied the effects on primary producers, trophic transfer efficiency between phytoplankton and zooplankton (using zooplankton biomass divided by phytoplankton Chl a as a proxy), and benthic fauna. The experiment consisted of three treatments: no shelter, shelter without macrophytes and shelter with submerged macrophytes (Myriophyllum spicatum) present at the start of the experiment. Our results clearly showed that under unsheltered conditions phytoplankton was the dominant primary producer, whereas in sheltered conditions submerged macrophytes became dominant. Interestingly, submerged macrophytes appeared rapidly in the sheltered treatment where first no macrophytes were visibly present; hence, at the end of the experiment, there was little difference among the sheltered treatments with and without initial presence of submerged macrophytes. Despite that phytoplankton concentrations were 23-fold higher under the unsheltered conditions, this did not result in higher zooplankton biomass. This can be explained by a five-fold greater trophic transfer efficiency between phytoplankton and zooplankton under the sheltered conditions. Furthermore, under the sheltered conditions the Gastropoda density reached 746 individuals m(-2), whereas no Gastropoda were found under the no shelter treatment.
   These findings indicate that for shallow lakes that are negatively affected by wind-induced turbulence, measures aimed at ameliorating this stressor can be effective in facilitating submerged macrophyte recovery, increasing Gastropoda densities and restoring trophic transfer efficiency between phytoplankton and zooplankton. Ultimately, this may support higher trophic levels such as fish and water birds by increasing their food availability in shallow lake ecosystems.

AB  - Conservation triage is an evolving strategy designed to allocate limited resources to address pressures that require urgent actions due to their consequences on biodiversity and essential ecosystem services for human well-being. This perspective proposes a structured, ethical and inclusive conservation triage-based framework for efficiently addressing socio-ecological requirements in biodiversity conservation, leveraging limited resources. Based on three main pillars-conservation planning, policy and governance and co-production of knowledge-our goal is to promote conservation triage as a pragmatic and comprehensive approach.<br /> We explore the application of conservation triage principles in Chile, following the recent establishment of the Conservation and Human Well-being programme, a science-based initiative promoting the conservation of Chile's unique biodiversity and informing the development of conservation policies.<br /> Synthesis and applications. This perspective offers guidance to scientists and practitioners on how to prioritize conservation efforts while taking resource constraints into account when navigating conservation triage. It emphasizes how crucial it is to integrate ethical issues, fostering a decision-making process enriched by diverse perspectives and collaborative knowledge co-production. Through the alignment of strategic resource allocation with socio-ecological aspects, this approach offers insights for developing equitable and well-balanced conservation outcomes that are transferable to other geographical and environmental settings.

AB  - Simple Summary The Sahara desert is home to the greatest diversity of ungulates of all deserts. In this harsh environment, the endangered Cuvier's gazelle finds at the southernmost limit of its distribution a key population for its survival. A better understanding of the feeding ecology of the species may improve our understanding of the biological requirements for implementing conservation measures. In this study, we analysed the diet and feeding strategy of a desert population by combining different approaches such as faecal sampling, recording indirect signs of feeding, and direct observations of individuals. Our results revealed that Cuvier's gazelles displayed a feeding behaviour similar to that of browsing ruminants, with acacias as key species for the survival of the species in the harsh environment of the Sahara. Consequently, the current increasing grazing pressure in remote areas and on acacias calls for measures to mitigate this emerging and possibly worsening impact due to imminent climate change. Knowledge of the feeding ecology of ungulates in arid biomes offers an interesting model for understanding the drought resistance of large desert-adapted herbivores, a crucial issue in the face of increasing desertification due to climate change. To assess the feeding ecology of the endangered Cuvier's gazelle (Gazella cuvieri) in the Sahara desert, we used a multi-method approach combining faecal samples, direct observations, and the recording of indirect signs of feeding. We hypothesised that browser behaviour is the best foraging strategy for species living in hyper-arid environments, mainly due to long periods without grazing opportunities. Complementarily, we explored the effects of the main environmental descriptors (rainfalls and NDVI) on feeding patterns and diet quality. We found that Cuvier's diets are based mainly on acacias (Vachellia tortilis, V. flava) and occasionally on the annual forb Anastatica hierochuntica. In total, eighteen species (five trees, nine shrubs, three herbs, and one grass) belonging to fifteen families were recorded. Our result confirmed the browsers' characteristic of this species, reaffirming its ability to settle in a hostile environment. Acacias stand out as key species consumed at the southernmost limit of their range; hence, future conservation plans and strategies should take this into account for the survival of Cuvier's gazelle in desert environments.

AB  - Tree carbon allocation is a dynamic process that depends on the tree's environment, but we know relatively little about how biotic interactions influence these dynamics. In central Kenya, the loss of vertebrate herbivores and the savanna's invasion by the ant Pheidole megacephala are disrupting mutualisms between the foundational tree Acacia (Vachellia) drepanolobium and its native ant defenders. Here, we piloted a (13)Carbon (C) pulse-labeling method to investigate the influence of these biotic interactions on C allocation to ant partners by adult trees in situ. Trees withstood experimental conditions and took up sufficient labeled (CO2)-C-13 for C-13 to be detected in various C sinks, including ant mutualists. The d(13)C in ants collected shortly after labeling suggested that trees exposed to herbivores allocated relatively more newly assimilated C to native ant defenders. Our results demonstrate the viability of the pulse-labeling method and suggest that C allocation to ant partners depends on the biotic context of the tree, but further investigation with replication is needed to characterize such differences in relation to invasion and herbivore loss.

AB  - The larvae of speckled emperor moths (Gynanisa maja) are important plant defoliators in savanna ecosystems of southern Africa and a valuable food resource for indigenous communities. Population explosions of G. maja larvae can negatively impact an area's primary productivity thereby altering herbivory patterns and associated ecosystem processes. Harvests of the larvae enhance socio-economic livelihoods of local people by providing a source of protein and improving household incomes. We report on a population outbreak of G. maja larvae that occurred in south-eastern Zimbabwe between December 2022 and January 2023 and discuss the ecological and social significance of the event. A total biomass weight of 5811 tons of G. maja larvae was estimated over the area of the outbreak and extensive defoliation was recorded in Colophospermum mopane trees. We could not associate the outbreak with any obvious environmental conditions and speculate that it may have been caused by subtle triggers that are not easily identified.

AB  - Most extinctions worldwide have occurred on islands, primarily due to interactions with exotic species, but rarely due to interactions among endemic species. This potential exists on two of the California Channel Islands, Santa Cruz and Santa Rosa, as endemic island spotted skunks (Spilogale gracilis amphiala) appear to have rapidly declined to rarity, possibly due to interference competition with endemic island foxes (Urocyon littoralis). Niche partitioning is expected in response to interference competition; hence, it is surprising that skunks and foxes show extensive overlap in macrohabitat use and circadian activity. However, the role of microhabitat associations and fine-scale temporal activity in facilitating coexistence of the two species has not been explored. We evaluated microhabitat associations of island spotted skunks and island foxes across both islands using data from live traps and wildlife cameras collected during 2015-2017, and we analyzed fine-scale temporal activity using camera data from 2016 and 2017. On both islands, skunks had a positive response to ground-level cover provided by rugged topography or woody vegetation such as shrubs or trees, whereas foxes had a weak or negative response, suggesting partitioning of these microhabitat characteristics. Additionally, on both islands the peak in timing of skunk activity offset the peak for foxes, which implies that skunks use fine-scale adjustments in activity to avoid foxes. Past grazing by exotic herbivores likely reduced habitat refuges for skunks; however, as vegetation on both islands recovers, regrowth of shrubs and trees may provide cover that will improve prospects for coexistence of island spotted skunks and island foxes.

AB  - The Port-Cros National Park (PCNP), established in 1963, was one of the earliest terrestrial and marine parks in the Mediterranean Sea. From 2012, it engaged in a major redefinition and extension of its territory (N-PCNP-New Port-Cros National Park). This case is particularly interesting insofar as the protected area has been competently and efficiently managed since its creation, and protection and management measures have been strictly implemented: in the Mediterranean, the PCNP has often been considered as a benchmark. Here, we critically analyse almost 60 years of the management of the biodiversity and the human uses, with their share of successes and failures, certain operations which are today regarded as errors, and a doctrine today of a priori non-interventionism, in contrast to the doctrine in vogue in the early years. Of particular interest is the change in outlook with regard to actions favouring flagship species, such as building a tower for bats, setting up artificial nests for seabirds, and constructing an artificial reef at sea. The question of the natural arrival of the wild boar, a native species, and the hostility of the public and some species-centred scientists, is particularly instructive. We analyse these changes in the light of the ongoing trends in concepts in ecology and nature conservation, and the shift from a species-centred to an ecosystem-centred approach. It is worth emphasizing that a critical review of almost 60 years of management is a very rare exercise in a national park anywhere in the world.

AB  - Terrestrial invertebrates are highly important for the decomposition of dung from large mammals. Mammal dung has been present in many of Earth's ecosystems for millions of years, enabling the evolution of a broad diversity of dung-associated invertebrates that process various components of the dung. Today, large herbivorous mammals are increasingly introduced to ecosystems with the aim of restoring the ecological functions formerly provided by their extinct counterparts. However, we still know little about the ecosystem functions and nutrient flows in these rewilded ecosystems, including the dynamics of dung decomposition. In fact, the succession of insect communities in dung is an area of limited research attention also outside a rewilding context. In this study, we use environmental DNA metabarcoding of dung from rewilded Galloway cattle in an experimental set-up to investigate invertebrate communities and functional dynamics over a time span of 53 days, starting from the time of deposition. We find a strong signal of successional change in community composition, including for the species that are directly dependent on dung as a resource. While several of these species were detected consistently across the sampling period, others appeared confined to either early or late successional stages. We believe that this is indicative of evolutionary adaptation to a highly dynamic resource, with species showing niche partitioning on a temporal scale. However, our results show consistently high species diversity within the functional groups that are directly dependent on dung. Our findings of such redundancy suggest functional stability of the dung-associated invertebrate community, with several species ready to fill vacant niches if other species disappear. Importantly, this might also buffer the ecosystem functions related to dung decomposition against environmental change. Interestingly, alpha diversity peaked after approximately 20-25 days in both meadow and pasture habitats, and did not decrease substantially during the experimental period, probably due to preservation of eDNA in the dung after the disappearance of visiting invertebrates, and from detection of tissue remains and cryptic life stages.

AB  - Persicaria perfoliata (Mile-a-Minute Weed), an invasive vine, forms monocultural patches of various sizes within infested landscapes among patches also containing other plants. We compared the species composition of P. perfoliata-dominated patches and adjacent nondominated patches in 2 topographically homogeneous sites using 20 paired plots, nonmetric multidimensional scaling, multi-response permutation procedure, and indicator species analyses. Richness and diversity were lower in the P. perfoliata-dominated patches but both patch types had uncommon native plants present. The patch types differed significantly in composition, and the nondominated patches were dominated by another nonnative invader, Microstegium vimineum (Japanese Stiltgrass), or a native weed, Ambrosia artemisiifolia (Common Ragweed). Documenting potentially interacting native and exotic species within an invaded landscape will help predict likely restoration success in response to targeted nonnative-invasive plant removal.

AB  - Natural forests present complex environments due to abiotic and biotic heterogeneity. While studies on volatile organic compounds (VOCs) mediated plant-plant communication have been conducted in controlled environments such as laboratories, research in natural forests remains scarce. To determine whether beech (Fagus crenata) exhibits plant-plant communication in natural forests, we investigated plant hormones and leaf damage as defense responses considering wind direction, forest stand structure and genetic relatedness. Our findings indicated that trees closer to the VOCs source accumulated more salicylic acid than those farther away downwind, resulting in less damage from pathogens and herbivores. Conversely, there was no distance-dependent change in hormone levels or leaf damage upwind. Additionally, genetic relatedness between the VOC source tree and surrounding trees did not influence the levels of plant hormones or leaf damage. Thus, our results suggested that beech exhibits plant-plant communication in natural forests influenced by abiotic and biotic heterogeneity of forest ecosystems.

AB  - Global evidence of phase shifts to alternate community types is of particular concern because these new com-munities can provide fundamentally different and often novel ecosystem functions and services compared to the original community. Shifts of a diverse range of marine communities to dominance by green macroalgal mats have occurred worldwide, making it critical to understand their emerging functions and roles. We observed green algal mat on two reefs in the Eastern Tropical Pacific, with one persisting for >10 years on a reef with stable herbivore populations and no known sources of anthropogenic nutrients. These mats supported a more speciose macroalgal community with fewer taxa present in the adjacent coral community and facilitated growth of an associated understory macroalgal species by reducing herbivory pressure and possibly enhancing nutrient supplies within the mat community state. These results demonstrate a weakening in the processes controlling reef community structure as a result of the shift in composition associated with the macroalgal mat, creating positive feedback supporting mat persistence. These novel ecosystem functions generated by this alternate community state illustrate the importance of further research on community shifts, which will become increasingly common in the Anthropocene.

AB  - Fire disturbance is an integral part of many ecosystems. However, some taxa may not be resilient to the increasing size, intensity, and frequency of fire events due to climate change. We investigated how terrestrial invertebrate Ordinal-level community structure and the abundance of six Orders (Acarina, Araneae, Coleoptera, Collembola, Diptera, Hymenoptera: Formicidae) changed following three natural fire events over two decades (2007-2022) in Kangaroo Island and mainland South Australia. We collected invertebrates using two methods (pitfall traps and sweep nets) at four sites (two burnt and two unburnt) every 6 months, before and after three fire events (2007, 2019, 2021). Ordinal-level community structure generally showed signs of recovery nearing pre-fire conditions within 20-22 months post-fire. The pitfall samples showed increased abundance in Coleoptera, Diptera and Hymenoptera (Formicidae) following fire, and no change in Acarina abundance. The sweep net samples showed no recovery to pre-fire conditions on mainland South Australia, but recovery to baseline after 20-22 months on Kangaroo Island. There were significant shifts in invertebrate community structure across time-since-fire with a return to pre-fire conditions at burnt sites after 20-22 months. These findings demonstrate the apparent ordinal-level resilience of invertebrates in South Australian eucalypt woodlands, particularly of ground-dwelling species, but also point to Order specific differences that warrant future study.

AB  - Nowadays, gathering information about tree health conditions in cities is necessary. Trees are essential in regulating urban microclimate and mitigating the urban heat island effect. Therefore, their health status should be crucial in urban vegetation monitoring. The growing number of new cameras, sensors and research methods allows for a broader application of thermal data in remote sensing vegetation studies. This research aimed to evaluate whether it is possible to use thermal infrared data to assess the health condition of selected species of deciduous trees in an urban environment. More specifically, the data must have a 3.6-4.9 mu m spectral range, obtained during the day and the night. For this purpose, research was carried out in the city center of Warsaw (Poland) in 2020. During the airborne data acquisition, thermal data, laser scanning and RGB images were collected. Synchronously with airborne data, 617 ground references were obtained in different health condition classes (healthy, slightly poor condition, poor condition and dying) for five tree species: Acer platanoides, Acer pseudoplatanus, Aesculus hippocastanum, Tilia cordata and Tilia x euchlora. The results were as follows: (i) healthy trees were cooler than trees in poor condition and dying both during the daytime and nighttime; (ii) the difference in the canopy temperatures between healthy and dying trees was 1.06 degrees C of mean value on the nighttime data and 3.28 degrees C of mean value on the daytime data; (iii) all condition classes significantly differ from each other on daytime thermal data. The aerial thermal data can be considered a new alternative to hyperspectral data. Thermal sensing represents another method of assessing the health condition of trees in an urban environment especially data obtained during the day, which can differentiate condition classes better than data obtained at night. The method based on thermal infrared and laser scanning data fusion could be a quick and efficient solution for identifying trees in poor health.

AB  - Understanding how species respond to different anthropogenic pressures is essential for conservation planning. The archaeological record has great potential to inform extinction risk assessment by providing evidence on past human-caused biodiversity loss, but identifying specific drivers of past declines from environmental archives has proved challenging. We used 17 684 Holocene zooarchaeological records for 15 European large mammal species together with data on past environmental conditions and anthropogenic activities across Europe, to assess the ability of environmental archives to determine the relative importance of different human pressures in shaping faunal distributions through time. Site occupancy probability showed differing significant relationships with environmental covariates for all species, and nine species also showed significant relationships with anthropogenic covariates (human population density, % cropland, % grazing land). Across-species differences in negative relationships with covariates provide ecological insights for understanding extinction dynamics: some mammals (red deer, aurochs, wolf, wildcat, lynx, pine marten and beech marten) were more vulnerable to past human-environmental interactions, and differing single and synergistic anthropogenic factors influenced likelihood of past occurrence across species. Our results provide new evidence for pre-industrial population fragmentation and depletion in European mammals, and demonstrate the usefulness of historical baselines for understanding species' varying long-term sensitivity to multiple threats.

AB  - Approximately 2600 km of bison and elk trails have been mapped in West Virginia using historical records, including county histories and travelers' accounts with published dates between 1876 and 1977. Most points of interest associated with these trails document European bison or elk hunting events. We explore some potential uses of the digital trails data and discuss the limitations of the data and need for further refinements. This map of major bison trails (available for download at https://doi.org/10.2737/RDS-2021-0055) is an important resource for telling a more complete story of the history of forests and woodlands of West Virginia.

AB  - This work identified the presence of AQPs in frozen-thawed sperm of wild ruminants and assessed the influence of the interaction between photoperiod and thyroxine on AQP expression, and on testosterone secretion. Thyroxine and melatonin were administered to ibexes. In a second experiment, performed in mouflons, circulating thyroxine was reduced via treatment with propylthiouracil (PTU), and an artificial long day (LD) photoperiod established. In the ibexes, the melatonin treatment increased the blood plasma testosterone concentration, reduced the cryoresistance ratio (CR) for sperm viability and the presence of an intact acrosome, and increased the percentage of sperm with AQP7 in the acrosome and of AQP3 and AQP10 in the midpiece. In the mouflons, neither the PTU treatment, the LD, nor the combination of both affected the CR of any sperm variable. The percentage of sperm with AQP3 increased in the post-acrosome region but decreased in the tail in the LD+PTU group. The percentage of sperm with AQP10 in the principal piece and endpiece was lower in the PTU+LD group than in the control and LD groups. The influence of photoperiod/melatonin on AQP expression might be indirectly exerted through changes in the testosterone concentration, and thus ultimately affect sperm cryoresistance.

AB  - Simple Summary Alpine musk deer, red serow, and white-lipped deer coexist in the Nyenchen Tanglha Mountains of Tibet. We aimed to understand the mechanisms of their coexistence by studying their dietary preferences using DNA barcoding. All of the species exhibited broad dietary ranges with distinct food preferences. Furthermore, our findings revealed genus-level dietary specializations and the mechanisms facilitating their coexistence. The results of this study provide valuable insights for the development and implementation of effective conservation strategies and management measures in the local area.Abstract Wild ungulates play crucial roles in maintaining the structure and function of local ecosystems. The alpine musk deer (Moschus chrysogaste), white-lipped deer (Przewalskium albirostris), and red serow (Capricornis rubidus) are widely distributed throughout the Nyenchen Tanglha Mountains of Tibet. However, research on the mechanisms underlying their coexistence in the same habitat remains lacking. This study aimed to investigate the mechanisms underlying the coexistence of these species based on their dietary preferences through DNA barcoding using the fecal samples of these animals collected from the study area. These species consume a wide variety of food types. Alpine musk deer, white-lipped deer, and red serow consume plants belonging to 74 families and 114 genera, 62 families and 122 genera, and 63 families and 113 genera, respectively. Furthermore, significant differences were observed in the nutritional ecological niche among these species, primarily manifested in the differentiation of food types and selection of food at the genus level. Owing to differences in social behavior, body size, and habitat selection, these three species further expand their differentiation in resource selection, thereby making more efficient use of environmental resources. Our findings indicate these factors are the primary reasons for the stable coexistence of these species.

AB  - We studied diets of feral cats (Felis catus), dingoes (Canis familiaris) and red foxes (Vulpes vulpes) in desert environments in north-eastern South Australia by analysing prey remains in opportunistically-collected scats. Four major landscapes were sampled (Simpson Desert, Sturt Stony Desert, Strzelecki Desert ? Cooper Creek and Diamantina River) which yielded 238 cat scats, 298 dingo scats and ten fox scats. There was some overlap in prey eaten by cats and dingoes, but their diets were significantly different because cats typically ate small prey such as small mammals, small lizards and birds, while dingoes ate larger prey like domestic cattle, kangaroos and large reptiles. The few fox scats collected suggested fox diets were more similar to cat than dingo diets. Scat composition also differed significantly between landscapes irrespective of predator, with landscapes differing both in diversity and relative abundances of prey consumed. We detected several species in scats that are threatened with extinction either nationally (dusky hopping mouse, Notomys fuscus, and crest-tailed mulgara, Dasycercus cristicauda) or regionally (desert mouse, Pseudomys desertor, and long-haired rat, Rattus villosissimus), adding valuable knowledge to the distribution of these mammals and demonstrating the value of predator scat analyses in mammal surveys of Australian deserts.

AB  - The proliferation of pest and invasive marine macroalgae threatens coastal ecosystems, with biotic interactions, including direct effects such as grazing and indirect effects such as the trophic cascades, where one species indirectly affects another through its interactions with a third species, play a critical role in determining the resistance of local communities to these invasions. This study examines the foraging behaviour and preference of native fish communities toward native ( Halopteris scoparia, , Sargassum vulgare) ) and non-indigenous ( Asparagopsis taxiformis) ) macroalgae using the Remote Video Foraging System (RVFS). Fifty-four weedpops were deployed across three locations to present these macroalgae, while associated epifaunal assemblages were also collected. Video analysis revealed that four common fish species displayed preference towards native macroalgae, possibly due to by the presence of zoobenthos rather than herbivory. This observation suggests that these fish species identified the macroalgae as a habitat that harboured their preferred food items. In contrast, A. taxiformis was consistently avoided, suggesting limited integration into the local food web. Site-specific variations in fishmacroalgae interactions and epifaunal diversity highlighted the complexity of these dynamics. This study contributes to understanding of the ecological implications of invasive macroalgae and supports the use of RVFS as a tool for assessing local biotic resistance against non-indigenous species in coastal ecosystems globally.

AB  - Unravelling how biodiversity is maintained despite species competition for shared resources has been a central question in community ecology, and is gaining relevance amidst the current biodiversity crisis. Yet, we have still a poor understanding of the mechanisms that regulate species coexistence and shape the structure of assemblages in highly competitive environments such as carrion pulsed resources. Here, we study how large vertebrates coexist in scavenger assemblages by adapting their diel activity at large ungulate carcasses in NW Spain. We used camera traps to record vertebrate scavengers consuming 34 carcasses of livestock and hunted wild ungulates, which allowed us to assess also differences regarding carcass origin. To evaluate tem-poral resource partition among species, we estimated the overlap of diel activity patterns and the mean times of each scavenger at carcasses. We recorded 16 species of scavengers, 7 mammals and 9 birds, and found similar richness at both types of car-casses. Birds and mammals showed contrasting diel activity patterns, with birds using carcasses during daytime (mean= 11:38 h) and mammals mostly at night (23:09 h). The unimodal activity patterns of scavengers showed asynchronous peaks among species. Subordinate species modified their activity patterns at carcasses used by apex species to reduce temporal overlap. Also, diel activity patterns of vultures closely followed those of corvids, suggesting facilitation processes in which corvids would enhance carcass detection by vultures. Two mammal species (12.5%) increased nocturnality at carcasses of hunted ungu-lates, which could be a response to human disturbance. Our results suggest that both temporal segregation and coupling mediate the coexistence of large vertebrates at carcasses. These mechanisms might lead to richer scavenger assemblages and thereby more efficient ones in driving critical ecosystem functions related to carrion consumption, such as energy and nutrient recycling and biodiversity maintenance.

AB  - In heterogeneous landscapes, resource selection constitutes a crucial link between landscape and population-level processes such as density. We conducted a non-invasive genetic study of white-tailed deer in southern Finland in 2016 and 2017 using fecal DNA samples to understand factors influencing white-tailed deer density and space use in late summer prior to the hunting season. We estimated deer density as a function of landcover types using a spatial capture-recapture (SCR) model with individual identities established using microsatellite markers. The study revealed second-order habitat selection with highest deer densities in fields and mixed forest, and third-order habitat selection (detection probability) for transitional woodlands (clear-cuts) and closeness to fields. Including landscape heterogeneity improved model fit and increased inferred total density compared with models assuming a homogenous landscape. Our findings underline the importance of including habitat covariates when estimating density and exemplifies that resource selection can be studied using non-invasive methods.

AB  - In this study, we described and compared the diet, monthly feeding intensity, and condition of west coast steenbras (Lithognathus aureti) and silver kob (Argyrosomus inodorus) caught at a unique habitat in the northern Benguela. Stomach contents of 179 west coast steenbras and 114 silver kob caught from October 2020 to September 2022 were investigated. The peak in feeding intensity of west coast steenbras appeared to be opportunistic during winter and summer periods depending on food availability. The fish condition, however, peaked at the beginning (October) and at the end (April) of the austral summer spawning period, with the hepatosomatic index (HSI) at 1.5% and the condition factor (CF) at 0.022%. Seven prey taxa were found in the diet of west coast steenbras (bivalves, bony fishes, other mollusks, algae, crustaceans, cnidaria, and polychaetas) and six taxa in the diet of silver kob (bivalves, crustaceans, bony fishes, algae, starfish, and zooplankton), indicating generalist feeding behavior in both the species. The bivalves were the most important prey items in the diet of west coast steenbras (95.9% index of relative importance [IRI]). The most important prey items in the diet of silver kob were crustaceans (83.1% IRI) and bony fishes (16.0% IRI). Crustaceans were most important in the diet of small-to-medium-sized silver kob, whereas bony fishes were most important in the diet of larger silver kob (>75 cm), with significant differences of IRI% by size class. Schoener's index of niche overlap indicated a relatively low overall niche overlap (0.11) between west coast steenbras and silver kob. This allows them to coexist as their feeding habits allow them to occupy unique niches in the coastal reef and sandy habitat and reduce competition for resources.

AB  - Extensive agricultural development in the United States over the last century and subsequent restoration efforts through the Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) have led to many wildlife species occupying landscapes comprising a mix of natural and developed cover types. Understanding how species like mule deer (Odocoileus hemionus) move through and select resources in those landscapes is important for effectively managing populations and habitat. We examined seasonal resource selection, migration, and survival of female mule deer in the Columbia Plateau Ecoregion of southeastern Washington, USA, which is dominated by row-crop agriculture. We acquired global positioning system locations at 4-hour intervals from 57 adult females during 2018-2022. We used Migration Mapper 3.0 to detect migration, resource selection functions to evaluate resource selection, and Cox proportional hazards to quantify survival. Thirty percent of deer migrated for an average distance of 30 km each year. Residents and migrants had the same annual survival of 0.86 (SE = 0.03), similar to survival of adult female mule deer across their range. When selecting home ranges within the study area in summer and winter, CRP and grassland were the highest-ranked cover types, and selection for cereal agriculture and fallow fields was low to moderate. Within their home ranges, deer selected shrublands (including CRP) followed by tree-covered areas in summer. Cereal agriculture and fallow fields ranked lowest in summer, whereas grasslands and agriculture ranked highest in winter. Survival rates of residents and migrants were not related to their use of CRP or agriculture cover types. Mule deer used different components of the landscape mosaic seasonally, selecting vertical cover during summer fawn rearing and areas with young wheat and broad-leaved forbs during winter. Regardless of season and scale, intact (grassland and shrubland) or restored (CRP) cover types were most selected, demonstrating the importance of increasing both CRP and native cover for deer in agricultural landscapes.

AB  - Sagebrush-steppe restoration has long been seen as a wicked problem-each case has multifaceted problems with no universal solutions-and thus managers have had to adopt adaptive management techniques to meet ever-changing landscape demands. In this study, we characterize the efficacy of an adaptive management plan in a severely degraded sagebrush-steppe winter range habitat for mule deer for 8 yr by monitoring the plant community. During this time, managers have actively managed juniper encroachment through felling and responded to a 2014 wildfire by applying herbicide and seeding for native and forage vegetation. We found that the adaptive management practices reduced annual invasive grasses by about half post fire and nearly doubled preferred herbaceous plants' cover and biomass. However, these successes were only recorded in plots that received repeated treatments, whereas in plots that only received a single treatment post fire, invasive annual grasses returned to prefire cover. Despite these successes in recovering desired herbaceous composition, shrub regeneration was nearly nonexistent during the study period despite repeated attempts to seed.(c) 2023 The Society for Range Management.

AB  - Rice-fish co-culture system has a history of more than 2,000 years in Asia and has been recognized as one of FAO's Globally Important Agricultural Heritage Systems (GIAHS). To date, few studies have explored rice-fish co-culture effects on the relationship between predator-prey aggregations and associated tri-trophic cascades of predatory spiders, insect herbivores and rice. Indeed, predators have been shown to increase prey spatial aggregation but it is still not clear how fish (tertiary consumers) affect aggregations and interactions of their prey on multiple trophic levels (i.e. predatory spiders and rice insect herbivores). Here, we conducted a 2-year experiment to measure the abundance and distribution of herbivores (leafrollers, stemborers and planthoppers) and their predators (spiders) along with rice yield in rice-fish co-culture versus monoculture-rice (fish free) systems in eastern China. We analysed spatial aggregations of herbivores and predators using geostatistics and used correlations to examine tri-trophic interactions. Results showed that co-culture enhanced predatory spider and herbivore spatial aggregations, which in turn increased biocontrol of herbivores by predators, decreased herbivore damage and increased rice productivity. Synthesis and applications. Fish presence increased spatial aggregation of two different trophic levels, which enhanced a tri-trophic cascade of predatory spiders, insect herbivores and rice in co-culture systems. Our approach linking spatial aggregations of herbivores and predators with trophic cascades can be applied to study trophic interactions in other ecosystems. Incorporating fish into monoculture paddy fields can increase both natural pest control by predatory spiders and crop productivity via aggregation, and thus increase multiple ecosystem services.

AB  - Catenas are undulating hillslopes on a granite geology characterised by different soil types that create an environmental gradient from crest to bottom. The main aim was to determine mammal species (>mongoose) present on one catenal slope and its waterholes and group them by feeding guild and body size. Species richness was highest at waterholes (21 species), followed by midslope (19) and sodic patch (16) on the catena. Small differences observed in species presence between zones and waterholes and between survey periods were not significant (p = 0.5267 and p = 0.9139). In total, 33 species were observed with camera traps: 18 herbivore species, 10 carnivores, two insectivores and three omnivores. Eight small mammal species, two dwarf antelopes, 11 medium, six large and six mega-sized mammals were observed. Some species might not have been recorded because of drought, seasonal movement or because they travelled outside the view of cameras. Mammal presence is determined by food availability and accessibility, space, competition, distance to water, habitat preferences, predators, body size, social behaviour, bound to territories, etc. The variety in body size and feeding guilds possibly indicates a functioning catenal ecosystem. This knowledge can be beneficial in monitoring and conservation of species in the park.

AB  - How seedling mortality and browsing affects species composition of regenerating forests has been mostly studied on a small scale. Yet, large-scale analyses based on extensive data are essential for robust prediction of species composition in young forests. In this study, we used a dataset from a national inventory of young forests (1-4 metres in height) to investigate the species composition of young forests across Sweden. We found that most of the regenerated forest area (almost 90%) was planted with Norway spruce (southern Sweden) and Scots pine (northern Sweden). Regeneration of Norway spruce was generally relatively successful but as a consequence of seedling mortality and browsing, almost 40% of the area regenerated with Scots pine will probably not develop into pine-dominated stands. Thus, low survival of Scots pine seedlings and trees can profoundly change the trajectory of species composition of the young forest from what was originally intended, and a large proportion of the young stands may develop into mixtures of conifers and broadleaves. While such mixtures may benefit certain biodiversity and ecosystem services, a loss of Scots pine dominated stands may also have adverse impacts on the economic returns as well as pine-dependent biodiversity and recreational values.

AB  - We revisit the nature and extent of trophic cascades and quaking aspen (Populus tremuloides) recovery in the northern range of Yellowstone National Park, where studies have reported on Rocky Mountain elk (Cervus canadensis) browsing and young aspen heights following the 1995-96 reintroduction of gray wolves (Canis lupus). A recent study by Brice et al. (2021) expressed concerns about methodologies employed in earlier aspen studies and that results from those studies exaggerated the extent to which a trophic cascade has benefitted aspen, concerns such as: (a) the selection of aspen stands, (b) young aspen sampling and measurements within stands, (c) the upper browse level of elk, (d) cause of increased young aspen height growth, (e) interpretation of browsing and height data, and others. We individually address these concerns and conclude that earlier aspen studies have provided important insights regarding the recovery of aspen that is underway in northern Yellowstone and that they have not exaggerated the ongoing recovery. We found that Brice et al. (2021) misinterpreted or misrepresented various aspects of those earlier studies, while failing to address potential biases and shortcomings of their own 2007-2017 study, including; sampling aspen stands from only a portion of the park's northern range, not randomly selecting aspen stands across their study area, but only within identified treatments, varying sampling density (stands/km(2)) by more than an order of magnitude between treatments, and not sampling all stands in most years. Regardless of the research methodologies employed in various aspen studies, they have consistently shown that decreased browsing has resulted in greater young plant heights in the park's northern range, results consistent with an ongoing trophic cascade.

AB  - Long-term livestock grazing has shaped landscapes, biodiversity, societies, cultures, and economies in the North Atlantic over time. However, overgrazing has become a major environmental sustainability challenge for this region, covering the Faroe Islands, Greenland, Iceland, Norway, and Scotland. The objective of this study was to elicit narratives and spatial patterns of local people's management preferences for sheep grazing in the Faroe Islands through a socio-cultural lens. We collected data via a Public Participation Geographic Information Systems (PPGIS) survey with an open question about hopes and concerns for sheep management in the Faroe Islands and a mapping exercise for expressing spatial preferences for sheep management. Four distinct narratives emerged from a qualitative analysis of responses to the open question (n = 184): (1) Sustainable sheep management, (2) Nature without sheep, (3) Sheep as part of Faroese culture, and (4) Sheep as nuisance. Visual inspection of narrative-specific maps with locations where either no or fewer sheep were preferred indicated that sheep management is not simply a 'sheep vs. no sheep' issue but embedded in a more nuanced consideration of the place of sheep in the landscape and society. For example, for some residents sheep-farming is not a commercial enterprise but a social activity and local source of food. Our combined methodological approach using qualitative and spatial data can help researchers in other fields identify the interplay between place-specific areas of grazing management concern and socio-cultural values, enabling more targeted land-use management policies or plans.

AB  - A multifactorial combination of human-mediated disturbances is now recognized as a major driver of the global rise and spread of invasive alien plants. Among the numerous invasive alien plants, annuals have fast adaptability and evolution via maternal effect in human-mediated disturbance environments, such as chemical and physical controls. The characteristic enables them to quickly disperse and establish new habitats. Thus, understanding the adaptability and evolution of invasive plants in response to multifactorial human-mediated disturbances is crucial for developing effective management strategies to control their spread and minimize their impacts on ecosystems and human activities. In order to test the growth and reproductive responses in both the parent and offspring generations, two ecotypes (clump and scatter) of an annual invasive plant, Erigeron annuus, were subjected to simulated trampling, defoliation (simulated herbivory), and herbicide disturbances. We found that disturbances negatively affected the growth and reproduction of E. annuus in parent and offspring generations. In comparison to the scatter ecotype plants, the clump ecotype plants had greater growth and reproductive production, as well as a reduced maternal interference effect to cope with human-mediated disturbances. It enhanced the adaptability of their offspring to disturbances. The findings imply that the evolutionary advantage of clump ecotype plants may explain why they can thrive in disturbed habitats and become invasive in some regions.

AB  - Fire directly impacts soil properties responsible for soil function and can result in soil degradation. Across the globe, climate change-induced droughts and elevated temperatures are exacerbating fire regime severity, breadth, and frequency, thus posing a threat to soil function and dependent ecosystem services. In Australia, the 2019-2020 fire season consumed nearly 50% of Kangaroo Island, South Australia, burning both dry sclerophyll woodland and adjacent historically cleared and grazed pastureland. Due to exacerbated fire regime elements, e. g., intensity and area affected, and interactions with historical land use, post-fire recovery of soil function was uncertain. This study assessed the impacts of a) the 2019-2020 fire event in Western River, Kangaroo Island on dry sclerophyll woodland and b) the interaction between this fire event and historical clearing and grazing on post-fire function of the soil. To do so, the following physicochemical and biological soil properties were analysed: labile active carbon, total carbon, total nitrogen, carbon to nitrogen ratio (C/N), pH, electrical conductivity, soil water repellency, aggregate stability, microbial community composition, and microbial diversity. Our results showed that the fire was of high severity, causing a reduction in nutrient content, an extreme rise in pH, and significant modifications to fungal communities in burnt compared to unburnt dry sclerophyll woodland. Furthermore, clearing and grazing raised post-fire soil nutrient levels and soil microbial diversity but reduced soil C/N and the abundance of ectomycorrhizal fungi in burnt pastureland compared to burnt woodland soils. This study highlights the role of management and fire severity in post-fire outcomes and emphasizes the need for comprehensive soil function assessments to evaluate the impacts of disturbance on soil. Taking direct measure of soil properties, as done here, will improve future assessments of fire season impacts and post-fire recovery in fireprone landscapes.

AB  - Economic activities in the ocean (that is, the 'blue economy') provide value to society, yet also jeopardize marine ecosystems. For example, fisheries are an essential source of income and food security for billions of people, yet bycatch poses a major threat to marine biodiversity, creating trade-offs between economic growth and biodiversity conservation. This Perspective explores bycatch levies as a market-based instrument for reconciling these trade-offs. We outline the theory and practice of bycatch levies to demonstrate how they could incentivize bycatch prevention and raise revenue for compensatory conservation, provided they are well designed, as part of a policy mix for sustainable and equitable ocean governance. We then explore ways forward for mainstreaming bycatch levies into the blue economy. While compensatory bycatch mitigation has been controversial, increasing adoption of net outcome approaches to biodiversity conservation suggests they could become mainstreamed within the next decade. Bycatch levies could raise billions of dollars towards closing global biodiversity financing gaps, delivering net outcomes for biodiversity under the United Nations Post-2020 Global Biodiversity Framework while enabling blue growth, and moving towards win-wins for economic welfare and biodiversity conservation.
   This Perspective outlines how financial levies on fisheries bycatch may aid biodiversity conservation both directly, by incentivizing bycatch prevention, and indirectly, through raising revenue that could be directed towards compensatory conservation.

AB  - Mammal distribution is shaped by different ecological and anthropogenic factors, and the pattern varies depending on their sensitivity thresholds, food and habitat preferences, ecological roles, and physical traits. The present study investigated the influence of ecological and anthropogenic factors on the distribution of mammal species communities across different trophic levels and body sizes in Myanmar's Htamanthi Wildlife Sanctuary (HWS). The values of mammal characteristics, ecological, and anthropogenic factors were analyzed in ArcMap software. Most of the large and small sized mammals, whose distribution decreases with elevation, were observed near the main streams. Across mammal tropic levels, the omnivores and herbivores were mostly observed farther from gold mining sites. In terms of forage plant effect on mammal community, floral forage plants and the presence of climber negatively affected mammal species across different trophic levels. Moreover, presence of resin trees also has a substantial impact on the distribution of medium-large animals and omnivorous mammals as trophic niche factors. Overall, our findings highlight the crucial role that ecological and anthropogenic factors play in shaping mammal distribution in the HWS. This underscores the importance of simultaneously conserving both habitat and mammal diversity in HWS, especially in the face of a changing climate and environment.

AB  - Plant secondary chemistry is known to be an important driver of plant-insect community structure across ecological scales. Recently, the concept of phytochemical diversity (PD) has been introduced to help describe variation in plant secondary chemistry and explain how this variation affects community structure. Previous studies show that PD among individuals and species results in phytochemical mosaics, known as the phytochemical landscape. However, plant traits can vary at finer scales, such as within individuals, and even a single host plant may be perceived as an entire phytochemical landscape by an interacting insect.
   Using the neotropical shrub Piper amalago, we tested and compared how herbivory, caterpillar biodiversity and plant-herbivore network structure are affected by the compositional (number and concentration of compounds) and structural (diversity of distinct chemical structures) dimensions of PD. We analysed variation among individual plants and among-plant height strata within individual plants. This allowed us to decompose PD within and among plant individuals and analyse how variation at both scales affects the plant-herbivore network.
   We found that both within and among plants greater structural diversity decreased herbivore feeding damage. Furthermore, each dimension of PD has different effects on herbivore biodiversity and network structure depending on the scale of biological organization.
   Within plants, the compositional dimension, specifically low concentrations of compounds tentatively identified as Piper amides, increased herbivore biodiversity. This dimension also increased the capacity of strata within plants to mediate ecological cascades through direct and indirect effects on herbivore abundance in the plant-herbivore network. In contrast, a greater structural diversity among plants decreased herbivore biodiversity and the capacity of plants to affect all other herbivores and plants directly and indirectly in the network.
   Synthesis. Based on our results we expand the concept of the phytochemical landscape to multiple scales of biological organization and provide evidence that PD may be maintained by how its multiple dimensions have distinct roles across scales of biological organization.

AB  - For the conservation and management of the Arctic regions vulnerable to climate change, it is important to elucidate the trophic relations and food sources for consumers in the ecosystems. We analyzed DNA extracted from feces to understand the summer diets of the major terrestrial animals and their trophic relations in tundra ecosystems near Kongsfjorden, Svalbard. Feces of Svalbard reindeer (Rangifer tarandus platyrhynchus), Barnacle Goose (Branta leucopsis), Arctic fox (Vulpes lagopus), and Rock Ptarmigan (Lagopus muta) were collected during the summer seasons of 2014, 2015, 2018, and 2019. Plant DNA was detected in the feces of herbivores (reindeer, goose, and ptarmigan) and vertebrate DNA was detected in the feces of carnivore (Arctic fox) by amplifying, cloning, and Sanger sequencing. In case of Arctic fox, VulpesB, the blocking primer preventing from amplifying Arctic fox DNA, was used to improve the detection of their prey DNA. Salix was the most detected genus in feces of Svalbard reindeer and Barnacle Goose, which were described as feeding on graminoids, forbs, and prostrate as well as bryophyte. Bryophyte was added as an important food source for all herbivores. Arctic fox preferred birds such as geese (Anatidae) and gulls (Laridae), showing that interpretation between Arctic foxes and gulls may have occurred at the same predator level. Our results suggest that cloning-based DNA analysis using fecal sample contributes to understanding the tundra terrestrial food web near Kongsfjorden.

AB  - Context. Scent-trailing dogs ("hounds') are used to hunt introduced sambar deer (Cervus unicolor) in south-eastern Australia, but little is known about this recreational hunting technique. Aim. The aim of this study was to characterise hound hunting of sambar deer in Victoria, Australia. Our study had three objectives as follows: (1) to report the hunting success of the technique; (2) to estimate pursuit times and distances; and (3) to investigate the landscape features associated with kill sites. Methods. Data were collected from four hound-hunting crews during 2020-2021. GPS data from collars fitted to hounds were used to quantify hunt duration (min) and hunt distance (m). Logistic regression was used to estimate the effects of deer sex and hound pack size on the probability of hunting success. We used a Bayesian multinomial regression resource selection function (RSF) to identify the characteristics of sites where deer were killed (elevation, aspect, and distances to water and roads). Key results. The four hunting teams ranged in size from 2 to 10 people and from one to eight hounds. Of 136 hunts, most (88%) harvested a deer, with pursued deer escaping on the other 12% of occasions. Pursuit times and distances were highly variable, with pursuit time > 60 min for 46% of hunts and pursuit distance > 5 km for 30% of hunts. The probability of killing a pursued male and female deer were similar, and there was not a positive relationship between pack size and hunt success. The RSF showed that both male and female deer were more likely to be killed on steeper slopes and closer to roads. Conclusions. Successful hound hunting of sambar deer involves pursuits of considerable duration and requires a network of roads, with geographical features associated with deer kills sites being related to hunter access. Implications. Hound hunting may be a useful wildlife management tool for land managers, but further studies are needed to assess its efficacy for achieving management goals.

AB  - Climate change represents a growing ecological challenge. The (sub) arctic and boreal regions of the world experience the most rapid warming, presenting an excellent model system for studying how climate change affects mammals. Moose (Alces alces) are a particularly relevant model species with their circumpolar range. Population declines across the southern edge of this range are linked to rising temperatures. Using a long-term dataset (1988-1997, 2017-2019), we examine the relative strength of direct (thermoregulatory costs) and indirect (food quality) pathways linking temperature, precipitation, and the quality of two important food items (birch and fireweed) to variation in moose calf mass in northern Sweden. The direct effects of temperature consistently showed stronger relationships to moose calf mass than did the indirect effects. The proportion of growing season days where the temperature exceeded a 20 degrees C threshold showed stronger direct negative relationships to moose calf mass than did mean temperature values. Finally, while annual forb (fireweed) quality was more strongly influenced by temperature and precipitation than were perennial (birch) leaves, this did not translate into a stronger relationship to moose calf weight. The only indirect path with supporting evidence suggested that mean growing season temperatures were positively associated with neutral detergent fiber, which was, in turn, negatively associated with calf mass. While indirect impacts of climate change deserve further investigation, it is important to recognize the large direct impacts of temperature on cold-adapted species.

AB  - To counteract the effects of herbivores and pathogens, conifers have developed a sophisticated resin-based defensive system. Since defences are costly, trees must continuously accommodate defensive investment throughout plastic responses to environmental stimuli. However, the extent of such responses can differ at the intra-specific level (i.e. genetic variation in plasticity). Here we examined whether and to what extent year-toyear climate fluctuations, an important source of environmental heterogeneity during the trees' life, drive plasticity in defensive allocation of a widespread pine species. Specifically, we quantified interannual variation in resin duct production along a 31-year-period in 174 Pinus pinaster trees of nine range-wide populations grown in two common gardens in Central Spain. We aimed to explore (i) patterns of interannual variation (i.e., temporal plasticity) in resin duct production among populations and sites, (ii) whether such patterns are linked to plastic responses to interannual variation in climate conditions (i.e., climatic plasticity), and (iii) whether plastic responses to climate differ among populations (i.e., genetic variation in plasticity) and sites. We found large interannual plasticity in resin duct production (22.8 % of total variance), with temporal patterns differing among sites and populations. Climate conditions during the early growth period significantly affected the annual differentiation of resin ducts. Particularly, April precipitation had a positive overall effect on resin duct production. Inversely, warmer conditions in April had a negative effect but only in certain populations, which demonstrates genetic variation in climate sensitivity of resin duct formation. Despite significant effects of certain climate variables on annual resin duct production, climate only accounted for a small proportion of the total interannual variation (up to 3.8 % of interannual variation explained by climate factors). This suggests that alternative factors such as trade-offs with growth and temporal variation in biotic and non-climatic abiotic conditions likely contribute to explain interannual fluctuations in defensive investment.

AB  - The link between large- and middle-sized mammals in forest habitat is understudied in Central Europe; meanwhile these animals could have important effects on their habitats. In our study, we analysed camera trapping data obtained from May 2015 to September 2021 on 29 different sites in a temperate forest at the B & uuml;kk Mountain, Hungary. We investigated the temporal activity of ungulates (red deer, roe deer, wild boar) and predators (red fox and grey wolf), together with their response to human disturbance. We calculated temporal overlap value (Delta 4) and occurrence dynamics with multi-state modelling (msm). The results suggest that human activity was higher at daytime, while the mammals were more active at night. Multi-state modelling (msm) grouped animals and humans separately. Ungulates chose nighttime, when predators were also active, while they avoided daytime and human disturbance. Grey wolf were mostly co-occurred with its main food source, the red deer. Red fox overlapped the most with roe deer, suggesting that fox prey upon deer fawns. We found that human disturbance has a significant impact on the activity of forest mammals, whereas the expected avoidance of predators by ungulates does not appear to be evident. To better understand the effect of prey-predator behavioural responses in the presence of human disturbance, more field studies are needed in the region.

AB  - Questions Herbivory is a fundamental ecological interaction underlying energy and mass flow between primary producers and consumers. Ecological theory describes plant biomass quality in terms of food for herbivores as a functional effect trait. We asked how leaf functional traits affect insect herbivory in a species-rich meadow community. Location Certoryje National Nature Reserve, Bile Karpaty (White Carpathians) Protected Landscape Area, Czech Republic. Methods We assessed herbivory of 24 plant species co-occurring in a species-rich semi-natural grassland by measuring herbivore damage caused by leaf-chewing insects. Identification of trait-herbivory links was conducted by a comparative analysis based on a phylogenetically informed regression. Results Plant species strongly differed in leaf-chewer herbivory. Interspecific differences in herbivory and most traits displayed a strong phylogenetic signal associated with the deep evolutionary split between monocot graminoids and dicot forbs. There were also pronounced correlations among individual traits. Herbivory was tightly related to an intercorrelated trait set describing fibre composition and Ca content. There was also a less pronounced negative effect of leaf biomass C:N ratio on herbivory. However, the observed association between traits and herbivory was phylogenetically structured in agreement with the univariate tests of phylogenetic signal. Conclusion Herbivory was associated with a whole syndrome of intercorrelated traits, among which it is not possible to choose a single best trait predictor. Moreover, the principal pattern in this trait syndrome was related to a macro-evolutionary singularity. Such linkage among an ecosystem process, traits, and phylogeny complicates linking ecosystem processes with particular functional traits and may also occur elsewhere in natural ecosystems.

AB  - BackgroundEffective conservation requires understanding the behavior of the targeted species. However, some species can be difficult to observe in the wild, which is why GPS collars and other telemetry devices can be used to "observe" these animals remotely. Combined with classification models, data collected by accelerometers on a collar can be used to determine an animal's behaviors. Previous ungulate behavioral classification studies have mostly trained their models using data from captive animals, which may not be representative of the behaviors displayed by wild individuals. To fill this gap, we trained classification models, using a supervised learning approach with data collected from wild red deer (Cervus elaphus) in the Swiss National Park. While the accelerometer data collected on multiple axes served as input variables, the simultaneously observed behavior was used as the output variable. Further, we used a variety of machine learning algorithms, as well as combinations and transformations of the accelerometer data to identify those that generated the most accurate classification models. To determine which models performed most accurately, we derived a new metric which considered the imbalance between different behaviors.ResultsWe found significant differences in the models' performances depending on which algorithm, transformation method and combination of input variables was used. Discriminant analysis generated the most accurate classification models when trained with minmax-normalized acceleration data collected on multiple axes, as well as their ratio. This model was able to accurately differentiate between the behaviors lying, feeding, standing, walking, and running and can be used in future studies analyzing the behavior of wild red deer living in Alpine environments.ConclusionWe demonstrate the possibility of using acceleration data collected from wild red deer to train behavioral classification models. At the same time, we propose a new type of metric to compare the accuracy of classification models trained with imbalanced datasets. We share our most accurate model in the hope that managers and researchers can use it to classify the behavior of wild red deer in Alpine environments.

AB  - Almost all ecosystems are open systems, meaning that significant changes in one ecosystem can lead to unexpected changes in others. Deer overabundance has become a problem worldwide, leading to forest degradation that has impacts on not only terrestrial, but also aquatic ecosystems. This study aims to investigate the regional-scale importance of large herbivores in inter-ecosystem interactions by examining the effects of deer-induced forest degradation on fish populations. We selected similar-scale catchments from river systems in Hyogo, Japan, that differed in the time since deer-induced forest degradation. Conventional surveys for fish densities and microhabitat environments were conducted in 23 catchments, and surveys using quantitative eDNA metabarcoding were conducted in 95 catchments. We examined the relationships between fish population densities, microhabitats, and time since forest degradation, considering confounding effects. Data from 8 and 17 fish taxa detected by snorkeling and eDNA methods, respectively, were available for statistical analysis. Snorkeling-counts (Individuals/1 m transect) and eDNA concentrations (Copies/L) in river water were strongly correlated. Fine sediments on riverbeds were increased in the 3-15 years following forest degradation and decreased after 16 years. Population densities of sand-preferring fishes, as inferred from both eDNA and snorkeling, reasonably followed this pattern. These patterns may be caused by the depletion of fine sediments on mountain slopes. The results of this study suggest that deer-induced worldwide alternation may also occur in aquatic ecosystems.

AB  - Plant enemies can influence plant community assembly and structure. However, it is unclear how insect herbivores and fungal pathogens affect seedling recruitment. Complex interactions with competition and resource availability make it difficult to isolate the effect of enemies. This uncertainty can impede understanding of community assembly drivers, species coexistence and trophic interactions; and limits hypothesis testing such as of the enemy release hypothesis, a key hypothesis in invasion biology. Using a novel species-specific approach, we examine how enemies affect seedling survival and recruitment of 16 grassland species. We planted seedlings of 16 native species from two functional groups (C4 grasses and non-legume forbs) into two grassland sites (early and mid-succession). We hand-painted 1512 individual seedlings with pesticides (insecticide and fungicide) over the course of one growing season to enforce aboveground species-specific release from enemies and tested whether it enhanced survival relative to untreated controls. Applying treatments to individuals allowed us to test for the effect of enemies on plant performance while controlling for contexts such as competition from the resident community and resource levels. Release from insects increased seedling survival by 56% on average, with no additional benefit of release from fungal pathogens. This effect was observed for both forbs and C4 grasses across both sites and was strongest in resource-acquisitive species. There was no effect of the mean phylogenetic distance between our target species and the resident plant community, or of light availability or soil moisture. Synthesis. The significant positive effect of release from insect herbivores on survival early in colonisation-a trend that held across functional groups and types of resident community-suggests insects play an important regulatory role in community assembly, especially for resource-acquisitive species. As variation between species could be explained by traits but not by phylogeny, we emphasise the importance of trait-based approaches to plant community ecology. Our results also support the key mechanism (increased performance following release from enemies) underlying the enemy release hypothesis. Enemy release may therefore aid initial recruitment of plants during the invasion process.

AB  - Wild boar (Sus scrofa) is now an important species of wild ungulates in Central Europe. Next to conflicts of wild boar with agriculture, the main threat of wild boar presence lies in the expansion of African swine fever across Europe. The regulation of the wild boar population is complicated by the high reproduction rate and intelligent behavior of the species, which limits hunting effectiveness. We analyzed the spatial behavior of wild boar in an environment with a lack of natural food resources. The study area consisted of a forest complex (1,283 ha) with 2 areas. In the "risk" area, wild boar were intensively hunted, and in the "refuge" area, the hunting pressure was much lower. The distribution of wild boar was not regular within the study area. The wild boar density was higher in the refuge area than in the risk area. Even in times of food shortage, wild boar avoided the area where obtaining quality food was associated with a high risk of being killed. The conclusion applies to the winter season and an environment where the wild boar can become sufficiently fattened in the crop fields in the summer. For effective control of wild boar populations, it is therefore essential to organize the coordination of hunting pressure evenly in large areas.

AB  - Decomposing variation in juvenile recruitment is a key component of understanding population dynamics for partially migratory ungulates. We investigated reproductive parameters of adult female elk (Cervus canadensis) with calves at heel, and survivorship, cause-specific mortality, and intrinsic and extrinsic factors affecting risk of mortality for calves in a partially migratory elk population from 2013-2016 in Alberta, Canada. Elk calves born to resident mothers had 45% lower survivorship on average compared to migrant calves (0.24 vs. 0.69) and nearly twice the mortality rate (0.37 vs. 0.19) from bears (Ursus spp.), the dominant source of mortality. Contrary to our predictions, we found that increasing levels of maternal ingesta-free body fat were associated with increasing risk of calf mortality, indicating predation may have overwhelmed nutritional effects. We found no evidence that timing of calf birth or birth weight differed between migratory tactics or influenced mortality risk. We found that as percentage of cut forest increased, risk of calf mortality marginally decreased, which benefited migrant elk that were exposed to more clear-cuts compared to residents. Exposure to bear predation risk was unimportant during the hiding phase (<= 10 days after birth) for either migratory tactic, presumably because neonatal hiding behavior reduced vulnerability. In contrast, bear predation risk was important for mortality risk after 10 days in age, especially for resident elk calves, which were exposed to higher bear predation risk compared to migrants. We conclude that relative differences in bear predation between migratory tactics are contributing to the dynamics of partial migration in this population through additive effects on calf mortality. Thus, wildlife managers should anticipate that recovering grizzly bear (U. arctos) populations may substantially lower elk recruitment through effects on summer calf survival, especially in areas with diverse carnivore assemblages.

AB  - The moose (Alces alces; mooz in Anishinaabemowin, Ojibwe language) population has recently declined in Minnesota, USA, and gray wolf (Canis lupus; ma'iingan) predation is likely a contributing factor. We analyzed diet composition of gray wolves in northeastern Minnesota during 2011-2013 to evaluate the importance of moose as prey and seasonal and regional variations in wolf diet. We identified frequency of occurrence of prey items and biomass consumed in 1,000 wolf scats collected on and adjacent to the Grand Portage Indian Reservation and Voyageurs National Park and within the 1854 Ceded Territory (greater northeastern Minnesota). White-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus; waawaashkeshiwag [plural]), moose, and beaver (Castor canadensis; amikwag [plural]) composed the majority of wolf diet, with moose as the primary prey in Grand Portage (35-54% of diet by biomass across seasons) and deer the primary prey in the 1854 Ceded Territory (46-62%) and Voyageurs (63-79%). Relative importance of prey species differed by study area and season. Moose calves were an important prey item in spring in the 1854 Ceded Territory (12% of diet by biomass) but not in Grand Portage or Voyageurs. Although calves were not a majority of wolf diet by biomass, many calves were preyed upon by wolves (30% of calves born each year in Grand Portage), thus affecting recruitment in a declining moose population. Deer fawns composed 12% of wolf diet in spring and 10% in summer in Grand Portage and 19% in summer in Voyageurs. Beaver composed 16% of wolf diet by biomass in spring and 14% in summer in Grand Portage and composed 22% of wolf diet in spring and 30% in summer in Voyageurs. At most prey densities, moose were preferred and deer avoided in Grand Portage and the 1854 Ceded Territory and beaver were preferred in Voyageurs. Our results can be used in conjunction with predation and prey studies to evaluate the effect of wolves on prey populations.

AB  - The Espiritu Santo Island (ESI) has the highest elasmobranch richness among the Gulf of California islands, exemplifying its importance for conservation. In the present study, we assessed the temporal variation of the batoid assemblages captured in the southern ESI. Using the monthly artisanal fishing fleet catch data between 2013 and 2015, we applied three methods to evaluate changes in diversity: descriptive (i.e., richness, dominance, evenness, and Shannon-Wiener index), taxonomic diversity, and functional diversity. Four orders, ten families, ten genera, and 15 species were identified. Mobula munkiana, Hypanus dipterurus, Narcine entemedor, and Rhinoptera steindachneri were the most numerically abundant (dominant) during the study period. The Biological Values Index of these species indicated temporary changes mainly attributable to sea surface temperature. Diversity and average taxonomic distinctiveness values were high, indicating stability in the batoids assemblage assessed. Further, we identified nine functional groups classified mainly into two life history types, benthic and pelagic. The former group was characterized as having small- to medium-sized species and circular and oval body shape with preferences to remain buried or on sea bottom. The second group was formed by large-body size species and rhomboid body shape with high motility in the water column and with migrations. The ESI community of batoids has a stable taxonomic structure over time, whose functional groups have adapted to the ESI environmental conditions and available resources. This study confirms and highlights the importance of ESI as a critical site for these batoid species within the Gulf of California and thus their conservation.

AB  - Background: Separation of biotic and abiotic impacts on species diversity distribution patterns across a significant climatic gradient is a challenge in the study of diversity maintenance mechanisms. The basic task is to reconcile scale-dependent effects of abiotic and biotic processes on species distribution models. Here, we used a hierarchical modeling method to detect the host specificities of bark beetles (Scolytinae and Platypodinae) with their dependent tree communities across a steep climatic gradient, which was embedded within a relatively homogenous spatial niche.
   Results: Species turnover of both trees and bark beetles have an opposite pattern along the climatic proxy (represented by the elevation gradients) at the regional scale, but not at local spatial scales. This pattern confirmed the hypothesis wherein emphasis was on influences of macro-climate on local biotic interactions between trees and hosted bark beetle communities, whereas local biotic relations, represented by host specificity dependence, were regionally conserved.
   Conclusions: At a confined spatial scale, cross-taxa comparisons of beta-diversity highlighted the importance of simultaneous impacts from both extrinsic factors related to geography and environment, and intrinsic factors related to organism characteristics. The effects of tree abundance and phylogeny diversity on bark beetle diversity were, to a large extent, indirect, operating via changes in bark beetle abundance through spatial and temporal dynamics of resources distribution. Tree host dependence, which was considered and represented by host specificities, plays a minor role on the hosted beetle community in this concealed wood decomposing interacting system.

AB  - The overabundance of certain deer species is emerging as a critical issue in many forested regions across the Northern Hemisphere, including those in Japan. In the field of deer impact studies, the prevailing notion has been that overabundant deer populations could cause drastic changes of ecosystem states. This study comprises a review of the historical discussion surrounding ecosystem changes caused by deer overabundance, from theoretical frameworks to in situ observations and experiments. The synthesis highlights the potential for state transitions, shifting ecosystems from forest to nonforest states, and in some scenarios to a so-called alternative stable states. However, detecting these transitions poses challenges due to the enduring impacts of past deer activity and the nonequilibrium nature of forest dynamics. Furthermore, this study reveals additional multifield complexities arising from the interactive effects of deer overabundance and global changes on future forest dynamics. To address these challenges, new avenues for research are proposed, emphasizing the importance of sustained efforts in conducting valuable long-term studies.

AB  - Silvopastoralism based on livestock feeding on forage trees is becoming a sustainable alternative to traditional grazing on the open pastures of dry tropical Central America. Four autochthonous trees, Acacia pennatula, Enterolobium cyclocarpum, Gliricidia sepium and Guazuma ulmifolia, and one exotic (Moringa oleifera) tree are the preferred species for these silvopastoral systems. Little is known, however, about the feeding preferences of cattle, sheep and goats for such fodder trees and whether wild ungulates (white-tailed deer, Odocoileus virginianus) feed on these plants. In this work, we conducted several multiple-choice feeding preference tests (cafeteria test) to compare the best choice to feed cattle, sheep, goats and white-tailed deer in these farming systems. Although all ruminant species included the four autochthonous trees and the exotic M. oleifera in their diets, G. ulmifolia was the preferred forage tree by far. The preference for the rest of the trees varied among our ruminant species. When M. oleifera was added to the cafeteria test, it was well accepted by white-tailed deer but little appreciated by their domestic counterparts. The use of these forage trees for livestock feeding is thus interesting not only for sustainable animal production but also to support wild herbivores in the dry tropics of Central America.

AB  - Global threats to ecosystems have galvanized ecologists to better understand the anthropogenic impacts of biotic and abiotic homogenization on ecological trajectories. However, contemporary understanding of spatiotemporal trajectories in ecosystems composed of competitive and consumptive interactions is largely observational or, if more mechanistic, based on simplified models or select aspects of ecological function (e.g., stability of primary production). Here, we describe a pair of 9-month experiments that explore the influence of top-down versus bottom-up drivers of temporal variation within consumer-resource assemblages in tropical and temperate marine ecosystems. Specifically, we examine the trajectories of tropical and temperate algal communities and metacommunities in response to nutrient and herbivory gradients to assess the drivers of spatiotemporal heterogeneity in ecological dynamics. We find that temporal variation (i.e., spatiotemporal asynchrony) in both tropical and temperate algal communities and metacommunities is largely driven by nutrient gradients (i.e., bottom-up effects), whereas herbivory gradients (i.e., top-down effects) appear to have a weaker influence only on tropical algal assemblages. Importantly, we find that the interactive effects of habitat heterogeneity, herbivory levels, and nutrient levels are strongest early (i.e., within 150 days) in algal successional dynamics at the metacommunity scale and that algal communities appear to converge on greater similarity, regardless of environmental conditions, within 300 days. These findings support the notion that temporal dynamics within a trophic level are partially determined by adjacent trophic levels, highlighting the importance of considering biotic and abiotic drivers of spatiotemporal asynchrony both within and across trophic levels within communities.

AB  - Russian sheep breeds traditionally raised in specific environments are valuable parts of sociocultural heritage and economic component of the regions. However, the import of commercial breeds negatively influences the population sizes of local sheep populations and might lead to biodiversity loss. Estimation of the runs of homozygosity (ROH) in local sheep genomes is an informative tool to address their current genetic state. In this work, we aimed to address the ROH distribution and to estimate genome inbreeding based on SNP data to evaluate genetic diversity in Russian local sheep breeds. Materials for this study included SNP-genotypes from twenty-seven Russian local sheep breeds which were generated using the Illumina OvineSNP50 BeadChip (n = 391) or the Illumina Ovine Infinium HD BeadChip (n = 315). A consecutive runs method was used to calculate ROH which were estimated for each animal and then categorized in the ROH length classes. The ROH were found in all breeds. The mean ROH length varied from 86 to 280 Mb, while the ROH number ranged from 37 to 123. The genomic inbreeding coefficient varied from 0.033 to 0.106. Our findings provide evidence of low to moderate genomic inbreeding in major local sheep populations.

Hunting is well known to affect behaviour of ungulates, but how annual variation in quotas and hunting season duration affects individual behaviour remains uncertain. Harvest rates reach their highest level when aiming to limit outbreaks of infectious diseases. In Norway, marked changes to hunting regulations of wild reindeer Rangifer tarandus were implemented as part of chronic wasting disease (CWD) management (2019-2022) in the Hardangervidda population, Norway. Here, we quantify the movements (step length) of 135 female GPS-marked alpine reindeer during years (2001-2022) with largely variable levels of quotas, harvest rates (0-33%) and hunting season duration (31-58 days). A strong predictor of movement was season with a decline from mid- August to early October, and longer and more variable movement distances during daytime compared to the night. Reindeer moved more in years with higher harvest rates, but mainly in late September and not in the beginning of the hunting season. Movements were higher during weekends, only in early September. Our study shows that responses to hunting of an alpine ungulate living in open habitat appear to differ from those of forest living ungulates. The high level of sociality of reindeer may further increase disturbance effects relative to less social and forest-dwelling species. Hunting season occurs at a critical time before the winter season in northern Europe, and further studies are needed to investigate whether increased movements during hunting affect body condition.

AB  - The aim of the study was to identify the trends and dynamics of changes in the chemical and biochemical properties of soil induced by rotational grazing of farmed deer. Soils pH and the content of mineral nitrogen forms, total nitrogen, and organic carbon were determined in the study and the activity of three soil enzymes. The monitored soils were slightly acidic and neutral, with pH in 1 mol KCldm(-3) ranging from 6.37 to 7.03. The contents of content of organic carbon, total nitrogen in the monitored soils were in the range of 9.42-19.37 gkg(-1) and 1.13-2.24 gkg(-1), respectively, while the contents of N-NH4+ and N-NO3- of 1.34-7.08 mgkg(-1) and 102.8-619.5 mgkg(-1), respectively. The mean levels of nitrate nitrogen in the pasture soils were lower than that in the mown soil. The soils from the pastures were characterized by a higher level of available phosphorus, potassium, and magnesium forms than the mown soil. In the deer grazing areas, the activity of all enzymes was clearly higher than in the soil from the control plot. The results of the present pilot study have demonstrated a positive effect of cervid grazing on the biochemical parameters of the soil environment.

AB  - The macroinvertebrates associated with algae casts light on the possibility of coevolution in a specific environmental context. The understanding of how biological and environmental factors could favor, or limit such interactions and represent an important step for the comprehension of river socio-ecology dynamics. The aim of this study is to establish convergences and recurrent relationships between the most frequent algal groups and associated macroinvertebrates in temperate and tropical rivers from Mexico and Spain. We collected algal population from sixteen rivers, identifying that environmental factors and the algae characteristics that influence the biotic associations with macroinvertebrates and their implications in conservation from a biological and functional perspective. We found that habitat preference is guided by algae as a provider of food and shelter and that environmental factors were secondary. Paralemanea and Lemanea spp. (Rodophyta) recorded the greatest structural complexity, promoting more diverse but less specific associations, which could be a factor that limits co-evolution. Conversely, Phormidium and Nostoc (Cyanobacteria) recorded less diversity but greater specificity; in particular, Cricotopus (Chironomidae) was dominant, suggesting a recurrent association with the possibility of coupled life cycles. The algal structural complexity was the preponderant factor in determining the specificity of associated macroinvertebrates. The associations were in turn related to a river's specific environmental context, for example, Nostoc and Cricotopus were characteristic of oligotrophic waters, while Paralemanea and Lemanea with Hydroptilidae and Hydrobiosidae (Trichoptera) were recurrent in meso-eutrophic waters. Implications for insect conservation Changes in aquatic ecosystem quality can affect the establishment of populations of algae and insects, affecting species conservation and coexistence relationships mediated by evolutionary coupling events.

AB  - Societal Impact Statement
   Today, expansive C-4 grassy biomes exist across central, western, and northern Madagascar. Some researchers have argued that the island's now-extinct pygmy hippopotamuses belonged to a megaherbivore grazing guild that maintained these grasslands prior to human arrival. However, the chemistry of hippo bones indicates that C-4 grasses were only a minor part of hippo diet. This, in turn, suggests that C-4 grasses were present but not widespread when hippos were alive and that grasses expanded only after Malagasy people shifted from hunting and foraging to agropastoralism approximately 1000 years ago. These results have important implications for environmental reconstructions and biodiversity management.
   Summary
   center dot Extinct hippopotamuses (Hippopotamus spp.) were part of Madagascar's megaherbivore guild. Stable carbon (delta C-13) and nitrogen (delta N-15) isotopes in radiometrically dated bone collagen track spatial and temporal variation in diet and habitat. If hippos helped maintain C-4 grassy biomes, then they should have regularly consumed C-4 grasses, which have high delta C-13 values. However, if expansive C-4 grassy biomes are anthropogenic, then forests would have been more extensive in the past, and hippos would have predominantly consumed C-3 plants with low delta C-13 values. Nitrogen isotopes can clarify foraging habitat (moist or dry).
   center dot We assessed delta C-13 and delta N-15 values for hippos from different ecoregions of Madagascar and compared these with data for extinct herbivorous lemurs from the same ecoregions. We further explored the effects of wet/dry transitions on isotopic trends for hippos from the central highlands and spiny thicket ecoregions.
   center dot Carbon isotopes suggest (1) limited C-4 consumption by hippos in the central highlands, dry deciduous forest, and succulent woodland ecoregions; and (2) moderate consumption of C-4 resources in the spiny thicket. Nitrogen data indicate that hippos foraged in wetter habitats than sympatric lemurs in all regions.
   center dot Malagasy hippos did not regularly graze C-4 grasses in dry, open habitats, even in regions blanketed by C-4 grassy biomes today. Malagasy grasses are adapted to grazing and fire, but these are likely ancient adaptations that accompanied grasses when they initially spread to Madagascar. C-4 grassy biomes were spatially limited in extent in the past and only expanded after the Late Holocene introduction of domesticated ungulates.

AB  - Conservation paleobiology seeks to leverage proxy reconstructions of ecological communities and environmental conditions to predict future changes and inform management decisions. Populations of East African megafauna likely changed during the Holocene in response to trends and events in the regional hydroclimate, but reconstructing these populations requires development of new proxies. We examine if fecal steroids are a viable proxy for megafauna populations since they are well preserved in sedimentary archives. We measured eleven fecal steroids in 87 fresh dung samples representing 22 species of megafauna in the Maasai Mara National Reserve (Kenya) and a further seven samples from captive animals. Using this reference library, four distinctive groups are identified, which reflect diet and biochemical modification of these inputs during digestion by the gut microbiome. Carnivore dung is characterized by more than similar to 75% cholesterol and primate dung includes uniquely high proportions of coprostanol. Two groups of herbivore are distinguished by their differing proportions of phytosterols that are consumed by eating plants and 5 beta-stanols produced during digestion. Under cross validation a random forests statistical model accurately classified 72% of dung samples to the species level using fecal steroids. Variability among individuals and between wild and captive animals suggests that fecal steroids in herbivore dung may reflect diversity and variability in diet, while a lack of variability in carnivore dung indicates that they cannot be identified to the species level in most instances. Our results suggest that fecal steroids may have utility in reconstructing the time-evolving composition megafauna populations in East Africa.

T2  - AFRICAN JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY
LA  - English
AB  - The common impala (Aepyceros melampus melampus), a medium-sized herbivore in Eastern and Southern African savannahs, faces challenges from climate change. Using a species distribution model, we found temperature of the driest quarter (30.32%) and wettest month precipitation (20.36%) as the most influential factors. Surprisingly, land cover change had less impact (0.25%). Projections suggest a significant habitat reduction for impalas by 2050, with estimated losses of 18.12% (SSP-126) and 25.62% (SSP-585). These findings highlight climate change and land cover alterations as potential threats to impala survival, impacting crucial resources like forage and water. This research guides conservation efforts for common impala.

AB  - Animal biodiversity, and its key roles in ecosystem state and functioning, is facing critical challenges in the wake of anthropogenic activities. It is urgently necessary to improve understanding of the interconnections between animals and the vegetation within ecosystems. Process-based modelling has shown to be a mighty tool in making assessments on ecological processes. We assess the effect of different vegetation models on simulated animal biodiversity by replacing the vegetation module within Madingley, a multi-trophic model of functional diversity with LPJ-GUESS, a dynamic global vegetation model. We compare the output metrics of the model system to Madingley's default version for four ecosystem types around the globe and analyse whether the realism of the simulation results increased as a result of the coupling between Madingley and LPJ-GUESS. Simulated animal populations react to the coupling by shifting towards smaller individuals with a higher abundance. General shifts in body mass and animal distributions can be traced back to ecological processes, allowing in-depth analysis of heterotrophic responses to changes in leaf biomass. We also derive power-law relationships for herbivory to NPP and herbivore biomass to NPP and conclude that the coupled model system simulates animal populations that follow reasonable power-laws which are similar to power-laws derived from empirical data. Our results indicate that developing process-based model systems is a viable way to assess multi-trophic interconnections between animal populations and the ecosystems vegetation.

AB  - Pest spillover from wildlands to farms can create conflict between habitat conservation and agricultural production. For example, the key economic pest of hazelnuts in Oregon's Willamette Valley is the filbertworm (Cydia latiferreana), a moth hosted by the native Oregon white oak (Quercus garryana). Oak habitat near hazelnut orchards can sustain source populations that compound pest load in hazelnuts throughout the growing season. This dynamic is of conservational concern as historical oak habitat has been greatly reduced and what remains is almost entirely on private land, often in proximity to hazelnut orchards. Here, we present a novel strategy to reconcile this regional conflict by using hogs (Sus domesticus) to reduce pest populations through prescribed foraging. From 2018 to 2020 we prescribed hog-foraging in early fall to glean filbertworm-infested acorns from an oak woodland understory. Hogs were both highly successful at reducing the total number of infested acorns and the ratio of infested acorns the following year. Despite an oak-masting year in 2019, foraging reduced both the emerging and adult mating population of filbertworm the following year. We did not measure significant changes in the woodland understory, suggesting intermittent hog-foraging may not entail tradeoffs for understory vegetation. Our results demonstrate that prescribed foraging in oak patches can be an effective strategy to reduce filbertworm source populations. By benefiting both conservation and farmers, this adaptive pest management approach provides a model for similar challenges and conflicts across the agricultural-wildland matrix.

AB  - A key conservation biology tool is the information on the geographic distribution of species as well as the variables driving those patterns. Here, we used maximum entropy modeling, MaxEnt, to model the total potential distribution of Tapirus terrestris, classified as "Vulnerable" on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species. In this study, we recorded 117 occurrence records and considered 18 environmental variables. The total potential distribution area covers 96,055.6 km2, meaning 12.3 % of the territory of the Peruvian Amazon, with "high potential" habitat covering 3,891.36 km2, "moderate potential" habitat covering 22,849.5 km2, and "low po-tential" habitat covering 69,314.7 km2. Natural Protected Areas (NPAs) shelter 32.2 % (30,966.2 km2) of the total potential distribution area of the species, being the Bahuaja Sonene and Manu National Parks, the NPAs with the largest total potential distribution, 8,220.2 km2 and 7,619.7 km2 respectively. Eventually, 67.8 % (65,089.4 km2) of the total potential distribution were identified without any type of protection category by SINANPE and its complementary categories; therefore, we consider this area as a priority for the conservation of T. terrestris in Peru.

AB  - Phytosociology reached its peak development during the 20th century, particularly after 1992 with the implementation of the EU Habitats Directive, which incorporated plant associations into habitat classifications. The objective of this study is to assess the diversity of Mediterranean grasslands using the phytosociological methodology, focusing specifically on the PBTs and BsHl associations. Although both types of grasslands are of interest for livestock farming, we emphasize those belonging to Poetea bulbosae (PbTs), which are included in the priority habitat 6220 and are of high value for sheep grazing. The results indicate that Vca-Vco = 0.390 for PBTs and 0.525 for BsHl, the latter due to the absence of companion species diversity in BsHl. A strong linear correlation was observed for both associations, with R-2 > 0.8 for PbTs and R-2 > 0.9 for BdHl. Given the importance of grassland diversity research, its teaching should be predominantly practical and conducted outside the classroom. To achieve this, an inquiry-based constructivist methodology is employed, which is particularly suitable for learning the phytosociological method, allowing students to take ownership of their learning process. The aim of this teaching approach is to expose students to field research methodologies, enhancing their scientific training. The results are highly positive, with a 100% success rate in students' comprehension of the two grassland types after the teaching-learning process.

AB  - The Cretaceous-Palaeogene (K-Pg) extinction of the non-avian dinosaurs (66 Ma) led to a 25 million year gap of megaherbivores (>1000 kg) before the evolution of megaherbivorous mammals in the Late Eocene (40 Ma). The botanical consequences of this 'Palaeocene megaherbivore gap' (PMHG) remain poorly explored. We hypothesize that the absence of megaherbivores should result in changes in the diversification and trait evolution of associated plant lineages. We used phylogenetic time- and trait-dependent diversification models with palms (Arecaceae) and show that the PMHG was characterized by speciation slowdowns, decreased evolution of armature and increased evolution of megafaunal (>= 4 cm) fruits. This suggests that the absence of browsing by megaherbivores during the PMHG may have led to a loss of defence traits, but the absence of megaherbivorous seed dispersers did not lead to a loss of megafaunal fruits. Instead, increases in PMHG fruit sizes may be explained by simultaneously rising temperatures, rainforest expansion, and the subsequent radiation of seed-dispersing birds and mammals. We show that the profound impact of the PMHG on plant diversification can be detected even with the overwriting of adaptations by the subsequent Late Eocene opening up of megaherbivore-associated ecological opportunities. Our study provides a quantitative, comparative framework to assess diversification and adaptation during one of the most enigmatic periods in angiosperm history.

AB  - An important objective of fish ecology is to understand pure and shared effects of abiotic, biotic, and spatial predictors of fish assemblages' structure on continental shelves. This study aims to assess the structure of the bottom-associated fish assemblage on the shallow inner continental shelf of Paran<acute accent>a, southern Brazil, in response to physicochemical, biological, and spatial factors. We hypothesize that this structure is associated with the benthic megafauna, particularly with the distribution of the Brazilian seabob shrimp Xiphopenaeus kroyeri, an abundant fishing resource on the shallow coast of Paran<acute accent>a. We used uni and multivariate analyses to examine the distribution of abundance, richness, and composition of ichthyofauna in the region. Using variance partitioning analysis, we determined the pure and shared effect of spatial (latitude and longitude), physicochemical, and spatiotemporal distribution patterns of crustaceans, echinoderms, and mollusks as potential predictors of the structure of the fish assemblage. The data were obtained monthly from a one-year bottom trawl survey, comprising five transects and four depths (six, nine, 12 and 15 m) in a 60 km long section of the inner continental shelf, under the influence of estuaries. We captured 57578 demersal fish, comprising 37 families and 88 species. The average abundance of fish per haul was 387 individuals at a depth of 6 m, decreasing to 114 individuals per haul at 15 m. Average richness also decreased along the bathymetric profile, from 15 to 10 species per haul. Fish abundance and richness responded positively to a seasonal estuarine discharge pattern that was stronger in summer and autumn. High biomass of juvenile seabob shrimp in shallower regions also explained the higher abundances and richness. The results also suggest the existence of two fish assemblages in the region, associated with the distribution of the megafauna and segregated by depth, water surface transparency, and sediment particle size composition. Despite significant seasonal variations, controlled by precipitation and bottom water temperature, the structure of fish assemblages responded to the pure and shared effects of the three predictive components in all seasons. In particular, local coastal hydrography and the prey-predator relationship between fish and seabob shrimp were ecologically relevant processes for structuring fish assemblages at the inner continental shelf of Paran<acute accent>a. This study highlights the complexity of ecological interactions within demersal fish assemblages and the importance of considering biotic and abiotic factors in understanding fish distribution patterns at the spatial scale of inner continental shelves that are influenced by estuaries.

AB  - Anthropogenically induced global climate change has caused profound impacts in the world ocean. Climate change related stressors, like ocean acidification (OA) and warming (OW) can affect physiological performance of marine species. However, studies evaluating the impacts of these stressors on algae-herbivore interactions have been much more scarce. We approached this issue by assessing the combined impacts of OA and OW on the physiological energetics of the herbivorous snail Tegula atra, and whether this snail is affected indirectly by changes in biochemical composition of the kelp Lessonia spicata, in response to OA and OW. Our results show that OA and OW induce changes in kelp biochemical composition and palatability (organic matter, phenolic content), which in turn affect snails' feeding behaviour and energy balance. Nutritional quality of food plays a key role on grazers' physiological energetics and can define the stability of trophic interactions in rapidly changing environments such as intertidal communities.

AB  - El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO) events have impacted the marine environment of the Galapagos, causing massive die-offs of corals and megafauna, and benthic habitat shifts. With ENSO events predicted to intensify under climate change scenarios it is important for managers to have an evidence-based understanding of how these events may affect fish assemblages in the Galapagos. We assess the abundance and size fluctuations of benthic and mid-water shore fishes during the 2015-16 "Godzilla" ENSO using data from baited remote underwater stereo-video surveys collected on four occasions over 2015-16. We found significant differences in the assemblage structure between the pre-El Nino, El Nino onset, El Nino receding, and La Nina onset sampling periods. Mackerels (i.e. Trachurus murphyi and Decapterus spp.) had a similar to 480% greater relative biomass, 229% greater relative abundance, and 20.6% greater size during La Nina onset compared to El Nino. With the onset of La Nina we observed a severalfold increase in the abundance of mid-water species including large Carangids, medium-size Scombrids, elasmobranchs (i.e. Sphyrna lewini, Carcharhinus galapagensis) and several other bentho-pelagic taxa. We also found evidence of seasonal abundance fluctuations across years, independent of seasonal effects, in Scarids, Haemulids, Labrids, Chaetodontids, and Carangids. Although the 2015-16 ENSO appears to have had a lesser impact on the Tropical Eastern Pacific than past El Nino events, it was linked to changes in the abundance of several species of key ecological and economic importance. This information furthers our understanding of the influence of large-scale climatic events on fish populations and improves our ability to predict how these populations may change under future climate scenarios.

AB  - Introduction Technological developments have facilitated the collection of large amounts of imagery from isolated deep-sea ecosystems such as abyssal nodule fields. Application of imagery as a monitoring tool in these areas of interest for deep-sea exploitation is extremely valuable. However, in order to collect a comprehensive number of species observations, thousands of images need to be analysed, especially if a high diversity is combined with low abundances such is the case in the abyssal nodule fields. As the visual interpretation of large volumes of imagery and the manual extraction of quantitative information is time-consuming and error-prone, computational detection tools may play a key role to lessen this burden. Yet, there is still no established workflow for efficient marine image analysis using deep learning-based computer vision systems for the task of fauna detection and classification.Methods In this case study, a dataset of 2100 images from the deep-sea polymetallic nodule fields of the eastern Clarion-Clipperton Fracture zone from the SO268 expedition (2019) was selected to investigate the potential of machine learning-assisted marine image annotation workflows. The Machine Learning Assisted Image Annotation method (MAIA), provided by the BIIGLE system, was applied to different set-ups trained with manually annotated fauna data. The results computed with the different set-ups were compared to those obtained by trained marine biologists regarding accuracy (i.e. recall and precision) and time.Results Our results show that MAIA can be applied for a general object (i.e. species) detection with satisfactory accuracy (90.1% recall and 13.4% precision), when considered as one intermediate step in a comprehensive annotation workflow. We also investigated the performance for different volumes of training data, MAIA performance tuned for individual morphological groups and the impact of sediment coverage in the training data.Discussion We conclude that: a) steps must be taken to enable computer vision scientists to access more image data from the CCZ to improve the system's performance and b) computational species detection in combination with a posteriori filtering by marine biologists has a higher efficiency than fully manual analyses.

AB  - Human disturbance, social interactions and habitat constraints usually influence the behavior of wild ungulates. Poaching and habitat degradation are threats to the guanaco, a native South-American herbivore adapted to arid environments. Flight and vigilance behaviors, and guanaco-observer distances, were seasonally surveyed in mountain Andean environments, inside a protected area and surroundings. Field surveys and GIS analyses estimated environmental variables. Linear mixed models estimated probability of the mentioned behaviors and distance based on predictions about influences of human disturbance, social interactions, environmental constraints, and their changes over time. Flight and vigilance behaviors and guanaco-observer distance were higher in less protected landscapes, and near urban sites. Flight probability and guanaco-observer distance decreased over the years, being this distance shorter within the protected area. Flight decreased in summer, while vigilance increased. Vigilance was higher in groups with young, and lower in larger groups. Flight and vigilance behaviors were lower in slopes and higher in tall shrublands. These results are in agreement with hypotheses of risk-allocation, learning habituation, fitness maximization, risk detection strategy and foraging hypothesis. Social and environmental influences on guanaco behavior will probably prevail over anthropogenic influences insofar as current efforts to discourage disruptive activities are maintained in these mountain environments.

AB  - Early-life adversity influences adult fitness across vertebrate species. In polygynous systems with intense intrasexual competition, males may be more sensitive to conditions experienced during development. However, the importance of different aspects of the early-life environment and how their effects differ between the sexes remains poorly understood. Here, we used a long-term study of wild Soay sheep to characterize the early-life environment in terms of weather, infection risk, resource competition and maternal investment, and test the hypothesis that males are more vulnerable to early adversity. Birth weight, reflective of maternal investment and conditions during gestation, positively predicted lifetime breeding success in both sexes, suggesting a classic 'silver spoon' effect, though the effects were stronger in males. Males that experienced increased resource competition in their first year had lower lifetime breeding success, suggesting lasting negative consequences of nutritional stress, but there was no association in females. By contrast, challenging weather in the first winter of life was associated with stronger viability selection, with males surviving these harsh conditions having higher adult fitness. Our findings further evidence the important long-term fitness consequences of early-life adversity in wild vertebrates, demonstrating distinct aspects of the early environment may shape fitness in different and sex-specific ways.

AB  - Livestock grazing is one of the most intense human activities worldwide, even within protected areas. Understanding the survival characteristics of wildlife and livestock is fundamental to species conservation. Long-term studies of wildlife-livestock interactions are needed to better explore the roots of wildlife-livestock conflict and provide effective protection suggestions. Here, we deployed infrared camera traps in snow leopard habitat in Wolong Nature Reserve, Sichuan, China from 2015 to 2022 and analyzed the interactions among snow leopards, blue sheep, and domestic yaks over time with respect to three aspects: spatial distribution, daily activity patterns, and habitat use patterns. We found a high spatial overlap among all three species (average 65.4 %). Snow leopards were crepuscular, while blue sheep and domestic yaks were diurnal. Domestic yaks showed evidence of an overall lower adaptive capacity than blue sheep, with more pronounced shifts in activity patterns over time than the wild species, as well as a more divergent habitat use pattern in choosing areas at lower elevation and with gentler slopes. Changes in daily activity patterns, habitat use and occupancy probability over time were cyclical and suggest complex shifts in niche over time among species. To mitigate wildlife-livestock conflicts in the future, we recommend 1) controlling the number of livestock, 2) improving the carrying capacity of the environment, and 3) optimizing policies to allow for niche differentiation between livestock and wildlife. Our study is helpful for guiding future research directions and formulating effective livestock management policies worldwide.
