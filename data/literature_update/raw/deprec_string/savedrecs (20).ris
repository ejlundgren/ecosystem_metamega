AB  - The objective of this study was to assess the agronomic and nutritional responses of Carajas grass (Cenchrus purpureus x C. americanus, syn. Pennisetum purpureum x P. glaucum, cultivar 'Carajas') fertilized with protected urea. The experimental design was completely randomized blocks in split-plot arrangement over time. The treatments consisted of 5 levels of nitrogen (0, 100, 200, 400 and 800 kg N/ha/year) and measurements were made over 2 seasons (spring 2015 and summer 2016), with 8 replicates. Leaf and stem elongation and senescence rate of tillers increased as N dosage increased, while tiller density, leaf:stem ratio, live:dead material ratio and phyllochron declined. Forage biomass increased with N dosage reaching 47 t DM green forage/ha at 800 kg N/ha but DM production per unit of N applied declined dramatically as level of N applied increased. There was no effect of season. For crude protein (CP) and fiber concentrations, a positive effect was observed with increasing N application, with maximum CP% of 172 g/kg with 800 kg N/ha in spring. Further studies are warranted to determine if economics indicate that the higher fertilizer levels are justified and even protected urea should still be applied on a number of occasions, but still less often than conventional urea, rather than as a single dose at the beginning of spring.

AB  - It is of great significance to explore the molecular mechanism of gametophytic sexual reproduction in the genetic improvement and breeding of tea plants [Camellia sinensis (L.) O. Kuntze]. Imported beta family members (IMBs) are a class of widely distributed nucleoplasmic transport receptor proteins in eukaryotes, affecting plant development and reproduction, and participating in flowering time and sexual reproduction. Still missing, though, is a thorough examination of IMB members in tea plants. Here, seven members of the IMB gene family were screened by a genome-wide investigation in tea plants. These members were scattered unevenly throughout five chromosomes. All of them contained the conserved KAP95 and HEAT Repeat domains. Additionally, the promoter regions of CsIMBs harbored cis-acting elements associated with plant hormones, light, and abiotic stress responses. In order to further confirm the function of CsIMBs in the sexual reproduction of tea plants, the expression patterns of CsIMBs in different flower development stages and the ovary (before and after pollination) were analyzed. The expression results highlighted that CsIMBs were related to the fertility and fruiting of tea plants. Furthermore, five of the seven CsIMBs (CsIMB1a, CsIMB1b, CsIMB2, CsIMB3a, and CsIMB3b) were found to be localized in the nucleus revealed by subcellular localization analysis. These results offer a comprehensive characterization of IMB genes as well as insights into the potential roles of CsIMBs participating in the gametophytic sexual reproduction of C. sinensis.

AB  - Oxidative stress is closely related to the occurrence of depression. Acupuncture has been proved to be an effective method for treating depression. In order to explore the mechanism of the antidepressant effect of acupuncture, this study performed acupuncture prevention on chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS) depression model rats, and observed the effect of acupuncture on hippocampal oxidative stress and Nrf2 signaling pathway. Male SD rats were randomly divided into control group, CUMS group, acupuncture group, and fluoxetine group (n = 10/group). Fluoxetine, a common antidepressant, was used as a positive control drug in this study. In the fluoxetine group, rats were given fluoxetine (2.1 mg/kg) intragastrically once a day for 28 days. The acupoints of Shangxing (GV23) and Fengfu (GV16) were applied in acupuncture group, once every other day for 14 times in total. Behavioral tests and biological detections were used to evaluate the effects of the interventions and the changes of factors related to oxidative stress, Nrf2 pathway, and neuronal apoptosis. The results showed that both acupuncture and fluoxetine could increase sugar preference rate in SPT and decrease immobility time in FST in depression model rats. It also significantly decreased oxidative stress products such as ROS and H2O2, and elevated the protein and mRNA expressions of Nrf2 and HO-1. From Nissl's staining, there were more abundant nerve cells in two intervention groups compared with CUMS group. Plus, acupuncture down-regulated the expression levels of Bax and caspase-3 and up-regulated the expression of Bcl-2. Our findings indicate that acupuncture improved depression-like behaviors of CUMS rats. And CUMS-induced depression-like behaviors in rats were related to oxidative stress and neuronal apoptosis in hippocampus. Acupuncture showed antidepressant effects in reducing oxidative stress products via regulating the Nrf2/HO-1 signaling pathway so that prevented neuronal apoptosis.

AB  - Introduction: Drug metabolism during pregnancy is a complex process that involves maternal, placental and fetal sites of metabolism. Indeed, there is a lack of clarity provided from drug metabolism in human pregnancy due to ethical limitations. Large animal models of human pregnancy provide an opportunity to quantify activity of phase 1 drug metabolism mediated by cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes in the maternal, placental, and fetal compartments. Herein, we have validated a comprehensive assay to quantify maternal, placental, and fetal CYP activity.Methods: Isolated microsomes from sheep maternal liver, placenta, and fetal liver (140d gestation, term = 150d) were incubated with CYP-specific probe drugs to quantify the activity of CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP2E1 and CYP3A. Inhibition studies were performed to validate specificity of probe drugs. The validated assay was developed using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS).Results: CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP2E1 and CYP3A were active in maternal liver. In contrast, only CYP1A2, CYP2C8 and CYP2D6 were active in the placenta, whereas CYP2B6, CYP2C8 and CYP2D6 were active in the fetal liver. Of the placental-specific CYPs validated, CYP1A2 increased in type A compared with type D placentomes, whereas CYP2C8 activity increased in type B compared with type A and C.Discussion: This study has established conditions for compartment-specific CYP activity in the sheep maternalplacental-fetal unit using a validated and standardised experimental workflow. Compartment- and placentome type-specific CYP activity are important considerations when examining drug metabolism in the maternalplacental-fetal unit and in determining the impact of pregnancy complications.

AB  - Platelet functionality plays a crucial role in marine mammals. Alterations in platelet function can result from stress, pathologies, or exposure to xenobiotics, among others. The early detection of platelet function abnormalities is essential in these species to prevent advanced pathology and mitigate potential risks. Our main objective was to establish a range of physiological values of platelet function in bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus), beluga whales (Delphinapterus leucas), sea lions (Otaria flavescens) and walruses (Odobenus rosmarus). Intraplatelet Ca2+ mobilization using adenosine diphosphate (ADP) as a platelet agonist was used as a platelet function biomarker, adapting the methodology previously described by us in dolphins (Felipo-Benavent et al., 2022) to the rest of the species. The assay was also adapted to a seal (Phoca vitulina). Numerical indicators of intraplatelet Ca2+ mobilization kinetics were established, and statistical analyses were performed to compare the effects of species, sex, age, aquarium and species. Significant differences were observed between species, being the platelets of the sea lions the more reactive to the agonist. This work demonstrates the usefulness of this assay in the diagnosis or monitoring of animals with hemostatic diseases, showing two clinical cases in which intraplatelet calcium mobilization values were altered in marine mammals suffering haemorrhages. This assay may also serve as a means to monitor environmental changes and their potential impact on the health of marine mammal populations.

AB  - Both larvae and adults of the Henosepilachna vigintioctopunctata feed on leaves of potatoes, tomatoes, and eggplants. Given the variation in planting times of host plants in the Jianghan Plain, host switching between larvae and adults of H. vigintioctopunctata is inevitable to ensure continuous food availability. We evaluated the effect of consistent versus diverse larval and adult host plant feeding experience on growth performance, fecundity, longevity, and feeding preferences of H. vigintioctopunctata through match-mismatch experiments. Host plant quality significantly influences larval development and adult reproduction. Potatoes are identified as the optimal host plant for H. vigintioctopunctata, whereas eggplants significantly negatively affect the adult fecundity. Adult stage host feeding experience determines the fecundity of H. vigintioctopunctata, irrespective of the larval feeding experience. The fecundity of H. vigintioctopunctata adults on eggplant leaves remains significantly lower than that observed on potato leaves. Similarly, adult H. vigintioctopunctata demonstrate a preference for consuming potato leaves, irrespective of the larval feeding experience. Although host switching between larval and adult stages offers lesser benefits for the performance of herbivorous insects compared to a consistent diet with potato leaves, it maintains H. vigintioctopunctata population continuity amidst shortages of high-quality potato hosts.

AB  - Leaf-cutting ants (Formicidae; Atta spp., Acromyrmex spp.) cut off pieces of leaves and other plant tissue and feed it to their symbiotic fungi. As this foraging behavior poses an imminent threat to agriculture, leaf-cutting ants are considered as pests of huge ecologically and economically importance. Consequently, research on leaf-cutting ants focused on their foraging decisions and interactions with their cultivated symbiotic fungi, whereas their effect on the attacked plants, apart from the loss of plant tissue, remains largely unknown. In this study, we investigated the consequences of an attack by leaf-cutting ants and analyzed the plants' defense responses in comparison to chewing caterpillars and mechanical damage. We found that an attack by leaf-cutting ants induces the production of jasmonates in several host and non-host plant species (Arabidopsis thaliana, Vicia faba, Phaseolus lunatus, Tococa quadrialata). Additionally, we showed in the natural host plant lima bean (P. lunatus) that leaf-cutting ant damage immediately leads to the emission of typical herbivory-induced plant volatiles, including green leaf volatiles and terpenoids. Further data exploration revealed clear differences in the defense-related phytohormone profile in plant species of Neotropical and Eurasian origin. Taken together, we show that leaf-cutting ant infestation and their way of clipping the plants' tissues induce jasmonate and jasmonates-mediated responses and do not differ from those to mechanical injury or larval feeding.

AB  - The incidence of chemotherapy-induced cognitive impairment (CICI) has attracted massive attention. Some studies have demonstrated the neuroprotective effects of dexmedetomidine (DEX). Here, alterations in nuclear receptor coactivator 4 (NCOA4)-mediated ferritinophagy were investigated as the possible causes of DEX's neuroprotection of HT22 cells against methotrexate (MTX)-induced neurotoxicity. We used various concentrations of DEX and NCOA4-siRNA to treat MTX-induced neurotoxicity and inflammation in HT22 cells. The biomarkers of HT22 cells viability, apoptosis and inflammatory were tested. The expression of ferritinophagy markers were detected in the HT22 cells by using western blot and Immunofluorescence. We found that 10 and 50 ng/mL of DEX alleviated MTXinduced hippocampal neuronal inflammatory injuries. Meanwhile, DEX also reversed MTX-induced iron and ROS overproduction. Increasing DEX concentrations caused significant falls in the expression of ferritin heavy chain 1 (FTH1). DEX also increased vital ferritinophagy markers, NCOA4 and LC3II. NCOA4-siRNA transfection annulled the neuroprotective effects of DEX on MTX-induced inflammation in HT22 cells. Additionally, because NCOA4-siRNA disrupted ferritinophagy, DEX's inhibitory impact on MTX-induced iron and ROS overproduction in HT22 cells was also annihilated. DEX weakened MTX-provoked neurontoxicity in HT22 cells, possibly by improving NCOA4mediated ferritinophagy. Our discoveries present further mechanisms for understanding the protective effects of DEX against MTX-induced cognitive impairment.

AB  - Nickel is recognized as an environmental contaminant and can affect various living organisms; therefore, clarifying the mechanism of Ni-induced toxicity and elucidating a protection strategy are crucial. This study investigated the neurotoxic potential of dosing nickel sulfate (Ni) on rats and the possible protective mechanism of curcumin in alleviating brain injury. Twenty-eight male albino Wistar rats were allocated into four groups: G1; control, G2; curcumin (CUR, 1.5 mg/kg bwt/day, i.p), G3; nickel sulfate (Ni, 20 mg/kg bwt, per os), and G4; Ni + CUR by the same protocol dosing for 30 days. Results revealed that Ni induced neurobehavioral abnormalities including disruption in cognition, impaired memory, increased anxiety, and motor imbalance, impaired acetylcholinesterase expression, and disrupted brain redox state. Downregulation of Nrf2 and HO-1 expression was recorded; moreover, marked neuropathological alterations affect many brain areas, mainly the cerebrum, hippocampus, and cerebellum, with increased immune reactivity of caspase-3 and NF-kappa B. However, curcumin significantly reduces brain injury via down-regulation of the redox state and regresses the related neurobehavioral and neuropathological alterations. The role of curcumin in the mitigation of Ni-induced intoxication was confirmed via antioxidant and anti-apoptotic pathways and downregulation of NF-kappa B in the brain.

AB  - This study aimed to investigate the changes in retinal neurotransmitters and the role of the dopamine D2 receptor (D2R) pathway in regulating the myopic refractive state. Tricolor guinea pigs were randomly divided into two groups: the normal control group (NC) and the form-deprivation myopia group (FDM). Animals in the FDM group had their right eye covered with a balloon for 4 weeks. These two groups were further divided into two subgroups based on intravitreal injection with D2R antagonist sulpiride once a week for 3 weeks (NC, NC-Sul, FDM, and FDM-Sul groups). Ultrahigh-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry was used to quantitatively detect the changes in 17 retinal neurotransmitters. Compared to the NC group, the concentrations of dopamine (DA) and ?-aminobutyric acid (GABA) decreased, while those of glutamate (Glu), 3-methoxytyramine (3-MT), and glycine increased, accompanied by an increase in myopic refraction and axial length (AL) in the FDM group. In the FDM-Sul group, glycine and DA levels were upregulated, whereas 3-MT and Glu levels were downregulated, accompanied by a decrease in myopic refraction and AL. The ratio of Glu to GABA (RGG) represents the balance between excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmitters. Notably, RGG changes occurred with corresponding AL changes, which increased in the FDM group and decreased in the FDM-Sul group. Decreased retinal DA concentration, with an increase in Glu, may be involved in the myopia progression. D2R antagonists might effectively slow myopia progression by increasing retinal DA, regulating Glu concentration to match GABA, and maintaining the balance between excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmitters.

AB  - The South American native ungulates (SANUs) are usually overlooked in Eutherian phylogenetic studies. In the rare studies where they were included, the diversity of SANUs was underrated, keeping their evolutionary history poorly known. Some authors recognized the SANUs as a monophyletic lineage and formally named it Meridiungulata. Here, we recognized and defined a new supraordinal lineage of Eutheria, the Sudamericungulata, after performing morphological phylogenetic analyses including all lineages of SANUs and Eutheria. The SANUs resulted as non-monophyletic; thus, Meridiungulata is not a natural group; Litopterna and "Didolodontidae" are Panameriungulata and closer to Laurasiatheria than to other "Meridiungulata" (Astrapotheria, Notoungulata, Pyrotheria, and Xenungulata). The other "Meridiungulata" is grouped in the Sudamericungulata, as a new monophyletic lineage of Afrotheria Paenungulata, and shared a common ancestor with Hyracoidea. The divergence between the African and South American lineages is estimated to Early Paleocene, and their interrelationships support the Atlantogea biogeographic model. Shortly afterward, the Sudamericungulata explosively diversified in its four lineages. Confronting the Sudamericungulata evolutionary patterns and the Cenozoic natural events (such as tectonics and climatic and environmental changes, among others) helps to unveil a new chapter in the evolution of Gondwanan Eutheria, as well as the natural history of South America during the Cenozoic.

AB  - Motilin, a peptide hormone consisting of 22 amino acid residues, was identified in the duodenum of pigs in the 1970s. It is known to induce gastrointestinal contractions during the interdigestive state in mammals. Although the motilin gene has been identified in various animal species, it has not been studied in amphibians. Here, we identified the motilin gene in the Japanese fire bellied newt (Cynops pyrrhogaster), and conducted an analysis of tissue distribution, morphological observations, and physiological experiments. The deduced mature newt motilin comprises 22 amino acid residues, like in mammals and birds. The C-terminus of the newt motilin showed high homology with motilin from other species compared to the N-terminus region, which is considered the bioactive site. Motilin mRNA expression in newts was abundant in the upper small intestine, with notably high motilin mRNA expression found in the pancreas. Motilin-producing cells were found in the mucosal layer of the upper small intestine and existed as two cell types: open-and closed-type cells. Motilin-producing cells in the pancreas were also found to produce insulin but not glucagon. Newt motilin stimulated gastric contractions but not in other parts of the intestines in vitro, and motilin-induced gastric contraction was significantly inhibited by treatment with atropine, a muscarinic acetylcholine receptor antagonist. These results indicate that motilin is also present in amphibians, and that its gastrointestinal contractile effects are conserved in mammals, birds, and amphibians. Additionally, we demonstrated for the first time the existence of pancreatic motilin, suggesting that newt motilin has an additional unknown physiological role.

AB  - India is the world's largest producer of milk for over 20 years. This production mainly responds to growing domestic demand, and relies almost entirely on millions of small herds (3 female buffaloes or cows) fed with local crop residues. This paper aims to assess the socio-economic and environmental sustainability of this dairy development model by implementing different approaches at various geographical scales. To assess such a model is complex. On the one hand, the recycling of biomass for livestock feed is mainly practiced by the poorest farmers, who have a limited access to land, markets and other resources. It sustains their employment and livelihoods, but also their food security since theyconsume part of their milk production. On the other hand, the intensive use of subsidized mineral fertilizers and energy for irrigation to produce crop grains and residues leads to high fossil energy uses and greenhouse gas emissions per litre of milk, calling into question the model's environmental sustainability. Our results need to be explored further by (i) investigating more case studies to develop a larger picture of the diversity of the Indian dairy sector, and (ii) integrating the different approaches and levels within a larger framework.

AB  - Wheat production is threatened by the destructive effects of numerous pests, including Oulema melanopus (cereal leaf beetle, CLB). Both adults and larvae of CLB damage grain crops, but the target of insecticide treatments are the larvae. Insect-associated bacteria are important for many of the insects' life processes and may also modulate plant defense responses to feeding of their insect host. The aim of our study was to elucidate the early wheat plants' reaction to this herbivore feeding and to disclose the CLB-associated bacteria modulation of the wheat-insect interactions. Transcriptome analyses were performed for the leaves wounded mechanically and by feeding of the CLB larvae as well as for the distal leaves to study both, the plant's local and systemic response. Comparative transcriptome analysis indicated that 24 h after the plant treatment, a much larger number of up-regulated DEGs in damaged leaves was noted, especially those on which larvae were fed. It may suggest that at the analysed time point, the local response was stronger than the systemic one. In the leaves on which larvae with natural bacterial flora were fed (local response), the number of up- and down-regulated differentially expressed genes (DEGs) was 7136 and 7411, respectively, in comparison to the dataset obtained for the leaves wounded by larvae with a reduced number of bacteria. In the distal leaves, 3015 up- and 2372 down-regulated DEGs were noted. CLB-associated bacteria were found to affect many aspects of the physiology of wheat plants, especially in wounded leaves, including the expression of genes related to primary metabolism, phytohormone signaling and photosynthesis. We also observed that CLB-associated bacteria mitigated numerous anti-herbivore processes and pathways associated with the synthesis of metabolites and proteins, potentially harmful to the insects. The bacteria also reversed the expression of some genes involved, inter alia, in the phosphorylation of proteins, oxidative stress, cell wall organization, and biogenesis. Understanding the role of CLB-associated bacteria in the plant's defense response will be important to the fields of pest control and herbivore and its host ecology and evolution.

AB  - This study provides new insights into the behavioral ecology of Dinomys branickii based on long-term camera trap surveys conducted at three sites along an altitudinal gradient in southeastern Peru. Notably, we document the first known cases of geophagy in this species, which suggests a highly herbivorous diet. Moreover, in contrast to previous reports that described D. branickii as a group-living species, our data indicate that it is primarily solitary, with group formations likely limited to reproductive activities. Additionally, we confirm the species' predominantly nocturnal and crepuscular activity patterns, with most activity occurring between 02:00 and 05:00 h. By calculating and comparing camera trap detection rates, used as an index of relative abundance (RAI), for D. branickii across different surveys, we highlight the species' ecological rarity, evidenced by consistently low detection rates (0.163; 0.173 and 0.011 events per 1,000 trap-days) across diverse habitats and survey designs.

AB  - TDP-43 proteinopathies cover a range of neurodegenerative diseases, including frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Hyperphosphorylated TDP-43 was found within the inclusion bodies in disease lesions; however, the role of hyperphosphorylation and the toxic species are still ambiguous. To characterize the hyperphosphorylation effect of TDP-43, here, we employed five serine mutations implicated in the diseases at serine locations 379, 403, 404, 409, and 410 in the C-terminus to aspartate (SSD) and to alanine (SSA). We systematically characterized the conformation, liquid-liquid phase separation, oligomerization, and fibrillization of TDP-43 variants. Results revealed that the recombinant TDP-43 variants readily formed structurally similar spherical oligomers, as evidenced by circular dichroism spectroscopy, fluorescence spectroscopy, the TDP-43 oligomer-specific antibody assay, dynamic light scattering, and transmission electron microscopy. After incubation, only the phosphor-mimic SSD TDP-43 formed thioflavin-positive amyloid fibrils, whereas wild-type and SSA TDP-43 formed amorphous aggregates. We also examined membrane disruption, the cytotoxicity of human neuroblastoma, and the synaptic loss of primary neurons induced by oligomers and large aggregates of TDP-43. The results showed that all oligomeric TDP-43 variants were toxic regardless of hyperphosphorylation, but the fibrils and amorphous aggregates were not. Overall, our results demonstrated the hyperphosphorylation effect on fibril formation and the toxicity attributed from TDP-43 oligomers. This study facilitates the understanding and therapeutic development for TDP-43 proteinopathies.

AB  - Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a complex and devastating illness that affects people of all ages. Despite the large use of antidepressants in current medical practice, neither their mechanisms of action nor the aetiology of MDD are completely understood. Experimental evidence supports the involvement of Parvalbumin-positive GABAergic neurons (PV-neurons) in the pathogenesis of MDD. DLX5 and DLX6 (DLX5/6) encode two homeodomain transcription factors involved in cortical GABAergic differentiation and function. In the mouse, the level of expression of these genes is correlated with the cortical density of PV-neurons and with anxiety-like behaviours. The same genomic region generates the lncRNA DLX6-AS1, which, in humans, participates in the GABAergic regulatory module downregulated in schizophrenia and ASD. Here, we show that the expression levels of Dlx5/6 in the adult mouse brain are correlated with the immobility time in the forced swim test, which is used to measure depressive-like behaviours. We show that the administration of the antidepressant fluoxetine (Flx) to normal mice induces, within 24 h, a rapid and stable reduction in Dlx5, Dlx6 and Dlx6-AS1 expression in the cerebral cortex through the activation of the TrkB-CREB pathway. Experimental Dlx5 overexpression counteracts the antidepressant effects induced by Flx treatment. Our findings show that one of the short-term effects of Flx administration is the reduction in Dlx5/6 expression in GABAergic neurons, which, in turn, has direct consequences on PV expression and on behavioural profiles. Variants in the DLX5/6 regulatory network could be implicated in the predisposition to depression and in the variability of patients' response to antidepressant treatment.

AB  - The cerebral cortex accounts for substantial energy expenditure, primarily driven by the metabolic demands of synaptic signaling. Mitochondria, the organelles responsible for generating cellular energy, play a crucial role in this process. We investigated ultrastructural characteristics of the primary visual cortex in 18 phylogenetically diverse mammals, spanning a broad range of brain sizes from mouse to elephant. Our findings reveal remarkable uniformity in synapse density, postsynaptic density (PSD) length, and mitochondria density, indicating functional and metabolic constraints that maintain these fundamental features. Notably, we observed an average of 1.9 mitochondria per synapse across mammalian species. When considered together with the trend of decreasing neuron density with larger brain size, we find that brain enlargement in mammals is characterized by increasing proportions of synapses and mitochondria per cortical neuron. These results shed light on the adaptive mechanisms and metabolic dynamics that govern cortical ultrastructure across mammals.

AB  - Activation of voltage-gated calcium channels at presynaptic terminals leads to local increases in calcium and the fusion of synaptic vesicles containing neurotransmitter. Presynaptic output is a function of the density of calcium channels, the dynamic properties of the channel, the distance to docked vesicles, and the release probability at the docking site. We demonstrate that at Caenorhabditis elegans neuromuscular junctions two different classes of voltage-gated calcium channels, CaV2 and CaV1, mediate the release of distinct pools of synaptic vesicles. CaV2 channels are concentrated in densely packed clusters similar to 250 nm in diameter with the active zone proteins Neurexin, a-Liprin, SYDE, ELKS/CAST, RIM-BP, a-Catulin, and MAGI1. CaV2 channels are colocalized with the priming protein UNC-13L and mediate the fusion of vesicles docked within 33 nm of the dense projection. CaV2 activity is amplified by ryanodine receptor release of calcium from internal stores, triggering fusion up to 165 nm from the dense projection. By contrast, CaV1 channels are dispersed in the synaptic varicosity, and are colocalized with UNC-13S. CaV1 and ryanodine receptors are separated by just 40 nm, and vesicle fusion mediated by CaV1 is completely dependent on the ryanodine receptor. Distinct synaptic vesicle pools, released by different calcium channels, could be used to tune the speed, voltage-dependence, and quantal content of neurotransmitter release.

AB  - The parrotfish Sparisoma cretense, a marine species native to the eastern and southern coastal areas of the Mediterranean, has extended its distribution northward. Here, we provide an update on its distribution based on currently published data and two new records from the coastline of Sardinia, Italy (central-western Mediterranean). The survey methods were scuba diving and spearfishing: one specimen of S. cretense was caught along the Argentiera coastline (northwest Mediterranean) and the others were photographed in the Gulf of Orosei, Osalla Bay (central-eastern Mediterranean). A literature update, together with new records, documents the distribution of this species in the northernmost areas of the Mediterranean. Probably a result of global warming, the ongoing northward expansion of S. cretense highlights the need for sampling campaigns to obtain timely updates on population and distribution of this thermophilic species.

AB  - Monomeric flavan-3-ols and their oligomeric forms, proanthocyanidins (PAs), are closely related to the bitterness of tea beverages. Monomeric flavan-3-ols are characteristic flavor compounds in tea. Increasing the content of PAs and anthocyanins enhances the resistance of tea plants to pathogen invasion but decreases the quality of tea beverages. MATE family transporters play a critical role in transferring monomeric flavan-3-ols and anthocyanins into vacuoles for storage or subsequent condensation into PAs. Their activities modulate the ratio of monomeric flavan-3-ols to PAs and increase anthocyanin content in tea plants. In this study, it was observed that the gene expression and protein phosphorylation level of the MATE transporter CsTT12, a vacuole-localized flavonoid transporter, were notably upregulated following exogenous sucrose treatment, promoting PA synthesis in tea plants. Further analysis revealed that overexpression of CsTT12 and CsTT12S17D significantly increased the content of anthocyanins and PAs in plants, whereas CsTT12S17A did not. In CsTT12 knockdown plants, PA's accumulation decreased significantly, while monomeric catechin content increased. Moreover, phosphorylation modification enhanced the vacuolar membrane localization of CsTT12, whereas dephosphorylation weakened its vacuolar membrane localization. This study uncovers the crucial role of phosphorylation in flavonoid biosynthesis and provides insights into balancing quality improvements and resistance enhancement.

AB  - "Huangjinya" is a light-sensitive albino variety and is widely cultivated in China. It has been proved that red light could promote the vegetable growth of plants. However, the mechanism of "Huangjinya" in response to a red light is unclear. This study used high-throughput sequencing technology to analyze the transcriptome of tender shoots of "Huangjinya" under the white and red light supplement conditions. At the same time, liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS) was used to analyze metabolite changes under different light conditions. Transcriptome analysis revealed that a total of 174 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified after the red light supplement. Kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes (KEGG) classification indicated that amino acid metabolism enriched the most DEGs. In addition, two phenylpropanoid metabolism-related genes and five glutathione S-transferase genes (CsGSTs) were found to be expressed differently. Metabolome analysis revealed that 193 differential metabolites were obtained. Being the same as transcriptome analysis, most differential metabolites were enriched in amino acids, sweet and umami tasting amino acids were increased, and bitter-tasting amino acids were decreased after the red light supplement. In summary, red light supplementary treatment may be propitious to the quality of "Huangjinya" due to its regulatory effect on amino acid metabolism. Also, CsGSTs involved phenylpropanoid metabolism contributed to tea quality changes in "Huangjinya."

AB  - Waelz slag is an iron-containing waste generated during electric arc furnace (EAF) dust processing in a rotary kiln named the Waelz process. This study focuses on the reduction smelting of the Waelz slag to produce iron-based alloy. The thermodynamic simulation using FactSage 8.0 software was carried out to predict temperatures of the metal and slag obtained as well as their compositions. Based on the simulation results, reduction smelting experiments were performed on a laboratory scale using two approaches, with and without preliminary froth flotation of carbon, respectively. The experiments have confirmed the technological possibility of reduction smelting of the Waelz slag from EAF dust processing. The approach using preliminary flotation of carbon and reduction smelting at 1500 degrees C resulted in high-copper cast iron production, while the approach without flotation, where the Waelz slag was smelted at 1650 degrees C with the addition of SiO2 flux, led to obtaining low-silicon ferrosilicon with high Cu content, as well as slag attractive for construction industry.

AB  - The Jawi of Southern Thailand form a cultural conservatory of the ancient peninsular Malay world of which they testify. Islam arrived in their country at the end of the 14th century. However, Islam was present overall among the elites and coastal population and it spread in the highlands only slowly. Like the Malays, they were first animists and then Hindu, influenced by India. They retain the imprint in their ritual beliefs and practices and in the myths of the oldest background. The example of the tiger, a predator that largely dominates the local fauna and the fabulous bestiary of the Jawi and the Malays, shows this well. The myth of the origin of the tiger and that of its stripes mixes animist and Indian sources with more recent Muslim currents and associates with the tiger the figures of the bull and the buffalo, the lion, the archangel Gabriel, the devil and Sayidina Ali, son-in-law of the Prophet Muhammad and Malay cultural hero.

AB  - The blood biochemical composition is indicative of the animal's performance and health status. This study evaluated the interaction between age and blood metabolites, immunoglobulins, hormones in Hu sheep. In total 30 male lambs between 1, 2, 3, 6 and 12 months (M) old were used in this study. The lambs were kept with their dams and offered the total mixed ration at 7 days of age, while at 55 days of age; the lambs were weaned and transferred to individual pens. The data were analysed using the one-way ANOVA procedure of SPSS and the Pearson's correlation coefficient between blood parameters was calculated. The 2M old lambs had significantly lower (p < 0.05) blood biochemical parameters than 1M old lambs. However, these parameters were higher in the adult sheep except the blood glucose (GLU). In contrast, the blood albumin/globulin ratio and beta-hydroxybutyric acid (BHBA) did not show significant differences. Moreover, positive correlations were observed between blood immunoglobulins, growth hormone (GH) and insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1), globulin (GLB), and blood total protein (TP). In addition, BHBA had a positive correlation with GLB and immunoglobulins. In addition, blood albumin (ALB) had a significant positive correlation with TP, GH, and IGF-1. Moreover, a significant positive correlation was between GLU and insulin. The investigation of blood biochemical parameters in sheep of different ages from 1 to 12M could be a reliable method to detect the metabolism status and health condition through the early stage of life.

AB  - Positive allosteric modulators (PAMs) of alpha 5GABA(A) receptors (alpha 5GABAARs) are emerging as potential thera-peutics for a range of neuropsychiatric disorders. However, their role in memory processing of healthy animals is not sufficiently examined. We tested the effects of MP-III-022 (1 mg/kg, 2.5 mg/kg and 10 mg/kg), a PAM known to be selective for alpha 5GABAARs and devoid of prominent side-effects, in different behavioral paradigms (Morris water maze, novel object recognition test and social novelty discrimination) and on GABRA5 expression in Wistar rats, 30 min and 24 h after intraperitoneal treatment administration. The lowest dose tested worsened short-term object memory. The same dose, administered two times in a span of 24 h, improved spatial and impaired object and, at a trend level, social memory. The highest dose had a detrimental effect on all types of long-term memory (object memory at a trend level) and short-term spatial memory, but improved short-term object and social memory. Distinct sets of expression changes were detected in both prefrontal cortex and two regions of the hippocampus, but the latter ones could be assessed as more consequential. An increase of GABRA5 mRNA in CA2 occurred in parallel with improvement of object and social, but impairment of spatial memory, while the opposite happened with a trend level change in CA1. Our study demonstrates the variability of the roles of the alpha 5GABAAR based on its level of expression and localization, in dependence on the type and protocol of cognitive tasks, as well as the respective timing of pharmacological modulation and testing.

AB  - Volatile compounds play indispensable roles in the interactions among host plants, herbivores and natural enemies. Previous studies showed that the addition of buckwheat strips in cotton fields could attract Peristenus spretus, the dominant parasitoid of Apolygus lucorum, and enhance its parasitic activity. Through the combined analysis of Y-tube olfactometer, solid-phase microextraction (SPME), gas chromatography-mass spectrometer (GC-MS) and electroantennography (EAG), we found that male and female P. spretus responded to compounds present in buckwheat flowers. The five major components of buckwheat flowers, cis-3-hexenyl acetate (Z3HA), 4-methylanisole, 4-oxoisophorone, p-methylphenol and 2-ethylhexyl salicylate, all had a significant attraction to P. spretus adults and led to positive electroantennogram responses, especially for 10 mg/mL 4-oxoisophorone, indicating the components played a key role in the selection behavior of P. spretus to buckwheat flowers. Additionally, field trials showed that the five volatiles could significantly increase the parasitism by P. spretus. Our study screened the key active components of buckwheat flower volatiles that have an attractive effect on P. spretus, revealing its behavioral selection mechanism and emphasizing the important role of plant volatiles on host selection and parasitism of parasitic wasps, providing a theoretical basis for the development of attractants for P. spretus and the reduction of pesticides in the field to promote conservation biological control (CBC) of A. lucorum.

AB  - Simple Summary The authors aimed to investigate the possible impact of hormone levels during the reproductive cycle of gilts on the slaughter characteristics and meat quality. The levels of progesterone (P4) and LH were determined in the blood samples of the processed female pigs. Moreover, during the research, the biochemical and haematological properties of the blood were investigated. Additionally, the fat and meat content and other properties were determined. It was observed that some of the analysed properties of meat and blood varied as a result of increased levels of LH. The aim of the conducted research was to determine the impact of factors such as sex hormone levels, which vary during gilts' reproductive cycle, on the quality of the obtained meat and slaughter characteristics of the processed gilts. The research material included a population of 60 gilts slaughtered in one of the slaughterhouses located in south-eastern Poland. After the slaughtering operations were completed, the carcasses were weighed at the classification stand. The results of the statistical evaluation of the haematological and biochemical blood parameters of the examined gilts showed that, in the tested blood samples, the concentration of progesterone had a statistically significant impact only on the level of total protein, which was higher in the blood samples of gilts with a low concentration of progesterone. It was found that carcasses of gilts with higher levels of the LH hormone were characterized by a lower meat content index by nearly 3%. It was shown that the concentration of LH affected the post-slaughter temperature of the sirloin and ham muscles. The interpretation of the obtained data was difficult since there seems to be a gap in the literature concerning the dependencies of sex hormone levels in gilts and meat quality.

AB  - Microplastics (MPs) generally refer to the plastic fragments or particles smaller than 5 mm in diameter, which are closely concerned due to their widespread presence in the environment. Recent studies have shown that MPs have a serious threat on the reproductive health of organisms. Pigs are often selected as the model animals because of their high similarity to human tissues and organs. However, there are no reports on the effects and mechanisms of MPs exposure on swine germ cells. In the present study, we established swine testis (ST) cell models exposed to 250, 500, and 1000 mu g/ml polystyrene microplastics (PS-MPs, 1-10 mu m), respectively. The findings revealed that PS-MPs reduced cell viability dose-dependently. Acridine orange/ethidium bromide staining and flow cytometry results indicated the occurrence of apoptosis and necrosis in ST cells under PS-MPs exposure, and the expression changes of relevant marker genes (B-cell lymphoma-2, Bcl-2 Associated X, Caspase-3, Caspase-9, Receptor-interacting protein kinase 1, Receptor-interacting protein kinase 3, Mixed lineage kinase domain-like, and Caspase-8) were clarified via quantitative real-time PCR and western blot. Further mechanistic studies found that PS-MPs treatment induced excessive intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, which promoted the phosphorylation of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway-related genes (P38, c-Jun N-terminal kinase, extracellular regulated protein kinases) and activated the downstream gene hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF1 alpha). In conclusion, our study suggests that PS-MPs treatment causes apoptosis and necroptosis in ST cells via ROS/MAPK/HIF1 alpha signaling pathway.

AB  - Unbiased data-driven omic approaches are revealing the molecular heterogeneity of Alzheimer disease. Here, we used machine learning approaches to integrate high-throughput transcriptomic, proteomic, metabolomic, and lipidomic profiles with clinical and neuropathological data from multiple human AD cohorts. We discovered 4 unique multimodal molecular profiles, one of them showing signs of poor cognitive function, a faster pace of disease progression, shorter survival with the disease, severe neurodegeneration and astrogliosis, and reduced levels of metabolomic profiles. We found this molecular profile to be present in multiple affected cortical regions associated with higher Braak tau scores and significant dysregulation of synapse-related genes, endocytosis, phagosome, and mTOR signaling pathways altered in AD early and late stages. AD cross-omics data integration with transcriptomic data from an SNCA mouse model revealed an overlapping signature. Furthermore, we leveraged single-nuclei RNA-seq data to identify distinct cell-types that most likely mediate molecular profiles. Lastly, we identified that the multimodal clusters uncovered cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers poised to monitor AD progression and possibly cognition. Our cross-omics analyses provide novel critical molecular insights into AD.
   Omics studies have found molecular features associated with different clinical and pathological profiles in patients with Alzheimer's disease. This study combines multiple high-throughput omics datasets and machine learning to identify four distinct molecular profiles of Alzheimer's disease, one of which was associated with worse cognitive function and neuropathological features.

AB  - Depression during pregnancy is often overlooked and undertreated. Ketamine has been shown to exert prompt and sustained antidepressant effects in patients with depression, although concerns of potential neurotoxicity prohibit its use in pregnant women. Here, we aim to investigate the neurobehavioral effects of subanesthetic ketamine on pregnant mice and their offspring. We found that pregnant C57BL/6 mice receiving ketamine (10 mg/kg/day intraperitoneal) from gestation day 15 to 17 exhibited less depression-like behaviors. Prenatal ketamine treatment induced male-specific reduction in depression- and anxiety-like behaviors in adult offspring, without alterations in social and memory performance. These behavioral outcomes were associated with a male-specific increase in dendritic spine density of dentate gyrus granule cells, while neither dendritic architecture nor hippocampal neurogenesis was affected. N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor subunits GluN2A and GluN3A were expressed at significantly higher levels in the hippocampus of male as compared to female mouse embryos, suggesting sex-dependent actions of ketamine on developing brain. Overall, our study showed that prenatal exposure to subanesthetic ketamine could exert long-lasting neurobehavioral effects in a sex-dependent manner, with male offspring being more resilient to stress. These findings may have implications concerning ketamine use during pregnancy, and also provide clues about the developmental origins of emotional problems.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Understanding the factors that promote the success of invasive species is important for managing biological invasions. Interactions between invasives and other species (e.g. competitors, pathogens, or predators), could favor or limit their success. In recent decades, yellowjacket wasps, including Vespula germanica and Vespula vulgaris, have successfully established in Patagonia. Additionally, the invasive willow Salix fragilis has invaded areas next to watercourses, which in turn are typically colonized by the giant willow aphid (GWA, Tuberolagnus salignus), an additional species characterized as a successful invader in many regions worldwide. Aphid exudate (honeydew) has been reported to be used as a carbohydrate source by social wasps. The aim of our study was to gain a better understanding of the infestation pattern of the GWA in north-western Patagonia, its effect on exudate availability and its relationship with yellowjacket foraging patterns. The study was conducted under the working hypothesis that the increase in the size of GWA colonies and resulting honeydew production, will fuel an increase in local Vespula spp. populations.
   RESULTS: We found that the aphid honeydew is produced in relatively high amounts in the region (estimated at 1517 +/- 139 kg/ ha/season), with strong indications that it is used by yellowjackets because of the significantly higher abundance levels of yellowjackets foraging on honeydew compared to nearby areas.
   CONCLUSION: Given its effect on yellowjacket foraging behavior, the interaction of these three invasive species, willows, GWA and yellowjackets, needs to receive special attention to develop future environmentally-sound mitigation tools of these nuisance pest.

AB  - Camellia oleifera is a crucial cash crop in the southern region of China. Timely flowering is a crucial characteristic for maximizing crop productivity. Nevertheless, the cold temperature and wet weather throughout the fall and winter seasons in South China impact the timing of flowering and the yield produced by C. oleifera. This study examined the miRNAs, transcriptomes, and phytohormones that are part of the flowering time regulatory networks in distinct varieties of C. oleifera (Sep, Oct, and Nov). This study provides evidence that phytohormones significantly impact the timing of flowering in C. oleifera leaves. There is a positive correlation between the accumulation variations of zeatin (cZ), brassinolide (BL), salicylic acid (SA), 1-amino cyclopropane carboxylic acid (ACC), and jasmonic acid (JA) and flowering time. This means that blooming occurs earlier when the quantity of these substances in leaves increases. Abscisic acid (ABA), trans-zeatin-riboside (tZR), dihydrozeatin (dh-Z), and IP (N6-Isopentenyladenine) exhibit contrasting effects. Furthermore, both miR156 and miR172 play a crucial function in regulating flowering time in C. oleifera leaves by modulating the expression of SOC1, primarily through the miR156-SPL and miR172-AP2 pathways. These findings establish a strong basis for future research endeavors focused on examining the molecular network associated with the flowering period of C. oleifera and controlling flowering time management through external treatments.

AB  - The selection of sows that are reproductively fit and produce large litters of piglets is imperative for success in the pork industry. Currently, low heritability of reproductive and litter-related traits and unfavourable genetic correlations are slowing the improvement of pig selection efficiency. The integration of biomarkers as a supplement or alternative to the use of genetic markers may permit the optimization and increase of selection protocol efficiency. Metabolite biomarkers are an advantageous class of biomarkers that can facilitate the identification of cellular processes implicated in reproductive condition. Metabolism and metabolic biomarkers have been previously implicated in studies of female mammalian fertility, however a systematic analysis across multiple biofluids in infertile and high reproductive potential phenotypes has not been explored. In the current study, the serum, urinary and salivary metabolomes of infertile (INF) sows and high reproductive potential (HRP) sows with a live litter size >= 13 piglets were examined using LC-MS/MS techniques, and a data pipeline was used to highlight possible metabolite reproductive biomarkers discriminating the reproductive groups. The metabolomes of HRP and INF sows were distinct, including significant alterations in amino acid, fatty acid, membrane lipid and steroid hormone metabolism. Carnitines and fatty acid related metabolites were most discriminatory in separating and classifying the HRP and INF sows based on their biofluid metabolome. It appears that urine is a superior biofluid than saliva and serum for potentially predicting the reproductive potential level of a given female pig based on the performance of the resultant biomarker models. This study lays the groundwork for improving gilt and sow selection protocols using metabolomics as a tool for the prediction of reproductive potential.

AB  - Positive affect (PA) is not only associated with individuals' psychological and physical health, but also their cognitive processes. However, whether medial temporal lobe (MTL) and its subfields' volume/functional con-nectivity can explain individual variability in PA remains understudied. We investigated the morphological (i.e., grey matter volume; GMV) and functional characteristics (i.e., resting-state functional connectivity; rsFC) of PA with a combination of univariate and multivariate pattern analyses (MVPA) using a large sample of participants (n = 321). We simultaneously collected the T1-weighted (n = 321), high-resolution MTL T2-weighted, and resting-state functional imaging data (n = 209). The MTL and its subfields' volumes, including the CA1, CA2+3, DG, and subiculum (SUB), perirhinal cortex (PRC), and parahippocampus (PHC), were extracted using an automatic segmentation of hippocampal subfields (ASHS) software. The morphological results revealed that GMVs in the prefrontal-occipital and limbic (i.e., hippocampus, amygdala, and PHC) systems were associated with variability in PA at the whole-brain level using MVPA but not univariate analysis. Linear regression results further revealed a positive association between the MTL subfields' GMV, especially for the right PRC, and PA after controlling for several covariates. PRC-seed-based rsFC analyses further revealed that its couplings with the fronto-parietal-occipital system predicted PA in both univariate and MVPA. These findings provide novel insights into the neuroanatomical and functional substrates underlying human PA trait. Findings also suggest critical contributions of the MTL and its subfield of the perirhinal cortex, but not hippocampal subfields, as well as its functional coupling with the fronto-parietal control-system on the formation of PA.

AB  - Physiological tolerance in response to Yellow Sugarcane Aphid feeding remains an unexplored area in the sugar industry of Zimbabwe and elsewhere. Two treatments of aphid infestation (un-infested (control) and infested) were applied to seven sugarcane genotypes (00-1165, ZN 3 L, ZN 8, ZN 9, 96-1107, N14 and ZN 10). The treatments were laid out in a 7 x 2 factorial arrangement in a complete randomized block design (CRBD), replicated four times and carried out over summer and winter seasons. Highly significant differences (p < 0.001) were observed amongst the sugarcane varieties in percentage chlorophyll loss in control (sprayed) and infested (unsprayed) plots. Great increase in percentage chlorophyll loss (21.4%) was observed on ZN 10. Regression analysis displayed a highly significant (p < 0.001) strong positive correlation (r = 0.85) between chlorophyll loss and aphid number. Summer results showed highly significant differences (p < 0.001) in gas exchange responses in control and infested plots. Nevertheless, in YSA infested plots, 00-1165 recorded the highest compensatory photosynthetic rate (32.52), transpiration rate (4.32), and stomata conductance (218.2) when compared to the least obtained from ZN 10 and N14 at day 28. Significant positive correlations between; chlorophyll loss and photosynthesis (r = 0.44; p = 0.019) and between photosynthesis and aphid number were noticed (r = 0.57; p = 0.002). Ranking of sugarcane varieties was done according to YSA susceptibility; less susceptible (00-1165), moderate susceptible (ZN 3 L, ZN 8 and ZN 9) and highly susceptible (96-1107, N14 and ZN 10). Sugarcane growers should use YSA tolerant varieties as they exhibit physiological compensatory and maintaining behavior.

AB  - Background: Although elevation of the sinus can be considered a predictable procedure, it is nonetheless not free of complications, for which reason there is a constant search for new tools and techniques that may reduce these complications. The present study focused on maxillary sinus lifts performed on pig heads cadavers, using a new device with the balloon technique. Materials and Methods: Fifteen ex vivo adult pig heads were used in this experimental study. Sinus floor elevation was performed using the new balloon elevation control system, which consists of a syringe containing latex and serum as well as a system of burs for membrane access and control. Each lift was performed within a 3 min time frame while constant pressure was applied to allow the tissue to adapt to the tension. Results: In 100% of cases, perforations do not occur during aperture or in the elevation of the wall. In the global sample, there was histological elevation in 73.33% compared to 26.66% non-elevation (p = 0.0268). Conclusions: Within the limits of this study, the maxillary sinus lifts employing the new device and the balloon technique were minimally invasive procedures. The elevations achieved proved sufficient to allow future placement of implants of varying lengths and diameters without risk of perforating the membranes, even in the presence of crests of less than 1 mm.

AB  - Environmental enrichment (EE) is a significant approach to influencing brain function by altering the environment and changing living conditions and has been shown to modulate mood-related diseases, including depression. Among the elderly, depression is particularly prevalent and is often linked to social isolation. However, the specific role of EE in social isolation-related geriatric depression remains imprecise. This study was intended to explore the status of EE exposure in geriatric depression and to uncover its underlying mechanisms. We utilized 19-month-old male C57BL/6J mice, which are equivalent to humans aged 50-60 years, and induced depression through social isolation. After 2 weeks of social isolation, mice were identified as depressive by using the sugar preference test and then classified into either standard or enrichment environment groups for 4 weeks. Subsequently, conventional indices associated with depression, including neurogenesis, neurotrophic factors, and neuroinflammation, were measured. Results display that EE alleviated the depressive-like symptoms in elderly mice and enriched their social activities. Concurrently, EE regulated levels of certain neurotransmitters in the hippocampus, including the systems of glutamate, tyrosine, and histamine. Moreover, the ability of neurogenesis also increased in the hippocampus of EE mice. At the neuroinflammation level, the activation of Natural Killer (NK) cells and ARG1+ microglia is considered a major contributor to mediating the effects of EE-regulated geriatric depression. Collectively, these results underline the importance of EE in the treatment of geriatric depression and partially elucidate its underlying mechanism, offering valuable suggestions for treating social isolation--related depression via environmental modulation.

AB  - Simple Summary Alpacas in central Europe often suffer from vitamin D deficiency due to lower UV radiation. Many alpacas are therefore additionally treated with vitamin D-3. As vitamin D-3 contents can be given in either mu g or IU (international units) and these units had been mixed up in a textbook, several alpacas were poisoned and given 40 times more vitamin D-3 than intended. Toxicological levels of vitamin D result in an increase in the level of calcium and phosphate in the blood, thus calcification in various organs, leading to organ dysfunction. In this study, three affected alpaca crias were examined in more detail. Severe changes in the kidneys, lungs and liver were found. In addition, kidney function was evaluated. Alpacas kept in Central Europe are often deficient in vitamin D-3, which is supplemented orally or by injection by the owners or veterinarians. Vitamin D-3 can be specified in two different units (IU and mu g), which differ by a factor of 40. By mixing up these units, an overdosage can be induced. In this study, three alpaca crias were examined after vitamin D-3 intoxication, with particular reference to kidney function. All three animals developed non-specific clinical alterations 1-2 weeks after a vitamin D-3 overdose of approximately 40 times. Plasma of the animals revealed several alterations. The main findings were severe azotemia, hypercalcemia and hyperphosphatemia, 15 days after treatment. Kidney function analysis (endogenous creatinine clearance) in two of the crias revealed severe glomerular damage. All crias died despite intensive treatment within 23 days after vitamin D-3 treatment. Necropsy revealed calcification in different organs, mainly the kidneys, lungs and liver. Since nine other crias in the same group were treated with comparable doses of vitamin D-3 and no clinical signs were observed in these animals, it is concluded that individual animals show different levels of sensitivity to vitamin D-3.

AB  - Simple Summary The post-weaning period presents various challenges to the continuity of the rabbits' production. The use of natural plant secondary compounds is among the promising feed additives to enhance the rabbit's health status and growth performance. Extracts of apricot and peach kernels contain high biological phytochemicals that possess anti-oxidative and anti-microbial activities components, therefore, they and their mixture can be used as feed additives for weaned rabbits. The treatment of growing rabbits with apricot, peach, and their mixture enhanced growth performance. This enhancement was fit with improvements in nutrient digestibility, blood antioxidant indicators, and immune response of growing rabbits treated with the mixture. These results indicate the effectiveness of the mixture of apricot and peach kernel extract as a feed additive for the growing rabbits. This study assessed the effects of the kernel extracts of apricot (AKE; Prunus armeniaca) and peach (PKE; Prunus persica), and their mixture (Mix) on growth efficiency, feed utilization, cecum activity, and health status, of growing rabbits. Weaned male New Zealand White rabbits at six weeks old [n = 84, 736 +/- 24 SE g body weight (BW)] were randomly allotted to four dietary groups. The first group received no feed additives (control), the second and third groups received 0.3 mL/kg BW of AKE and PKE, respectively, and the fourth group received a mixture of AKE and PKE (1:1) at 0.3 mL/kg BW (Mix). Results indicated that 2(3h)-Furanone, 5-Heptyldihydro was found in abundance in both extracts, while 1,1-Dimethyl-2 Phenylethy L Butyrate and 1,3-Dioxolane, and 4-Methyl-2-Phenyl- were the most components detected in AKE and Cyclohexanol and 10-Methylundecan-4-olide were found in abundance in PKE. All the experimental extracts enhanced (p < 0.05) the growth performance, cecal fermentation parameters, and cecal L. acidiophilus and L. cellobiosus count, while PKE and the mixture treatments presented the highest (p = 0.001) total weight gain and average weight gain without affecting the feed intake. Rabbits that received the mix treatment had the highest (p < 0.05) nutrient digestibility and nitrogen retained, and the lowest (p = 0.001) cecal ammonia concentration. All the experimental extracts enhanced (p < 0.05) the blood antioxidant indicators (including total antioxidant capacity, catalase, and superoxide dismutase concentrations), and immune response of growing rabbits. In general, fruit kernel extracts are rich sources of bioactive substances that can be used as promising feed additives to promote the growth and health status of weaned rabbits.

AB  - Background: Zhi-Zi-Chi-Tang (ZZCT) is an effective traditional Chinese medicinal formula. ZZCT has been used for the treatment of depression for centuries. Its clinical efficacy in relieving depression has been confirmed. However, the molecular mechanisms of ZZCT regarding neuroplasticity in the pathogenesis of depression have not yet been elucidated.
   Purpose: The present study aimed to examine the effects of ZZCT on neuroplasticity in mice exposed to chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS), and to explore the underlying molecular mechanisms.
   Methods: For this purpose, a murine model of depression was established using the CUMS procedure. Following the intragastric administration of ZZCT or fluoxetine, classic behavioral experiments were performed to observe the efficacy of ZZCT as an antidepressant. Immunofluorescence was used to label and quantify microtubule-associated protein (MAP2) and postsynaptic density protein (PSD95) in the hippocampus. Golgi staining was applied to visualize the dendritic spine density of neurons in the hippocampi. Isolated hippocampal slices were prepared to induce long-term potentiation (LTP) in the CA1 area. The hippocampal protein expression levels of glycogen synthase kinase-3 beta (GSK-3 beta), p-GSK-3 beta (Ser9), cAMP response element binding protein (CREB), p-CREB (Ser133), brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and 14-3-3 zeta were detected using western blot analysis. The interaction of 14-3-3 zeta and p-GSK-3 beta (Ser9) was examined using co-immunoprecipitation. LV-shRNA was used to knockdown 14-3-3 zeta by an intracerebroventricular injection.
   Results: ZZCT (6 g/kg) and fluoxetine (20 mg/kg) alleviated depressive-like behavior, restored hippocampal MAP2(+) PSD95(+) intensity, and reversed the dendritic spine density of hippocampal neurons and LTP in the CA1 region of mice exposed to CUMS. Both low and high doses of ZZCT (3 and 6 g/kg) significantly promoted the binding of 14-3-3 zeta to p-GSK-3 beta (Ser9) in the hippocampus, and ZZCT (6 g/kg) significantly promoted the phosphorylation of GSK-3 beta Ser9 and CREB Ser133 in the hippocampus. ZZCT (3 and 6 g/kg) upregulated hip-pocampal BDNF expression in mice exposed to CUMS. LV-sh14-3-3 zeta reduced the antidepressant effects of ZZCT.
   Conclusion: ZZCT exerted antidepressant effects against CUMS-stimulated depressive-like behavior mice. The knockdown of 14-3-3 zeta using lentivirus confirmed that 14-3-3 zeta was involved in the ZZCT-mediated antide-pressant effects through GSK-3 beta/CREB/BDNF signaling. On the whole, these results suggest that the antide-pressant effects of ZZCT are attributed to restoring damage by neuroplasticity enhancement via the 14-3-3 zeta/ GSK-3 beta/CREB/BDNF signaling pathway.

AB  - Zoos are places open for a large number of visitors, adults and children, who can admire exotic as well as indigenous animal species. The premises for animals may contain pathogenic microbes, including those exhibiting antibiotic resistance. It poses a threat to people remaining within the zoo premises, both for animal keepers who meet animals on a daily basis and visitors who infrequently have contact with animals. There are almost no studies concerning the presence on the concentration of airborne bacteria, especially staphylococci and fecal bacteria in animal shelters in the zoo. There is no data about antibiotic resistance of staphylococci in these places. The results will enable to determine the scale of the threat that indicator bacteria from the bioaerosol pose to human health within zoo premises. This study conducted in rooms for 5 animals group (giraffes, camels, elephants, kangaroos, and Colobinae (species of monkey)) in the Silesian Zoological Garden in Chorzow (Poland). The bioaerosol samples were collected using a six-stage Andersen cascade impactor to assess the concentrations and size distribution of airborne bacteria. Staphylococci were isolated from bioaerosol and tested for antibiotic resistance. In our study, the highest contamination of staphylococci and fecal bacteria was recorded in rooms for camels and elephants, and the lowest in rooms for Colobinae. At least 2/3 of bacteria in bioaerosol constituted respirable fraction that migrates into the lower respiratory tract of the people. In investigated animal rooms, the greatest bacteria contribution was recorded for bioaerosol fraction sized 1.1-3.3 mu m. Bacterial concentrations were particularly strong in spring and autumn, what is related to shedding fur by animals. Among the isolated staphylococci which most often occurred were Staphylococcus succinus, S. sciuri, and S. vitulinus. The highest antibiotic resistance was noted in the case of Staphylococcus epidermidis, while the lowest for S. xylosus. In addition to standard cleaning of animal rooms, periodic disinfection should be considered. Cleaning should be carried out wet, which should reduce dust, and thus the concentrations of bacteria in the air of animal enclosures.

AB  - An epiphytic gammarid species, Apohyale sp., was abundant in the floating Ulva prolifera (U. prolifera), which forms large-scale green tides in the Yellow Sea (YSGT). Field observation and laboratory experiments were subsequently conducted to study the species identity, abundance, and grazing effects on the floating algal biomass. The abundance of Apohyale sp. showed great spatial variation and varied from 0.03 to 1.47 inds g(-1) in the YSGT. In average, each gram of Apohyale sp. body mass can consume 0.43 and 0.60 g algal mass of U. prolifera per day, and the grazing rates varied among the algae cultured with different nutritional seawaters. It was estimated that grazing of Apohyale sp. could efficiently reduce ~0.4 and 16.6% of the algal growth rates in Rudong and Qingdao, respectively. The U. prolifera fragments resulting from gnawing of Apohyale sp. had a higher growth rate and similar photosynthetic activities compared to the floating algae, indicating probably positive feedback on the floating algal biomass. This research corroborated the significant impact of Apohyale sp. on the floating algal mass of YSGT through the top-down control. However, further research is needed to understand the population dynamics of these primary predators and hence their correlation with the expansion or decline of YSGT, especially under the complex food webs in the southern Yellow Sea.

AB  - Hydrothermal carbonization (HTC) is increasingly considered as a promising method to deal with animal manure. Inevitably, using this method for treatment of animal manure led to large amount of hydrothermal liquid. However, the effect of temperature on the characteristics of liquid product that derived from hydrothermal carbonization of animal manure was still incompletely clear. In this study, three types of animal (chicken, dairy, and swine) manures were selected for hydrothermal carbonization at three different temperatures (200, 250, and 300 degrees C), and the liquid was collected for further analysis, aiming to investigate the effect of temperature on the liquid properties and its potential function as a soil-leaching agent. Results show that high temperature led to high pH, volatile phenol, organic-N and Cr3+ concentration of liquid, but low chroma, COD, inorganic-N and Cr6+ concentration of liquid. Moreover, the manure types, temperature, and their interaction significantly (P<0.001) influenced the selected liquid properties except for BOD based on the two-way analysis of variance, indicating the liquid properties depended on the manure types and temperature. In addition, the extraction of Cu from contaminated soil using the liquid (hydrothermal carbonization of dairy manure, swine manure, and chicken manure at 200 degrees C) increased by 125%, 178%, and 424%, respectively, compared to distilled water, indicating that liquid can be applied as a promising soil-leaching agent for heavy metal remediation.

AB  - Intermittent fasting (IF) is a promising strategy to counteract ageing shown to increase the number of adult-born neurons in the dentate gyrus of mice. However, it is unclear which steps of the adult neurogenesis process are regulated by IF. The number of adult neural stem cells (NSCs) decreases with age in an activation-dependent manner and, to counteract this loss, adult NSCs are found in a quiescent state which ensures their long-term maintenance. We aimed to determine if and how IF affects adult NSCs in the hippocampus. To identify the effects of every-other-day IF on NSCs and all following steps in the neurogenic lineage, we combined fasting with lineage tracing and label retention assays. We show here that IF does not affect NSC activation or maintenance and, that contrary to previous reports, IF does not increase neurogenesis. The same results are obtained regardless of strain, sex, diet length, tamoxifen administration or new-born neuron identification method. Our data suggest that NSCs maintain homeostasis upon IF and that this intervention is not a reliable strategy to increase adult neurogenesis.
   imageCombining genetic lineage tracing and label retention experiments, this study shows that every-other-day intermittent fasting does not affect adult neural stem cell behaviour and, despite previous encouraging data, is not a reliable strategy to promote adult hippocampal neurogenesis in mice.Night-time every-other-day intermittent fasting elicits a systemic fasting response in mice while preserving circadian activity.Intermittent fasting has no effect on the proliferation or maintenance of adult neural stem cells in the dentate gyrus.Irrespective of the mouse strain, sex, labelling method, diet length, or refeeding protocol evaluated in this work, intermittent fasting did not promote adult hippocampal neurogenesis.

AB  - The cabbage moth, Mamestra brassicae L. (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae), is a generalist insect pest of cruciferous crops. We tested glucosinolate induction by jasmonic acid (JA) and salicylic acid (SA), and by these phytohormones combined with feeding by M. brassicae larvae in four genotypes of kale, Brassica oleracea L. var. acephala (Brassicaceae). The genotypes tested had high glucobrassicin (genotype HGBS), low glucobrassicin (genotype LGBS), high sinigrin (genotype HSIN), and low sinigrin content (genotype LSIN). Application of JA increased indolic and total glucosinolate content in all kale genotypes 1, 3, and 9 days after treatment. For SA-treated plants, glucosinolate induction varied depending on the number of days after treatment and the genotype. Overall, herbivory by M. brassicae accentuated and attenuated the effects of JA and SA, respectively, on plant glucosinolate content. Larvae of M. brassicae gained less weight on leaves from plants treated with JA compared to leaves from control plants and plants treated with SA. In bioassays with leaf discs, a significant reduction of defoliation only occurred in JA-treated plants of the HSIN genotype. This research shows that previous herbivory alters the susceptibility of kale to M. brassicae and that induction of glucosinolates varies among kale genotypes differing in their glucosinolate content.

AB  - Zoo waste is a common problem in urban areas, as it overloads municipalities. To enhance the park's appeal, sustainability, and cleanliness, a pilot vermicomposting process was implemented as an alternative for organic waste disposal. It aimed to address the negative effects of poor organic waste management. Three types of pond water, namely hippopotamus, crocodile, and gharial, were recycled. Additionally, ostrich droppings and the nitrogenous compounds abundant in carnivore feces were utilized. The study sought to improve organic waste management and recycle pond water using exotic worms. Chemical and physical analyses were conducted on pond water and vermicompost obtained from Gandhi Zoological Park, revealing their high nutrient content. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy was employed to study the functional groups present in the compost and vermicompost, allowing the detection of vermicompost maturity. The biomass of exotic earthworms, as well as the count of cocoons, juveniles, and adults, was assessed during different seasons of the year. This approach facilitated the recycling of pond water and the reduction of organic waste within the zoo premises. It involved the symbiotic cooperation of earthworms and bacterial colonies, transforming the waste into a high-quality product with balanced macro nutrients. The novelty of the study lies in its focus on nutrient recycling in pond water, ostrich droppings, and vermicomposting of organic waste from carnivores.

AB  - Nandrolone (Ndn) and boldenone (Bdn), the synthetic testosterone analogues with strong anabolic effects, despite being recognized as potentially carcinogenic compounds, are commonly abused by athletes and bodybuilders, which includes women, worldwide. This study tested the hypothesis that different doses of Ndn and Bdn can initiate neoplastic transformation of porcine ovarian putative stem cells (poPSCs). Immunomagnetically isolated poPSCs were expanded ex vivo in the presence of Ndn or Bdn, for 7 and 14 days. Results show that pharmacological doses of both Ndn and Bdn, already after 7 days of poPSCs culture, caused a significant increase of selected, stemness-related markers of cancer cells: CD44 and CD133. Notably, Ndn also negatively affected poPSCs growth not only by suppressing their proliferation and mitochondrial respiration but also by inducing apoptosis. This observation shows, for the first time, that chronic exposure to Ndn or Bdn represents a precondition that might enhance risk of poPSCs neoplastic transformation. These studies carried out to accomplish detailed molecular characterization of the ex vivo expanded poPSCs and their potentially cancerous derivatives (PCDs) might be helpful to determine their suitability as nuclear donor cells (NDCs) for further investigations focused on cloning by somatic cell nuclear transfer (SCNT). Such investigations might also be indispensable to estimate the capabilities of nuclear genomes inherited from poPSCs and their PCDs to be epigenetically reprogrammed (dedifferentiated) in cloned pig embryos generated by SCNT. This might open up new possibilities for biomedical research aimed at more comprehensively recognizing genetic and epigenetic mechanisms underlying not only tumorigenesis but also reversal/retardation of pro-tumorigenic intracellular events.

AB  - Although age-related changes in the gut microbiome of pigs have been extensively studied, the dynamic patterns of fecal microbiota and SCFAs during the gestation-to-weaning period in sows remain poorly characterized. We aim to characterize the changes in fecal microbiota and SCFAs from pregnancy to weaning, and to investigate their associations with maternal weight gain during gestation. We systematically collected 100 fecal samples at four time points (day 30 of pregnancy (T1), 1-2 days before delivery (T2), day 10 after delivery (T3), and day 21 of weaning stage (T3)), and measured the body weight of sows at T1 (132 kg +/- 10.8) and T2 (205 kg +/- 12.1). The primary nutrient components of the diets during the gestation and lactation periods are summarized. All fecal samples were subjected to 16S rRNA gene sequencing. We found that a high proportion of crude fiber (bran) is a key feature of the gestation diet, which may affect enterotype shifts and gut microbial composition. Sows fed a high-fiber diet showed significant enrichment of gut microbiota, including genera such as Prevotellaceae_UCG-003, Prevotellaceae_NK3B31_group, and Prevotella_9 during the gestational period (LDA score > 2). Moreover, Eubacterium_coprostanoligenes_group (average relative abundance: 5.5%) and Lachnospiraceae_NK4A136_group (average relative abundance: 2.5%) were the dominant bacteria during the lactation stage. Fecal propionate and butyrate levels were lowest in late gestation, and propionate negatively and acetate positively correlated with body weight change (p < 0.05). Additionally, certain Prevotella taxa were associated with arachidonic acid metabolism and acetate production (p < 0.05). Our study identified key microbial communities across four stages from gestation to weaning and revealed that dietary patterns can shape the sow gut microbiota. Furthermore, we observed significant correlations between SCFAs and body weight change during pregnancy. These findings provide a scientific basis and theoretical support for future strategies aimed at modulating gut microbiota and targeting SCFAs to improve maternal health and productivity throughout the gestation-to-weaning period.

AB  - Ethnopharmacological relevance: Panax notoginseng flowers, which are the buds of the traditional Chinese medicinal herb Sanqi, are widely used in China for their cough-ameliorating properties, with demonstrated therapeutic effects in the treatment of both acute and chronic coughs. However, both the antitussive mechanism and active compound basis of P. notoginseng flowers remain poorly understood. Aim of the study: We investigated the antitussive effects of P. notoginseng flowers, identified the bioactive constituents responsible for alleviating cough symptoms, and elucidated the underlying pharmacological mechanisms. Materials and methods: We analyzed the major chemical constituents of aqueous extracts of P. notoginseng flowers using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry and quantitatively analyzed the key component, 20S-ginsenoside Rh2, using high-performance liquid chromatography. Using a cough reflex model in healthy mice and an ovalbumin-induced, highly sensitive guinea pig cough model, we verified the suppressive effects of P. notoginseng flowers and their saponin constituents on coughing. Furthermore, we explored the mechanisms of action of the key ion channels, NaV1.7 and TRPV1, using whole-cell patch-clamp techniques and molecular docking. Finally, the therapeutic mechanisms of P. notoginseng flowers on pathological cough were revealed using hematoxylin and eosin staining, immunohistochemistry, and western blotting. Results: The active components of P. notoginseng flowers were primarily protopanaxadiol-type saponins, among which 20S-ginsenoside Rh2 had the highest content (51.46 mg/g). In the mouse model, P. notoginseng flowers exhibited antitussive effects comparable to those of pentoxyverine citrate. Although its main saponin component, 20S-ginsenoside Rh2, showed slightly weaker effects, it still demonstrated concentration-dependent inhibition of channel activity. The whole-cell patch-clamp technique and virtual molecular docking showed that Rh2 might exert its effects by directly binding to the NaV1.7 and TRPV1 channels. In the guinea pig model, P. notoginseng flowers and their saponin components not only reduced cough frequency and prolonged the latency period before cough onset, but also significantly inhibited tracheal and pulmonary inflammation and the overexpression of TRPV1. Conclusions: 20S-Ginsenoside Rh2, the major bioactive saponin in P. notoginseng flowers, exhibits potent antitussive effects. The potential mechanism of action of 20S-Ginsenoside Rh2 in the treatment of cough may involve inhibiting NaV1.7 and TRPV1 channel currents through direct binding to core protein active sites and downregulating TRPV1 expression.

AB  - The use of neural networks for plant disease identification is a hot topic of current research. However, unlike the classification of ordinary objects, the features of plant diseases frequently vary, resulting in substantial intra-class variation; in addition, the complex environmental noise makes it more challenging for the model to categorize the diseases. In this paper, an attention and multidimensional feature fusion neural network (AMDFNet) is proposed for Camellia oleifera disease classification network based on multidimensional feature fusion and attentional mechanism, which improves the classification ability of the model by fusing features to each layer of the Inception structure and enhancing the fused features with attentional enhancement. The model was compared with the classical convolutional neural networks GoogLeNet, Inception V3, ResNet50, and DenseNet121 and the latest disease image classification network DICNN in a self-built camellia disease dataset. The experimental results show that the recognition accuracy of the new model reaches 86.78% under the same experimental conditions, which is 2.3% higher than that of GoogLeNet with a simple Inception structure, and the number of parameters is reduced to one-fourth compared to large models such as ResNet50. The method proposed in this paper can be run on mobile with higher identification accuracy and a smaller model parameter number.

AB  - The persistence of maladaptive heroin-associated memory, which is triggered by drug-related stimuli that remind the individual of the drug's pleasurable and rewarding effects, can impede abstinence efforts. Cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (Cdk5), a neuronal serine/threonine protein kinase that plays a role in multiple neuronal functions, has been demonstrated to be involved in drug addiction and learning and memory. Here, we aimed to investigate the role of cdk5 activity in the basolateral amygdala (BLA) in relapse to heroin seeking, using a self-administration rat model. Male rats underwent 10 days of heroin self-administration training, during which an active nose poke resulted in an intravenous infusion of heroin that was accompanied by a cue. The rats then underwent nose poke extinction for 10 days, followed by subsequent tests of heroin-seeking behaviour. We found that intra-BLA infusion of & beta;-butyrolactone (100 ng/side), a Cdk5 inhibitor, administered 5 min after reactivation, led to a subsequent decrease in heroin-seeking behaviour. Further experiments demonstrated that the effects of & beta;-butyrolactone are dependent on reactivated memories, temporal-specific and long-lasting on relapse of heroin-associated memory. Results provide suggestive evidence that the activity of Cdk5 in BLA is critical for heroin-associated memory and that the specific inhibitor, & beta;-butyrolactone, may hold potential as a substance for the treatment of heroin abuse.

AB  - This study is constituted of the chemical activation of camelina meal (CM) biochar and the utilization of these activated carbon for the adsorption of perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) from water. Camelina meal, a sustainable agro-based byproduct, underwent slow pyrolysis and subsequent chemical activation with potassium carbonate (K2CO3), potassium hydroxide (KOH), and sodium hydroxide (NaOH). Among these chemical activating agents, KOH emerged as the one of most efficient activating agents, yielding activated carbon with superior surface properties and significantly higher carbon content. After the screening of the activating agents, a central composite design (CCD) was employed to optimize the critical constraints like temperature (600-900 degrees C), activation time (60-120 min), and KOH-to-feed ratio (0.5-1.5), with the objective of maximizing the surface area and adsorption capacities of the activated carbon samples. The activated carbon exhibited a substantial enhancement in surface area and PFOA adsorption efficacy. Optimal adsorption of PFOA was achieved using activated carbon produced at 800 degrees C with an activation time of 60 min and a KOH-to-feed ratio of 1.5. This material exhibited a surface area of 1558.4 m2/g and demonstrated a PFOA removal efficiency of 92.3%. The findings underscore the efficacy of chemically activated camelina meal biochar as an ecological adsorbent for the remediation of PFOA-polluted water.

AB  - Pterophyllum ptilum Harris 1932 is a distinctive fossil plant species that occurred exclusively in the Late Triassic but in a broad geographic distribution ranging from North Europe to East Asia. Thus, this species has long been considered significant in stratigraphic correlation of non-marine sequences. However, previous studies of P. ptilum have been mostly focused on the morphological characteristics of its foliages, a complete biological feature, particularly the epidermal anatomy, remains poorly understood. Here, we show detailed epidermal anatomies of P. ptilum based on well-preserved cuticular specimens from the Upper Triassic of Sichuan Province, Southwest China. Pterophyllum ptilum is characterised by petiolate leaves with small lateral leaflets, which possess contracted bases and bicuspid apices with five to eight parallel veins and syndetocheilic type stomata. In the leaflets, the stomata are only present on the abaxial surface, whereas the stomata are present on both the abaxial and adaxial surfaces of the rachis. Both the adaxial and abaxial leaflet surfaces can be divided into costal and intercostal fields. The epidermal cells in the costal fields are elongated rectangular but shortened rectangular in the intercostal fields. The stomata are only present in the intercostal fields of the abaxial leaflet surface. On the rachis, the epidermal cells are all elongated rectangular and arranged tightly in vertical files. Based on a thorough comparison of fossil records and observation of extant cycads, we propose that the bicuspid leaflet apices of P. ptilum may resulted from herbivorous arthropod apical feeding damage. Fossil records reveal that P. ptilum were primarily preserved in coastal plain, deltaic, and tidal flat environments in the South China Block; the absence of papillae and hairs in the present specimens may suggest a relatively more humid local environment.

AB  - For threatened species that occur across multi-use landscapes, a coordinated cross-tenure management approach is desirable to achieve long-term conservation outcomes. To provide a comprehensive understanding of the progress towards achieving conservation priorities for the greater bilby (Macrotis lagotis) in the Pilbara region of Western Australia (WA), and inform ongoing research and funding investment, we review a research program that has focused on the species over the past decade. Priorities were initially established at a stakeholder workshop in 2013, and research targeting key areas has greatly enhanced ecological knowledge of the bilby in the Pilbara and elsewhere in WA. Highlights include the development of a non-invasive scat DNA-based abundance monitoring technique, an improved understanding of habitat use and diet, including the importance of Acacia spp. that host root-dwelling larvae, and the threat posed by introduced predators. Proposed future research directions focus on better understanding habitat requirements and the association between key food resources and fire, evaluating genetic structure and gene flow at the landscape-scale and examining threat interactions. Management to mitigate a range of threats including introduced predators, grazing livestock/feral herbivores and fire is recommended, with consideration for an integrated approach.

We thank the Mugarinya Community Association and Yandeyarra Rangers, Nullagine Community School and members of the Warralong community for their assistance with bilby monitoring, field surveys and threat management within the Pilbara. The Pilbara Bilby Research Program (PBRP) was supported through offset funding from Fortescue Metals Group, Millennium Minerals and Roy Hill. The 2013 Bilby Workshop hosted by the then Department of Parks and Wildlife (now DBCA), was undertaken in collaboration with the then Department of Environment and sponsored by Aurizon and Buru Energy. DBCA has worked in partnership with universities and other stakeholders, including environmental consultancies, CSIRO and Traditional Owners to deliver the PBRP. This review is derived from a Departmental report, which was prepared for the Department of Water and Environmental Regulation (DWER) (see Northover et al. 2023). A section of this report was also summarised in another Departmental report, also prepared for DWER (https://www.wa.gov.au/system/files/2023-08/summary-of-knowledge-for-six-faunal-species-that-are-mnes-in-the-pilbara_final-report.pdf). 'Guidelines for surveys to detect the presence of bilbies, and assess the importance of habitat in Western Australia' was prepared by DBCA in association with Richard Southgate (Envisage Environmental) and Mike Bamford (Bamford Consulting Ecologists). The standardised data sheet for 2-ha sign plot surveys was developed in partnership with the World Wildlife Fund and Environs Kimberley with advice from experts including Richard Southgate. Faecal samples obtained from Kanyana Wildlife Rehabilitation Centre were used to refine faecal DNA extraction methods and conduct DNA degradation trials. We would like to express our gratitude to those that have contributed to bilby recovery, either through their employment, student projects or volunteer involvement, with particular thanks to Frank Morris. We would also like to acknowledge the support of Rangelands NRM, Main Roads WA, Greening Australia and DBCA Karijini National Park Rangers for their assistance with logistics.

AB  - Bud paradormancy has been widely studied in perennial deciduous woody species, but little attention has been paid to paradormancy set and release in perennial evergreen tree species. Here, shoot bud paradormancy in Camellia sinensis cv. Huangdan was studied by untargeted metabolomics. We found that after removing the axillary floral buds for one day, the paradormancy of the axillary shoot buds was released. The paradormant shoot buds had lower glucose-1-phosphate, fructose, and D-(-)-tagatofuranose content but higher trehalose, raffinose, galactinol, and alpha-D-xylopyranose content. Meanwhile, high levels of asparagine were accumulated. Flavonoids were differentially accumulated, and higher levels of three flavone glycosides (C-diglucosylapigenin, apigenin 6-C-glucoside 8-C-arabinoside, and prunin) and four proanthocyanidins (Procyanidin trimer isomer 1, Galloylprocyanidin dimer, Procyanidin trimer isomer 3, and Galloylated trimeric proanthocyanidin) were accumulated in paradormant shoot buds. During the paradormancy-to-growth transition, all these metabolites were reversed. These data suggest that the reconfiguration of carbon, nitrogen, and flavonoid metabolism could be an important aspect for the paradormancy set and release of tea axillary shoot buds. This study provided novel insights into shoot bud paradormancy set and release in a perennial evergreen tree species.

AB  - Piglets afflicted with Porcine Epidemic Diarrhea Virus (PEDV) experience severe diarrhea and elevated death rates, leading to substantial financial losses in the pig farming sector. The objective of this study is to investigate the impact of polyphenols on PEDV within Vero cells by utilizing different methodologies to evaluate their antiPEDV effect. By producing 30 polyphenols, we have discovered that No.2, No.5, No.7 and No.17 exhibit properties that make them effective against PEDV, serving as potential drugs. The findings showed that in a clear dose-dependent manner, the mRNA levels of PEDV were significantly inhibited in the high, middle, and low-dose groups of No.2, No.5, No.7 and No.17, when compared to the PEDV control. The four tested polyphenols significantly inhibited the levels of PEDV N contents and viral titers. Furthermore, concentration of cytotoxicity 50 % (CC50) values for No.2, No.5, No.7 and No.17 polyphenols were 42.84 mu M, 16.78 mu M, 39.01 mu M and 28.86 mu M, respectively, demonstrating the safety of these medications in clinical environments. While they exert their anti-PEDV activity all specifically at the viral replication stage. Collectively, these findings indicate that the four examined polyphenols could efficiently modulate the immune response against PEDV and hold promise for utilization in antiviral treatments.

AB  - Simple Summary Consultation with sheep producers in Australia revealed that understanding the impact of the number of triplet-bearing ewes in a paddock at lambing, known as the mob size, on the survival of their lambs was an important research priority. Previous research has demonstrated that smaller mob sizes at lambing improve the survival of single- and especially twin-born lambs. Therefore, we expected that lambing triplet-bearing ewes in smaller mobs would increase the survival of their lambs. Research was conducted on 12 commercial sheep farms across southern Australia between 2019 and 2021, with three farms used in two years of the experiment. Adult, triplet-bearing ewes were randomly allocated into one of two treatments, 'High' or 'Low' mob size, at about 15 days before the start of lambing. We found that lamb survival was significantly greater for lambs born in the Low compared with the High mob size treatments. Analysis of the effect of the actual mob sizes showed that reducing mob size at lambing by 10 triplet-bearing ewes increased the survival of their lambs by 1.5%. Lambing triplet-bearing ewes in smaller mobs will therefore be included in management guidelines for producers as a strategy to improve the survival of triplet-born lambs. Industry consultation in Australia revealed that the potential impact of the mob size of ewes during lambing on the survival of triplet-born lambs was an important research priority. Previous research has demonstrated that smaller mob sizes at lambing improve the survival of single- and especially twin-born lambs, regardless of ewe stocking rate. Therefore, we hypothesised that lambing triplet-bearing ewes in smaller mobs, regardless of stocking rate, will increase the survival of their lambs. Research sites were established on 12 commercial sheep farms across southern Australia between 2019 and 2021. One farm used Merinos whilst the remainder of the farms used non-Merino breeds, consisting of composite ewes joined to composite or terminal sires. Three of the farms were used in two years of the experiment. Adult, triplet-bearing ewes were randomly allocated into one of two treatments, 'High' or 'Low' mob size, at an average of 135 days from the start of joining. Ewe and lamb survival were assessed between allocation to treatments and lamb marking. Lamb survival was significantly greater for lambs born in the Low (65.6%) compared with the High (56.6%) mob size treatments (p < 0.001). There was no effect of mob size at lambing on the mortality of triplet-bearing ewes. Analysis of the effect of the actual mob sizes showed that reducing the mob size at lambing by 10 triplet-bearing ewes increased the survival of their lambs to marking by 1.5% (p < 0.001). This study has shown that the survival of triplet-born lambs can be improved by lambing triplet-bearing ewes in smaller mobs regardless of stocking rate when ranging from 0.7-13 ewes/ha.

AB  - Hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL) is a promising thermochemical process for converting sludge into biocrude. However, the effective utilization of other HTL byproducts, such as hydrochar (HC) and an aqueous phase (HTL-AP), remains a significant challenge. This study investigates the synergistic utilization of HTL-AP and HC in anaerobic digestion (AD) for effective biogas production. HTL experiments were conducted at three temperatures (280 degrees C, 330 degrees C, and 370 degrees C). The higher HTL temperatures increased the biocrude yield while reducing HC and AP production. The methane production in AD was influenced by the HTL-AP composition and the presence of HC, with the highest cumulative methane production (327 +/- 1.01 mL/g VS) observed for AP produced at 280 degrees C with HC addition. The addition of HC improved methane production by 25% at 280 degrees C, 29% at 330 degrees C, and 19% at 370 degrees C compared to reactors without HC. HC amendment increased the relative abundance of Firmicutes, Clostridium, and Methanobacterium, supporting improved microbial syntrophic interactions, particularly at 330 degrees C. The results further suggested that HC might also facilitate direct interspecies electron transfer (DIET), enhancing methane production by promoting electron exchange between syntrophic bacteria and methanogens. These findings highlight the potential of co-utilizing HTL byproducts in AD as a sustainable strategy for sludge management and bioenergy recovery.

AB  - Obesity is a global health crisis linked to numerous adverse outcomes including cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes, cancer and cognitive decline. This study investigated the sex-specific effects of monosodium glutamate (MSG)-induced obesity on learning, memory, anxiety-like behavior, oxidative stress, and genotoxicity in rats. In 32 neonatal Wistar albino rats, subcutaneous MSG injections were administered to induce obesity. Both male and female obese rats displayed significant abdominal fat accumulation, with a more pronounced increase in females. Cognitive assessments using the Morris water maze test revealed substantial impairments in learning and memory in both sexes, although no significant sex-related differences were observed. Anxiety-like behavior remained unaffected by obesity in both sexes, as indicated by behavioral tests. Oxidative stress in the hippocampus, measured by total oxidant and antioxidant levels, did not show significant alterations. However, the study found genotoxic effects in female obese rats, indicated by DNA damage, whereas male rats did not exhibit such effects. The results suggest that MSG-induced obesity negatively impacts cognitive function and causes genotoxicity, particularly in females, highlighting the potential sex-specific vulnerabilities in obesity-related pathologies. This research provides valuable insights into the cognitive and genetic consequences of obesity, with implications for understanding complex biological mechanisms across sexes.

AB  - Yes-associated protein (YAP) is a mechanosensory protein that serves as a critical transcriptional coactivator involved in various cellular processes. Thus, the precise regulation of YAP is vital for effectively manipulating cellular functions. Despite small molecular inhibitors and siRNA being available, these approaches often fail to achieve precise and reversible regulation of YAP dynamics within complex biological systems. This often leads to suboptimal therapeutic results or collateral damage to healthy tissues. Here, we introduce a method for quantitative and reversible regulation of YAP through nanoparticle-mediated magnetothermal stimulation of F-actin, which is crucial for transmitting mechanical signals to YAP. We utilized actin-binding peptide-modified ultrasmall zinc-doped ferrite nanoparticles to specifically and effectively disrupt intracellular F-actin structures by generating localized heat upon exposure to an alternating magnetic field (AMF). In our in vitro studies, increasing the AMF intensity from 0 to 313 Oe led to a progressive deterioration of F-actin integrity, which was defined as Fint. Fint gradually decreased from 0.91 to 0.38 as the AMF intensity increased from 0 to 313 Oe. Concurrently, YAP nuclear localization also decreased, with the most rapid decline occurring within the range of 243-313 Oe. Importantly, cells were able to completely F-actin self-repair within 24 h, allowing YAP to re-enter the nucleus. This ability facilitates the quantitative and reversible control over YAP nuclear translocation. Further in vivo studies using MCF-7 tumor-bearing mouse models demonstrated the efficacy of this method in inhibiting glycolysis, reducing the 'Warburg effect', and reprogramming the tumor metabolic microenvironment. These results not only provide a promising strategy for precise manipulation of YAP nuclear localization but also establish a therapeutic framework for treating intractable diseases driven by YAP dysregulation.

AB  - BackgroundOxidative stress and inflammation are pivotal in pathogenesis of brain ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) injury. This study evaluated neuroprotective effects of nerolidol (NRD) on asprosin (ASP), spexin (SPX), and DARS2 expressions in myocardial infarction (MI) induced cerebral I/R injury, and systemic inflammatory responses by measuring serum cytokine levels.Methods and resultsTwenty-eight Wistar rats were divided into: Control, MI (200 mg/kg isoproterenol), NRD (100 mg/kg/day), and MI + NRD groups. After 14 days, brain cortex tissues were analyzed histopathologically and immunohistochemically, while serum TAS, TOS, and cytokines were measured via ELISA. Histopathological examination revealed severe cortical damage in MI rats, which was significantly attenuated by NRD treatment. Immunohistochemistry showed marked upregulation of ASP, SPX, and DARS2 in the MI group, with NRD normalizing SPX/DARS2 and partially reducing ASP. Serum analysis revealed comprehensive therapeutic effects of NRD, effectively counteracting the metabolic and inflammatory disturbances caused by MI. The treatment completely restored depleted Metrnl levels to normal values, demonstrating its metabolic regulatory capacity. NRD also showed potent anti-inflammatory action, significantly lowering elevated levels of key pro-inflammatory cytokines while maintaining a balanced immune response. Furthermore, it effectively corrected the oxidative imbalance characteristic of I/R injury, normalizing both oxidant and antioxidant markers to near-control levels. NRD effectively reduces cerebral I/R injury after MI by combining antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and metabolic regulatory actions. It normalizes Metrnl, cytokines, and oxidative stress markers while modulating ASP/SPX/DARS2 pathways, suggesting their role in both injury and recovery.ConclusionsThese findings highlight the potential of NRD in preventing post-MI brain damage and the need for further research on optimal dosing and mechanistic pathways.

AB  - Dominance hierarchies are common in social mammals, especially primates. The formation of social hierarchies is conducive to solving the problem of the allocation of scarce resources among individuals. From August 2015 to July 2016, we observed a wild, provisioned Yunnan snub-nosed monkey (Rhinopithecus bieti) group at Xiangguqing in Baimaxueshan National Nature Reserve, Yunnan Province, China. Aggressive and submissive behaviors were used to investigate dominance hierarchies between female individuals in the same one-male unit (OMU), and the grooming reciprocity index was used to detect reciprocal relationships between these females within the OMU. The results showed that loose social hierarchies exist among the females in each OMU, and more dominant individuals have higher grooming incomes. These results are consistent with the aggressive-submissive hypothesis and the resource control hypothesis.

AB  - Transgenerational plasticity in plants is an increasingly recognized phenomenon, yet it is mostly unclear whether transgenerational plasticity is relevant to both the fitness of the plant and its interacting species. Using monoclonal strains of the giant duckweed (Spirodela polyrhiza) and its native herbivore, the waterlily aphid (Rhopalosiphum nymphaeae), we assessed whether pre-treating plants with copper excess, both indoors and outdoors, induces transgenerational plasticity in plant defences that alter plant and herbivore fitness. Outdoors, copper pre-treatment tended to increase plant growth rates under recurring copper excess. Indoors, copper pre-treatment either increased or decreased plant growth rates under recurring conditions, depending on the plant genotype. Copper pre-treatment induced anthocyanins that protected plants against copper toxicity, and these elevated levels were transgenerationally retained. Copper pre-treatment also transgenerationally increased the levels of 12-oxo-phytodienoic acid (OPDA), a jasmonate precursor. Nevertheless, aphids grew up to 50% better when the plants were pre-treated with copper. The increased aphid growth was likely caused by transgenerationally elevated OPDA levels, as aphids grew better when jasmonates were externally applied to plants. Taken together, this study shows that transgenerational plasticity is relevant to both plant and herbivore fitness, which highlights the role of transgenerational plasticity in plant evolution and species interactions.

AB  - Simple Summary The virulence factors and pathogenesis of S. suis are inconclusive. Here, the associated proteins, or their derived peptides, involved in the survival of S. suis when simulated with a blood environment are demonstrated. The results reveal the derived peptides or proteins of S. suis potentially serving as the putative virulence factors. Further studies based on our findings could be used to fulfill the knowledge gap of S. suis pathogenesis. Streptococcus suis (S. suis) is a zoonotic pathogen causing severe streptococcal disease worldwide. S. suis infections in pigs and humans are frequently associated with the virulent S. suis serotype 2 (SS2). Though various virulence factors of S. suis have been proposed, most of them were not essentially accounted for in the experimental infections. In the present study, we compared the peptidomes of highly virulent SS2 and SS14 in humans, the swine causative serotypes SS7 and SS9, and the rarely reported serotypes SS25 and SS27, and they were cultured in a specified culture medium containing whole blood to simulate their natural host environment. LC-MS/MS could identify 22 unique peptides expressed in the six S. suis serotypes. Under the host-simulated environment, peptides from the ABC-type phosphate transport system (SSU05_1106) and 30S ribosomal protein S2 (rpsB) were detected in the peptidome of virulent SS2 and SS14. Therefore, we suggest that these two proteins or their derived peptides might be involved in the survival of S. suis when simulated with a blood environment.

AB  - Testosterone is a key crucial hormone synthesized by steroidogenic enzymes that initiate and maintain spermatogenesis and secondary sexual characteristics in adult males. The taste receptor family 1 subunit 3 (T1R3) is reported to be associated with male reproduction. T1R3 can regulate the expressions of steroidogenic enzymes and affect testosterone synthesis. In this study, we addressed the question of whether the expression of steroid synthase was associated with T1R3 and its downstream-tasting molecules during testicular development. The results showed an overall upward trend in testosterone and morphological development in testes from Congjiang Xiang pigs from pre-puberty to sexual maturity. Gene expression levels of testicular steroidogenic acute regulatory protein (StAR), 3ll-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (3fl-HSD), cytochrome P450c17 (CYP17A1) and 17ll-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (17fl-HSD) were increased from pre -puberty to sexual maturity. Protein expression changes of CYP17A1 and 3ll-HSD were consistent with mRNA. The relative abundance of tasting molecules (TAS1R3, phospholipase Cll2, PLCfl2) was increased from pre-puberty to puberty (P < 0.05), with no further significant changes in expression from puberty to sexual maturity. Steroidogenic enzymes (3ll-HSD and CYP17A1) were strongly detected in Leydig cells from pre-puberty to sexual maturity, while tasting molecules were localized in Leydig cells and spermatogenic cells. Correlation analysis showed that the genes mentioned above (except for PLCfl2) were positively correlated with testosterone levels and morphological characteristics of the testes at different developmental stages of Congjiang Xiang pigs. These results suggest that steroidogenic enzymes regulate testosterone synthesis and testicular development, and that taste receptor T1R3, but not PLCll2, may associate with this process.

AB  - The study aimed to evaluate and compare the co-digestion of swine wastewater (SW) and other co-substrates: grass residue (GR), food waste (FW), and poultry litter (PL). The comparisons were performed using the biochemical methane potential (BMP) test. The maximum accumulated methane (CH4) production was submitted to a joint analysis of variance. Tukey's test (alpha = 0.05) was used to compare the results of the treatments, and Dunnett's test (alpha = 0.05) was used to compare the ratios (100:0, 75:25, 50:50, 25:75, and 0:100) (based on volatile solids-VS). In addition, both the synergistic effect and kinetic adjustment of some models were evaluated. The results indicated that the co-digestion of all substrates (GR, FW, and PL) with SW improved the methane production yield in comparison with mono-digestion (GR, FW, and PL). A positive synergistic effect was observed for the FW:SW (25:75 and 75:25). According to both Tukey's and Dunnett's tests (alpha = 0.05), the FW:SW ratio of 25:75 did not show statistical difference compared with the mono-digestion (SW), which exhibited the largest CH4 production. Among the models evaluated, the modified Gompertz function presented the best fit. For the co-digestion treatments, the ratio of FW:SW of 25:75 exhibited the most promising potential for integrated management, demonstrating the best synergistic effect among the substrates. In this context, methane production from co-digestion equalled that of mono-digestion, while enabling integrated residue management.

AB  - Hyperexcitability of neuronal networks is central to the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Pharmacological activation of Kv7 channels is an effective way to reduce neuronal firing. Our results showed that that pharmacologically activating the Kv7 channel with Retigabine (RTG) can alleviate cognitive impairment in mice without affecting spontaneous activity. RTG could also ameliorate damage to the Nissl bodies in cortex and hippocampal CA and DG regions in 9-month-old APP/PS1 mice. Additionally, RTG could reduce the A beta plaque number in the hippocampus and cortex of both 6-month-old and 9-month-old mice. By recordings of electroencephalogram, we showed that a decrease in the number of abnormal discharges in the brains of the AD model mice when the Kv7 channel was opened. Moreover, Western blot analysis revealed a reduction in the expression of the p-Tau protein in both the hippocampus and cortex upon Kv7 channel opening. These findings suggest that Kv7 channel opener RTG may ameliorate cognitive impairment in AD, most likely by reducing brain excitability.

AB  - Three fish blood flukes (Aporocotylidae Odhner, 1912) infect mullets (Mugiliformes: Mugilidae): Cardicola mugilis Yamaguti, 1970 and Plethorchis acanthus Martin, 1975 infect striped mullet, Mugil cephalus Linnaeus, 1758 in the Central Pacific Ocean (Hawaiian Islands) and Brisbane River (Australia), respectively; Cardicola brasiliensis Knoff & Amato, 1992 infects Lebranche mullet, Mugil liza Valenciennes, 1836 from the Southwestern Atlantic Ocean (Brazil). White mullets were cast-netted from the mouth of Deer River, a coastal saltmarsh of Mobile Bay, in the north-central Gulf of Mexico and examined for blood fluke infections. Specimens of Mugilitrema labowskiae Warren & Bullard n. gen., n. sp. were found infecting the endocardial surface and inter-trabecular spaces of the atrium, ventricle, and bulbous arteriosus. The new genus and species differ from all other aporocotylids by having the combination of two post-caecal testes, a uterus with straight ascending and descending portions, and a common genital pore. The 28S analysis recovered the new species and P. acanthus as sister taxa and Aporocotylidae as monophyletic. Carditis associated with intense infections comprised endocardial hyperplasia, resulting in a thickened cardiac endothelium. Probable dead or deteriorating eggs in the myocardium were encapsulated by granulomas composed of epithelioid histiocytes. Live eggs infected the afferent artery of gill filaments and were associated with varied hyperplasia of the overlying epithelium and haemorrhaging from the afferent artery in high-intensity infections. The new species is the first aporocotylid infecting a mullet from the northwestern Atlantic Ocean and only the second description of demonstrable endocarditis attributed to an adult fish blood fluke infection.

AB  - This research examines whether the groundwater in the Sivakasi Region of South India is suitable for consumption, and assesses the possible health hazards for various age demographics including infants, children, teenagers, and adults. A total of 77 groundwater samples were gathered, covering a total area of 580 km(2) and analyzed for major and minor ions. The hydrogen ion concentration (pH) of the samples indicates neutral to marginally alkaline. The total dissolved solids (TDS) fluctuate from 255 to 2701 mg/l and electrical conductivity varies from 364 to 3540 mu S/cm. A wide range of fluoride concentration was detected (0.1 to 3.2 mg/l) with nearly 38% groundwater samples surpassing the proposed limit (1.5 mg/l) suggested by the World Health Organization in 2017. Gibbs plot analysis suggested that most of the samples were influenced by geogenic factors, primarily rock weathering in this region. Correlation analysis showed that most of the samples were impacted by both natural and human sources. The pollution index of groundwater (PIG) fluctuated from 0.67 to 2.60 with approximately 30% and 53% of samples falling into insignificant and low pollution categories, respectively. Furthermore, 10% and 5% of total samples were characterized as moderate and high pollution levels, and 2% as very high pollution category. Spatial analysis using GIS revealed that 440.63 km(2) were within safe fluoride levels according to the WHO standards, while 139.32 km(2) were identified as risk zone. The principal component analysis (PCA1) showed strong positive loadings on EC (0.994), TDS (0.905), Mg2+ (0.910), Cl- (0.903) and HCO3- (0.923) indicating rock water interaction. PCA2 accounts the high positive factor loading on HCO3- (0.864) indicating ion exchange and mineral leaching. The PCA1 and PCA2 indicated that variables such as mineral leaching and rock water interaction are the major mechanisms contributing to the chemical signatures in groundwater, which may support for the elevated fluoride levels in certain areas. Risk assessments, including Hazard Quotient results showed that 71%, 61% 38%, and 34% of groundwater samples exceeded the permissible THI limit (THI > 1) for infants, children, teenagers, and adults, respectively. The study recommends implementing measures such as denitrification, defluorination, rainwater harvesting, and improved sanitation infrastructure to enhance the health conditions in the study region. Additionally, it suggests introducing educational programs in rural areas to create awareness about the health dangers due to consumption of water with high fluoride levels.

AB  - There are different stress resistance among different breeds of pigs. Changes in intestinal stem cells (ISCs) are still unclear among various breeds of piglets after early weaning. In the current study, Taoyuan Black and Duroc piglets were slaughtered at 21 days of age (early weaning day) and 24 days of age (3 days after early weaning) for 10 piglets in each group. The results showed that the rate of ISC-driven epithelial renewal in local Taoyuan Black pigs hardly changed after weaning for 3 days. However, weaning stress significantly reduced the weight of the duodenum and jejunum in Duroc piglets. Meanwhile, the jejunal villus height, tight junction-related proteins (ZO-1, Occludin, and Claudin1), as well as the trans-epithelial electrical resistance (TEER) values, were down-regulated after weaning for 3 days in Duroc piglets. Moreover, compared with Unweaned Duroc piglets, the numbers of Olfm4+ ISC cells, PCNA+ mitotic cells, SOX9+ secretory progenitor cells, and Villin+ absorptive cells in the jejunum were reduced significantly 3 days after weaning. And ex vivo jejunal crypt-derived organoids exhibited growth disadvantages in weaned Duroc piglets. Notably, the Keap1/Nrf2 signaling activities and the expression of HO-1 were significantly depressed in weaned Duroc piglets compared to Unweaned Duroc piglets. Thus, we can conclude that ISCs of Duroc piglets were more sensitive to weaning stress injury than Taoyuan Black piglets, and Keap1/Nrf2 signaling is involved in this process.

AB  - Targeting protein therapeutics to specific cells and tissues is a major challenge in modern medicine. Improving the specificity of protein therapeutic delivery will significantly enhance efficiency in drug development. One of the promising tools for protein delivery is extracellular vesicles (EVs) that are enveloped by a complex lipid bilayer. EVs are secreted by almost all cell types and possess significant advantages: biocompatibility, stability, and the ability to penetrate the blood-brain barrier. Overexpression of the vesicular stomatitis virus protein G (VSV-G) was shown to promote EV formation by the producer cell. We have developed an EV-based system for targeted delivery of protein cargoes to antigen-presenting cells (APCs). In this study, we show that attachment of a recombinant llama nanobody alpha-CD206 to the N-terminus of a truncated VSV-G increases the selectivity of EV cargo delivery mainly to APCs. These results highlight the outstanding technological and biomedical potential of EV-based delivery systems for correcting the immune response in patients with autoimmune, viral, and oncological diseases.

AB  - SQUINT (SQN) regulates plant maturation by promoting the activity of miR156, which functions primarily in the miR156-SQUAMOSA PROMOTER BINDING PROTEIN-LIKE9 (SPL9) module regulating plant growth and development. Here, we show that SQN acts in the jasmonate (JA) pathway, a major signaling pathway regulating plant responses to insect herbivory and pathogen infection. Arabidopsis thaliana sqn mutants showed elevated sensitivity to the necrotrophic fungus Botrytis cinerea compared with wild type. However, SQN is not involved in the early pattern-triggered immunity response often triggered by fungal attack. Rather, SQN positively regulates the JA pathway, as sqn loss-of-function mutants treated with B. cinerea showed reduced JA accumulation, JA response and sensitivity to JA. Furthermore, the miR156-SPL9 module regulates plant resistance to B. cinerea: mir156 mutant, and SPL9 overexpression plants displayed elevated sensitivity to B. cinerea. Moreover, constitutively expressing miR156a or reducing SPL9 expression in the sqn-1 mutant restored the sensitivity of Arabidopsis to B. cinerea and JA responses. These results suggest that SQN positively modulates plant resistance to B. cinerea through the JA pathway, and the miR156-SPL9 module functions as a bridge between SQN and JA to mediate plant resistance to this pathogen.

AB  - Methylated soy and chickpea proteins (MSP and MCP, respectively), and 11S globulin (a soy protein fraction), are characterized by net positive charges and a more hydrophobic nature, nominating them as antiviral proteins. Under greenhouse conditions, potato plants (cv. Spunta) mechanically infected with potato virus Y (PVY) and potato virus X (PVX) were treated with MSP, MCP, and 11S globulin at different concentrations, after ten days of infection. The three tested substances inhibited the viral propagation, where the concentration 500 mu g ml(-1) produced the maximum antiviral action. This influence was further augmented by applying the material twice 10 and 20 days after the viral infection. Assessing the viral load by a double antibody sandwich ELISA (DAS-ELISA), dot-blot hybridization, and reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) confirmed the viral inhibition, in the following order: MSP > MCP > 11S globulin. Bringing the virus in contact with MCP produced deformed TEM (transmission electron microscope) viral micrographs referring to a potential direct action of the substance on the virus. The tested materials' antiviral activity at 500 mu g ml(-1) was positively reflected on the growth and yield of PVY or PVX-infected potato plants cultivated under open field conditions in January. Considerably high increases in the tuber yield of either PVY-infected (68, 42, and 36%) or PVX-infected plants (52, 41 and 30%), were produced by the treatment with MSP, MCP and 11S (500 mu g ml(-1)), respectively.

AB  - Background: Hydroxysafflor yellow A (HSYA), the main active ingredient in safflower, possesses antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities. We confirmed in our previous study that HSYA exerts antidepressant effects, but further investigation is needed to uncover the exact mechanism. Herein, we aimed to explore the antidepressant effects of HSYA based on microglial activation and ferroptosis studies. Methods: The chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS) procedure was used to establish a depression model in rats. Behavioral tests were conducted on rats after HSYA administration. Iba-1 immunostaining was used to determine the activation of microglia in the hippocampus. We examined the iron ion level using a colorimetric method. Assayed by western blot for protein expression. Results: Rats receiving HSYA showed enhanced spatial learning and memory abilities, as well as improvements in depression-like behaviors. HSYA administration reduced Iba-1 expression in CUMS rats' hippocampus, indicating that HSYA suppressed microglial activation. HSYA inhibited CUMS-induced Fe2+ concentration and promoted ferroptosis-related protein GPX4 and SLC7A11 expression. HSYA treatment also elevated SIRT1 and Nrf2 protein levels, while p-p65 protein levels decreased in the hippocampus of CUMS rats. Conclusion: HSYA exerts an antidepressant-like effect by inhibiting microglia activation in the hippocampus and inducing SIRT1/Nrf2/NF-kB signaling.

AB  - Zearalenone (ZEA) and Deoxynivalenol (DON) are two mycotoxins highly detected in agricultural products and feed. Both mycotoxins produce reproductive toxicity and pose a serious threat to human and animal health, among which pigs are the most sensitive animals. Sertoli cells (SCs) play an important role in spermatogenesis; however, the combined toxicity of ZEA and DON and the screening of effective protective agents remains to be determined. By studying the effects of N-acetylcysteine (NAC) on the cells exposed to 20 mu M of ZEA and 0.6 mu M of DON, we explored the protective mechanism of NAC (4 mM) on the cytotoxic injury of piglets SCs induced by both mycotoxins. The results showed that the combination of ZEA and DON destroy organdies and SCs structures, NAC significantly alleviates the damage caused by ZEA and DON. NAC also significantly increased the expression and distribution of zonula occludens 1 (ZO-1), decreased the relative mRNA and protein expression levels of Bax, Bid, caspase-3, and caspase-9, and increased Bcl-2 expression level and inhibited the decrease of mitochondrial membrane potential. Further, NAC also eases the cell cycle arrest and oxidative stress caused by ZEA and DON. In summary, our results show that NAC could alleviate SCs injury via reducing the oxidative damage and apoptosis caused by ZEA and DON.

AB  - Mechanistic multi-scale modelling holds the potential to inform fuel performance codes by incorporating highfidelity models, algorithms, parameters, and material properties. In this context, meso-scale codes emerge as valuable tools for developing detailed models and performing separate verification and validation steps. This work focuses on SCIANTIX, an open-source 0D meso-scale code designed to describe the behaviour of gaseous and volatile fission products in nuclear oxide fuel. The code predominantly employs engineering physics-based behavioural models featuring computational times that align with typical fuel performance code requirements. Given the numerical foundation of the code, it is applicable to both stationary and transient conditions. Following a recent work outlining the standalone SCIANTIX (version 2.0) performance and its separate-effect validation database, we present its performance when coupled with fuel performance codes to simulate light water reactor fuel rods. The experiments selected for the comparative analysis constitute an initial integral validation database. The comparison focuses on conventional engineering quantities of interest, such as integral fission gas release, demonstrating the satisfactory performance of the code. Additionally, it highlights the potential advantages of multi-scale modelling over conventional semi-empirical approaches.

AB  - Ethnopharmacological relevance: The large number of secondary derivatives have been isolated from the genus Salvia with about 700 species, and used in the pharmacopoeia throughout the world. Various biological prop-erties of Salvia formulations have been reported including as antioxidant, antimicrobial, hypotensive, anti -hyperglycemia, anti-hyperlipidemia, anti-cancer, and skin curative. Salvia cadmica Boiss. root and aerial part extracts enriched with polyphenols are bactericidal towards gastric pathogen Helicobacter pylori (Hp) and diminish deleterious effects induced by Hp lipopolysaccharide (LPS) towards gastric epithelial cells.Aim of this study: To examine the influence of S. cadmica extracts on the M1/M2 polarization of macrophages primed with Hp LPS vs standard LPS Escherichia coli (Ec), and the macrophage cytokine as well as phagocytic activity, which are affected during Hp infection. Material and methods: Macrophages derived from THP-1 human monocytes primed with LPS Hp/Ec and/or S. cadmica extracts, were examined for the biomarkers of activation (surface, cytoplasmic or soluble), and phagocytic capacity. The bone marrow macrophages of Cavia porcellus were used to determine the engulfment of Hp. Results: Priming of THP-1 cells (24h) with LPS Hp/Ec resulted in polarization of M1 macrophages, activation of nuclear factor kappa B, secretion of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, interleukin (IL)-1 beta, macrophage chemotactic protein (MCP)-1, immunoregulatory IL-10, and production of reactive oxygen species. These effects were diminished after restimulation of cells with S. cadmica extracts. THP-1 macrophages exposed to studied extracts showed an increased phagocytic capacity, in conjunction with elevated CD11b/CD11d expression and enhanced production of inducible nitric oxide synthase. They also increased Hp engulfment by bone marrow macrophages. These effects were not related to a global DNA methylation.Conclusions: S. cadmica extracts possess an immunomodulating activity, which might be useful in control of H. pylori LPS driven activity of macrophages.

AB  - Rates at which predators encounter, hunt and kill prey are influenced by, among other things, the intrinsic condition of prey. Diseases can considerably compromise body condition, potentially weakening ability of afflicted prey to avoid predation. Understanding predator-prey dynamics is particularly important when both species are threatened, as is the case with lions (Panthera leo) and giraffes (Giraffa camelopardalis). Importantly, an emergent disease called giraffe skin disease (GSD) may affect predatory interactions of lions and giraffes. Hypotheses suggest that GSD may negatively affect the likelihood of giraffes surviving lion attacks. We evaluated giraffe-lion interactions in Ruaha National Park, Tanzania, where 85% of the giraffe population has GSD. We monitored lion hunting behaviour and estimated proportion of the giraffe population with GSD and evidence of 'lion marks' from assumed previous lion predation attempts (i.e. claw marks, bite marks and missing tails). Although we recorded lions hunting and feeding on 16 different prey species, giraffes represented the largest prey category (27%; n = 171 of 641). For age and sex cohorts combined, 26% (n = 140 of 548) of encountered giraffes displayed evidence of previous lion predation attempts. Occurrence of lion marks was higher for adults and males in the giraffe population, suggesting that these individuals were more likely to survive lion attacks. We also found marginal evidence of a positive relationship between giraffes with severe GSD and occurrence of lion marks. Our results identify giraffes as important prey species for lions in Ruaha National Park and suggest that GSD severity plays a minor role in likelihood of surviving a lion attack. This is the first study to explore connections between lion predation and GSD. We explore the ecological implications of disease ecology on predator-prey interactions and consider opportunities for future research on causal links between GSD and giraffe vulnerability to lion predation.

AB  - Simple Summary In insects, host searching usually involves different kinds of stimuli, both visual and chemical, that may act in combination. External cues are perceived through specific sensory organs (sensilla), mainly present on the antennae. Understanding how ectoparasites belonging to the Hippoboscidae locate their hosts is crucial, since these flies infest animals and can attack humans, with veterinary and medical implications. The aim of this research was to study the antennae of four hippoboscid species, Lipoptena cervi (Linnaeus, 1758), Lipoptena fortisetosa Maa, 1965, Hippobosca equina Linnaeus, 1758, and Pseudolynchia canariensis (Macquart, 1840), investigating the morphology and the sensory structures present on these appendages. A typical conformation of the antennae with the envelopment of the third segment (flagellum) inside the first two have been observed. Moreover, two types of sensilla have been detected and their role in the perception of host odours and CO2 have been hypothesized. Other antennal structures seem to be involved in the detection of temperature and humidity variations. Our findings confirm that these hippoboscids use chemoreception for host location, giving insights into this complex process in this poorly investigated group. Lipoptena cervi (Linnaeus), Lipoptena fortisetosa Maa, Hippobosca equina Linnaeus, and Pseudolynchia canariensis (Macquart) are hematophagous ectoparasites that infest different animal species and occasionally bite humans. Hosts are located by a complex process involving different kinds of stimuli perceived mainly by specific sensory structures on the antennae, which are the essential olfactory organs. General antennal morphology, together with distribution and ultrastructure of sensilla, have been studied in detail with scanning and transmission electron microscopy approaches. Observations have revealed some common features among the four studied hippoboscids: (a) typical concealment of the flagellum inside the other two segments; (b) characteristic trabecular surface of the flagellum; (c) peculiar external microtrichia; (d) presence on the flagellum of basiconic sensilla and grooved peg coeloconic sensilla; (e) unarticulated arista. The ultrastructure of L. fortisetosa revealed that microtrichia and the flagellar reticulated cuticle are not innervated. Different roles have been hypothesized for the described antennal structures. Microtrichia and the reticulated cuticle could convey volatile compounds towards the flagellar sensory area. Peculiar sensory neurons characterize the unarticulated arista which could be able to detect temperature variations. Coeloconic sensilla could be involved in thermoreception, hygroreception, and carbon dioxide reception at long distances, while the poorly porous basiconic sensilla could play a role in the host odour perception at medium-short distances.

AB  - This study aimed to determine how melatonin (MT) and seminal plasma affected the freezability of buck sperm during the nonbreeding season. Semen was collected from eight bucks before (pre-MT) and after (post-MT) MT application in the nonbreeding season. Individual ejaculates were collected from the bucks, split into two equal groups according to the removal of seminal plasma (SP) (-) or nonremoval of SP (+). For washing, the groups of ejaculates were centrifuged, and the supernatant was separated, SP (-) and SP (+) ejaculates were diluted, then frozen. Semen samples were examined for sperm motility, plasma membrane integrity, defective acrosomes, DNA fragmentation, and mitochondrial membrane function at the native and post-thaw stages. When the general average post-thaw motility (p < 0.01), plasma membrane (p < 0.05), acrosome (p < 0.05), and DNA integrity rates (p < 0.05) and mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) (p < 0.01) were evaluated, it was seen that MT administration caused a statistically significant improvement. The dramatic effect of nonremoval of seminal plasma on motility and plasma membrane integrity is more clearly observed in individual semen samples frozen in the pre-MT group (p < 0.05). Also, it was observed that removing seminal plasma in the post-MT group caused even milder post-thaw acrosome damage compared with the SP (+) group (p < 0.05). The effect of removing seminal plasma was not observed in terms of DNA integrity and MMP rates in pre- and post-MT groups. As a result, it was concluded that MT application and removal of seminal plasma in the nonbreeding season result in improvement in the freezability of buck semen.

AB  - Simple Summary Sheep meat is one of the most important sources of animal protein throughout the world, specifically in arid and semiarid regions. The meat yield of growing lambs can be maximized by improving the function and health of the digestive system, specifically using sheep diets containing ratios high in fibers. Diets rich in fibrous portions cannot be efficiently hydrolyzed by the endogenous enzymes or by the microbes of the rumen. Therefore, the addition of some feed additives that can improve fiber digestion and/or sustain digestive system eubiosis, such as fibrolytic enzymes, probiotics, and yeast, can be a suitable intervention. Fibrolytic enzymes are gaining importance because they improve the nutrient digestibility and performance of animals without affecting the animals' health. Probiotics (bacteria and/or yeast) are also important feed additives that can support ruminal microbial activity and enhance gut health and ecology through rumen maturity by favoring microbial establishment. In the present study, dietary supplementation with a combination of fibrolytic enzymes and probiotics (Calfo Care(R)) at 0.5, 1, and 2 kg/ton diet of dry matter increased nutrient digestibility, feed intake and feed conversion, daily weight gain, average total weight gain, and improved most blood parameters of lambs. The addition of 1 kg/ton diet of DM resulted in more economic profit compared with other levels. This study was conducted to evaluate the effects of adding different levels of the combination of fibrolytic enzymes and probiotics (a mixture of bacteria and yeast) on the performance of fattening lambs. Thirty-two male Ossimi lambs (weighing 39 +/- 0.24 kg) were divided into four groups randomly (eight animals each). The first group (control ration, G1) was fed on a ration of 60% concentrate feed mixture (CFM), 20% Egyptian clover (EC), and 20% wheat straw (WS). The second (G2), third (G3), and fourth (G4) groups were fed a control ration supplemented with Calfo Care(R) at concentrations of 0.5, 1, and 2 kg/ton diet of dry matter (DM). Results showed that the G2 and G3 rations significantly (p <= 0.05) increased the DM, organic matter, crude protein, crude fiber, and ether extract digestibility compared with the G1 and G4 rations. Moreover, the G2 and G3 rations increased (p <= 0.05) the percentages of total digestible nutrients (TDN), starch values (SV), and digestible crude protein (DCP) compared with the G1 and G4 rations. Both the G2 and G3 rations significantly (p <= 0.05) increased the TDN, SV, and DCP as kg/day or g/kg w(0.75) and kg or g/100 kg body weight compared with the G1 and G4 rations. Conversely, the G1 ration significantly decreased the feed conversion of DM, TDN, SV, and DCP compared with the experimental groups. Furthermore, the G2, G3, and G4 rations significantly (p <= 0.05) increased the total weight gain by 25.34%, 52.20%, and 3.79%, respectively, compared with the G1 ration. The G2, G3, and G4 rations also (p <= 0.05) increased the concentrations of most hematological parameters, including triiodothyronine, total protein, albumin, and glucose, compared with the G1 ration. Finally, the best net profit was recorded with the G3 ration, followed by the G2, G4, and G1 rations.

AB  - The study was conducted to determine the nutrient digestibility and digestible (DE) and metabolizable energy (ME) of 15 cereal processing by-products and to develop prediction equations for DE and ME based on the chemical composition in growing pigs. A total of 36 crossbred pigs were chosen and divided into three blocks according to a three 12 x 3 Youdin square experimental design. Twelve pigs in each block were allocated into six diets including a basal diet and five test diets. The feeding experiment included three periods, and each dietary treatment contained six replicates. Each period lasted 12 days, including 7 d of dietary adaption and 5 d of total feces and urine collection. The results showed that the coefficients of variation for EE, NDF, ADF, CP, and GE among 15 cereal processing by-products were 86.78%, 49.82%, 51.14%, 14.95%, and 6.26%, respectively. There were significant differences in DE, ME, and ME/DE (DM basis) among 15 cereal processing by-products (p < 0.05), ranging from 11.55 MJ/kg to 17.64 MJ/kg, from 10.90 MJ/kg to 17.40 MJ/kg, and from 89.41% to 98.63%, respectively. The digestibility of GE, DM, NDF, ADF, and CP showed a significant difference among 15 cereal processing by-products (p < 0.05). The DE and ME contents showed a negative correlation to NDF and ADF (p < 0.05), and the prediction equations for DE and ME (as-fed basis) were DE (MJ/kg) = -0.4597 x ADF (%) + 0.5988 x GE (MJ/kg) + 6.0138 (R-2 = 0.74; p < 0.05) and ME (MJ/kg) = 1.0440 x DE (MJ/kg) - 1.1235 (R-2 = 0.98; p < 0.05). On a DM basis, the optimal prediction equations for DE and ME were DE (MJ/kg DM) = -0.1451 x NDF (%) + 0.3026 x CP (%) + 13.8595 (R-2 = 0.72; p < 0.05) and ME (MJ/kg DM) = 1.1155 x DE (MJ/kg DM) + 0.0363 x ADF (%) - 2.3412 (R-2 = 0.99; p < 0.05). In conclusion, there were large variations in the chemical composition, nutrients digestibility, and available energy among the 15 different samples of cereal processing by-products. It is reasonable to develop prediction equations for DE and ME based on the chemical composition of cereal by-products for growing pigs.

AB  - Prospermatogonia (ProSGs), the progenitors of spermatogonial stem cells in neonatal testes, undergo critical migration to the testicular microenvironment-a fundamental process for testicular development and subsequent spermatogenic capacity. The SDF-1/CXCR4 chemokine axis serves as an essential molecular guidance mechanism, directing ProSGs toward the basal membrane of seminiferous tubules. Nevertheless, the precise molecular mechanisms governing this axis remain incompletely understood. Utilizing a porcine in vitro model system, this investigation elucidated the molecular mechanisms underlying the SDF-1/CXCR4 axis in ProSGs fate determination. Through integrated molecular and transcriptomic analyses, we investigated the consequences of CXCR4 inhibition on ProSG cellular dynamics. Our findings demonstrated that the SDF-1/CXCR4 axis exerts regulatory control over ProSGs differentiation via the PI3K-AKT-AP-1 signaling cascade. This regulation significantly influences the transcriptional landscape of ProSGs, particularly modulating the expression of PLZF, a crucial suppressor of spermatogonial differentiation, and DMRT1, an essential mediator of germ cell differentiation. These findings elucidate the molecular mechanisms orchestrating ProSGs homing and emphasize the significance of maintaining male reproductive competence. Furthermore, this research could enhance our understanding of ProSGs biology and its relationship to boar fertility, while potentially facilitating the development of innovative reproductive technologies and sustainable livestock management strategies.

AB  - In many taxa, females store sperm in specialized storage organs. Most insect sperm storage organs have a tubular structure, typically consisting of a central lumen surrounded by epithelial cells. These specialized tubules perform the essential tasks of transporting sperm through the female reproductive tract and supporting long-term sperm survival and function. Little is known about the way in which female sperm storage organs provide an environment conducive to sperm survival. We address this using a combined light microscopy, micro computed tomography (microCT), and Focused Ion Beam Scanning Electron Microscopy (FIB-SEM) approach for high-resolution correlative three-dimensional imaging to advance our understanding of sperm-female interactions in Drosophila melanogaster. Using this multimodal approach, we were able to scan the lower female reproductive tract and distal portion of the seminal receptacle at low magnification, and to subsequently zoom in for further analysis on an ultrastructural level. Our findings highlight aspects of the way in which the seminal receptacle keeps sperm viable in the lumen, and set the stage for further studies. The methods developed are suitable not only for Drosophila but also for other organisms with soft, delicate tissues.
   The anatomy of the Drosophila female lower reproductive tract is probed using a combination of high-resolution correlative three-dimensional imaging techniques, highlighting aspects of seminal receptacle sperm interactions and sperm viability.

AB  - Since Jane Goodall's famous observations of stick tool use by chimpanzees,1 animal tool use has been observed in numerous species, including many primates, dolphins, and birds. Some animals, such as New Caledonian crows, even craft tools.2,3 Elephants frequently use tools4,5 and also modify them.6 We studied water-hose tool use in Asian zoo elephants. Flexibility, extension, and water flow make hoses exceptionally complex tools. Individual elephants differed markedly in their water-hose handling. Female elephant Mary displayed sophisticated hose-showering behaviors. She showed lateralized hose handling, systematically showered her body, and coordinated the trunk-held water hose with limb behaviors. Mary usually grasped the hose behind the tip, using it as a stiff shower head. To reach her back, however, she grasped the hose further from the tip and swung it on her back, using hose flexibility and ballistics. Aggressive interactions between Mary and the younger female elephant, Anchali, ensued around Mary's showering time. At some point, Anchali started pulling the water hose toward herself, lifting and kinking it, then re- grasping and compressing the kink. This kink-and-clamp behavior disrupted water flow and was repeated in several sessions as a strict sequence of maneuvers. The efficacy of water flow disruption increased over time. In control experiments with multiple hoses, it was not clear whether Anchali specifically targeted Mary's showering hose. We also observed Anchali pressing down on the water hose, performing an on- hose trunk stand, which also disrupted water flow. We conclude that elephants show sophisticated hose tool use and manipulation.

AB  - Background: This study aimed to validate a method for characterizing and quantifying the multi-elemental profiles of different insect flours to enable their distinction, identification, and quality assessment. The focus was on three insect species: cricket (Acheta domesticus), buffalo worm (Alphitobius diaperinus), and mealworm (Tenebrio molitor). Methods: Mealworms were powdered in the laboratory through mechanical processing. Sample analysis involved acid digestion using a microwave digester, followed by profiling with Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry (ICP-MS). This technique enabled rapid, multi-elemental analysis at trace levels. Chemometric methods, including Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for exploratory analysis, Covariance Selection-Linear Discriminant Analysis (CovSel-LDA), alongside forward stepwise LDA classification methods, were applied and compared. Results: ICP-MS accurately detected elements at micro trace levels. Both classification models, based on different variable selection methods and externally validated on a test set comprising 45% of the available samples, proved effective in classifying samples based on slightly different pools of trace elements. CovSel-LDA selected Mg and Se, whereas the stepwise-LDA focused on Mg, K, and Mn. Conclusions: the validated methods demonstrated high accuracy and generalizability, supporting their potential use in food industry applications. This model could assist in quality control, facilitating the introduction of insect-based flour into European and international markets as novel foods.

AB  - Proteomics technology reveals the marker proteins, potential pathogenesis, and intervention targets after noise-induced hearing loss. To study the differences in cochlea protein expression before and after noise exposure using proteomics to reveal the pathological mechanism of noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL). A guinea pig NIHL model was established to test the ABR thresholds before and after noise exposure. The proteomics technology was used to study the mechanism of differential protein expression in the cochlea by noise stimulation. The average hearing threshold of guinea pigs on the first day after noise exposure was 57.00 +/- 6.78 dB Sound pressure level (SPL); the average hearing threshold on the seventh day after noise exposure was 45.83 +/- 6.07 dB SPL. The proteomics technology identified 3122 different inner ear proteins, of which six proteins related to the hearing were down-regulation: Tenascin C, Collagen Type XI alpha two chains, Collagen Type II alpha one chain, Thrombospondin 2, Collagen Type XI alpha one chain and Ribosomal protein L38, and are enriched in protein absorption, focal adhesion, and extracellular matrix receptor pathways. Impulse noise can affect the expression of differential proteins through focal adhesion pathways. This data can provide an experimental basis for the research on the prevention and treatment of NIHL.

AB  - The aim was to study the effect of 4-phenylfuroxan-3-carbonitrile (Fx), a NO-releasing agent, and carbetocin, an oxytocin receptor agonist, on matrix metalloproteinases-2 (MMP-2) activity and PGE2 production in cervix from cycling sheep. Cervical explants were incubated during 12 h with MEM supplemented with increasing concentrations of Fx in DMSO (2 %) (0 to 300 mu g/mL) with Cb (100 ng/mL) (Experiment 1, n = 15) and DMSO (2 %), DMSO + Cb (100 ng/mL) or DMSO + Fx (30 mu g/mL) (Experiment 2, n = 10), and their respective controls. In the supernatants, activated (A) and latent (L) MMP-2 activities were determined by a SDS-PAGE zymography, PGE2 concentration by immunoassay and NO production indirectly as nitrites by spectrophotometry. Data were analyzed by ANOVA. The Cb treatment increase the A MMP-2 activity in DMSO (Experiment 1 at follicular phase and Experiment 2) or alone (Experiment 2) and increase the L MMP-2 activity (Experiments 1 and 2) (P < 0.02). The DMSO treatment also increase the L MMP2 activity (Experiment 2) (P < 0.0001). Treatment with Fx + DMSO increased the concentration of accumulated nitrites in the supernatant (P < 0.0001) (Experiment 1), but did not affect or decrease the activity of A and L MMP-2 (P < 0.04) (Experiments 1 and 2). The PGE2 concentration trend to increase with Cb treatment (P = 0.0614) and decrease with Fx+DMSO treatment (P < 0.0001) (Experiment 2). In conclusion, Cb and/or DMSO treatment of cervical explants increase the MMP-2 activity through PGE2-independent mechanisms, but Fx in DMSO fail in this, suggesting that the pre-treatment with Cb and/or DMSO could be used to increase cervical dilation in ewes.

AB  - Decades have passed since the first discovery of H10-subtype avian influenza virus (AIV) in chickens in 1949, and it has been detected in many species including mammals such as minks, pigs, seals and humans. Cases of human infections with H10N8 viruses identified in China in 2013 have raised widespread attention. Two novel reassortant H10N3 viruses were isolated from chickens in December 2019 in eastern China during routine surveillance for AIVs. The internal genes of these viruses were derived from genotype S (G57) H9N2 and were consistent with H5N6, H7N9 and H10N8, which cause fatal infections in humans. Their viral pathogenicity and transmissibility were further studied in different animal models. The two H10N3 isolates had low pathogenicity in chickens and were transmitted between chickens via direct contact. These viruses were highly pathogenic in mice and could be transmitted between guinea pigs via direct contact and respiratory droplets. More importantly, these viruses can bind to both human-type SA alpha-2,6-Gal receptors and avian-type SA alpha-2,3-Gal receptors. Asymptomatic shedding in chickens and good adaptability to mammals of these H10N3 isolates would make it easier to transmit to humans and pose a threat to public health.

AB  - Atmosphere, wastewater, and soil are the main natural receptacles of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs), but the profiles and transmission of ARGs across the above-mentioned phases during freezing temperatures remain poorly realized. In this study, several ARGs in dust, wastewater and soil phases from 5 human-associated point-sources during dairy mean air temperature from-27 degrees C to 29 degrees C were examined. The factors (e.g., VGT (bacteria biomass), HGT (intI1 gene), seasonal variations (non-cold and cold seasons), environmental phases, and point-sources) were also explored. Results showed the wastewater phase harbored the highest total targeted ARGs (2.00 x 10-2 gene copies per 16S rRNA gene copies). Principal coordinate analysis (PCoA) with Bray-Curtis distance indicated that the selected ARGs in the dust phase might originate from the wastewater and soil pha-ses. The pig farm was a potential hotpot of ARGs, which carried the highest relative abundances of total targeted ARGs in the dust (5.34 x 10-1) and wastewater phases (3.59 x 10-1). Seasonal variations potentially influenced the concentration of ARGs among three phases, the percentages of sul genes (sul1, sul2) and erm gene (ermB, ermC) relative abundances presented higher proportions in the non-cold season (41.06%) and cold season (42.62%), respectively. The positive correlations between 16S rRNA, intI1, and selected ARGs strengthened in dust and wastewater phases during the cold season and non-cold season, respectively, which hinted vertical gene transfer (VGT) and intI1-mediated horizontal gene transfer (HGT) varied with natural phases and seasons. This study highlights the critical roles of environmental phases and seasons in huge ranges of temperatures for ARG dissemination.

AB  - Anxiety disorders are multifaceted conditions that engage numerous brain regions and circuits. While the hindbrain is pivotal in fundamental biological functions, its role in modulating emotions has been underappreciated. This review will uncover critical targets and circuits within the hindbrain that are essential for both anxiety and anxiolytic effects, expanding on research obtained through behavioral tests. The bidirectional neural pathways between the hindbrain and other brain regions, with a spotlight on vagal afferent signaling, provide a crucial framework for unraveling the neural mechanisms underlying anxiety. Exploring neural circuits within the hindbrain can help to unravel the neurobiological mechanisms of anxiety and elucidate differences in the expression of these circuits between genders, thereby providing valuable insights for the development of future anxiolytic drugs.

AB  - Ethnopharmacological relevance: Valeriana jatamansi Jones (V. jatamansi) is a traditional Chinese medicine (TCM). It was recorded in Diannan Bencao, Compendium of Materia Medica and some local medical books and was described as useful in treating insomnia, distraction, poor mental health, vomiting and diarrhea. Aim of the study: To investigate whether the antidepressant effect of V. jatamansi may operate through modulating vitamin B12-related ileal homeostasis using a chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS) mouse model. Materials and methods: A CUMS-induced depression model was established in mice for five weeks, after which V. jatamansi extracts were administered for three weeks. At week eight, the forced swimming test and noveltysuppressed feeding test were conducted. H&E staining assessed ileal pathology, while 16S rDNA sequencing analyzed changes in ileal microbiota. Additionally, B12 in serum, cubilin (CUBN) and amnionless (AMN) in ileal tissue, methionine synthase (MS) and homocysteine (Hcy) in the hippocampus were measured using ELISA, and the correlations between them and ileal microbiota were explored. Results: Mice in the model group exhibited significant depressive behavior. However, after treatment with V. jatamansi, immobility time and feeding latency were improved. H&E staining demonstrated the repairing effect of V. jatamansi on the ileum regarding tissue damage. The alpha and beta diversity of the ileal microbiota were regulated and converged to the normal group. Additionally, V. jatamansi modulated B12, CUBN, AMN, MS, and Hcy levels. Correlation analysis showed that there are certain correlations between a variety of microorganisms and B12-related factors. Conclusion: These findings suggest that the mechanism of V. jatamansi in treating depression may be through repairing depression-associated intestinal damage. This repair process may affect the intestinal absorption and microbial production of B12. By reversing the reduction of serum B12, V. jatamansi ultimately reduces the infiltration of Hcy into the CNS.

AB  - Diabetic retinopathy (DR) and glaucoma can both be incurable if they are not detected early enough. Therefore, ophthalmologists worldwide are striving to detect them by personally screening retinal fundus images. However, this procedure is not only tedious, subjective, and labor-intensive, but also error-prone. Worse yet, it may not even be attainable in some countries where ophthalmologists are in short supply. A practical solution to this complicated problem is a computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) system-the objective of this work. We propose an accurate system to detect at once any of the two diseases from retinal fundus images. The accuracy stems from two factors. First, we calculate a large set of hybrid features belonging to three groups: first-order statistics (FOS), higher-order statistics (HOS), and histogram of oriented gradient (HOG). Then, these features are skillfully reduced using a genetic algorithm scheme that selects only the most relevant and significant of them. Finally, the selected features are fed to a classifier to detect one of three classes: DR, glaucoma, or normal. Four classifiers are tested for this job: decision tree (DT), naive Bayes (NB), k-nearest neighbor (kNN), and linear discriminant analysis (LDA). The experimental work, conducted on three publicly available datasets, two of them merged into one, shows impressive performance in terms of four standard classification metrics, each computed using k-fold crossvalidation for added credibility. The highest accuracy has been provided by DT-96.67% for DR, 100% for glaucoma, and 96.67% for normal.

AB  - Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a generalist virus, infecting and evolving in numerous mammals, including captive and companion animals, free-ranging wildlife, and humans. Transmission among non-human species poses a risk for the establishment of SARS-CoV-2 reservoirs, makes eradication difficult, and provides the virus with opportunities for new evolutionary trajectories, including the selection of adaptive mutations and the emergence of new variant lineages. Here, we use publicly available viral genome sequences and phylogenetic analysis to systematically investigate the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 between human and non-human species and to identify mutations associated with each species. We found the highest frequency of animal-to-human transmission from mink, compared with lower transmission from other sampled species (cat, dog, and deer). Although inferred transmission events could be limited by sampling biases, our results provide a useful baseline for further studies. Using genome-wide association studies, no single nucleotide variants (SNVs) were significantly associated with cats and dogs, potentially due to small sample sizes. However, we identified three SNVs statistically associated with mink and 26 with deer. Of these SNVs, similar to% were plausibly introduced into these animal species from local human populations, while the remaining similar to(1/3) were more likely derived in animal populations and are thus top candidates for experimental studies of species-specific adaptation. Together, our results highlight the importance of studying animal-associated SARS-CoV-2 mutations to assess their potential impact on human and animal health.

AB  - The spittlebug Mahanarva spectabilis (Distant, 1909) is considered the main and most limiting pest of elephant grass (Pennisetum purpureum Schum.), and has caused economic losses to Brazilian farmers. In this study, we evaluated the insecticidal effects of aqueous extracts of garlic, rue, cinnamon, lemongrass, clove, star anise, eucalyptus, tobacco, and thyme on M. spectabilis nymphs. The results indicated that the tobacco extract was the most effective among all extracts, as it reached a mortality of 76%. The next most effective was star anise extract and cinnamon extract was the least effective. In the second stage of tests, we evaluated the insecticidal potential of five concentrations of tobacco extract. The values of LD50 and LD90 calculated for aqueous tobacco extract were, respectively, 11.5% and 33.3% 24 h after application, and 9.2% and 29.5% 48 h after application. We also evaluated different methods of extraction, through comparative tests, and the methods of infusion and decoction proved to be equivalent to those of the method of extraction by ultrasound. We conclude that among the nine aqueous plant extracts tested, tobacco extract was the only one recommended against M. spectabilis, as it showed insecticidal activity, with better results at a concentration of 25%, and with extraction by infusion and decoction.

AB  - Research on food finding by pest termites can be used to inform the development of techniques to control their population; however, there is a paucity of information available on the foraging behavior of Nasutitermes corniger, an urban pest in South America. In the present study, we analyzed the effect of the distance between the nest and food on the exploration and recruitment of N. corniger during foraging behavior under laboratory conditions. Nests containing mature colonies were collected in the field and placed in a glass cube connected to a test arena (50.0 x 40.0 cm) in which Eucalyptus grandis blocks were supplied at three different distances: 10, 20 and 30 cm. In each test, the occurrence of the following events were recorded: initial exploitation, initial recruitment, and mass worker recruitment. Individuals in the blocks were counted at the end of each test and divided into the total number of recruited termites, recruited workers, consuming workers and recruited soldiers. Each test lasted 60 minutes and was repeated with 20 colonies. Nasutitermes corniger foragers showed the three behavioral events of interest at all three distances. The occurrences of initial exploitation and initial recruitment, the latency of the three events and the number of foragers were not affected by the distance between the nest and food. The occurrence of mass worker recruitment was the only event affected by this distance, with higher recruitment at shorter distances.

AB  - Studies in animals indicate that sevoflurane exposure in the second trimester of pregnancy has harmful effects on the learning and memory of offspring. Whether an enriched environment can reverse the damage of sevoflurane exposure in the second trimester of pregnancy on the learning and memory of rat offspring remains unclear. In this study, rats at 14 days of pregnancy were exposed to 3.5% sevoflurane for 2 hours and their offspring were treated with an enriched environment for 20 successive days. We found that the enriched environment for offspring increased nestin and Ki67 levels in hippocampal tissue, increased hippocampal neurogenesis, inhibited glycogen synthase kinase 30 activity, and increased the expression of cell proliferation-related beta-catenin and apoptosis-related Bcl-2, indicating that an enriched environment reduces sevoflurane-induced damage by increasing the proliferation of stem cells in the hippocampus. These findings suggest that an enriched environment can reverse the effects of sevoflurane inhaled by rats during the second trimester of pregnancy on learning and memory of offspring.

AB  - The human breast and ovine mammary gland undergo striking levels of postnatal development, leading to formation of terminal duct lobular units (TDLUs). Here we interrogate aspects of sheep TDLU growth as a model of breast development and to increase understanding of ovine mammogenesis. The distributions of epithelial nuclear Ki67 positivity differ significantly between younger and older lambs. Ki67 expression is polarised to the leading edge of the developing TDLUs. Intraepithelial ductal macrophages exhibit periodicity and considerably increased density in lambs approaching puberty. Stromal macrophages are more abundant centrally than peripherally. Intraepithelial T lymphocytes are more numerous in older lambs. Stromal hotspots of Ki67 expression colocalize with immune cell aggregates that exhibit distinct organisation consistent with tertiary lymphoid structures. The lamb mammary gland thus exhibits a dynamic mucosal and stromal immune microenvironment and constitutes a valuable model system that provides new insights into postnatal breast development.
   Nagy et al. describe the histomorphogenesis of ovine mammary development in pre- and peri-pubertal sheep as a candidate model for human breast development. They investigate the locale and abundance of several immune cell types at different ages, highlighting this as a valuable model system that can provide new insights into postnatal breast development.

AB  - In mammals, the testis is the organ with the highest transcriptional activity. After gene transcription, translation, and post-translational protein modification, the transcriptional results are finally presented at the metabolic level. Metabolites not only essential for cell signaling and energy transfer, but also directly influenced by the physiological and pathological changes in tissues and accurately reflect the physiological changes. The fact that the testes are oxygen-deprived organs can explain why Sertoli cells and germ cells may use distinctive metabolic pathways to obtain energy in their different stages of development. Therefore, studying metabolic changes during testis development can better elucidate metabolic profile of the testis, which is essential to revealing characteristic metabolic pathways. The present study applied a widely targeted UPLC-MS/MS-based metabolomics approach with large-scale detection, identification and quantification to investigate the widespread metabolic changes during Ti-betan sheep testis development. Firstly, a total of 847 metabolites were detected in the sheep testis, and their changes along with the three testis-development stages were further investigated. The results indicated that those metabolites were clustered into amino acids and their derivatives, carbohydrates and their derivatives, organic acids and their derivatives, benzene and substituted derivatives, alcohols and amines, lipids, nucleotides and their derivatives, bile acids, coenzymes and vitamins, hormones and hormone-related compounds, etc. Among them, the most abundant metabolites in the testis were amino acids and lipid metabolites. The results showed that most of the lipids, carbohydrates with their de-rivatives, as well as alcohol and amines metabolites were high in sexually immature sheep while organic acids, amino acids and nucleotides showed a continuously increasing trend along with testis develop-ment stages. Among them, the content of metabolites with antioxidant effects increased along with testis development, while those related with energy synthesis was downregulated with age. Further correla-tion analyses of each metabolite-metabolite pair emphasized the cross talk between differential me-tabolisms across testis development, suggesting a significant correlation between lipids and other metabolites. Finally, based on KEGG pathway analysis, we found that the metabolic pathways in Tibetan sheep testis development were mainly clustered into energy metabolism, gonadal development, and anti-oxidative stress. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are by-products of normal cellular metabolism and are inevitable during testicular energy metabolism. Thus, the anti-oxidative stress function is a key process in maintaining the normal physiological function of testis. These results contributed to a broader view of the testis metabolome and a comprehensive analysis on metabolomic variation among different testis-development stages, providing a theoretical basis for us to understand the sheep testis metabolic mechanism.

AB  - Simple Summary Scoring lesions in slaughtered pigs can provide useful feedback to the swine industry, although the systematic recording of lesions is very challenging and time consuming. Artificial intelligence offers interesting opportunities to solve highly repetitive tasks, such as those performed by veterinarians at postmortem inspection in high-throughput slaughterhouses and to consistently analyze large amounts of data. The present investigation indicates that enzootic pneumonia-like lesions can be effectively detected and quantified through artificial intelligence methods under routine slaughter conditions. The slaughterhouse can act as a valid checkpoint to estimate the prevalence and the economic impact of diseases in farm animals. At present, scoring lesions is a challenging and time-consuming activity, which is carried out by veterinarians serving the slaughter chain. Over recent years, artificial intelligence(AI) has gained traction in many fields of research, including livestock production. In particular, AI-based methods appear able to solve highly repetitive tasks and to consistently analyze large amounts of data, such as those collected by veterinarians during postmortem inspection in high-throughput slaughterhouses. The present study aims to develop an AI-based method capable of recognizing and quantifying enzootic pneumonia-like lesions on digital images captured from slaughtered pigs under routine abattoir conditions. Overall, the data indicate that the AI-based method proposed herein could properly identify and score enzootic pneumonia-like lesions without interfering with the slaughter chain routine. According to European legislation, the application of such a method avoids the handling of carcasses and organs, decreasing the risk of microbial contamination, and could provide further alternatives in the field of food hygiene.

AB  - Purpose: To explore the diagnostic value of serum apolipoprotein B100 (Apo B100) combined with hippocampal volume in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Methods: A total of 59 AD patients and 59 healthy subjects were selected. The Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) was used for neuropsychological assessment. Blood glucose and serum lipid levels were detected by biochemical analyzer. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was used to detect apolipoprotein E (Apo E) epsilon 3/epsilon 4 genotypes in the plasma. Hippocampal volume was calculated using Slicer software. Independent-sample t test or Mann-Whitney U test were used to compare the levels of various indicators between the two groups. Spearman's correlation analysis was used to analyze the correlation between each level. The receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) was plotted, and the area under the curve (AUC) was calculated to compare the diagnostic efficacy of individual and combined detection of serum Apo B100 levels and hippocampal volume in AD. Results: Compared with the healthy control group, the levels of serum total cholesterol (TC), low-density lipoprotein (LDL), Apo B100, and plasma Apo E epsilon 3/epsilon 4 were higher in the AD group, and serum high-density lipoprotein (HDL) level was lower in the AD group (both p < 0.05). The hippocampal volume in the AD group was lower than in the control group (p < 0.01). The serum Apo B100 level was negatively correlated with MMSE score (r = -0.646), whereas hippocampal volume was positively correlated with MMSE score (r = 0.630). ROC curve analysis showed that the AUC of the combined serum Apo B100 level and hippocampal volume for AD was higher than that of either alone (AUC = 0.821, p < 0.01). Conclusion: Serum Apo B100 level is elevated, and the hippocampal volume is reduced in AD patients. The combined detection of the two has a higher diagnostic efficiency for AD than other alone and has the potential to become an important indicator for the diagnosis of AD in the future.

AB  - ObjectiveThis study aimed to investigate whether the antidepressant-like effects of electroacupuncture (EA) are associated with the regulation of inflammation and pyroptosis mediated by the NLRP3 inflammasome, as well as the protection of neuron cells in the hippocampus (HP) in a rat model of post-stroke depression (PSD).MethodsDepressive-like behaviors (DLBs) in PSD rats were evaluated through a series of behavioral tests. The expression levels of NLRP3, caspase-1 (Casp-1), and apoptosis-associated speck-like protein (ASC), as well as the cleavage product gasdermin D (GSDMD), were assessed using real-time PCR (RT-PCR), immunofluorescence, and Western blot (WB). IL-1 beta and IL-18 levels were measured by RT-PCR and WB. To upregulate NLRP3 expression, adeno-associated virus (AAV) was injected into the hippocampus. Nissl staining was employed to evaluate neuronal morphology and count in the hippocampus.ResultsEA significantly alleviated DLBs in PSD rats and suppressed the overexpression of NLRP3, Casp-1, ASC, GSDMD, IL-1 beta, and IL-18 in the ischemic hippocampus. NLRP3 overexpression attenuated the therapeutic effects of EA on both behavioral outcomes and neuroinflammatory markers.ConclusionsEA mitigated hippocampal inflammation and pyroptosis in PSD by downregulating NLRP3 inflammasome activation, indicating that NLRP3 may serve as a potential therapeutic target for PSD.

AB  - Schizophrenia is a psychiatric disorder characterized by cognitive dysfunctions. These dysfunctions significantly impact the daily lives of schizophrenic patients, yet effective interventions remain scarce. In this study, we explored the effects of two enriched housing types-cognitive and physical-on cognitive dysfunctions in a rat model of schizophrenia. Male neonatal Wistar-Imamichi rats were administered MK-801, a noncompetitive NMDAR antagonist, twice daily from postnatal day (PND) 7 to PND 20. Physical enrichment ameliorated memory deficits in both object and place recognition tests, while cognitive enrichment primarily improved object recognition performance. Our findings suggest that exercise therapy could be a potential approach to address cognitive dysfunctions in schizophrenia patients.

AB  - Over the past decade, awareness of plastic pollution has significantly increased, leading to a focus on its potential adverse effects on biota, including the ingestion of microplastics by fish. This study investigates the abundance, composition, and characteristics of microplastics in the gills and gastrointestinal tracts (GITs) of 96 coral reef fish with different feeding habits (herbivorous fish: Scarus rivulatus, Naso lituratus, and Acanthurus triostegus; omnivorous fish: Abudefduf vaigensis; carnivorous fish: Epinephelus merra) from the Xisha Islands Waters, South China Sea. The relationships between microplastic abundance and fish length, weight, and feeding habits were also analyzed. Results show that 97.92% of the sampled coral reef fish contained microplastics. The average abundance of microplastics in the gills and GITs was 1.09 +/- 0.25 items individual 1 and 1.74 +/- 0.26 items individual 1, respectively. The predominant shapes of microplastics were fibers, with black and blue being the most common colors. Most microplastics (90%) were smaller than 1 mm, and the main polymer types were PET, CP, PE, and PP. Additionally, the GITs contained more microplastics than the gills. Unlike the scope of previous studies, this study newly found the following two points: 1.Herbivorous fish had higher microplastic content than omnivorous fish, while carnivorous fish had the lowest, likely due to herbivorous fish feeding primarily on microplasticpolluted coral reefs. 2.The abundance of microplastics in the gills and GITs was not related to gill weight or GITs weight, however, the abundance of microplastics was significantly correlated with fish body length and body weight.

AB  - Environment-friendly nanostructured materials have been advocated as a promising and green tool for plant disease and insect pest management. It has been shown that chitosan nanoparticles (CNPs) and nanosilica could stimulate plant defenses against biotic stresses. However, to date, it has remained unknown how chitosan-silica nanocomposites mediated the mechanisms underlying the activation of plant resistance against insect herbivores. Herein, the activation effects of chitosan-coated mesoporous silica nanoparticles (CS-MSNs) on faba bean plant resistance against aphids (Acyrthosiphon pisum) were evaluated, as compared to single addition of CNPs and mesoporous silica nanoparticles (MSNs), respectively. Our results showed that foliar spray of 100 mg L-1 CS-MSNs reduced aphid reproduction in terms of nymph aphid population more effectively than equivalent application doses of CNPs, MSNs, and the acetamiprid pesticide. CS-MSNs decreased reproduction by 55.1% after 7 days post aphid infestation as compared to the control. Furthermore, CS-MSN application significantly reduced leaf oxidative stress in response to aphid attacks by increasing the activities of antioxidant enzymes (SOD, POD, CAT). The activation mechanism of CS-MSN-induced plant insect resistance was dependent on activating endogenous signals (Ca2+ influx and phytohormone accumulation) and enhancing defense metabolite (e.g., coumarin, quercetin) production. Altogether, CS-MSNs could act as an alternative control tool to simultaneously induce host plant resistance against herbivores and reduce the use of pesticides in agroecosystems.

AB  - The intensity of static electric field (SEF) in the surrounding environment of transmission lines has been greatly increased with the rapid development of ultra-high-voltage direct-current transmission. Therefore, the potential health effects of SEF have stimulated great public attention. It has been proven that SEF exposure can cause reversible damage to the nervous system through oxidative stress; however, the mechanism of its recovery is unclear. This study focused on nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2), a vital regulator of oxidative stress, and has been identified to notably impact the protection of organisms against many external stimuli. Herein, it was found that 56.3 kV/m SEF exposure for 7 days and 14 days significantly improved the expression levels of Nrf2 protein in the cytoplasm and nucleus of mice' hippocampus, as well as antioxidant genes, superoxide dismutase 2, and glutathione peroxidase 1. No significant difference in the expression level of the Nrf2 gene was found. The results indicated that the body could activate the Nrf2 signalling under SEF exposure by means other than up-regulation of Nrf2 gene expression. Inhibiting Nrf2 signalling by isoniazid could block SEF-induced gene transcription and protein expression, resulting in a decrease in antioxidant capacity, an increase in the level of lipid peroxide product, and irretrievability of learning and memory damage. These results demonstrated that the Nrf2 signalling pathway exhibited a protective role in SEF-induced oxidative damage and decline in learning and memory ability, which provides a potential strategy for preventing and treating SEF-related neurotoxicity.

AB  - Achillea species are used for therapeutic purposes in many countries. This study demonstrated the memory-enhancing, antioxidant, and anticholinesterase effects of Achillea pseudoaleppica essential oil in scopolamine-induced amnesia. The GC/FID-GC/MS system revealed camphor as the major compound in the oil. The application of the essential oil (1% and 3%) was performed on the rats by inhalation for 21 consecutive days before the performance of the behavioral tests (Y-maze and radial-arm maze tests). The essential oil application increased the spontaneous alternation behavior in scopolamine-induced rats in the Y-maze task. Furthermore, essential oil administration decreased working memory errors and reference memory errors in scopolamine-treated rats in the radial-arm maze test. Therefore, Achillea pseudoaleppica essential oil inhalation improved memory in scopolamine-treated rats. In addition, acetylcholinesterase and antioxidant profiles of the hippocampal tissues of the rats were examined. Essential oil administration decreased acetylcholinesterase and superoxide dismutase specific activities and malondialdehyde levels while increasing the total content of reduced glutathione in the rat hippocampus in scopolamine-treated rats. Therefore, in this study, the combination of scopolamine and Achillea pseudoaleppica essential oil improved memory formation and increased the activities of antioxidants and anticholinesterase.

AB  - Phenotypic and genetic clines frequently evolve due to varying selection along environmental gradients. However, the specific environmental factors that impose differential selection are often multivariate and difficult to tease apart. We addressed this complexity using a factorial manipulation of watering, soil nutrients and (simulated) herbivory in controlled conditions to better understand the agents of selection driving the evolution of clines in a polymorphic chemical antiherbivore defence, hydrogen cyanide (HCN), of the plant white clover Trifolium repens. We found the presence or absence of the two metabolic components required for HCN production (cyanogenic glucosides and linamarase) to be more prominent determinants of vegetative growth and sexual reproduction in T. repens than HCN itself. We also found that the ability to produce one or both of cyanogenic glucosides or linamarase resulted in a growth advantage under drought and simulated herbivory that outweighs the metabolic cost of their production. These results support the view that the metabolic components underlying HCN play important roles beyond defence by increasing plant tolerance to stress. The growth advantage under drought, however, was diminished in the absence of nutrient addition, consistent with multivariate interactions as drivers of selection. This study provides novel insight into how a cosmopolitan plant has adapted to environmental gradients, and more generally, highlights the importance of considering interactions between multiple environmental factors when studying the evolution of phenotypic and genetic clines.

AB  - Three-dimensional cell culture techniques mimic the in vivo cell environment more adequately than flat surfaces. Spheroids are multicellular aggregates and we aimed to produce scaffold-free spheroids of myogenic origin, called myospheres, using a mid-scale incubator and bioreactor hybrid. For the first time, we obtained spheroids from primary porcine muscle cells (PMCs) with this technology and compared their morphology and growth parameters, marker expression, and myogenic potential to C2C12-derived spheroids. Both cell types were able to form round-shaped spheroids in the bioreactor already after 24 h. The mean diameter of the C2C12 spheroids (44.6 mu m) was larger than that of the PMCs (32.7 mu m), and the maximum diameter exceeded 1 mm. C2C12 cells formed less aggregates than PMCs with a higher packing density (cell nuclei/mm(2)). After dissociation from the spheroids, C2C12 cells and PMCs started to proliferate again and were able to differentiate into the myogenic lineage, as shown by myotube formation and the expression of F-Actin, Desmin, MyoG, and Myosin. For C2C12, multinucleated syncytia and Myosin expression were observed in spheroids, pointing to accelerated myogenic differentiation. In conclusion, the mid-scale incubator and bioreactor system is suitable for spheroid formation and cultivation from primary muscle cells while preserving their myogenic potential.

AB  - In this study, we found that the deletion of the gene evfG in the type VI secretion system (T6SS) gene cluster significantly affected the motility of porcine extraintestinal pathogenic Escherichia coli (ExPEC) strain PCN033. Furthermore, the bacterial motility assay showed that Delta evfG mutants exhibited reduced motility compared to the parental strain. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) showed a significant reduction in the number of flagella in the mutant Delta evfG when compared with PCN033. To further explore the reasons why the deletion of evfG affects the motility of PCN033, transcriptomic and metabolomic analyses were conducted. The omics analyses showed that 134 differentially accumulated metabolites and 2236 differentially expressed genes were identified between the mutant Delta evfG and the parental strain PCN033. The metabolome profile and functional annotation analyses indicated that the impaired motility of Delta evfG was connected to the downregulation of the expression levels of genes associated with the energy metabolism pathway and flagellar assembly. Our study provides a new insight into the diminished PCN033 motility induced by evfG deletion. Moreover, the candidate genes and metabolites regulated by the gene evfG in the T6SS, which was involved in the motility of PCN033, were reported in this study.

AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a multifactorial pathology characterized by beta-amyloid (A beta) deposits, Tau hyperphosphorylation, neuroinflammatory response, and cognitive deficit. Changes in the bacterial gut microbiota (BGM) have been reported as a possible etiological factor of AD. We assessed in offspring (F1) 3xTg, the effect of BGM dysbiosisdysbiosis in mothers (F0) at gestation and F1 from lactation up to the age of 5 months on A beta and Tau levels in the hippocampus, as well as on spatial memory at the early symptomatic stage of AD. We found that BGM dysbiosisdysbiosis with antibiotics (Abx) treatment in F0 was vertically transferred to their F1 3xTg mice, as observed on postnatal day (PD) 30 and 150. On PD150, we observed a delay in spatial memory impairment and A beta deposits, but not in Tau and pTau protein in the hippocampus at the early symptomatic stage of AD. These effects are correlated with relative abundance of bacteria and alpha diversity, and are specific to bacterial consortia. Our results suggest that this specific BGM could reduce neuroinflammatory responses related to cerebral amyloidosis and cognitive deficit and activate metabolic pathways associated with the biosynthesis of triggering or protective molecules for AD.

AB  - Background The major aluminum (Al) detoxication mechanism of tea plant (Camellia sinensis), as an Al hyperaccumulator plant, is the fixation of almost 70% of Al in the cell walls. Pectin is the primary constituent of cell walls, a degree of methylation of pectin polysaccharides regulated by the pectin methylesterase (PME) genes can greatly affect the Al binding capacity. The knowledge on PME gene family in tea plant is still poor. Results We identified 66 (CsPME1-CsPME66) PME genes from C. sinensis genome. We studied their protein characterization, conserved motifs, gene structure, systematic evolution and gene expression under Al treatments, to establish a basis for in-depth research on the function of PMEs in tea plant. Gene structures analysis revealed that the majority of PME genes had 2-4 exons. Phylogenetic results pointed out that the PME genes from the same species displayed comparatively high sequence consistency and genetic similarity. Selective pressure investigation suggested that the Ka/Ks value for homologous genes of PME family was less than one. The expression of CsPMEs under three Al concentration treatments was tissue specific, eight PME genes in leaves and 15 in roots displayed a trend similar to of the Al contents and PME activities under Al concentration treatments, indicating that the degree of pectin de-esterification regulated by PME was crucial for Al tolerance of tea plant. Conclusions Sixty-six CsPME genes were identified for the first time in tea plant. The genome-wide identification, classification, evolutionary and transcription analyses of the PME gene family provided a new direction for further research on the function of PME gene in Al tolerance of tea plant.

AB  - This study investigated the effects of peat (PT) and maize straw biochar (MSB) on gas emissions and microbial metabolism characteristics during chicken manure (CM) and maize straw (MS) composting. Three treatments with different additives (0%, 5% PT, 5% MSB added on dry weight basis) were designed to conduct 30-day aerobic composting experiments in nine insulated polyvinyl chloride (PVC) reactors. The results showed that PT and MSB addition increased the temperature and nitrate-nitrogen (NO3--N) content but decreased the ammonium nitrogen (NH4+-N) content of compost. Compared with control, the total emissions of methane (CH4), nitrous oxide (N2O) and ammonia (NH3) in PT and MSB were reduced by 20.13-30.57%, 28.88-47.46% and 37.35-52.71%, respectively. In addition, PT and MSB amendments improved the microbial utilization capacity on carbohydrates, esters and carboxylic acids. Redundancy analysis revealed that temperature, NH4+-N, pH and microbial metabolism were positively correlated with CH4, N2O and NH3 emissions. Meanwhile, temperature, NH4+-N and pH also had positive correlations with microbial metabolism. Together these results indicated that PT and MSB amendment improved the metabolism capacity of microbes and reduced CH4, N2O and NH3 emissions, eventually mitigating nitrogen loss and promoting the quality of compost product.

AB  - The Cre-lox site-specific recombinase system is one of the most powerful and versatile technology platforms for studying neural stem cells (NSCs) in adult brain, which is now challenged due to the complex and dynamic nature of in vivo gene expression. In this study, we develop an inducible dual recombinase-mediated intersectional genetics by combining Dre-rox and Cre-lox recombination technologies to specifically target two subpopulations of NSCs (alpha- and beta-NSCs). By visiting their cell lineage and functionality, we find that alpha- and beta-NSCs display distinct self-renewal and differentiation potential, as well as differential responses to external stimuli. Notably, in contrast to alpha-NSCs, the number of beta-NSCs is not affected in aged mice and an APP/PS1 mouse model of Alzeimer's disease. Single cell transcriptome analysis reveals divergent molecular signatures between type alpha- and beta-NSCs and identifies PRMT1 as an important regulatory element to differentially regulate the neurogenic potential of alpha- and beta-NSCs. Inhibition of PRMT1 specifically enhances the neurogenic capacity of beta-NSCs and promotes the cognition functions in aged mice. Importantly, PRMT1 inhibition combined with increased BDNF levels pharmacologically ameliorates the cognitive impairments in APP/PS1 mice. Together, our study suggests that understanding the functional heterogeneity of NSCs might pave the way for harnessing the specific subpopulation of NSCs to treat brain disorders.

AB  - Many novel diseases are of zoonotic origin, likely including COVID-19. Describing diseases as originating from a diverse range of animals is known to increase risk perceptions and intentions to engage in preventative behaviors. However, it is also possible that communications depicting use of exotic animals as food sources may activate stereotypes of cultures at the origin of a disease, increasing discriminatory behaviors and disease stigma. We used general linear modeling and mediation analysis to test experimental data on communications about zoonotic disease origins from the critical first two months leading up to the declaration of a global pandemic. Results suggest that communications about potential familiar food origins (pigs) affected people's risk perceptions, health behaviors, and COVID-19 stigma compared to more exotic food sources (e.g., snakes). Participants (N = 707) who read descriptions of exotic origins viewed the virus as riskier and reported stronger intentions to engage in preventative behaviors than those who read about familiar origins (pigs). However, reading exotic origin descriptions was also associated with stronger intentions to avoid Asian individuals and animal products. These results are critical for both theory and public policy. For theory, they are the first to experimentally demonstrate that zoonotic origin descriptions can impact intentions to engage in discriminatory behaviors for cultures viewed as the origin of a novel infectious disease. For policy, they offer clear, actionable insights on how to communicate about risks associated with a novel zoonosis while managing the potential impact on discriminatory behaviors and stigma.

AB  - Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) is a severe disease affecting the human venous system, accompanied by high morbidity and mortality rates caused by early and late complications. The study aimed at analyzing the changes in the transcriptome of the femoral vein caused by DVT in the porcine model based on the formation of the thrombus in vivo. The study was performed on 11 castrated male pigs: A thrombus was formed in each left femoral vein in six animals; the remaining five served as a control group. Total RNA was isolated from the left femoral veins of the experimental and control animals. High-throughput RNA sequencing was used to analyze the global changes in the transcriptome of veins with induced DVT. Applied multistep bioinformatics revealed 1474 differentially expressed genes (DEGs): 1019 upregulated and 455 downregulated. Functional Gene Ontology annotated 1220 of DEGs into 225 biological processes, 30 molecular functions and 40 cellular components categories. KEGG analysis disclosed TNF, NF-kappa B and apoptosis pathways' overexpression in DVT samples. A thorough analysis of the detected DEGs indicated that a dysregulated inflammatory response and disturbed balance between clotting and anti-clotting factors play a crucial role in the process of DVT.

AB  - Purpose: Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is an endocrine disorder with the highest prevalence among other disorders in sexually-active women. It is associated with broad-spectrum hormonal and metabolic disturbances with behavioural difficulties. Experimentally, letrozole administration causes similar findings. Ascorbic acid is powerful anti-oxidant; and its cellular levels decrease with "hyperglycemic and poor anti-oxidative" status, which is, a main hallmark of PCOS. Thus, ascorbic acid administration may prevent the induction of PCOS and its consequences. Basic procedures: Forty female rats were divided into four groups (n = 10 in each): normal control (CTRL), ascorbic acid (ASC), letrozole (LTZ), and ascorbic acid + letrozole (ASC + LTZ) group. Behavioural tests (Y-maze spontaneous alteration, tail suspension test, forced swimming test) were performed. In serum, hormones (testosterone, estradiol, progesterone), glycemia (blood glucose, insulin and HOMA-IR) and oxidative stress (SOD activity, GSH) markers were measured. In hippocampus, inflammation and apoptosis indicators (p-JAK2, p-STAT5, p-ERK1/2, NF-kappa B, BAX, Bcl2, BAX/Bcl2 ratio) and neurotransmitters (DA, 5-HT, NE, BDNF) were determined. Lastly, ovary histopathological investigation was conducted to confirm PCOS induction. Principal results: Letrozole induced PCOS with subsequent disturbances. Testosterone levels were augmented while estradiol and progesterone were declined. Fasting blood glucose, insulin, HOMA-IR and oxidative stress markers were elevated. The expression of p-JAK2, p-STAT5, p-ERK1/2, BAX and the levels of NF-kappa B were increased, but Bcl2 expression, monoamines and BDNF levels were lowered. Importantly, ASC restored the last mentioned parameters markedly. Major conclusions: Ascorbic acid mitigated the behavioural difficulties of PCOS possibly by switching-off JAK2/STAT5 and JAK2/ERK1/2 pathways in hippocampus along with its neurotransmission-improving, hormonal-normalizing, anti-hyperglycemic and anti-oxidative effects.

AB  - The use of sensors for monitoring livestock has opened up new possibilities for the management of livestock in extensive grazing systems. The work presented in this paper aimed to develop a model for predicting the metabolisable energy intake (MEI) of sheep by using temperature, pitch angle, roll angle, distance, speed, and grazing time data obtained directly from wearable sensors on the sheep. A Deep Belief Network (DBN) algorithm was used to predict MEI, which to our knowledge, has not been attempted previously. The results demonstrated that the DBN method could predict the MEI for sheep using sensor data alone. The mean square error (MSE) values of 4.46 and 20.65 have been achieved using the DBN model for training and testing datasets, respectively. We also evaluated the influential sensor data variables, i.e., distance and pitch angle, for predicting the MEI. Our study demonstrates that the application of machine learning techniques directly to on-animal sensor data presents a substantial opportunity to interpret biological interactions in grazing systems directly from sensor data.

AB  - The use of lipases from animal sources for the synthesis of new biocatalysts is barely studied in the literature. The present work focused on the immobilization of lipases from kid goat's and lamb's epiglottis in different ionic supports. For this, anionic supports (monoaminoethyl-N-aminoethyl-agarose (MANAE) and diethylaminoethyl-agarose (DEAE)) and cationic supports (carboxymethyl-agarose and sulfopropyl-agarose) were used. The immobilization parameters were evaluated, as well as the thermal stability of the immobilized enzymes and their stability at different values of pH. Then, the performance of the biocatalysts was evaluated in hydrolysis reactions for obtaining omega-3 fatty acids from fish oil (eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA)). Values of 100% of recovered activity were obtained for lipase from goats, indicating that it was possible to maintain all the enzymatic activities of the immobilized enzymes on the supports. The immobilized enzymes were more stable in different pH conditions and at a temperature of 50 degrees C, reaching values of stabilization factor of 12.17 and t1/2 of 9.86 h-1, for lamb lipase immobilized in sulfopropyl agarose. In general, the anionic supports led to lower Km values and the cationic ones to a higher Vmax. Lamb lipase showed the highest selectivity values for EPA/DHA, reaching values of 6.43 using MANAE. Thus, the high potential for using such biocatalysts from animal sources in the food or pharmaceutical industries is observed.

AB  - Crown gall, caused by Agrobacterium tumefaciens (syn. Rhizobium radiobacter), is characterized by gall formation on crowns, stems or roots on many plant species. We describe the occurrence of this disease for the first time on cannabis (Cannabis sativa L. marijuana) plants in two licenced production facilities in British Columbia. Galls were observed on crowns, stems and roots of several genotypes, including 'White Rhino', 'Pink Kush' and 'Sour Kush'. The affected plants displayed no other visible symptoms. The incidence of crown gall was extremely low, estimated at 0.01% of total plants. Isolations made from root and stem galls on MacConkey medium (selective for Gram -ve bacteria) and on D1 medium (selective for Agrobacterium spp.) yielded a range of bacterial species, which did not include Agrobacterium sp. However, the presence of Agrobacterium in gall tissues was confirmed following PCR amplification with primers for the indole-acetic acid (iaa) H gene on the T-DNA region of Agrobacterium spp. and showed > 99% similarity to A. tumefaciens. Artificial inoculations were conducted using an A. tumefaciens strain from ATCC (Rhizobium radiobacter, strain designation TT134 [6-1-2, CIP 104 336], cat. 15955) which resulted in gall formation on five cannabis genotypes tested. These galls contained the iaaH gene as determined by PCR and the pathogen was successfully re-isolated on MacConkey agar medium at 4 and 10 weeks post-inoculation. Our findings confirm the occurrence of A. tumefaciens on naturally infected and artificially infected cannabis plants grown under greenhouse conditions and demonstrate reproducible gall symptoms on several cannabis genotypes following A. tumefaciens inoculation.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Vitrification of oocytes as a method of cryopreservation is quite successful, although it is still being standardized because of structural and molecular sensitivity of oocytes to the cooling and freezing process. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effect of ovarian storage temperature and time on post thaw viability and maturation rate of vitrified immature oocytes in sheep. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The work consisted of oocyte collection from ovaries of abattoir sheep stored at various temperature (0 degrees C, 4 degrees C and 25 degrees C) and time (0 h, 6 h, 12 h and 24 h) combinations and post thaw viability and in vitro maturation rate evaluation. Vitrification was done in 30% vitrification solution, using ethylene glycol and DMSO, with post vitrification evaluation after 1 week's storage. RESULTS: Significantly higher post thaw viability was observed after storage at 0 degrees C for 6 h (95.3%) followed by 12 h (85%), with lowest value at 24 h (66.7%). However at 4 degrees C and 25 degrees C, values were nonsignificantly higher after 6 h (96.5 and 100% respectively) followed by 12 h (93 and 100%), with significantly lower values after 24 h (85.7 and 90.7%). At storage temperatures of 25 degrees C and 4 degrees C, a significantly higher percentage of mature oocytes was observed after 6 h (40 and 39.1%), 12 h (37.3 and 38.1%) and 24 h (34.6 and 36.4%) storage times compared to that at 0 degrees C (20.3% at 6 h, 14.2% at 12 h and only 13.8% at 24 h). However, at all storage temperatures, there was a tendency for the level of mature oocytes to decrease with storage time, and the levels were significantly lower than the control. CONCLUSION: Acceptable post thaw viability and in vitro maturation rates for oocytes is maintained up to 24 h in ovaries stored at 4 degrees C and 25 degrees C compared to at 0 degrees C, and these conditions may be used for the storage of ovaries meant for oocyte preservation.

AB  - Cytochrome P450 (CYP) catalyzes a wide variety of monooxygenation reactions in plant primary and secondary metabolisms. Land plants contain CYP703, belonging to the CYP71 clan, which catalyzes the biochemical pathway of fatty acid hydroxylation, especially in male reproductive tissues. Korean/Asian ginseng (Panax ginseng Meyer) has been regarded as one of important medicinal plant for a long time, however the molecular mechanism is less known on its development. In this study, we identified and characterized a CYP703A gene in P. ginseng (PgCYP703A4), regarding reproductive development. PgCYP703A4 shared a high-sequence identity (81-83%) with predicted amino acid as CYP703 in Dancus carota, Pistacia vera, and Camellia sinensis as well as 76% of amino acid sequence identity with reported CYP703 in Arabidopsis thaliana and 75% with Oryza sativa. Amino acid alignment and phylogenetic comparison of P. ginseng with higher plants and known A. thaliana members clearly distinguish the CYP703 members, each containing the AATDTS oxygen binding motif and PERH as a clade signature. The expression of PgCYP704B1 was only detected in P. ginseng flower buds, particularly in meiotic cells and the tapetum layer of developing anther, indicating the conserved role on male reproduction with At- and Os- CYP703. To acquire the clue of function, we transformed the PgCYP703A4 in A. thaliana. Independent overexpressing lines (PgCYP703A4ox) increased silique size and seed number, and altered the contents of fatty acids composition of cutin monomer in the siliques. Our results indicate that PgCYP703A4 is involved in fatty acid hydroxylation which affects cutin production and fruit size.

AB  - Purple-leaf tea cultivars are known for their specific chemical composition that greatly influences tea bioactivity and plant resistance. Some studies have tried to reveal the purple-leaf formation mechanism of tea by comparing the purple new leaves and green older leaves in the same purple-leaf tea cultivar. It has been reported that almost all structural genes involved in anthocyanin/flavonoid biosynthesis were down-regulated in purple-leaf tea cultivars when the purple new leaves become green older leaves. However, anthocyanin/flavonoid biosynthesis is also affected by the growth period of tea leaves, gradually decreasing as new tea leaves become old tea leaves. This leads to uncertainty as to whether the purple-leaf formation is attributed to the high expression of structural genes in anthocyanin/flavonoid biosynthesis. To better understand the mechanisms underlying purple-leaf formation, we analyzed the biosynthesis of three pigments (chlorophylls, carotenoids, and anthocyanins/flavonoids) by integrated metabolic and gene expression analyses in four purple-leaf tea cultivars including Camellia sinensis var. sinensis and var. assamica. Green-leaf and yellow-leaf cultivars were employed for comparison. The purple-leaf phenotype was mainly attributed to high anthocyanins and low chlorophylls. The purple-leaf phenotype led to other flavonoid changes including lowered monomeric catechin derivatives and elevated polymerized catechin derivatives. Gene expression analysis revealed that 4-coumarate: CoA ligase (4CL), anthocyanidin synthase (ANS), and UDP-glucose: flavonoid 3-O-glucosyltransferase (UFGT) genes in the anthocyanin biosynthetic pathway and the uroporphyrinogen decarboxylase (HEME) gene in the chlorophyll biosynthetic pathway were responsible for high anthocyanin and low chlorophyll, respectively. These findings provide insights into the mechanism of purple-leaf formation in tea cultivars.

AB  - Aging is an irreversible pathophysiological process for all organisms. The accumulation of senescent cells in pathological sites or tissues is recognized as the major cause of diseases and disorders during the aging process. Small molecules that reduce senescent cell burdens have gained increasing attention as promising intervention therapeutics against aging, but effective anti-senescence agents remain rare. Camellia Sect. Chrysantha Chang is documented as a traditional Chinese herbal medicine used by ethnic groups for many medical and health benefits, but its effect on aging is unclear. Here, we investigated the anti-senescence potential of eight C. Sect. Chrysantha Chang species. The results show that ethyl acetate fractions from these C. Sect. Chrysantha Chang species were able to delay the senescence of H9c2 cardiomyocytes except for C. pingguoensis (CPg). N-butanol fractions of C. multipetala (CM), C. petelotii var. grandiflora (CPt), and C. longzhouensis (CL) showed a senescent cell clearance effect by altering the expression levels of senescent-associated marker genes in the DNA-damage response (DDR) pathway and the senescent cell anti-apoptotic pathway (SCAPs). By using UPLC-QTOF-MS-based non-targeted metabolomics analyses, 27 metabolites from Sect. Chrysantha species were putatively identified. Among them, high levels of sanchakasaponin C and D in CM, CPt, and CL were recognized as the key bioactive compounds responsible for senescent cell clearance. This study is the first to disclose and compare the anti-cell-senescence effect of a group of C. Sect. Chrysantha Chang, including some rare species. The combination of senescent markers and metabolomics analyses helped us to reveal the differences in chemical constituents that target senescent cells. Significantly, contrary to the C. chrysantha var. longistyla (CCL), which is widely cultivated and commercialized for tea drinks, CM, CPt, and CL contain unique chemicals for managing aging and aging-related diseases. The results from this study provide a foundation for species selection in developing small-molecule-based drugs to alleviate diseases and age-related dysfunctions and may potentially be useful for advancing geroscience research.

AB  - The continuous use of synthetic anthelmintics against gastrointestinal nematodes (GINs) has resulted in the increased resistance, which is why alternative methods are being sought, such as the use of natural products. Plant essential oils (EOs) have been considered as potential products for the control of GINs. However, the chemical composition and, consequently, the biological activity of EOs vary in different plant cultivars. The aim of this study was to evaluate the anthelmintic activity of EOs from cultivars of Ocimum basilicum L. and that of their major constituents against Haemonchus contortus. The EOs from 16 cultivars as well the pure compound linalool, methyl chavicol, citral and eugenol were used in the assessment of the inhibition of H. contortus egg hatch. In addition, the composition of three cultivars was simulated using a combination of the two major compounds from each. The EOs from different cultivars showed mean Inhibition Concentration (IC50) varying from 0.56 to 2.22 mg/mL. The cultivar with the highest egg-hatch inhibition, Napoletano, is constituted mainly of linalool and methyl chavicol. Among the individual compounds tested, citral was the most effective (IC50 0.30 mg/mL). The best combination of compounds was obtained with 11% eugenol plus 64% linalool (IC50 0.44 mg/mL), simulating the Italian Large Leaf (Richters) cultivar. We conclude that different cultivars of O. basilicum show different anthelmintic potential, with cultivars containing linalool and methyl chavicol being the most promising; and that citral or methyl chavicol isolated should also be considered for the development of new anthelmintic formulations.

AB  - Dietary selection and preference are poorly understood for the mountain bongo (Tragelaphus eurycerus isaaci Thomas, 1902). Focal animal sampling was used to determine seasonal food choice and preference for captive-bred individuals at the Mount Kenya Wildlife Conservancy, in preparation for reintroduction into the wild at a proposed sanctuary within the surrounding forest reserve. Food availability was assessed using nested plot sampling. Plant life forms contributed differently to the diet (H[4] = 28.93, p < 0.01), with shrubs accounting for 55%. Relative abundance of the principal food plant species influenced their contribution to the diet in both wet and dry seasons (chi(2) = 7.33, df = 1, p = 0.07; chi(2) = 2.47, df = 1, p = 0.116 respectively). Despite having a high relative abundance (1.88%), Trichocladus ellipticus Eckl. & Zeyh. was less preferred during the wet season (E* = 0.20). It was however most preferred during the dry season (E* = 0.78), possibly reflecting relative nutritive value. The bongos included a large proportion of grass (27%) in their diet like other browsing herbivores that inhabit forest glades. Compared to the conservancy, plant foods were well represented at the proposed sanctuary with 72% and 80% similarity in both wet and dry seasons. This potentially enhances the likelihood of bongos adapting and establishing once reintroduced.

AB  - BackgroundMajor depressive disorder (MDD) is characterized by hippocampal volume reduction, impacting cognitive function. Inflammation, particularly elevated tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) levels, is consistently implicated in MDD pathophysiology. This study investigates the relationships between TNF-alpha levels, hippocampal volume, beta-amyloid (A beta) burden, and cognitive abilities in MDD patients, aiming to illuminate the complex interplay among inflammatory markers, pathology indicators, structural brain alterations, and cognitive performance in non-demented MDD individuals.MethodFifty-two non-demented MDD patients, comprising 25 with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), were recruited along with 10 control subjects. Each participant underwent a thorough assessment encompassing TNF-alpha blood testing, 18F-florbetapir positron emission tomography, magnetic resonance imaging scans, and neuropsychological testing. Statistical analyses, adjusted for age and education, were performed to investigate the associations between TNF-alpha levels, adjusted hippocampal volume (HVa), global A beta burden, and cognitive performance.ResultsMCI MDD patients displayed elevated TNF-alpha levels and reduced HVa relative to controls. Correlation analyses demonstrated inverse relationships between TNF-alpha level and HVa in MCI MDD, all MDD, and all subjects groups. Both TNF-alpha level and HVa exhibited significant correlations with processing speed across all MDD and all subjects. Notably, global 18F-florbetapir standardized uptake value ratio did not exhibit significant correlations with TNF-alpha level, HVa, and cognitive measures.ConclusionThis study highlights elevated TNF-alpha levels and reduced hippocampal volume in MCI MDD patients, indicating a potential association between peripheral inflammation and structural brain alterations in depression. Furthermore, our results suggest that certain cases of MDD may be affected by non-amyloid-mediated process, which impacts their TNF-alpha and hippocampal volume. These findings emphasize the importance of further investigating the complex interplay among inflammation, neurodegeneration, and cognitive function in MDD.
   Patients with MDD and MCI exhibited higher TNF-alpha levels and reduced hippocampal volumes compared to controls. An inverse relationship was observed between TNF-alpha levels and hippocampal volume in the MCI MDD group, the overall MDD group, and across all subjects. No significant correlations were found between beta-amyloid deposition and TNF-alpha levels, hippocampal volume, or cognitive measures. image

AB  - Infection with Chlamydia pecorum is one of the main causes of progressive decline of koala (Phascolarctos cinereus) populations in Eastern Australia. Pathological changes associated with the chlamydial infection in the genital tract of female and male koalas have been widely described with reports of acute and chronic lymphoplasmacytic inflammation and the description of the cystic dilatation of the ovarian bursa. Although these disease manifestations can result in severe chronic inflammation, structural changes and even sterility, only limited data is currently available on the organism's distribution and associated histopathological and ultrastructural changes within the upper genital tract of affected females. This study examined the pathogenesis of the most common pathological lesion associated with chlamydiosis in female koalas, the cystic dilation of the ovarian bursa starting from the evidence that Chlamydia spp. induces disruption of the intercellular junctions in the epithelium of the reproductive organs in humans. Histology, immunohistochemistry (IHC) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) were performed to evaluate the structural features and the expression of epithelial cell and cellular junctions' markers in affected bursae from 39 Chlamydia-infected female koalas. Epithelial cells from the ovarian bursae of one affected animal examined by transmission electron microscopy showed severe widening of the intercellular space, as morphologic evidence of disrupted permeability of the epithelial barrier. The epithelial cell-cell junctions markers E-cadherin, beta-catenin and ZO-1 expressions were significantly reduced in samples from cystic bursae when compared to normal tissue samples (P < 0.0001). On the other end, a significantly higher expression of the proliferation marker Ki67 was observed in cystic bursae compared to control samples (P < 0.0001). As these proteins are required to maintain epithelial functional integrity and cell-cell adhesive interactions, their loss may permanently impair and affect female koala fertility and suggest the molecular basis of the pathogenesis of the cystic accumulation of bursal fluid within this tissue.

AB  - Porcine epidemic diarrhoea virus (PEDV) is a coronavirus that can cause severe watery diarrhoea in piglets, with high morbidity and mortality rates, seriously hindering the healthy development of the global swine industry. In this study, we isolated a strain of PEDV from Tibetan pigs and named it CH/GS/2022. Subsequently, we screened the apoptosis signals of PEDV-infected IPEC-J2 cells and studied the correlation between apoptosis signals and cell apoptosis. The results showed that different infections of PEDV induced different degrees of apoptosis in cells, and PEDV-induced cell apoptosis was dose-dependent. We then detected the expression of the p53, p38, JNK, Bax, and Bcl-2 genes in the apoptosis signal pathway. The results showed that 24 h after PEDV infection, the expression of the p53, p38, JNK, and Bax genes in IPEC-J2 cells increased significantly, while the expression of the Bcl-2 gene decreased significantly (p < 0.05). Subsequently, we used Western blot to detect the protein levels of these five genes, and the results showed that PEDV infection upregulated the expression of p53, p38, JNK, and Bax proteins (p < 0.05) while downregulating the expression of Bcl-2 protein (p < 0.05). Thus, it was initially inferred that PEDV infection could regulate cell apoptosis by activating the p53, p38, and JNK signalling pathways. Finally, we further investigated the apoptosis of the cells through the use of inhibitors. The results indicated that the p53 inhibitor Pifithrin-alpha has a significant inhibitory effect on the expression of the p53 protein after PEDV infection and can reverse the expression levels of Bax and Bcl-2 proteins. This suggested that p53 is involved in PEDV-induced cell apoptosis. Similarly, the p38 MAPK inhibitor SB203580 has an inhibitory effect on the expression of the p38 protein and can reverse the expression levels of Bax and Bcl-2 proteins. This suggested that p38 is also involved in PEDV-induced cell apoptosis. On the other hand, the JNK inhibitor SP600125 has no inhibitory effect on the expression of the JNK protein after PEDV infection, but the expression levels of Bax and Bcl-2 proteins have changed. Furthermore, it is noteworthy that SP600125 can inhibit the activity of apoptotic proteins but not their levels, resulting in reduced cell apoptosis. These preliminary results indicated that JNK may be involved in PEDV-induced IPEC-J2 cell apoptosis.

AB  - The objective of our research was to test hyperspectral imaging as a method for early detection and discrimination of biotic and abiotic stress in maize. We investigated the individual and combined effects of wireworm feeding and drought stress on leaf spectral responses and on various morphological and physiological traits of maize plants, selecting two hybrids with different tolerance to drought. Physiological parameters were determined at three time points (14, 21 and 28 days after adding wireworms and changing watering regime), along with hyperspectral imaging. Most of the differences in physiological characteristics between treatments were detected on day 21, when drought was the main cause of the negative physiological outcome, while the presence of wireworms only caused lower relative chlorophyll content, resulting in lower combined stress damage in some treatments. The morphological data showed greater wireworm damage to hybrid ZP341 and a greater negative effect of combined stress on hybrid FuturiXX. Hyperspectral imaging detected pest infestation and drought stress before they were detected by classical methods, with the highest overall accuracy on day 14 (84.7%) and the lowest on day 28 (67%). It can therefore be used as a method for early detection of wireworm infestation and/or drought in maize.

AB  - Most flowering plants rely on insects for pollination and flowers are advertised using odor and visual cues. Flower scent consists of a complex blend of volatile compounds of which the emission can vary over time (and space) within species. Pollinator foraging behaviour, such as the choice for flowers and the time spent gathering nectar and/or pollen, can also show significant intraspecific variation. Underlying variation in pollinator behaviour can be sensory or foraging-related biases among sexes or individuals. Investigating the role of temporal variation in floral volatiles on visitation behaviour of male and female pollinators is largely unexplored. We examined temporal variation in the emission of scent of yellowhorn Xanthoceras sorbifolium flowers, visitation behaviour of its main pollinators, male and female Bibio rufiventris flies, and their responses to floral volatile compounds using field experiments and controlled bioassays. Our results show significant daily fluctuations in floral volatile emission of X. sorbifolium in the field. The relative emission of 1-octen-3-ol, 1-octanol, benzaldehyde, and alpha-farnesene increased from 9:00 to 15:00 h, while (Z)-3-hexen-1-ol, (E)-2-hexen-1-ol, (E)-2-hexenal, 2-methyl-6-hepten-1-ol, (E)-2-nonenal, 2,6,6-trimethyl-2-cyclohexene-1-methanol, (E)-2-nonenal and (E,Z)-2,6-nonadienal decreased. In concert, we observed an increase in visits and visitation duration for male pollinators, but a decrease for female visitation duration. Pollinators exhibited sex-specific responses to floral volatiles, with attraction to 1-octen-3-ol and 1-octanol for B. rufiventris males, while (E)-2-nonenal, (E,Z)-2,6-nonadienal and (E)-2-hexenal attracted females. Our study shows that temporal variation in floral scent may explain differences in flower visitation by male and female pollinators through sex-specific responses to floral volatiles. Investigating sex-based differences exhibited by pollinators and temporal variation in floral scent emission will help understand the dynamic nature of plant-pollinator interactions.

AB  - Fall armyworm, Spodoptera frugiperda, is a serious invasive pest in Africa but "Push-Pull" companion cropping can substantially reduce infestation. Here, we elucidate the underpinning chemical ecology mechanisms. We hypothesized that companion crop volatiles repel herbivores (push) while attracting natural enemies (pull). Headspace volatiles collected from companion plants (Desmodium intortum, Desmodium uncinatum, Brachiaria Mulato II) were used in bioassays and electrophysiological recordings with S. frugiperda and parasitoid wasps. Insect populations, plant damage and herbivore parasitism were assessed in field plots. Coupled GC-electroantennogram (GC-EAG) recordings showed robust responses to certain aromatic and terpenoid volatile compounds. In wind tunnel bioassays, maize volatiles mixed with Desmodium volatiles were less attractive to moths than maize alone. In oviposition bioassays, S. frugiperda laid significantly fewer eggs on maize when Desmodium volatiles were present. Conversely, in an olfactometer bioassay, parasitoid wasps were attracted to the scent of both Desmodium spp. (intercrop) and the Brachiaria border crop. Our data provide evidence of the mechanisms underpinning reduced S. frugiperda infestation in the Push-Pull companion cropping system, i.e., volatiles from companion crops repel S. frugiperda while attracting its parasitoid natural enemies. These findings explain why Push-Pull field plots had fewer S. frugiperda larvae and lower crop damage than monocropped maize.

AB  - Adaptation to different host plants is considered to be an important driver of the divergence and speciation of herbivorous insects. The application of molecular data and integrated taxonomic practices in recent years may contribute to our understanding of population divergence and speciation, especially for herbivorous insects considered to be polyphagous. Aphis aurantii is an important agricultural and forestry pest with a broad range of host plants. In this study, samples of A. aurantii feeding on different host plants in the same geographical area were collected, and their population genetic divergence and morphological difference were analyzed. Phylogenetic analysis and haplotype network analysis based on five genes revealed that the population on Ficus exhibited significantly genetic divergence from populations on other host plants, which was also supported by the statistical analysis based on measurements of 38 morphological characters. Our results suggest that A. aurantii has undergone specialized evolution on Ficus, and the Ficus population may represent a lineage that is experiencing ongoing sympatric speciation.

AB  - Brassinolide is an endogenous sterol phytohormone containing multiple hydroxyl groups that has the important function of improving plant cold resistance and alleviating freeze damage. To explore the molecular mechanism of how brassinolide improves the cold resistance of tea plants, "Qiancha 1" was used as the material, and the method of spraying brassinolide on the leaves was adopted to explore its effects on the tea plants under 4 degrees C low-temperature treatment. The results showed that brassinolide can significantly increase the protective enzyme activity of tea plants under cold stress and reduce cold damage. At the transcriptome level, brassinolide significantly enhanced the expression of key genes involved in calcium signal transduction, Calmodulin (CaM), Calcium-dependent protein kinase (CDPK), calcineurin B-like protein (CBL) and calmodulin-binding transcriptional activators (CAMTA), which then activated the downstream key genes transcriptional regulator CBF1 (CBF1) and transcription factor ICE1 (ICE1) during cold induction. Quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) results showed that the expression of these genes was significantly induced after treatment with brassinolide, especially CaM and CBF1. When calcium signalling was inhibited, the upregulated expression of CBF1 and ICE1 disappeared, and when CAMTA was knocked down, the expression of other genes under cold stress was also significantly reduced. The above results indicate that brassinolide combined with the calcium signalling pathway can improve the cold resistance of tea plants. This study provides a new theoretical basis for the study of the cold resistance mechanism of brassinolide.

AB  - Photo-biomodulation (PBM) with near-infrared (NIR) laser emerges as a promising noninvasive therapy for enhancing cognitive function. Here the effects of PBM, equipped with an 808 nm NIR laser, on cognitive function are investigated when used to irradiate hippocampi of mice. NIR irradiation once a day for 5 min per day for 5 consecutive days significantly improves the learning and memory performance of na & iuml;ve mice assessed with the Barnes and Y maze tests. PBM also significantly attenuates cognitive dysfunction following anesthesia and surgery, and lipopolysaccharide challenge, respectively. Cognitive enhancements are associated with increased neuronal oscillations and enhanced theta-gamma coupling in the hippocampal dentate gyrus (DG) during cognitive processing. High neuronal activation in the DG is evidenced by increased c-Fos expression and calcium signal intensity. The improvements are also associated with high-density cells in the DG together with facilitating local energy deposition and neuronal activation. NIR-laser-activated axonogenesis and oxidative phosphorylation-related genes assessed with single-cell RNA sequencing were seen in the DG. These findings suggest that PBM very likely holds great potential as a noninvasive therapy for cognitive dysfunction.

AB  - Acclimation refers to the process by which plants adapt to the environment. This study was to illustrate the effect of acclimation length on the metabolic profile of tea leaves. In this study, 32 long-acclimated tea varieties in Shandong Province and 61 ST varieties were used as materials, and the metabolites of tea plants were detected by using UPLC-MS/MS method. The results showed that the accumulation of flavonoids, organic acids, and alkaloids in long-acclimated tea plants was higher than that in ST plants. In contrast, the accumulation of phenolic acids, lipids, and amino acids showed an opposite trend. In long-acclimated tea varieties, Camellia sinensis cv. Lucha11 (LC11), LC24, and LC30 showed high flavonoids, phenolic acids, organic acids, and alkaloids, which were important metabolites and related to tea quality. This study provides a theoretical basis for understanding the effect of environment on metabolism of tea plants and guides the breeding of new tea varieties with high quality or special flavor.

AB  - Fear Conditioning by Proxy (FCbP) is a form of socially mediated fear learning, in which no-conditioned rodents acquire fear memories through social interactions with fear-conditioned rodents. This study investigates the impact of prior similar experiences on the transmission of contextual fear memories in FCbP and explores the role of the ventral hippocampus (vHPC) in the social transmission of fear. Observers were divided into two groups: those with contextual experience (D/O) and those without contextual experience- na & iuml;ve (O). These rats were exposed to fear-conditioned demonstrators (D) through social interaction, and their responses to fear contexts were observed. Additionally, the effect of vHPC inactivation on fear memory transmission was examined by injecting lidocaine into the vHPC. Fear was transmitted through social interaction among experienced rats but not among naive rats. Furthermore, lidocaine injection into the vHPC inhibited the social transmission of fear memories among experienced rats. This study demonstrates that contextual fear memories can be transmitted through social interaction among experience-dependent rats but not among naive rats. That inactivation in the vHPC blocks the social transmission of contextual fear memories.

AB  - BackgroundPeroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPAR alpha) plays a crucial role in liver physiological and pathological processes. Yes-associated protein (YAP) is a key effector in regulating cell growth and organ size. Ubiquitination is known to modulate YAP protein expression, stability, and nuclear localization. Our previous study demonstrated that PPAR alpha activation promotes hepatomegaly and liver regeneration via YAP activation. However, the underlying molecular mechanisms by which PPAR alpha regulates YAP are unclear. In this study, PPAR alpha was activated by the classical agonist WY-14643, and its effects on YAP ubiquitination were examined using plasmid transfection and immunoprecipitation. The ubiquitination of YAP was further investigated through mutant YAP plasmids, gene knockdown, and immunofluorescence staining. YAP mRNA and protein expression were measured via qRT-PCR and western blotting.ResultsThe results demonstrated that PPAR alpha activation upregulated YAP protein levels and enhanced its activity, while reducing overall YAP ubiquitination. Specifically, PPAR alpha activation inhibited K48-linked ubiquitination while promoting K63-linked ubiquitination of YAP. Mutations at the K252, K321, and K497 residues of YAP markedly reduced the capacity of PPAR alpha activation to facilitate YAP nuclear translocation. Furthermore, knockdown of the E3 ligase TRAF6 abolished the PPAR alpha-induced K63-linked ubiquitination of YAP and the upregulation of its downstream target genes.ConclusionsThese findings highlight the pivotal role of ubiquitination in regulating YAP through PPAR alpha activation, providing novel insights for future studies on the post-translational regulation of YAP by PPAR alpha activation.

AB  - Simple Summary Ice cream may be used as a carrier to deliver probiotics and prebiotics. In this study, we decided to investigate the possibility of using sheep milk from the Olkuska breed for ice cream manufacture and evaluate the viability of Lactobacillus and Lacticaseibacillus strains and the chemical, physical and organoleptic properties of dairy ice cream during storage. The obtained results contribute to a more practical application of different probiotic strains for the fermentation of ice cream mixes and the possibility of using apple fiber in ice cream production. Moreover, the study's findings showed that symbiotic ice cream with acceptable physicochemical and organoleptic characteristics might be produced from sheep milk of the Olkuska breed. The aim of this study was to determine the possibility of using Olkuska sheep milk for the production of ice cream with probiotics and prebiotics. The study examined the effect of the storage and type of bacteria used for the fermentation of ice cream mixes and partial replacement of inulin with apple fiber on the physicochemical properties, viability of probiotic cultures and organoleptic properties of sheep's milk ice cream stored at -22 degrees C for 21 days. The addition of apple fiber reduced the pH value of ice cream mixes before fermentation. In ice cream mixes and ice cream with apple fiber, the lactic acid content was higher by 0.1-0.2 g L-1 than in their equivalents with inulin only. These differences persisted during the storage of the ice cream. After fermentation of the ice mixes, the bacterial cell count ranged from 10.62 log cfu g(-1) to 12.25 log cfu g(-1). The freezing process reduced the population of probiotic bacteria cells in ice cream with inulin from 0.8 log cfu g(-1) in ice cream with Lactobacillus acidophilus, 1.0 log cfu g(-1) in ice cream with Lacticaseibacillus paracasei and 1.1 log cfu g(-1) in ice cream with Lacticaseibacillus casei. Freezing the varieties with apple fiber also resulted in a reduction of viable bacterial cells from 0.8 log cfu g(-1) in ice cream with L. paracasei and Lb. acidophilus to 1 log cfu g(-1) in ice cream with L. casei, compared to the results after fermentation. The highest percentage overrun was determined in ice cream with L. paracasei and Lb. acidophilus. Ice cream with L. casei was characterized by significantly lower overrun on the 7th and 21st days of storage. Although L. paracasei ice cream had the highest overrun, it did not cause a significant reduction in the probiotic population during storage. After seven days of storage, the first drop differed significantly depending on the type of bacteria used for fermentation of the mixture and the addition of apple fiber. L. casei ice cream had a longer first drop time than L. paracasei and Lb. acidophilus ice cream. Partial replacement of inulin with apple fiber resulted in a significant darkening of the color of ice cream mixes. Depending on the type of bacteria used for fermentation, the addition of apple fiber decreased the value of the L* parameter. Ice cream mixes and ice cream with inulin and apple fiber were characterized by a high proportion of yellow. Partial replacement of inulin with apple fiber reduced the hardness of ice cream compared to inulin-only ice cream. Moreover, the panelists found that ice cream with inulin was characterized by a sweeter taste than ice cream with apple fiber.
   Moreover, the addition of apple fiber favorably increased the flavor and aroma perception of the mango-passion fruit. Therefore, the milk of Olkuska sheep could be successfully used for the production of symbiotic dairy ice cream.

AB  - The present study sought to identify and characterize a novel antimicrobial peptide, named MOp2 fromMoringaoleiferaseed protein hydrolysates, and elucidate its potential antimicrobial effects onStaphylococcus aureus. MOp2, with the aminoacid sequence of His-Val-Leu-Asp-Thr-Pro-Leu-Leu (HVLDTPLL), was characterized as a hydrophobic anionic AMP of the beta-sheet structure. MOp2 exhibited negligible hemolytic activity at 2.0xMIC, suggesting its inhibitory effect on the growth ofS.aureus(MIC: 2.204 mM). It maintained more than 90% of antimicrobial activity under 5% salt and about 78% of antimicrobialactivity at a high temperature of 115 degrees C for 30 min. Protease, especially acid protease, reduced its antimicrobial activity to differentextents. Moreover, MOp2 caused irreversible membrane damage toS. aureuscells by increasing the membrane permeability,resulting in the release of intracellular nucleotide pools. Additionally, molecular docking revealed that MOp2 could inhibitS. aureusgrowth by interacting with dihydrofolate reductase and DNA gyrase through hydrogen bonding and hydrophobic interactions.Overall, MOp2 could be a potential novel antimicrobial agent againstS. aureusin food processing.

AB  - Simple Summary The presented study examined the phenolic acids, flavonoids and salicylates contents in young, 3-month-old shoots of different willow (Salix spp.) cultivars. The contents of individual compounds were not identical and depended on the cultivar from which they were isolated. Then, the severity of foraging damage by deer to the analyzed willow cultivars was evaluated and correlated with the content of specific compounds from each analyzed group. The quantitative relationships of helicine and salicin from the group of salicylic compounds, and between ferulic, trans-cinnamic and synapinic acid from the group of phenolic acids, can determine the foraging attractiveness of willow shoots to cervids. This study examined the phenolic acids, flavonoids, and salicylates contents in young, 3-month-old shoots (including the leaves) of willow (Salix spp.). The cultivars were selected based on experiments carried out previously in Poland on fodder and energy willows. It was found, using the HPLC-MS/MS method, that the willow cultivars analyzed from three experimental plots, contained nine different phenolic acids, five salicylates and nine flavonoids, including four flavanols (quercetin, kaempferol, taxifolin and isorhamnetin), two flavanones (prunin, naringenin), two flavones (luteolin, apigenin) and one flavan-3-ol (catechin). The contents of individual compounds were not identical and depended on the cultivar from which they were isolated. The S. laurina 220/205 and S. amygdalina Krakowianka contained the greatest amounts of phenolic acids. The lowest quantities of these compounds were found in the S. viminalis Tur, S. pantaderana and S. cordata clone 1036. The highest concentration of flavonoids in young stems was found in S. fragilis clone 1043. The S. purpurea clone 1131 contained the highest amounts of salicylic compounds. Based on the results obtained from all experimental plots, it was shown that there is a negative correlation between the extent of browsing damage and the content of helicine and salicin from the group of salicylic compounds. A similar analysis between the phenolic acid concentration and the degree of willow browsing showed a positive correlation, especially between ferulic, trans-cinnamic, and synapinic acid. A negative correlation was found between the concentration of protocatechic acid content and browsing by cervids.

AB  - The ability of cortical circuits to adapt in response to experience is a fundamental property of the brain. After exposure to a moving dot sequence, flashing a dot as a cue at the starting point of the sequence can elicit successive elevated responses even in the absence of the sequence. These cue-triggered elevated responses have been shown to play a crucial role in predicting future events in dynamic environments. However, temporal sequences we are exposed to typically contain rich feature information. It remains unknown whether the elevated responses are feature-specific and, more crucially, how the brain organizes sequence information after exposure. To address these questions, participants were exposed to a predefined sequence of four motion directions for about 30 min, followed by the presentation of the start or end motion direction of the sequence as a cue. Surprisingly, we found that cue-triggered elevated responses were not specific to any motion direction. Interestingly, motion direction information was spontaneously reactivated, and the motion sequence was backward replayed in a time-compressed manner. These effects were observed even after brief exposure. Notably, no replay events were observed when the second or third motion direction of the sequence served as a cue. Further analyses revealed that activity in the medial temporal lobe (MTL) preceded the ripple power increase in visual cortex at the onset of replay, implying a coordinated relationship between the activities in the MTL and visual cortex. Together, these findings demonstrate that visual sequence exposure induces twofold brain plasticity that may simultaneously serve for different functional purposes. The non-feature-specific elevated responses may facilitate general processing of upcoming stimuli, whereas the feature-specific backward replay may underpin passive learning of visual sequences.

AB  - Chlamydia abortus causes the disease ovine enzootic abortion, which is one of the most infectious causes of foetal death in small ruminants worldwide. While the disease can be controlled using live and inactivated commercial vaccines, there is scope for improvements in safety for both sheep and human handlers of the vaccines. We have previously reported the development of a new prototype vaccine based on a detergent-extracted outer membrane protein preparation of C. abortus that was determined to be more efficacious and safer than the commercial vaccines when administered in two inoculations three weeks apart. In this new study, we have developed this vaccine further by comparing its efficacy when delivered in one or two (1 x 20 mu g and 2 x 10 mu g) doses, as well as also comparing the effect of reducing the antigen content of the vaccine by 50% (2 x 5 mu g and 1 x 10 mu g). All vaccine formulations performed well in comparison to the unvaccinated challenge control group, with no significant differences observed between vaccine groups, demonstrating that the vaccine can be administered as a single inoculation and at a lower dose without compromising efficacy. Future studies should focus on further defining the optimal antigen dose to increase the commercial viability of the vaccine.

   This study characterizes the carcass composition, meat quality, and sensory attributes of an Italian native ovine breed. This investigation aims to implement feeding strategies in light lambs to enhance healthier fatty acids in meat; this is possible by applying extruded linseed and extruded linseed + oregano in a total mixed ration. The dietary treatments have no significant effect on the growth performances, slaughtering data, carcass composition, and quality meat. Moreover, meat chemical composition is not affected by feed supplementation. The diet supplemented with linseed + oregano appears to reduce the concentration of saturated fatty as well as the n-6/n-3 ratio. Due to these changes, meat fatty acid profile is improved, and so are the lamb meat healthy properties. Consequentially, the obtained good sensory traits are compatible with the requirements of the market's consumer. The combination of nutritional and sensory traits, with properties related to human health that is presented by these native light lambs, qualifies this production as a good choice of red meat to be included in a larger proportion in human food.
   There is a growing demand by the modern consumer for meat containing less fat and lower levels of saturated fatty acids, which are considered to increase the risk of coronary heart disease. In southern Italy, the Gentile di Puglia breed is one of the most common on farms, and the light lambs are often consumed. The study evaluates the effect of a diet containing extruded linseed (Linum usitatissimum) on growth performances, carcass traits, and meat quality in Gentile di Puglia light lambs. Thirty-six male lambs are weaned at about 20 days of age, and divided into three groups-each group is either fed a control diet (C), a diet containing 3% extruded linseed (L), or a diet containing 3% extruded linseed and 0.6% oregano (Origanum vulgare) (L + O). The lambs' growth performances and the slaughtering and dissection data did not differ between groups. Dietary treatments have no significant effect on the quality and chemical composition of Longissimus lumborum (Ll). The mount of linoleic acid in Ll meat is significantly higher in the L group, and this positively affected the total content of n-3 Polyunsaturated Fatty Acid, as well as the n-6/n-3 ratio. The good results obtained concerning the sensory traits meet the requirements of the market's consumer.

AB  - Tea (Camellia Sinensis) is a popular and extensively consumable drink after water due to its excellent health benefits and medicinal properties. Global tea production is rapidly increasing to keep up with demand, but this also creates massive waste piles of tea that negatively influence the environment. By 2025, tea consumption is expected to have increased from approximately 6.3 million tons in 2020 to 7.4 million tons. Increasing the intake rate of tea has also been accompanied by a spike in the production of tea waste after usage. The present review study investigates the emerging application of tea waste management. Also, it addresses the sustainable recycling of waste from the tea industry, the beneficial application of biomass in agriculture composting, and other applications. Additionally, a thorough assessment of the manufacture of various value-added products from the generated tea waste. A detailed explanation of the challenges and new prospects of using tea waste in multiple industries, such as energy production and environmental remediation. The outcomes of this review research are essential for the world's sustainable and environmentally friendly growth. This review will address resource management within the framework of zero-waste principles and a regenerative economy. Also, this study will help academics acquire extensive knowledge about the many sustainable uses of waste from tea production as an economical and environmentally favourable alternative to biomass.

AB  - Heavy alcohol consumption followed by periods of abstinence (i.e., binge drinking) during adolescence is a concern for both acute and chronic health issues. Persistent brain damage after adolescent intermittent ethanol exposure in rodents, a model of binge drinking, includes reduced hippocampal neurogenesis and a loss of neurons in the basal forebrain that express the cholinergic phenotype. The circuit formed between those regions, the septohippocampal pathway, is critical for learning and memory. Furthermore, this circuit is also altered during the aging process. Thus, we examined whether pathology in septohippocampal circuit and impairments in spatial behaviors are amplified during aging following adolescent intermittent ethanol exposure. Female and male rats were exposed to intermittent intragastric gavage of water (control) or 20% ethanol (dose of 5 g/kg) for a 2 days on/off cycle from postnatal days 25-55. Either 2 (young adult) or 12-14 (middle-age) months post exposure, rats were tested on two spatial tasks: spontaneous alternation and novel object in place. Acetylcholine efflux was assessed in the hippocampus during both tasks. There was no adolescent ethanol-induced deficit on spontaneous alternation, but middle-aged male rats displayed lower alternation rates. Male rats exposed to ethanol during adolescence had blunted behavioral evoked acetylcholine during spontaneous alternation testing. All ethanol-exposed rats displayed suppression of the cholinergic neuronal phenotype. On the novel object in place task, regardless of sex, ethanol-exposed rats performed significantly worse than control-treated rats, and middle aged-rats, regardless of sex or ethanol exposure, were significantly impaired relative to young adult rats. These results indicate that male rats display earlier age-related cognitive impairment on a working memory task. Furthermore, male rats exposed to ethanol during adolescence have blunted behavior-evoked hippocampal acetylcholine efflux. In addition, middle-aged and ethanol-exposed rats, regardless of sex, are impaired at determining discrete spatial relationship between objects. This type of pattern separation impairment was associated with a loss of neurogenesis.

AB  - Because effective control measures are lacking, tea leaf spot caused by Didymella segeticola results in huge tea (Camellia sinensis) production losses on tea plantations in Guizhou Province, southwestern China. Screening for natural antimicrobial agents with higher control effects against this pathogen and studying their modes of action may contribute to disease management. Here, Penicillium griseofulvum-derived antimicrobial griseofulvin (GSF) can inhibit the hyphal growth of D. segeticola strain GZSQ-4, with a half-maximal effective concentration of 0.37 mu g/ml in vitro and a higher curative efficacy at a lower dose of 25 mu g/ml for detached tea twigs. GSF induces deformed and slightly curly hyphae with enlarged ends, with protoplasts agglutinated in the hyphae, and higher numbers of hyphal protuberances. GSF alters hyphal morphology and the subcellular structure's order. The integrated transcriptome and proteome data revealed that the transport of materials in cells, cellular movement, and mitosis were modulated by GSF. Molecular docking indicated that beta-tubulin was the most potent target of GSF, with a binding free energy of -13.59 kcal/mol, and microscale thermophoresis indicated that the dissociation constant (Kd) value of GSF binding to beta-tubulin 1, compared with beta-tubulin 2, was significantly lower. Thus, GSF potentially targets beta-tubulin 1 to disturb the chromosomal separation and fungal mitosis, thereby inhibiting hyphal growth.

AB  - Species identities of Goniobranchus nudibranchs with white bodies and various marginal bands have long been problematic. In this study, specimens of these Goniobranchus nudibranchs from the Philippines, Peninsular Malaysia, Japan, Papua New Guinea, and Madagascar were analyzed and molecular data were obtained in order to re-examine the relationships between species within this "white Goniobranchus with marginal bands" group. The analyses clearly recovered six species groups corresponding to the described species Goniobranchus albonares, G. preciosus, G. rubrocornutus, G. sinensis, and G. verrieri as well as one new species, G. fabulus Soong & Gosliner, sp. nov. Notably, G. preciosus, G. sinensis, G. rubrocornutus, G. verrieri, and G. fabulus Soong & Gosliner, sp. nov. exhibit color variation and polymorphism, suggesting that some aspects of color patterns (e.g., presence or absence of dorsal spots) may not always be useful in the identification of species in the "white Goniobranchus with marginal bands" group, whereas other features such as gill and rhinophore colors and the arrangement and colors of the mantle marginal bands are more diagnostic for each species.

AB  - A database was built with the results of the physicochemical analysis of 23,435 samples of wastewater discharges obtained from the operational reports presented and the cross-checks carried out by the Ministry of Health to the operating entities, in accordance with the provisions of Decree 30661-MINAE-S, for the period 2016-2020. Using Bayesian networks, the probabilities of compliance with current regulations were estimated by preparing an acyclic directed graph for three alternative scenarios. At the national level, the BOD and the COD are the variables that record the lowest values, showing important differences between the results obtained for the central region of the country with respect to the other regions. Another determining variable turned out to be the type of final disposal, wherein the reuse of wastewater presents important compliance deficiencies for all regions except for Chorotega. In the case of BOD, COD and TSS, the lowest probabilities are recorded for ISIC codes 3821 (treatment of non-hazardous waste), 1040 (manufacture of animal and vegetable fats) and 145 (pig farming). Additionally, the integrated environmental risk was calculated as a product of the discharges, obtaining that for the evaluated parameters, the BOD and COD represent the highest risk values given their probability of occurrence rate, as well as the magnitude of the environmental impact. The Pacifico Central and Brunca regions recorded the highest integrated environmental risk value for BOD, COD and TSS compared to the other areas of the country. Based on the results obtained, proposals for improvement were generated for the control of wastewater discharges carried out by the environmental authorities in search of achieving a better comprehensive management of the water resource.

AB  - Lamb welfare, performance and survival on rangeland is partially determined by the quality of maternal care received (i.e., high durations of sniffing/grooming, allowing udder access, and staying close to the lamb). Previous studies have explored maternal behavior scores (MBSs), as a tool to select ewes based on their proximity to the lamb and the shepherd, finding variable evidence towards sensitivity and robustness in scores in ability to gauge lamb outcome (birth weight and weaning weight), survival, and maternal care throughout the lambing season. Though this scoring system is convenient, there may be another behavioral attribute related to fear of human or relationship to the human handler may be elicited during lamb collection and processing. This longitudinal study investigated the presence of a trait in response to the human handler employing a Lamb Handling (during processing) and a Lamb Tie Down (after processing) test with N= 42 total ewes and n=26 ewes consistently present across both years of the study. The current study also set out to investigate the relationship between proximity to the shepherd and lamb outcome. Attempts to perform principal component analysis revealed that variables from the Lamb Handling and Lamb Tie down test were not suitable for factor analysis. In the Lamb Handling test, proportion of 'pacing' was a nearly significant, negative predictor (P=0.07) term in the binary 'investigating human' model, improved model fit and explained more variance compared to the null model [(cumulative weight: 90 vs 10 %); (R-adjusted(2): 30.8 vs 15.2 %; deviance= 31 vs 18.5 %)]. A random term for individual also improved fit in this model, indicating a potential behavioral trait driven by the ewe related to fear or perception of the human. The occurrence of grazing (0 or 1) was a nearly significant, positive predictor (P=0.06), improved model fit and explained more variance in the 'investigating human' model compared to the null model [(cumulative weight: 76 vs 24 %); (R-adjusted(2): 21 vs 15.2 %; deviance= 26.8 vs 18.5 %)]. Individual did not improve model fit in the relationship between 'investigation human' and 'grazing'. Weaning weights were a nearly significant positive predictor in the model for 'close proximity' at lamb collection (P=0.07) and a significant positive predictor for 'close proximity' during processing (P<0.001), however, did not improve model fit over the null. Birth weights improved model fit for behaviours including 'sniffing/grooming' and 'pawing' in the Lamb Tie Down test and these behaviours may have been moderated by maternal investment in heavier lambs. Behavioural responses, expanding beyond proximity measures, can be useful for gauging maternal attachment and investment in the lamb during and after processing. Fear or perception of humans should also be considered as contributors to the response to the shepherd during human-animal interactions in the lambing season.

AB  - Background: Sanguinarine (SAN) is an important natural anti-inflammatory constitutes and dietary supplementation with SAN could improve the relative length of the intestine, alter gut microbiota, and enhance growth performance of pigs, broiler chickens, and cattle. However, it is unclear whether it has the therapeutic effect on ulcerative colitis (UC).
   Purpose: This study aimed to investigate the therapeutic effect of SAN on UC and explore its mechanisms of action.
   Study design and methods: Several efficacy indexes of SAN on dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced C57BL/6 mice were evaluated. ELISA kit and western blot analysis were used to evaluate it's anti-inflammatory effect and the mechanism of action. 16S rDNA sequencing detection was used to determine the impact of SAN on gut microbiota.
   Results: SAN and Sulfasalazine could significantly improve the colon length, the weight loss, the symptoms and the pathological injury of colon in DSS-induced mice. Meanwhile, SAN could decrease the levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-alpha, IFN-gamma, IL-1 beta, IL-6, IL-13 and IL-18) and increase the levels of anti-inflammatory cytokines (IL-4 and IL-10) in colon, and suppress DSS-induced high expressions of NLRP3, caspase-1 and IL-1 beta. In addition, SAN (0.5, 1 mu M) could inhibit the expression level of NLRP3 and the activation of caspase-1 and IL-1 beta in lipopolysaccharide-stimulated THP-1 cells in non-cytotoxic doses, which was similar to that of MCC950, a specific inhibitor of NLRP3 inflammasome activation. The abundance changes of many genera such as Muribaculaceae_unclassified, Escherichia-Shigella, Lachnospiraceae_NK4A136_group and Helicobacter were also closely related to the improvement of SAN on intestinal inflammatory response.
   Conclusion: SAN exhibited therapeutic effect on DSS-induced colitis by blocking NLRP3-(Caspase-1)/IL-1 beta pathway and improving intestinal microbial dysbiosis. SAN might be developed to treat UC and other disorders associated with microbial dysbiosis.

AB  - Plant volatile organic compounds (VOCs) are the key distress signals involved in tritrophic interactions, by which plants recruit predators to protect themselves from herbivores. However, the effect of nitrogen fertilization on VOCs that mediate tritrophic interactions remains largely unidentified. In this study, a maize (Zea mays)-aphid (Rhopalosiphum padi)-ladybird (Harmonia axyridis) tritrophic interaction model was constructed under high-nitrogen (HN) and low-nitrogen (LN) regimens. H. axyridis had a stronger tendency to be attracted by aphid-infested maize under HN conditions. Then, volatiles were collected and identified from maize leaves on which aphids had fed. All of the HN-induced volatiles (HNIVs) elicited an electroantennogram (EAG) response from H. axyridis. Of these HNIVs, 1-nonene was attractive to H. axyridis under simulated natural volatilization. Furthermore, our regression showed that the release of 1-nonene was positively correlated with H. axyridis visitation rates. Supplying 1-nonene to maize on which aphids had fed under LN enhanced attractiveness to H. axyridis. These results supported the conclusion that 1-nonene was the active compound that mediated the response to nitrogen in the tritrophic interaction. In addition, the 1-nonene synthesis pathway was hypothesized, and we found that the release of 1-nonene might be related to the presence of salicylic acid (SA) and abscisic acid (ABA). This research contributes to the development of novel environmentally friendly strategies to optimize nitrogen fertilizer application and to improve pest control in maize crops.

AB  - Tea is one of the most popular healthy and non-alcoholic beverages worldwide. Tea anthracnose is a disease in tea mature leaves and ultimately affects yield and quality. Colletotrichum camelliae is a dominant fungal pathogen in the tea field that infects tea plants in China. The pathogenic factors of fungus and the susceptible factors in the tea plant are not known. In this work, we performed molecular and genetic studies to observe a cerato-platanin protein CcCp1 from C. camelliae, which played a key role in fungal pathogenicity. oCcCp1 mutants lost fungal virulence and reduced the ability to produce conidia. Transcriptome and metabolome were then performed and analysed in tea-susceptible and tea-resistant cultivars, Longjing 43 and Zhongcha 108, upon C. camelliae wild-type CCA and oCcCp1 infection, respectively. The differentially expressed genes and the differentially accumulated metabolites in tea plants were clearly overrepresented such as linolenic acid and linoleic acid metabolism, glycerophospholipid metabolism, phenylalanine biosynthesis and metabolism, biosynthesis of flavonoid, flavone and flavonol etc. In particular, the accumulation of jasmonic acid was significantly increased in the susceptible cultivar Longjing 43 upon CCA infection, in the fungal CcCp1 protein dependent manner, suggesting the compound involved in regulating fungal infection. In addition, other metabolites in the glycerophospholipid and phenylalanine pathway were observed in the resistant cultivar Zhongcha 108 upon fungal treatment, suggesting their potential role in defense response.

AB  - Knowledge of food web interactions is essential for understanding the role of carnivores in an ecosystem and designing appropriate conservation and management strategies to preserve them. These interactions can only be understood by studying carnivores' diets and obtaining comprehensive and unbiased diet data. For large carnivores-which typically rely on large herbivores as prey-the role of smaller prey species has not received attention. This study aims to quantify the contribution of small (5-50 kg) and very small (<5 kg) prey taxa in the diet of lions (Panthera leo melanochaita) in four Kenyan National Parks (NPs). We use DNA metabarcoding to achieve higher-resolution insights into prey composition, which is less biased toward large prey species compared to traditional methods, such as carcass counts. Our study identified 24 prey taxa in a total of 171 lion fecal samples. Small and very small prey taxa together contributed 18.7% out of 278 prey occurrences in all fecal samples, with comparable small prey presence (ranging from 8% to 15%) in the diet for each NP studied. This approach proved to be useful in detecting small and very small prey species in the diet of lions and can therefore be used in future research to uncover the diverse diet composition of these large carnivores. The consistent presence of smaller prey species in the diet indicates that lions generally supplement their large prey diet with smaller prey.

AB  - Endocannabinoids, acting primarily through CB1 receptors, are critical modulators of neuronal activity, influencing cognitive functions and emotional processing. CB1 receptors are highly expressed in the hippocampus, primarily on GABAergic interneurons, modulating the excitation/inhibition balance. Previous evidence suggests the functional heterogeneity of CB1 receptors along the dorsoventral axis of the hippocampus. However, it is not known whether CB1 receptors differentially modulate basic aspects of the local neuronal network along the hippocampus. This study investigated how CB1 receptor activation modulates excitability, paired-pulse inhibition (PPI), and short-term neuronal dynamics (STND) in the dorsal and ventral CA1 hippocampus under physiologically relevant conditions. Using extracellular recordings from hippocampal slices of male Wistar rats, we compared the effects of two CB1 receptor agonists, ACEA and WIN55,212-2, on network activity in the dorsal and ventral hippocampus. We found that both agonists significantly increased excitability and reduced PPI in the dorsal, but not the ventral, hippocampus. Similarly, CB1 receptor activation modulated STND more prominently in the dorsal hippocampus, reducing facilitation at low frequencies and reversing depression at high frequencies, whereas effects on the ventral region were minimal. These dorsoventral differences in the actions of cannabinoid receptor agonists occurred despite similar CB1 receptor expression levels in both regions, suggesting that functional differences arise from downstream mechanisms rather than receptor density. Pre-application of the GIRK channel blocker Tertiapin-Q occluded the effects of WIN55,212-2 on STND, indicating a significant role of GIRK channel-mediated signaling in CB1 receptor actions. These findings demonstrate that CB1 receptors modulate hippocampal circuitry in a region-specific manner, with the dorsal hippocampus being more sensitive to cannabinoid signaling, likely through differential engagement of intracellular signaling pathways such as GIRK channel activation. These results provide novel insights into how endocannabinoid signaling differentially regulates neuronal dynamics along the dorsoventral axis of the hippocampus. They also have important implications for understanding the role of cannabinoids in hippocampus-dependent behaviors.

AB  - Seed defence priming is emerging as a novel, cost-efficient and environmentally safe tool for pest management. It has been proposed as a means to uncouple the defence-growth trade-off in plants by enhancing defence responses with minimal fitness costs, but the mechanisms underlying this role remain elusive. Here, we investigated seed priming as a mitigator of the compromise between growth and defence in Arabidopsis thaliana upon pest infestation, focusing on its molecular dynamics. After studying the effect of a set of seed priming agents on plant resistance and growth, and once an effective elicitor was identified, a combined -omics approach was employed to decipher the molecular mechanisms underlying that regulation. We found that seed priming with 0.1 mM methyl jasmonate effectively boosted plant defence with no obvious fitness penalty as a result of a fine-tune regulation between transcriptome and metabolome. The basal state of readiness of primed plants was characterized by reduced stomatal aperture, high transcriptomic variation, increased sugar content and enhanced translational rate. Upon pest infestation, primed plants exhibited herbivore-specific molecular responses, with the phenylpropanoid pathway showing particular relevance. These findings demonstrate that methyl jasmonate seed priming can enhance pest-tailored defences in plants without incurring any obvious fitness penalty.

AB  - Simple Summary Phytases of bacterial origin are the exogenous enzymes most widely used in the diets of monogastric animals, acting on the hydrolysis of phytate (myo-inositol 1,2,3,4,5,6-hexakis [dihydrogen] phosphate) to release the phosphate from this complex. However, the efficiency of phytase varies according to the aspects inherent to its own structure and origin, the age and physiological state of the animal, and the dietary composition. Overall, we found that supplementation with phytase between 1500 and 3000 units of phytase (FYT)/kg of feed in diets based on corn and soybean meal with a reduction in inorganic phosphorus (0.13%) and calcium (0.11%) improves the daily weight gain (DWG) and live weight (LW) of animals in the growing phase, which affects performance on finishing phases and slaughter body weight. This input could result in a reduction in the use of phosphorus sources, improving environmental issues with an increase in the main zootechnical parameters. The effects of increasing doses of bacterial phytase (Citrobacter braakii) on performance and carcass characteristics of growing-finishing pigs was evaluated. A total of 120 barrows weighing 25.16 +/- 2.80 kg and 68 days old were submitted to five treatments: positive control diet (PC) containing inorganic phosphorus (P) and limestone (Ca); negative control (NC) with reductions in P (by 0.13%) and Ca (by 0.11%); and three NC diets supplemented with 1500 (NC15), 3000 (NC30) and 4500 (NC45) units of phytase (FYT)/kg. The daily weight gain (DWG) in growth phase I (68-91 days) was higher in the PC, NC15 and NC30, compared to the NC (1.06, 1.06, 1.06 vs. 0.95, respectively). The DWG in finishing phase II (141-156 days) was higher in the NC15 (1.20 kg) and NC30 (1.14 kg) than in the NC45 (0.94 kg). The final weights (LW156) in the NC15 (122.95 kg LW) were higher than NC (116.47 kg LW) and NC45 (114.43 kg LW). Over the entire period, a quadratic effect (2012 FYT) was observed for the DWG. The increasing levels of phytase in corn and soybean meal-based diets improved the DWG and carcass traits; however, the addition of more than 3000 FYT/kg of feed should be carefully studied to determine enzyme viability.

AB  - Wildlife forensic science is a growing research field globally with application in criminal cases of illegal hunting requiring an estimate of time of death based on insect fauna. The techniques and procedures of forensic entomology acquired over the last 40 years, used in legal cases relating to human remains, can be adapted to decomposing wildlife. Research on carrion utilising the rate of development of insect immatures provides a biological clock from which a minimum post-mortem interval (minPMI) can be derived. The following study concerns 19 rhinoceros that were illegally killed and dehorned in the Republic of South Africa between 2014 and 2021. The paper details 74 samples of insect evidence collected from these rhinoceros remains from which an accurate estimate of their PMI was calculated. The specimens comprised 18 species from 12 families belonging to three insect orders. Many Dipteran and Coleopteran species were found on and around each carcass. The species of fly larvae (family Calliphoridae) used in each case to estimate the PMI are as follows: Chrysomya marginalis (Wiedemann) (13 cases), Chrysomya chloropyga (Wiedemann) (2 cases), Chrysomya albiceps (Wiedemann) (1 case) and Chrysomya megacephala (Fabricius) (1 case). Two species of Coleoptera from the family Dermestidae and Silphidae involved Dermestes maculatus (DeGeer) and Thanatophilus micans (Fabricius), respectively, also were involved in one PMI estimation each. The paper highlights opportunities for improving our global understanding of gaps in procedures and training related to wildlife criminal cases.

Navorsing oor aas wat die tempo van ontwikkeling van insek-onvolwassenes gebruik, bied 'n biologiese horlosie waaruit 'n minimum nadoodse interval (minPMI) afgelei kan word. Die volgende studie handel oor 19 renosters wat tussen 2014 en 2021 onwettig in die Republiek van Suid-Afrika doodgemaak en onthoring is. Die koerant bevat 74 monsters van insekbewyse wat uit hierdie renosterreste versamel is, waaruit 'n akkurate skatting van hul PMI bereken is. Die monsters bestaan uit 18 spesies uit 12 families wat tot 3 insekordes behoort. Baie Diptera-en Coleoptera-spesies is op en om elke karkas aangetref. Die spesies vlieglarwes van die Calliphoridae familie wat in elke geval gebruik word om die PMI te skat, is soos volg: Chrysomya marginalis (Wiedemann) (13 gevalle), Chrysomya chloropyga (Wiedemann) (2 gevalle), Chrysomya albiceps (Wiedemann) (1 geval) en Chrysomya megacephala (Fabricius) (1 geval). Twee spesies Coleoptera van die familie Dermestidae en Silphidae onderskeidelik was Dermestes maculatus (DeGeer) en Thanatophilus micans (Fabricius), wat ook betrokke by was in 1 PMI skatting elk. Die referaat beklemtoon geleenthede vir die verbetering van ons globale begrip van leemtes in prosedures en opleiding wat verband hou met wildmisdadige sake gebaseer op die evaluering van plaaslike wildlewe-gevallestudies.

AB  - Simple Summary Gastrointestinal nematodes are included worldwide among the most prominent parasites of small ruminants. In past decades, the control of these nematodes mainly relied on the use of synthetic anthelmintic drugs. However, nowadays the exclusive use of anthelmintic drugs is considered an obsolete and unsustainable control strategy due to the onset of anthelmintic-resistant sheep gastrointestinal nematode strains and the issues linked with the environmental pollution and residues in food of animal origin of synthetic anthelmintic drugs. Among alternative or complementary methods, the use of plants endowed with anthelmintic properties has been identified as a valuable option. As a part of this approach, this study evaluated the in vitro anthelmintic properties of two commercial sea buckthorn (Hippophae rhamnoides) berry juices on sheep gastrointestinal nematodes. Both H. rhamnoides berry juices tested in this study showed interesting anthelmintic properties in vitro. The obtained results are promising regarding the use of sea buckthorn berry juice as a potential tool for the control of gastrointestinal nematodes in small ruminants. Gastrointestinal nematodes are one of the major threats in small ruminant breeding. Their control is difficult due to the development of anthelmintic resistance, and the search for new molecules endowed with anthelmintic activity (AH) is considered a priority. In this context, we evaluated the in vitro AH activity of two commercial sea buckthorn (Hippophae rhamnoides) berry juices, namely SBT and SBF. The in vitro evaluation was based on the egg-hatch test and larval exsheathment assay at different concentrations. Data were statistically analysed, and the EC50 was calculated. Chemical analyses were performed to evaluate the total polyphenol content of the juices and chemical profile of the most represented compounds. The role of the polyphenolic fraction in the anthelmintic activity of the juices was also assessed. At the highest concentrations, the activity of SBT was high in both tests and comparable to that observed in the thiabendazole-treated positive controls, while SBF showed a lower efficacy. Glycosylated isorhamnetin and quercetin were the most represented polyphenolic compounds in both juices. In conclusion, both H. rhamnoides berry juices tested in this study showed interesting anthelmintic properties in vitro.

However, there are few comparative studies on protein hydrolysates from different dairy species, their production, characterization, and bioactivity. In the present study, skimmed milk from both major and minor dairy species was hydrolyzed with alcalase, and its protein profiles were studied using tricine polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and reverse phase-high protein liquid chromatography. The antioxidant and in vitro immunostimulatory properties were determined. RESULTS Iron chelation activity was highest in hydrolysates of whey (25.00 +/- 0.32 mmol L-1), casein (25.14 +/- 0.34 mmol L-1), colostrum (24.52 +/- 0.28 mmol L-1), and skimmed cattle milk (24.21 +/- 0.26 mmol L-1 ). alpha,alpha-Diphenyl-beta-picrylhydrazyl scavenging and 2,2 '-azobis(2-amidino-propane) dihydrochloride activity was lowest in skimmed donkey milk protein hydrolysates (MPHs) (IC50: 5.37 +/- 0.05 mg mL(-1) and 151.59 +/- 2.1 mg mL(-1)). Production of nitric oxide and phagocytosis activity in RAW 264.7 (murine macrophage cell line) was significantly higher among whey and buffalo skimmed milk protein hydrolysate-treated groups as compared with the untreated group. The incorporation of whey protein hydrolysate and skimmed buffalo milk protein hydrolysate were sensorially acceptable at 10% level in beverage mix. CONCLUSION This study comparatively evaluates the antioxidative and immunomodulatory properties of different skimmed MPHs and their potential applications as ingredients in pediatric, geriatric, and other health-promoting foods.

AB  - The coal industry in India, which provides 55% of the nation's energy, has also contributed to the degradation of groundwater quality in nearby areas. This study systematically reviews groundwater quality near Indian coalfields, assessing its suitability for drinking and industrial purposes. Data for this study were retrieved from Scopus, PubMed, and Web of Science using title-based searches with keywords like groundwater, coal mining, metals, and India, yielding 17 relevant articles that reviewed 19 physico-chemical parameters in groundwater near 10 major coalfields, marking the first comprehensive assessment of groundwater quality in these regions. To assess groundwater quality for drinking, several analyses were conducted, including the Pollution Index of Groundwater (PIG), health risks associated with nitrate and fluoride, and metal toxicity evaluated through indices such as contamination degree (CD) and ecological risk index (ERI). Moreover, the suitability of groundwater for industrial purposes was assessed using several indices, including the Chloride-Sulfate Mass Ratio, Revelle Index, Larson-Skold Index, Langelier Index, Ryznar Stability Index, and Puckorius Scaling Index. Comparing the water quality parameters with drinking water standards of India, fluoride concentration is low (potentially contributing to dental caries), while Fe and Cd exceed standards by 1.43 and 1.56 times, respectively, with these elevated levels being influenced by coal mining activities. The PIG revealed that four coalfields significantly contribute to groundwater pollution, with sulfate as the primary pollutant. Additionally, non-carcinogenic risks were existed for adults and children due to nitrate and fluoride. CD and ERI indicate that metals pose low to moderate pollution levels, with Fe and Cd being the predominant contributors to CD and ERI, respectively. Additionally, irrigation indices indicated that the water exhibits significant corrosive potential. This study underscores the critical need for targeted water management strategies to mitigate health risks and industrial damage caused by groundwater contamination in India's coal mining regions.

AB  - Simple Summary: Anemia is a common condition in sow herds especially during gestation. The condition occurs despite iron supplementation in feed and has been associated with increased stillbirth rate. We currently have limited knowledge about the consequences of anemia during gestation in sows. The aim of this study was to assess the effects of severe iron deficiency during gestation on sow and piglet health outcomes in an experimental model. For sows, hematologic parameters were monitored at regular intervals and farrowing results were recorded. After farrowing, tissue iron concentrations in sows and new born piglets were measured. Results of our study showed that sows and piglets were adversely affected by iron deficiency anemia (IDA) during gestation. Mild to severe IDA resulted in reduced tissue iron stores at farrowing in sows and piglets. Strategies to overcome the condition could therefore be beneficial to the pig industry.
   Anemia is a common condition in sow herds. We aimed to study the effects of severe iron deficiency during gestation on sow and piglet health outcomes with an experimental model for blood-removal-induced iron deficiency anemia. In total, 18 multiparous sows (8 in trial I and 10 in trial II) were allocated to either a blood removal group or a control group. Hematologic parameters were monitored at regular intervals and the tissue iron concentrations were measured for the sows and newborn piglets after farrowing. In trial I, the mean liver iron content was reduced to 46.7 mu g/g in the blood removal sows compared to 252.6 mu g/g in the controls (p < 0.001). In trial II, sows in the blood removal group had lower iron content in the liver (147.8 mu g/g), kidney (46.3 mu g/g) and spleen (326.5 mu g/g) compared to the control sows (323.2 mu g/g, 81.3 mu g/g and 728.9 mu g/g, respectively; p = 0.009, 0.016, 0.01, respectively). In trial I, piglets from sows in the blood removal group had significantly decreased hematocrit (Hct), red blood cells (RBC) and a tendency for reduced hemoglobin (Hb) compared to the control piglets. We established a blood removal model that resulted in mild- to severe degrees of sow anemia and reduced tissue iron stores at farrowing.

AB  - Methyl salicylate (MeSA) is an herbivore-induced plant volatile widely tested for attracting natural enemies for pest control. MeSA is commercially sold as slow-release lures or as a spray. While MeSA application has increased the abundance of natural enemies in numerous food crops, its ability to reduce pests for crop protection is not as frequently demonstrated. Our first objective was to test MeSA lures in ornamental fields where few studies have been done, and monitor natural enemies, pests, and crop protection. A 2-year study in spruce container yards revealed more aphid parasitoids (Pseudopraon sp.), fewer aphids (Mindarus obliquus) on shoot tips, and less shoot tip damage in MeSA plots during the first year. A 2-year study in red maple fields revealed more predatory lady beetles and rove beetles, and parasitic Ceraphronidae, Diapriidae, and Chalcidoidea in one or both years with MeSA. Fewer pest thrips were also captured in MeSA plots, though it is not clear whether this was due to enhanced predation or reduced colonization. Maple growth as measured by stem diameter change did not differ with MeSA use. A 2-year study examining predation on sentinel Halyomorpha halys eggs in various mature ornamental stock blocks found no increase in predation except for 1 month, though green lacewings, lady beetles, and predatory thrips occurred more in MeSA plots in the first year. While MeSA is expected to enhance biological control by herding in natural enemies, the impacts that applied volatiles have on predator efficiency is mostly unknown. Thus, our second objective examined how volatiles would impact feeding rates at close-range. Adult carabid Pterostichus melanarius, adult coccinellids Coccinella septempunctata and Harmonia axyridis, and larval lacewing Chrysoperla rufilabris consumed their prey at similar rates in the presence/absence of MeSA when food was presented directly in a 28 cm(2) or 30 ml arena, or when foraging in a 520 cm(2) outdoor soil arena or 946 ml arena with aphids on leaves.

AB  - It is well known that application of exogenous trehalose can enhance the heat resistance of plants. To investigate the underlying molecular mechanisms by which exogenous trehalose induces heat resistance in C. sinensis, a combination of physiological and transcriptome analyses was conducted. The findings revealed a significant increase in the activity of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and peroxidase (POD) upon treatment with 5.0 mM trehalose at different time points. Moreover, the contents of proline (PRO), endogenous trehalose, and soluble sugar exhibited a significant increase, while malondialdehyde (MDA) content decreased following treatment with 5.0 mM trehalose under 24 h high-temperature stress (38 degrees C/29 degrees C, 12 h/12 h). RNA-seq analysis demonstrated that the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were significantly enriched in the MAPK pathway, plant hormone signal transduction, phenylpropanoid biosynthesis, flavone and flavonol biosynthesis, flavonoid biosynthesis, and the galactose metabolism pathway. The capability to scavenge free radicals was enhanced, and the expression of a heat shock factor gene (HSFB2B) and two heat shock protein genes (HSP18.1 and HSP26.5) were upregulated in the tea plant. Consequently, it was concluded that exogenous trehalose contributes to alleviating heat stress in C. sinensis. Furthermore, it regulates the expression of genes involved in diverse pathways crucial for C. sinensis under heat-stress conditions. These findings provide novel insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying the alleviation of heat stress in C. sinensis with trehalose.

AB  - The pyridine alkaloid nicotine acts as one of best-studied plant resistant traits in tobacco. Previous research has shown that NtERF199 and NtERF189, acting as master regulators within the NIC1 and NIC2 locus, quantitatively contribute to nicotine accumulation levels in N. tabacum. Genome editing-created Nic1(Nterf199) and Nic2 (Nterf189) double mutant provides an ideal platform for precisely dissecting the defensive role of nicotine and the connection between the nicotine biosynthetic pathway with other putative metabolic networks. Taking this advantage, we performed a comparative transcriptomic analysis to reevaluate the potential physiological and metabolic changes in response to nicotine synthesis defect by comparing the nic1nic2 and NIC1NIC2 plants. Our findings revealed that nicotine reduction could systematically diminishes the expression intensities of genes associated with stimulus perception, signal transduction and regulation, as well as secondary metabolic flux. Consequently, this global expression reduction might compromise tobacco adaptions to environmental fitness, herbivore resistances, and plant growth and development. The up-regulation of a novel set of stress-responsive and metabolic pathway genes might signify a newly established metabolic reprogramming to tradeoff the detrimental effect of nicotine loss. These results offer additional compelling evidence regarding nicotine's critical defensive role in nature and highlights the tight link between nicotine biosynthesis and gene expression levels of quantitative resistance-related genes for better environmental adaptation.

AB  - Cucurbitacins, oxygenated tetracyclic triterpenoids that are found mainly in the Cucurbitaceae family, play essential roles as defensive compounds, serving as allomones against herbivores and pathogens and as signals for insect-parasite recognition. These compounds also exhibit various pharmacological effects. The biosynthesis of cucurbitacins is largely regulated by the bitter (Bi) gene, encoding an oxidosqualene cyclase, which catalyzes the conversion of 2,3-oxidosqualene into cucurbitadienol, a common precursor for cucurbitacin synthesis. Previous studies focused on uncovering the Bi gene clusters in Cucurbitaceae, but their presence in other cucurbitacin-producing plants remained unexplored. Here, the evolutionary history of Bi genes and their clusters were investigated in twenty-one plant genomes spanning three families based on chemotaxonomy. Nineteen Bi genes were identified in fourteen Cucurbitaceae, four Begoniaceae, and one Aquilaria species. Phylogenetic analysis suggested that the genome of Aquilaria sinensis contained the earliest Bi gene clusters in this dataset. Moreover, the genomic analysis revealed a conserved microsynteny of pivotal genes for cucurbitacin biosynthesis in Cucurbitaceae, while interspersed Bi gene clusters were observed in Begoniaceae, indicating rearrangements during plant Bi gene cluster formation. The bitter gene in A. sinensis was found to promote cucurbitadienol biosynthesis in the leaves of Nicotiana benthamiana. This comprehensive exploration of plant Bi genes and their clusters provides valuable insights into the genetic and evolutionary underpinnings of cucurbitacin biosynthesis. These findings offer prospects for a deeper understanding of cucurbitacin production and potential genetic resources for their enhancement in various plants.

AB  - The Cupressaceae family includes species considered to be medicinal. Their essential oil is used for headaches, colds, cough, and bronchitis. Cedar trees like Chamaecyparis lawsoniana (C. lawsoniana) are commonly found in urban areas. We investigated whether C. lawsoniana exerts some of its effects by modifying airway smooth muscle (ASM) contractility. The leaves of C. lawsoniana (363 g) were pulverized mechanically, and extracts were obtained by successive maceration 1:10 (w:w) with methanol/CHCl3. Guinea pig tracheal rings were contracted with KCl, tetraethylammonium (TEA), histamine (HIS), or carbachol (Cch) in organ baths. In the Cch experiments, tissues were pre-incubated with D-600, an antagonist of L-type voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels (L-VDCC) before the addition of C. lawsoniana. Interestingly, at different concentrations, C. lawsoniana diminished the tracheal contractions induced by KCl, TEA, HIS, and Cch. In ASM cells, C. lawsoniana significantly diminished L-type Ca2+ currents. ASM cells stimulated with Cch produced a transient Ca2+ peak followed by a sustained plateau maintained by L-VDCC and store-operated Ca2+ channels (SOCC). C. lawsoniana almost abolished this last response. These results show that C. lawsoniana, and its active metabolite quercetin, relax the ASM by inhibiting the L-VDCC and SOCC; further studies must be performed to obtain the complete set of metabolites of the extract and study at length their pharmacological properties.

AB  - BACKGROUND Trichoderma spp. are soil fungi that interact with plant roots and associated biota such as other microorganisms and soil fauna. However, information about their interactions with root-feeding insects is limited. Here, interactions between Trichoderma harzianum and the root-feeding insect Phyllophaga vetula, a common insect pest in maize agroecosystems, were examined.
   RESULTS Applications of T. harzianum and P. vetula to the root system increased and decreased maize growth, respectively. Induced tolerance against herbivore attack was provided by T. harzianum maintaining a robust and functional root system as evidenced by the increased uptake of Cu, Ca, Mg, Na and K. Herbivore tolerance also coincided with changes in the emission of root volatile terpenes known to induce indirect defense responses and attract natural enemies of the herbivore. More importantly, T. harzianum induced de novo emission of several sesquiterpenes such as beta-caryophyllene and delta-cadinene. In addition, single and combined applications of T. harzianum and P. vetula altered the sucrose content of the roots. Finally, T. harzianum produced 6-pentyl-2H-pyran-2-one (6-PP) a volatile compound that may act as an antifeedant-signaling compound mitigating root herbivory by P. vetula.
   CONCLUSION Our results provide novel information about belowground multitrophic plant-microbe-arthropod interactions between T. harzianum and P. vetula in the maize rhizosphere resulting in alterations in maize phenotypic plant responses, inducing root herbivore tolerance.

AB  - One of the essential needs of humans that is influenced by architectural geometry is visibility in indoor areas. Prayer hall geometry dominates the mosque typology and morphology. The spatial-volumetric shapes of interior prayer halls affect worshipers' visual comfort and spirituality. In this study, a new integrative framework is developed to quantitatively describe various mosque typo-morphologies affecting the visual comfort of worshipers, including spaciousness and consciousness, to obtain prayer hall typo-morphological patterns that may provide higher levels of visual comfort. Spatial and volumetric metrics from various prayer hall vantage points are used in this study. A two-dimensional isovist (VGA) map in depthmapX.10 collects spatial metrics, while the grasshopper script in Rhinoceros-7 collects 3D isovist volumetric metrics. The findings confirm the feasibility of creating a prominent area in barrier-free mosque layout designs centered on a central domed roof form.

AB  - Exploring ways to reduce the risk of heavy metal pollution by organic fertilizer application is of vital importance. In the present study, by conducting a pot experiment, natural zeolite was applied together with pig manure based organic fertilizer to agricultural soil in order to test its possibility of reducing the risk of heavy metals originating from pig manure. The results showed that a low rate of organic fertilizer (10%) application increased the biomass of Chinese cabbage (by 57.2%), while a high rate of organic fertilizer (30%) decreased the biomass of Chinese cabbage (by 46.16%), and meanwhile a 3% zeolite addition increased the biomass of Chinese cabbage which was treated with 30% organic fertilizer. The organic fertilizer addition decreased soil pH and increased soil CEC, while zeolite addition increased soil pH and decreased the soil organic matter content. The concentration of Zn in Chinese cabbage shoots increased with the organic fertilizer addition from 4.46% to 48.27%, while the addition of 1% and 3% zeolite significantly decreased Zn in Chinese cabbage shoots by 15.53% and 14.08%, respectively. The concentration of DPTA-extractable and DGT-extractable Zn of soil was increased by organic fertilizer application, whereas zeolite addition decreased the concentration of DPTA-extractable and DGT-extractable Zn in soil treated with organic fertilizer. Our present study suggests that natural zeolite application could be a promising method to reduce the risk of heavy metals originating from organic fertilizers.

AB  - Hair follicle stem cells (HFSCs) play a significant role in hair development. miR-1 has been reported as an important regulatory factor that affects hair follicle growth and development, but its regulatory mechanism on HFSC development remains unknown. In this study, the molecular mechanism of miR-1 in regulating HFSC proliferation and differentiation was investigated. High-throughput RNA-seq and integrated analysis were performed to identify differentially transcribed mRNAs and microRNAs (miRNAs) in HFSCs co-cultured with dermal papilla cells (named dHFSCs) and control HFSCs. We then determined the molecular function of miR-1 in HFSCs. Compared with HFSCs, 13 differentially transcribed miRNAs were identified in dHFSCs. The in vitro results indicated that the overtranscription of miR-1 inhibited HFSC proliferation, but enhanced HFSC differentiation by targeting IGF1R and LEF1 genes. This study provides new insights into the molecular mechanisms of HFSC development. Approval ID (2014ZX08008-002).

AB  - Microorganisms have difficulty surviving and performing remediation functions in mixed systems with high concentrations of Pb and Cd. Biochar has the potential to assist microorganism remediation as an excellent adsorbent for heavy metals. In this study, pig manure biochar (PMB) was used to assist phosphorus solubilizing bacteria (PSB) to explore the mineralization protection and biofeedback mechanism of biochar on PSB under mixed stress of 1000 mg/L Pb2+ and 500 mg/L Cd2+. The adsorption results showed that the removal of Pb2+ and Cd2+ by PMB+PSB was 148.77% and 72.27% higher than that by PSB. Meanwhile, the non-bioavailable fraction of Cd2+ and acid-soluble fraction of Pb2+ in PMB+PSB were increased by 9% and 3%, respectively. Mineralogical and microbial secretion results confirm that showed that the acidic soluble fraction and non-bioavailable fraction were mostly Pb/Cd-carbonate and Pb/Cd-phosphate. The pore adsorption and precipitation (carbonate) of biochar were able to reduce the exposure of PSB to Pb/Cd and the background stress concentration, thus stimulating the biological positive feedback effect of PSB and forming a microenvironment in the cell periphery. The vesicle detoxification and extracellular polymeric substance protection mechanism of PSB were improved under biochar protection, and the individual size and activity of PSB cells were enhanced. Besides, citric acid release from PSB (28.85% increase) accelerated the dissolution of unstable Cd-carbonate, thereby releasing a large amount of Cd2+ to compete with Pb2+ for PO43-. Thus, the protection of biochar and the positive feedback effect of PSB could reduce the biotoxicity of Cd2+ in the stress system by preferentially forming a stable Cd-phosphate. In addition, the excellent electrical conductivity and organic material adsorption of biochar increased the extracellular electron transport rate of microorganisms, which further accelerated the minerali-zation and immobilization of Pb2+ and Cd2+, so as to ensure the repair effect of PSB on heavy metals.

AB  - We present an elaborate study of the surface and size effects on the transient and steady-state behaviors of point defects in irradiated solids. In this investigation, both pure Ni and binary Ni-Cr were utilized as model systems. We utilize the spatially-resolved rate-theory (SRRT) modeling approach, and directly account for the effects of dose rate, production bias, and defects recombination, reactions with volumetric sinks, and diffusion to surface sinks. Several simulations were conducted to investigate the effects of these parameters in both coupled and decoupled manners. In the presence of production bias, the effects of surface and size persist even as the surface to volume ratio decreases. This was associated with a surface-induced and size-regulated instability. This instability is only triggered above a critical size between 100 and 500 nm. The critical size decreases with increasing dose rate, increasing production bias, or lowering the temperature. Moreover, this instability results in a pattern that favors the separation of vacancies and interstitials. Once this pattern develops, anomalies in the dependence on size for the transient and steady-state concentrations of point defects and the surface/boundary sink strength are observed. These anomalies tend to render irradiation damage more severe. For pure Ni, it was shown that vacancy supersaturation increases with size, and the rate of increase also rises with size. For the binary Ni-Cr system, it was shown that the magnitude of enrichment/depletion of Ni/Cr at the boundary increases with size, and the width of the enrichment/depletion layer also increases with size. The results obtained here agree well with experimental observations in irradiated materials such as the formation of void denuded zones adjacent to grain boundaries and the size and temperature dependence of the radiation resistance of nanomaterials. The size-dependent behaviors reported here also shed new light on the radiation tolerance of nanomaterials, i.e., the irradiation-induced instabilities are suppressed in such materials. Lastly, the implications of the results obtained here on the development of efficient reduced order models or the utilization of ion irradiation as a surrogate to neutron irradiation are discussed.

AB  - Schizophrenia is a chronic disabling disease affecting 1 % of the population. Current antipsychotics have limited efficacy in mitigating the severity of the symptoms of the disease. Therefore, searching for new therapeutic targets is essential. Previous studies have shown that alpha 2C-adrenoceptor antagonists may have antipsychotic and pro-cognitive effects. Therefore, the current study evaluates the behavioral and neurochemical effects of JP -1302, a selective alpha 2C-adrenoceptor antagonist, in a model of schizophrenia-like deficits induced by sub -chronic ketamine (KET) administration.Here, we administered ketamine (25 mg/kg, i.p.) to male and female Wistar rats for eight consecutive days. On the last two days of ketamine administration, rats were pretreated with either JP-1302 (1-3-10 mu mol/kg, i.p.), chlorpromazine (0.1 mg/kg, i.p.), or saline, and the behavioral tests were performed. Behaviors related to positive (locomotor activity), negative (social interaction), and cognitive (novel object recognition) symptoms of schizophrenia were assessed. Glutamate, glutamine, GABA levels, and alpha 2C-adrenoceptor expression were measured in the frontal cortex and the hippocampus. Tyrosine hydroxylase immunocytochemical reactivity was also shown in the midbrain regions.Sub-chronic ketamine administration increased locomotor activity and produced robust social interaction and object recognition deficits, and JP-1302 significantly ameliorated ketamine-induced cognitive deficits. Ketamine induced a hyperdopaminergic activity in the striatum, which was reversed by the treatment with JP-1302. Also, the alpha 2C-adrenoceptor expression was higher in the frontal cortex and hippocampus in the ketamine-treated rats.Our findings confirm that alpha 2C-adrenoceptor antagonism may be a potential drug target for treating cognitive disorders related to schizophrenia.

AB  - Artificial insemination (AI) plays a critical role in facilitating rapid genetic and production gains within the sheep industry. However, variable rates of AI success remain a concern for the industry and a barrier to adoption. Furthermore, the degree to which female factors influence the success of intrauterine laparoscopic AI rather than natural mating remains unknown. As such, this study investigates the effect of several factors collected during the time of AI, on the success of intrauterine laparoscopic AI. Data was generously donated by artificial breeding companies and stud breeders during routine commercial AI operations. AI data was collected over 3 breeding seasons during commercial AI programs (N = 24 programs) using Merino ewes (N = 24,700). Sire ID (N = 253), time of AI following progesterone removal (approx. 43-59 h post removal), uterine tone and intra-abdominal fat (both scored 1-5) as well as age of the ewe were all recorded at the time of AI. Transcutaneous ultrasound subsequently determined pregnancy rate approximately 55 days post-AI. A multivariate regression analysis was performed and revealed pregnancy success to increase when semen was inseminated into a ewe with a uterine tone score of 4 or 5 (P < 0.001). The remaining factors fell short of significance within the multivariate model. An interclass coefficient variation matrix was also used to determine the proportion of variation contributed to AI success by random factors allocated in the model; site, sire, AI date and breeding season (45.99 %, 29.94 %, 15.15 % and 8.92 %, respectively). These results highlight the influence of uterine tone on ewe fertility following laparoscopic AI, but also that program location and the sire used can further modify this influence on pregnancy rate. These factors must now be considered in combination with semen factors per individual sire used during AI to ascertain the contribution of several factors to the success of laparoscopic AI in Australia.

AB  - How nitrogen (N) supply affects the induced defense of plants remains poorly understood. Here, we investigated the impacts of N supply on the defense induced in maize (Zea mays) against the fall armyworm (Spodoptera frugiperda). In the absence of herbivore attack or exogenous jasmonic acid (JA) application, N supply increased plant biomass and enhanced maize nutrient (soluble sugar and amino acid) contents and leaf area fed by S. frugiperda (the feeding leaf area of S. frugiperda larvae in maize supplemented with 52.2 and 156.6 mg/kg of N was 4.08 and 3.83 times that of the control, respectively). When coupled with herbivore attack or JA application, maize supplemented with 52.2 mg/kg of N showed an increased susceptibility to pests, while the maize supplemented with 156.6 mg/kg of N showed an improved defense against pests. The changes in the levels of nutrients, and the emissions of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) caused by N supply could explain the above opposite induced defense in maize. Compared with herbivore attack treatment, JA application enhanced the insect resistance in maize supplemented with 156.6 mg/kg of N more intensely, mainly reflecting a smaller feeding leaf area, which was due to indole emission and two upregulated defensive genes, MPI (maize proteinase inhibitor) and PAL (phenylalanine ammonia-lyase). Hence, the optimal N level and appropriate JA application can enhance plant-induced defense against pests.

AB  - A ketogenic diet (KD) is a high-fat, low-carbohydrate, and low-protein diet that exerts antiepileptic effects by attenuating spontaneous recurrent seizures, ameliorating learning and memory impairments, and modulating the gut microbiota composition. However, the role of the gut microbiome in the antiepileptic effects of a KD on temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) induced by lithium-pilocarpine in adult rats is still unknown. Our study provides evidence demonstrating that a KD effectively mitigates seizure behavior and reduces acute-phase epileptic brain activity and that KD treatment alleviates hippocampal neuronal damage and improves cognitive impairment induced by TLE. We also observed that the beneficial effects of a KD are compromised when the gut microbiota is disrupted through antibiotic administration. Analysis of gut microbiota components via 16S rRNA gene sequencing in fecal samples collected from TLE rats fed either a KD or a normal diet. The Chao1 and ACE indices showed decreased species variety in KD-fed rats compared to TLE rats fed a normal diet. A KD increased the levels of Actinobacteriota, Verrucomicrobiota and Proteobacteria and decreased the level of Bacteroidetes. Interestingly, the abundances of Actinobacteriota and Verrucomicrobiota were positively correlated with learning and memory ability, and the abundance of Proteobacteria was positively correlated with seizure susceptibility. In conclusion, our study revealed the significant antiepileptic and neuroprotective effects of a KD on pilocarpine-induced epilepsy in rats, primarily mediated through the modulation of the gut microbiota. However, whether the gut microbiota mediates the antiseizure effects of a KD still needs to be better elucidated.

AB  - Endophytic fungi of the Epichlo & euml; genus are vital for the health of cool-season grasses, enhancing stress tolerance and resistance to herbivores and pathogens. Notably, Epichlo & euml; festucae var. lolii is crucial for Lolium perenne. Accurate detection and quantification of these fungi are essential for ecological studies and diagnostics. However, traditional methods, such as histochemical staining, microbiological culture and serological tests, often fail to provide reliable identification, can be time-consuming and are prone to cross-reactivity. Molecular techniques like PCR and quantitative PCR offer enhanced sensitivity but can be affected by PCR inhibitors and require reference standards for precise quantification. In this study, we developed a probe-based digital droplet PCR (ddPCR) as an advanced diagnostic tool for detection and absolute quantification of E. festucae colonisation in perennial ryegrass. The ddPCR was tested on 10 experimentally infected grass samples and naturally colonised positive controls. Compared to the EvaGreen-based ddPCR assay, which exhibited high background noise, the probe-based ddPCR significantly improved sensitivity, enabling detection of as few as two copies of fungal DNA. The target gene was detected in all artificially infected samples, with copy numbers ranging from 4 to 126 copies per 20 mu L of reaction mixture, while in naturally colonised samples, the target DNA reached up to 3620 copies/20 mu L. These findings highlight ddPCR as a highly sensitive and precise technique for E. festucae detection, which can be useful in fungal diagnostics, colonisation dynamics and ecological studies. Notably, this is the first study to develop a ddPCR protocol for E. festucae detection.

AB  - Peripheral nerve injury (PNI) remains a medical challenge with no easy resolution. Over the last few decades, significant advances have been achieved in promoting peripheral nerve regeneration, and new assessment tools have been developed, both functional and imaging, to quantify the proportion and quality of nerve recovery. The exploration of new animal models, larger, more complex, and with more similarities to humans, has made it possible to reduce the gap between the results obtained in classic animal models, such as rodents, and the application of new therapies in humans and animals of clinical interest. Ultrasonography is an imaging technique recurrently used in clinical practice to assess the peripheral nerves, allowing for its anatomical and topographic characterization, aiding in the administration of anesthesia, and in the performance of nerve blocks. The use of this technique in animal models is scarce, but it could be a useful tool in monitoring the progression of nerve regeneration after the induction of controlled experimental lesions. In this work, sheep, a promising animal model in the area of peripheral nerve regeneration, were subjected to an ultrasonographic study of three peripheral nerves of the hind limb, the common peroneal, and tibial and sciatic nerves. The main aim was to establish values of dimensions and ultrasound appearance in healthy nerves and landmarks for their identification, as well as to perform an ultrasound evaluation of the cranial tibial muscle, an effector muscle of the common peroneal nerve, and to establish normal values for its ultrasound appearance and dimensions. The results obtained will allow the use of these data as control values in future work exploring new therapeutic options for nerve regeneration after induction of common peroneal nerve injuries in sheep.

AB  - The Japanese rock ptarmigan ( Lagopus muta japonica) ) is an herbivorous species of partridges that inhabits only alpine zones. Alpine plants are their main source of food. These alpine plants contain toxic compounds to deter herbivores from consuming them. A previous analysis of the alpine plants frequently consumed by Japanese rock ptarmigans revealed the presence of a unique mixture of secondary metabolites and a novel compound. Additionally, wild Japanese rock ptarmigans are often infected by two species of Eimeria parasites. When these parasites were experimentally administered to Svalbard rock ptarmigans ( Lagopus muta hyperborean), ), which do not feed on alpine plants, the birds exhibited symptoms, such as diarrhea and depression, and in some cases, they died. Although little is known about the pathogenesis of these parasites in wild Japanese rock ptarmigans, it was hypothesized that compounds found in alpine plants, their main food source, may reduce the pathogenicity of Eimeria parasites. In the present study, we evaluated the anticoccidial activity of the compounds derived from alpine plants in vitro using Eimeria tenella, , which infects chickens belonging to the same pheasant family, as an experimental model. Twenty-seven natural components were extracted from eight alpine plants. The natural components were added to E. tenella sporozoites and incubated for 24 h to evaluate their direct effect. Additionally, Madin-Darby bovine kidney cells were incubated with sporozoites and natural components for 24 h to evaluate the inhibitory effect of the components on sporozoite cell invasion. Six compounds from four alpine plants decreased sporozoite viability by up to 88.3%, and two compounds inhibited sporozoite invasion into the cells. Although further studies are needed to evaluate the effects of these components against Eimeria infections in vivo, , our findings suggest that these alpine plants may reduce the degree of infection by decreasing the number of sporozoites in the intestinal tract.

AB  - Introduction Membrane proteins play an important role in living organisms as one of the main components of biological membranes. The problem in membrane protein classification and prediction is an important topic of membrane proteomics research because the function of proteins can be quickly determined if membrane protein types can be discriminated. Methods Most current methods to classify membrane proteins are labor-intensive and require a lot of resources. In this study, five methods, Average Block (AvBlock), Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT), Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT), Histogram of Orientation Gradient (HOG), and Pseudo-PSSM (PsePSSM), were used to extract features in order to predict membrane proteins on a large scale. Then, we combined the five obtained feature matrices and constructed the corresponding hypergraph association matrix. Finally, the feature matrices and hypergraph association matrices were integrated to identify the types of membrane proteins using a hypergraph neural network model (HGNN). Results The proposed method was tested on four membrane protein benchmark datasets to evaluate its performance. The results showed 92.8%, 88.6%, 88.2%, and 99.0% accuracy on each of the four datasets. Conclusion Compared to traditional machine learning classifier methods, such as Random Forest (RF), Support Vector Machine (SVM), etc. HGNN prediction performance was found to be better.

AB  - Glutamate excitotoxicity accompanies numerous brain pathologies, including traumatic brain injury, ischemic stroke, and epilepsy. Disturbances of the ion homeostasis, mitochondria dysfunction, and further cell death are considered the main detrimental consequences of excitotoxicity. It is well known that neurons demonstrate different vulnerability to pathological exposures. In this regard, neurons containing calcium -permeable AMPA receptors (CP-AMPARs) may show higher susceptibility to excitotoxicity due to an additional pathway of Ca2+ influx. Here, we demonstrate that neurons containing CP-AMPARs are characterized by the higher amplitude of the glutamate -induced elevation of intracellular Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i) and slower restoration of [Ca2+]i level compared to non-CP-AMPA neurons. Moreover, we have found that NASPM, an antagonist of CP-AMPARs, significantly decreases the amplitude of the [Ca2+]i elevation induced by glutamate or selective AMPARs agonist, 5-fluorowillardiine. In contrast, the antagonists of NMDARs or KARs affect insignificantly. We have also described some peculiarities of Na+, K+, and H+ intracellular dynamics in neurons containing CP-AMPARs. In particular, the amplitude of [Na+]i elevation was lower compared to non-CP-AMPA neurons, whereas the amplitude of [K+]i decrease was higher. We have shown the significant inverse correlation between [K+]i and [Ca2+]i and between intracellular pH and [Na+]i in CP-AMPARs-containing and non-CP-AMPA neurons upon glutamate excitotoxicity. Our data indicate that CP-AMPARs-mediated Ca2+ influx and slow removal of Ca2+ from the cytosol may underlie the vulnerability of the CP-AMPARs-containing neurons to glutamate excitotoxicity. Further studies of the mechanisms mediating the disturbances in ion homeostasis are crucial for developing new approaches for protecting these neurons at brain pathologies.

AB  - Androgen receptors (AR) are crucial in the control of male sexual behavior and sex preference. AR are partic-ularly concentrated in areas related with the neuroendocrine control of sex preference including the medial amygdala (MeA), the ventromedial nucleus of the hypothalamus (VMH), the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST), the medial preoptic area (MPOA), the nucleus accumbens (Acb), the suprachiasmatic (SCh) and su-praoptic (SO) nuclei, but also seem to be important for the control of reproductive processes in the hippocampus (CA1-CA4 and dentate gyrus, DG). In the present study we analyzed the density of AR in these brain areas of adult male rats with sexual preference (established in a three-compartment box). Same-sex preference was produced in male rats by the prenatal administration of the aromatase inhibitor, letrozole (0.56 mu g/kg/ml s.c. G10-22) that usually produces 1-2 animals per litter with same sex preference, while the others retain a female sex preference. We also included a group of proestrus females that had a clear preference for a sexually active male. AR were analyzed by immunocytochemistry using PG21 as primary antibody. We also measured total plasma testosterone concentrations by radioimmunoassay. In males with same sex preference there was a specific AR overexpression in CA3 and CA4 that suggests a feminized pattern because females in proestrus trend to show a higher density of AR in these hippocampal areas. Sex differences in AR density were found in the anterior cingulate cortex (ACg) and frontoparietal cortex (FrPa). Serum levels of testosterone did not differ between groups. Data are discussed based on the role of AR in the hippocampus.

AB  - Oxidative stress is directly linked to non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and the progression to steaotohepatitis (NASH). Thus, a beneficial role of antioxidants in delaying disease progression and/or accelerating recovery may be expected, as corroborated by recommendations of, e.g., vitamin E supplementation to patients. This study investigated the effect of vitamin C deficiency-often resulting from poor diets low in fruits and vegetables and high in fat-combined with/without a change to a low fat diet on NAFLD/NASH phenotype and hepatic transcriptome in the guinea pig NASH model. Vitamin C deficiency per se did not accelerate disease induction. However, the results showed an effect of the diet change on the resolution of hepatic histopathological hallmarks (steatosis, inflammation, and ballooning) (p < 0.05 or less) and indicated a positive effect of a high vitamin C intake when combined with a low fat diet. Our data show that a diet change is important in NASH regression and suggest that a poor vitamin C status delays the reversion towards a healthy hepatic transcriptome and phenotype. In conclusion, the findings support a beneficial role of adequate vitamin C intake in the regression of NASH and may indicate that vitamin C supplementation in addition to lifestyle modifications could accelerate recovery in NASH patients with poor vitamin C status.

AB  - Proteins accumulated in the medium during prolonged incubation of Trichinella pseudospiralis ISS7626 (domestic pig Sus scrofa (Kamchatka)) muscle larvae were analysed by LC-MS/MS. A wide repertoire of excretory-secretory and somatic proteins ranging from 72 to 238 was revealed in samples, correlating with a decrease in the reproduction potential of the larvae, which remained invasive. A gene ontology annotation shows that most of revealed proteins are nucleases, proteases or their regulators; enrichment in extracellular compartment-related proteins and proteins involved in cell attachment predominated. Sixty-nine of the revealed proteins were permanently present in all analysed samples, which indirectly confirm that most of the larvae were alive during the incubation period. Orthologous clustering demonstrates that most of the permanently present proteins are T. pseudospiralis strain-specific. High level of sequence identity within clusters and frequent presence of paralogous genes within cluster point to the recent emergence of these orthologous groups and rapid evolving of proteins during adaptation to wide range of hosts.

AB  - Widely considered an anthropogenic phenomenon, antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is a naturally occurring mechanism that microorganisms use to gain competitive advantage. AMR represents a significant threat to public health and has generated criticism towards the overuse of antimicrobial drugs. livestock have been proposed as important reservoirs for AMR accumulation. Here, we show that assemblages of AMR genes in cattle and ungulates from natural environments (Yellowstone and Rocky Mountain National Parks) are all dominated by genes conferring resistance to tetracyclines. However, cattle feces contained higher proportions of erm(A-X) genes conferring resistance to macrolide antibiotics. Medically important AMR genes differed between cattle and natural ungulates, but cumulatively were more predominant in natural soils. Our findings suggest that the commonly described predominance of tetracycline resistance in cattle feces is a natural phenomenon among multiple ungulate species and not solely a result of antimicrobial drug exposure. Yet, the virtual absence of macrolide resistance genes in natural ungulates suggests that macrolide usage in agriculture may enrich these genes in cattle. Our results show that antimicrobial use in agriculture may be promoting a potential reservoir for specific types of AMR (i.e., macrolide resistance) but that a significant proportion of the ungulate resistome appears to have natural origins.

AB  - Varying combinations of genetic and environmental risk factors are thought to underpin phenotypic heterogeneity between individuals in psychiatric conditions such as schizophrenia. While epigenome-wide association studies in schizophrenia have identified extensive alteration of mean DNA methylation levels, less is known about the location and impact of DNA methylation variance, which could contribute to phenotypic and treatment response heterogeneity. To explore this question, we conducted the largest meta-analysis of blood DNA methylation variance in schizophrenia to date, leveraging three cohorts comprising 1036 individuals with schizophrenia and 954 non-psychiatric controls. Surprisingly, only a small proportion (0.1%) of the 213 variably methylated positions (VMPs) associated with schizophrenia (Benjamini-Hochberg FDR < 0.05) were shared with differentially methylated positions (DMPs; sites with mean changes between cases and controls). These blood-derived VMPs were found to be overrepresented in genes previously associated with schizophrenia and amongst brain-enriched genes, with evidence of concordant changes at VMPs in the cerebellum, hippocampus, prefrontal cortex, or striatum. Epigenetic covariance was also observed with respect to clinically significant metrics including age of onset, cognitive deficits, and symptom severity. We also uncovered a significant VMP in individuals with first-episode psychosis (n = 644) from additional cohorts and a non-psychiatric comparison group (n = 633). Collectively, these findings suggest schizophrenia is associated with significant changes in DNA methylation variance, which may contribute to individual-to-individual heterogeneity.

AB  - Ethnopharmacological relevance: Rosmarinus officinalis L. (Rosemary) is a popular herb with reported effectiveness against diarrhea, anxiety and constipation, albeit with limited pharmacological evidence. Aim of the study: The current study was aimed at evaluating the therapeutic potential, possible pharmacological mechanisms of action and active constituents of hydro-ethanolic extract of rosemary (Rs.Cr), as potential antidiarrheal, laxative and anxiolytic agent. Method: Rs.Cr was analyzed through reverse -phase high pressure liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC). Laxative, antidiarrheal, and anxiolytic activities were assessed using in vivo models. Spasmogenic and spasmolytic mechanisms were studied on isolated guinea pig ileum and rabbit jejunum tissues, respectively. Possible role of diosmetin, one of the active constituents of Rs.Cr was also evaluated. Results: RP-HPLC analysis revealed presence of diosmetin, rutin and apigenin in Rs.Cr. Laxative effect was seen at low doses, which was partially reversed in atropinized mice. The spasmogenic mechanism was mediated by cholinergic and histaminergic receptors stimulation. At higher doses, antidiarrheal activity was evident, with reduction in gastrointestinal motility and secretions using charcoal meal and enteropooling assays, respectively. Rs.Cr also showed dose -dependent anxiolytic effect. The antispasmodic mechanisms were mediated by antimuscarinic and K + channel opening -like effect (predominant K ATP -dependent). Diosmetin exhibited antidiarrheal and antispasmodic activities, but spasmogenic effect was not seen. Conclusion: Rosemary leaves have dual antidiarrheal and laxative effects, and as well as anxiolytic activity. In addition, the possible modulation of muscarinic and histaminergic receptors, and K ATP channels show it as potential herb to be explored for irritable bowel syndrome. Diosmetin is possibly one of its constituents that contributes to its antidiarrheal activity.

AB  - The relationship between oviposition preference and offspring performance is critical to an understanding of the interaction between herbivores and host plants. Although the topic has been addressed widely in plant species-herbivore systems, it has rarely been investigated in plant stage-herbivore systems. In this study, we evaluated oviposition preference and offspring performance of the rice leaf folder (RLF), Cnaphalocrocis medinalis (Guenee) (Lepidoptera: Pyralidae), on rice plants at the seedling (SS), tillering (TS), and booting (BS) stages. In preference assays, females deposited more eggs on TS and BS than on SS plants in cage tests, and preferred TS and BS odors over SS odors in Y-tube olfactometer tests. Offspring performance was affected by plant stage. The RLF offspring performed well when the larvae fed on BS leaves, as indicated by the highest larval survival and pupation rate and the greatest adult longevity. RLF offspring performed also well when the larvae fed on TS leaves, where fecundity was the highest. The high RLF offspring performance on TS and BS plants coincided with high larval consumption of TS and BS leaf mass relative to SS leaf mass. Our findings confirm the prediction of the preference-performance hypothesis. The results explain the pest damage patterns in mixed croppings of one- and two-season rice and are of significance for management of the pest through synchronization of rice planting.

AB  - Anthrax, a widespread zoonosis in low and middle -income countries with low disease awareness and insufficient livestock vaccination coverage, has been known in Lao Cai Province in northern Vietnam for years before its apparent absence in 2009, which requires investigation as this infection is frequently reported from neighbouring provinces and countries. We aimed to describe the seasonal patterns of anthrax (1991-2008), compare livestock anthrax vaccine coverage to disease occurrence (19912022), and delineate the high -risk areas to inform local disease surveillance in the province. We illustrated the seasonal pattern of anthrax and provided a comparison between livestock vaccine coverage and disease occurrence by purely spatial SaTScan (Poisson model, 25% population at risk) to detect spatial clusters of human and livestock anthrax using population derived from zonal statistics routines. The number of cases, crude cumulative incidence, and spatial clusters of human and livestock anthrax were mapped in QGIS. Results indicate peak anthrax incidence from May to October. Buffalo, domestic cattle, and horses accounted for 75% of total animal cases. Horse anthrax was more common in Lao Cai than in its neighbours and often occurred in years with human mortality. Vaccination covered less than 30% of the livestock population. We found an apparent pattern where anthrax was controlled from 1998-2003 with higher vaccine coverage (>20%) and identified spatial clusters of human and livestock anthrax in Muong Khuong, Bao Thang, and Bac Ha districts of Lao Cai. The local public health and veterinary agencies are recommended to revisit the high -risk areas and communicate with neighbouring provinces for a regional approach to anthrax surveillance and control.

AB  - Simple Summary Ensuring "animal welfare" and "customer satisfaction" are crucial concerns in the modern slaughterhouse. Addressing "animal welfare" includes avoiding or minimizing pre-slaughter stress as well as anxiety, pain, distress, and suffering at the time of slaughter. In general, different methods of gas stunning are used, but the conventional carbon dioxide (CO2) gas-stunning method can result in severe aversion, elevated respiratory distress, irritation of the nasal mucous membranes, hypercapnia, and lactic acidosis. To reduce these problems, sometimes inert gases (argon or nitrogen) are mixed with CO2 in different proportions. In stunning, it is a vital point that after the onset of unconsciousness, the animal never recovers consciousness. On the other hand, consumers prefer bright red-colored fresh meat. This demands consideration during the stunning and slaughtering of animals. However, different high-concentration levels of inert gases and their effects on stunning are still unknown. To support this, a trial was conducted on heme-pigment solutions (hemoglobin and myoglobin solution) in different high-concentration (80%, 85%, and 90%) levels of CO2, Ar, and N-2 gas. In both cases, dark red-colored (high redness and low lightness, yellowness) solutions were found in CO2-exposed conditions, and bright red was found with N-2 (high lightness, yellowness, and low redness). The effect of Ar was intermediate between CO2- and N-2-treated groups. These results and concepts were applied to a rabbit-stunning method. It was proven that the rabbit started the onset of unconsciousness at a 96% concentration of N-2 gas; thus, 96% N-2 and 98% N-2 were considered in the nitrogen-treated group. In addition, from every treatment group, 80% concentration levels were omitted. As per the results, dark red-colored blood, meat, and small intestine (high redness and low lightness, yellowness) were seen in CO2- and Ar-stunned rabbits, and a bright red color was found in N-2-stunned rabbits (high lightness, yellowness, and low redness). However, consumers prefer to purchase bright red-colored fresh meat, so N-2 stunning can help to satisfy their desire. Out of the two treatments, with N-2, in view of the time required for stunning and color attributes, 98% N-2 is better for rabbits. Therefore, 98% N-2 can be considered a better option for gas stunning. The objectives of this study were to elucidate the effect of different high-concentration levels of inert gases (Ar and N-2) on heme-pigment solutions and on the color of the blood, meat, and small intestine of rabbits; and to figure out the proper concentration level of inert gas (Ar or N-2) for the complete stunning of the rabbit. To observe the changing of color attributes, a research study was conducted in the abattoir of the National Institute of Animal Science (NIAS), RDA, Republic of Korea. This experiment had 2 parts, (i) A trial on heme-pigment solutions (hemoglobin and myoglobin solution) was conducted in a gas chamber with different high-concentration levels of carbon dioxide, argon, nitrogen, and normal air; and (ii) a rabbit experiment was conducted-stunning with different high-concentration levels of carbon dioxide, argon, nitrogen, and the Halal method (non-stunning). A small-size digital gas chamber was used for this experiment (size: width 850 mm x depth 1350 mm).
   Artificial hemoglobin (Hb) and myoglobin (Mb) solutions were created from "porcine hemoglobin lyophilized powder" and "equine skeletal muscle myoglobin lyophilized powder", respectively. In the heme-pigment solutions trial, 10 treatments were used: (i) 80% carbon dioxide (T1), (ii) 85% carbon dioxide (T2), (iii) 90% carbon dioxide (T3), (iv) 80% argon (T4), (v) 85% argon (T5), (vi) 90% argon (T6), (vii) 80% nitogen (T7), (viii) 85% nitogen (T8), (ix) 90% nitogen (T9), and (x) normal air (T10). Heme-pigment solutions (both Hb and Mb) were exposed with each treatment for four separate durations of time (30 s, 1 min, 2 min, and 4 min); and every sample (Hb and Mb) was exposed during each duration of time for 10 times (n = 10). In the rabbit experiment, seven treatments were used (i) 85% carbon dioxide (T1), (ii) 90% carbon dioxide (T2), (iii) 85% argon (T3), (iv) 90% argon (T4), (v) 96% nitrogen (T5), (vi) 98% nitogen (T6), and (vii) the Halal method (non-stunning) (T7). Forty-two rabbits (mixed-breed) were collected from the nearest commercial farm and randomly selected for a treatment group (n = 6). The average body weight was 2.3 kg. For stunning, each individual rabbit was separately kept in a gas chamber, after which each specific gas was used to fulfill the desired level in the pit. After reaching the desired level of concentration, rabbits were stunned within a very short time. It was observed that the time required for stunning in the T1, T2, T3, T4, T5 and T6 treatment was 79-82, 68-73, 97-103, 88-91, 164-173, and 108-115 s, respectively. In the case of the Halal method (non-stunning), as per the rules of Islam, rabbits were slaughtered without stunning. After slaughtering, in all treatments, the blood, meat, and small intestine of each animal were collected carefully and kept in a cool room in which the temperature was -2 degrees C, and after 24 h, the color attributes-lightness (L*), redness (a*), and yellowness (b*)-were measured via a Chroma Meter. It was found that in both experiments (trial on heme-pigment solutions and rabbit stunning), the color values (L*, a* and b*) showed a significant difference (p < 0.05) among the treatment groups. The CO2-treated groups showed high redness (a*) and low lightness (L*) and yellowness (b*), which indicated a dark-red color, and N-2-treated groups showed high lightness (L*) and yellowness (b*) and low redness (a*), which implied a bright-red color. The effect of the Ar was in between the CO2- and N-2-treated groups. These phenomena were observed both in the heme-pigment solutions (Hb and Mb) and in the blood, meat, and small intestine of the rabbits. N-2-stunned animals fulfill the fundamental desire of consumers to purchase bright red-colored fresh meat. Therefore, in view of color attributes, consumer satisfaction, and animal welfare, N-2 gas can be thought of as a valuable alternative to stunning. Considering the time required for complete stunning and desirable color attributes, a 98% concentration of N-2 is best for rabbit stunning. As such, it could be used as a better option for the gas stunning of animals.

AB  - To clarify the soil nutrient status and identify the safety risks of heavy metals in Camellia oleifera planting regions, the integrated soil fertility status was assessed using the improved Nemero composite index method, weighted average method, and coefficient of variation (CV) method, and the impact of heavy metals in the soil on human health was evaluated with a health risk assessment model using the Qianyu C. oleifera planting base in Yuping County, Guizhou Province, as the study object. The results showed the following: (1) The soil pH levels were 4.12-6.17, with CV values of 0.04-0.66, and no significant differences were observed among the plots. The soil was rich in organic matter, alkali-hydrolyzed nitrogen, and available phosphorus, with a high total potassium content, total phosphorus content, and rapidly available potassium, indicating a high level of comprehensive soil fertility. (2) The total carcinogenic risk (CR) index of the arsenic (As), cadmium (Cd), and chromium (Cr) in the soil was 1.92 x 10(-7), and among these elements, the CR index of the As was the highest (1.3-8.0 x 10(-7)), but all were below the highest acceptable level (10(-6)) recommended by the United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA). (3) The redundancy analysis (RDA) between the soil fertility and trace elements revealed that the soil organic matter content was positively correlated with the contents of lead (Pb), manganese (Mn), and Cr and negatively correlated with the contents of zinc (Zn), iron (Fe), Cd, mercury (Hg), As, and copper (Cu). The soil pH was positively correlated with the contents of Cr, Fe, and Cu and negatively correlated with the contents of Mn, Pb, Zn, Cd, Hg, and As. In the study area, the soil was slightly acidic with overall high fertility without any CR. The quality of the C. oleifera was degraded by soil acidification, but the slightly acidic soil facilitated the absorption of trace elements by C. oleifera. Soil acidification could be relieved by taking appropriate measures, such as the addition of biochar or CaCO3. This study determined the soil fertility of the Qianyu C. oleifera planting base and assessed the health risk of heavy metals in the soil, providing a theoretical reference for enhancing C. oleifera quality, preventing the excessive accumulation of soil heavy metals, and improving the soil in this planting base.

AB  - Unlike the linear model "take-make-use-dispose", the circular economy model "grow-make-use-restore" intends to potentiate material and energy flows within a system with the premise of increasing environmental gains. Moreover, circular economy practices can be alternatives for closing loops in companies from different sectors, with material-, waste-, and energy-related initiatives towards promoting greater internal value-adding. However, the lack of consistent tools for measuring circularity of processes and companies is a gap yet to be covered. To tackle this gap, this paper's aims are: (i) to build a new tool, called Circular Flow, for generating greater internal value and competitive advantage in organizations and identify potential circular economy-related opportunities for closing loops based on external flows, (ii) to apply the tool in a case study, an organization that presents material and energy (electricity) flows and exchanges with other organizations, and (iii) to discuss the inte-gration and potential opportunities for the tool in organizations. The novel, Circular Flow, tool is based on a set of circular graph visualizations, and quantitative circularity indicators. For the graphical visualization, the software tool R (using the Circlize package) was used. The graphs aid the visualization of several interconnected pieces of information, allowing to show all quantitative flows of inputs and outputs, intuitively showing the paths (origin and destination of each flow) within the boundaries of the system under study. The quantitative in-dicators, e.g. Circularity of the organization (Circ p) and Circularity of each process (Circ o), show a circularity index ranging from 0% to 100%, which can be assessed at different levels. The criteria to select these indicators are based on quantities of inputs and outputs regarding mass and electricity. The tool has been applied in a case study of a rural property in southern Brazil, which region holds a tradition for milk and pig farming. The use of the tool showed the involvement of the rural property with its neighbors and with an agroindustrial cooperative. Keeping these flows within the system may increase environmental gains by reducing transportation, using renewable sources of energy, reducing costs, and boosting the generation of jobs and income in the region due to new market opportunities and business models.

AB  - BackgroundThe selection of suitable host plants for oviposition is critical for herbivorous insects to maximise survival of their offspring. Olfaction plays an important role in this process. However, little is known about how olfaction shapes the interaction between the fall armyworm (Spodoptera frugiperda) and host plants. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that olfaction guides the host selection process in the fall armyworm using oviposition and wind tunnel bioassays. ResultsIn no-choice and dual-choice assays, female moths oviposited on all seven host plants that were tested (maize, sorghum, wheat, bean, cowpea, tomato and cabbage). However, in multiple-choice assays, no eggs were deposited on cowpea and cabbage. We found that maize, sorghum and wheat were most preferred for oviposition, whereas cowpea was least preferred. Wind tunnel assays confirmed these divergent oviposition preferences, with maize, sorghum and wheat odours being the most attractive. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis followed by random forest classification identified terpenes as the potential host-plant attractants. ConclusionOur results improve our understanding of the chemical ecology of the fall armyworm and suggest that some of these host plants could offer potential for use in an intercropping strategy to manage S. frugiperda.

AB  - Background: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by cognitive decline, with pathological features including amyloid (3 (A(3) plaques and inflammation. Despite recent approvals of anti-amyloid antibodies, there remains a need for disease-modifying and easily accessible therapies. The endocannabinoid system presents a promising target for AD treatment, as it regulates various processes implicated in AD pathogenesis. Aims: This study assesses the effects of the synthetic cannabinoid WIN 55,212-2 on AD pathology and behavior deficits in aged 5XFAD mice, a well-established AD model. Methods: Male 9-month-old 5XFAD mice received either 0.2 mg/kg WIN 55,212-2 or a vehicle solution for 42 days. Memory, anxiety, and motor tests were conducted at 10 months to identify potential changes in behavior and cognition following WIN 55,212-2 treatment. Additionally, the effects of prolonged WIN 55,212-2 treatment on A(3 pathology and neuroinflammation in the brain were quantified immunohistochemically. Results: Therapeutic WIN 55,212-2 treatment improved the motor performance of 5XFAD mice on the rotarod and rescued memory deficits in the water maze. However, WIN 55,212-2 treatment did not significantly affect anxiety-like behavior in 5XFAD mice. Additionally, prolonged treatment with WIN 55,212-2 reduced A(3 plaque pathology and astrogliosis in the cortex and hippocampus. Conclusions: This study highlights the therapeutic potential of WIN 55,212-2 in AD by ameliorating cognitive and motor deficits and reducing neuropathology. These findings support a cannabinoid-based therapy as a promising strategy for AD treatment, with WIN 55,212-2 emerging as a potential candidate.

AB  - The aim of this study was to produce two fermented processed foods made from sheep meat, one of them inoculated with the probiotic Lactobacillus casei and the other with Lactobacillus paracasei, evaluating their microbial growth, viability, and the efficiency of these microorganisms as bioconservants. To that effect, physicochemical, physical, and microbiological analyses were carried out, as well as a count of lactic acid bacteria (LAB). The results regarding the physicochemical and physical characteristics were in accordance with Brazilian legislation, except for the humidity and carbohydrate analysis and water activity, the values of which were not in accordance with the legislation. However, the microbiological results regarding the pathogenic microorganisms' growth were within the standard established in the legislation until the end of the time of analysis. Regarding the presence of probiotics, both fermented processed foods had values higher than 10(7) CFU/g relative to LAB count until the limit of 84 days. From these results, it can be concluded that the probiotics are viable, showing bioconservative activity and proper consumption conditions, since they are in conformity with the legislation.

AB  - Parkinson's disease (PD) is a complex neurodegenerative disorder characterized by motor and non-motor symptoms. Motor symptoms include bradykinesia, resting tremors, muscular rigidity, and postural instability, while non-motor symptoms include cognitive impairments, mood disturbances, sleep disturbances, autonomic dysfunction, and sensory abnormalities. Some of these symptoms may be influenced by the proper hippocampus functioning, including adult neurogenesis. Doublecortin (DCX) is a microtubule-associated protein that plays a pivotal role in the development and differentiation of migrating neurons. This study utilized postmortem human brain tissue of PD and age-matched control individuals to investigate DCX expression in the context of adult hippocampal neurogenesis. Our findings demonstrate a significant reduction in the number of DCX-expressing cells within the subgranular zone (SGZ), as well as a decrease in the nuclear area of these DCX-positive cells in postmortem brain tissue obtained from PD cases, suggesting an impairment in the adult hippocampal neurogenesis. Additionally, we found that the nuclear area of DCX-positive cells correlates with pH levels. In summary, we provide evidence supporting that the process of hippocampal adult neurogenesis is likely to be compromised in PD patients before cognitive dysfunction, shedding light on potential mechanisms contributing to the neuropsychiatric symptoms observed in affected individuals. Understanding these mechanisms may offer novel insights into the pathophysiology of PD and possible therapeutic avenues.
   We analyzed postmortem brain tissue from individuals with Parkinson's disease (PD) and age-matched controls, focusing on the protein doublecortin (DCX), which is crucial for neuron development. Our findings reveal a significant reduction in DCX-positive cells in the dentate gyrus (DG) region of PD brains, suggesting compromised hippocampal adult neurogenesis. This highlights the potential role of impaired neurogenesis in PD's progression.image

AB  - Enantioselective metabolism of chiral pesticide in plants is very important. In vitro system has become an effec-tive means to study the metabolism of pesticides in plants, but the study on the metabolism of chiral pesticides has not been reported. This work compared the enantiomer metabolic behavior of acephate and its metabolite methamidophos between tea cell suspensions and excised tea stem with leaves. (+/-)-Acephate could be absorbed and transferred well to top leaves by the cut end of excised stem after 24 h. (+/-)-Methamidophos was derived from the metabolism of (+/-)-acephate in tea plants at 3-5% in leaves and 2-3% in stems at 216 h. The content of (+)-methamidophos was 1.5 times higher than that of (-)-methamidophos in excised leaves. Though both (+/-)-acephate and (+/-)-methamidophos could be metabolized well by cell suspension, (+/-)-acephate and (+/-)-methamidophos was non-enantioselectively metabolized in cell suspension. It was shown that using the excised tea stem with leaves for chiral pesticide metabolism studies was much closer to intact plant than cell suspensions. This result also established an effective and easily available in vitro metabolic model for the study of enantioselective metabolism of chiral contaminants from environment. (c) 2021 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The global significance of fluoride and nitrate contamination in coastal areas cannot be overstated, as these contaminants pose critical environmental and public health challenges across the world. Water quality is an essential component in sustaining environmental health. This integrated study aimed to assess indexical and spatial water quality, potential contamination sources, and health risks associated with groundwater resources in Al-Hassa, Saudi Arabia. Groundwater samples were tested using standard methods. The physiochemical results indicated overall groundwater pollution. This study addresses the critical issue of drinking water resource suitability assessment by introducing an innovative approach based on the pollution index of groundwater (PIG). Focusing on the eastern region of Saudi Arabia, where water resource management is of paramount importance, we employed advanced machine learning (ML) models to forecast groundwater suitability using several combinations (C1 = EC + Na + Mg + Cl, C2 = TDS + TA + HCO3 + K + Ca, and C3 = SO4 + pH + NO3 + F + Turb). Six ML models, including random forest (RF), decision trees (DT), XgBoost, CatBoost, linear regression, and support vector machines (SVM), were utilized to predict groundwater quality. These models, based on several performance criteria (MAPE, MAE, MSE, and DC), offer valuable insights into the complex relationships governing groundwater pollution with an accuracy of more than 90%. To enhance the transparency and interpretability of the ML models, we incorporated the local interpretable model-agnostic explanation method, SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP). SHAP allows us to interpret the prediction-making process of otherwise opaque black-box models. We believe that the integration of ML models and SHAP-based explainability offers a promising avenue for sustainable water resource management in Saudi Arabia and can serve as a model for addressing similar challenges worldwide. By bridging the gap between complex data-driven predictions and actionable insights, this study contributes to the advancement of environmental stewardship and water security in the region.

AB  - Organophosphorus compounds (OPs), such as VX, pose a significant threat due to their neurotoxic and hazardous properties. Skin decontamination is essential to avoid irreversible effects. Fuller ' s earth (FE), a phyllosilicate conventionally employed in powder form, has demonstrated decontamination capacity against OPs. The aim of this study was to develop a formulation that forms a film on the skin, with a significant OP removal capacity ( >95 %) coupled with sequestration capabilities, favorable drying time and mechanical properties to allow for easy application and removal, particularly in emergency context. Various formulations were prepared using different concentrations of polyvinyl alcohol (PVA), FE and surfactants. Their removal and sequestration capacity was tested using paraoxon-ethyl (POX), a chemical that simulates the behavior of VX. Formulations with removal capacity levels surpassing 95 % were mechanically characterized and cell viability assays were performed on Normal Human Dermal Fibroblast (NHDF). The four most promising formulations were used to assess decontamination efficacy on pig ear skin explants. These formulations showed decontamination levels ranging from 84.4 +/- 4.7 % to 96.5 +/- 1.3 %, which is equivalent to current decontamination methods. These results suggest that this technology could be a novel and effective tool for skin decontamination following exposure to OPs.

AB  - This study deals with the extraction of active compounds for a formula (Angelica gigas, Cornus officinalis, Ganoderma lucidum, Thymus vulgaris, and Asparagus cochinchinensis) and the evaluation of its skin anti-aging properties. This formulation was inspired by the oriental medicine Gongjin-dan (Angelica gigas, Cornus officinalis, deer antler, and musk), which has been used as a restorative drug for longevity. Enzyme-based extraction and chemical purification were used to obtain a mixed fraction (GEF) enriched in glycopeptides and glycoproteins from the five herbal materials. The chemical characteristics of GEF, including the carbohydrate groups attached to the peptides and proteins, the total carbohydrate and protein contents, and the composition of monosaccharides and amino acids were determined. The chemical characteristics that were significantly different from those of the extract, generally prepared in the same ratio, were the abundance of glycopeptides and glycoproteins and the high proportions of conditionally essential amino acids (51.0%) and acidic/basic amino acids (67.7%). These are necessary components for strengthening the skin layers against aging. The in vitro skin anti-aging properties of GEF on human fibroblasts (HS68), keratinocytes (HaCaT), and adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells (ADMSCs) were evaluated. It was found that MMP-1 gene expression was inhibited (18-28%) and fibrillin-1 protein (23-37%) was restored contrary to the effect of UV irradiation. COL1A1 and COL4A1 gene expression (25-35%), HAS2 gene expression (22-213%), and adipogenesis (15%) were facilitated. These results demonstrate the potential of GEF as a raw material for skin anti-aging and reinforce the scientific evidence supporting a traditional medicine with a long history.

AB  - In the evolution of proboscideans, the appearance of dwarf and semi-dwarf forms occurred repeatedly, in different territories and at different times, due to a lack of resources caused by geographic isolation on islands and by landscape isolation on the mainland. Despite a significant amount of information on the insular forms of mammoths and elephants, the question of the relationship between a decrease in body size and morphological changes in the dental system remains a matter of debate. Some data show that dwarfism was accompanied by a decreasing number of plates (lophs) and by tooth enamel thickening. Other data show that changes in the dental system on the islands indicate that the number of plates could either decrease or remain unchanged, or even increase. Taking into account the importance of the number of plates as a diagnostic feature in the species identification of proboscidean taxa and the lack of a consensus on the stability of the trend towards a decrease in the number of plates from large continental ancestors to insular dwarf descendants, we (1) summarize the data on the records of small tooth-mammoths of the genus Mammuthus with a reduced number of plates in sites across northern Eurasia, (2) provide new radiocarbon dates, and (3) consider the number of plates as a possible sign of dwarfization in continental mammoths. The small teeth of the last generation of M. primigenius from the coastal part of northeastern Siberia and a comparison with data from other regions show that the posterior sections of mammoth cheek teeth are the most variable and represent a reduction complex. For the woolly mammoth, reduction primarily affects that part of the crown which became more complex by the gradually increasing number of plates during the phyletic evolution in the Middle to Late Pleistocene. The rapid loss of the evolutionary achievements through reduction is not a unique feature of woolly mammoth teeth. This has been observed in other mammals as well. Similar reduction complexes are observed for the cheek teeth of proboscideans and rodents of the subfamily Arvicolinae, as is shown by a decrease in the number of serially homologous crown elements: plates in proboscideans and pairs of prisms in voles. A comparison of the number of plates with the size of the teeth of M. primigenius suggests that a decrease in the number of dental plates, while retaining other specific features of the tooth, can be used as a criterion for separating semi-dwarf and small specimens of the woolly mammoth. The largest decrease in size of mainland mammoths is observed during warming periods, which also showed significant transformations of landscapes in a reduction of available resources.

AB  - Adopting genetically modified crops in developing nations like India has consistently been hindered by apprehensions regarding their impact on non-target arthropods. Consequently, laboratory experiments were conducted to evaluate the impact of Bt toxins of BG-II cotton on the common green lacewing [Chrysoperla zastrowi sillemi (Esben-Petersen)], indirectly exposing them to the toxins. Prey-mediated feeding bioassays, utilizing BG-II cotton and non-Bt cotton plants as hosts, two prey herbivores, specifically Aphis gossypii Glover and Bemisia tabaci (Gennadius), were conducted on several days to assess the effects of Cry toxins on the growth of C. z. sillemi. The ELISA assay quantified the Cry toxins across three trophic levels and revealed that the leaves had the highest quantities of Cry1Ac and Cry2Ab toxins, measuring 7.36 and 23.54 mu g/g FW, respectively. In contrast, herbivores and predators exhibited very low concentrations of Cry toxins. Although traces of Cry toxins were found in both herbivores and predators, they had no negative impacts on any of the predator's developmental characteristics including total larval development period, pupal period, adult weight, adult longevity, and fecundity/female confirming that these toxins do not threaten C. z. sillemi.

AB  - Brachyceran flies constitute a large radiation of the order Diptera, but the phylogenetic relationships among them have remained controversial. In this study, we used next-generation sequencing to determine mitochondrial genomes (mitogenomes) for six brachyceran flies. Two of these species represent Milichiidae (Aldrichiomyza flaviventris and Phyllomyza obliqua); two representing Chloropidae (Pachylophus sp.) and Sphaeroceridae (Leptocera erythrocera) are the first sequenced members of these groups; and two species from Lauxaniidae (Homoneura sp.) and Syrphidae (Paragus quadrifasciatus) were newly sequenced. Together with the published mitogenomes, we included a total of 187 species representing 40 dipteran families to investigate the phylogeny of Brachycera. The results strongly supported Brachycera as a monophyletic group. The infra-orders Stratiomyomorpha, Tabanomorpha and Xylophagomorpha were retrieved as the earliest brachyceran lineages, but the clade (Stratiomyomorpha + (Xylophagomorpha + Tabanomorpha)) was not supported. In most analyses, Platypezoidea were recovered as the sister-group to Cyclorrhapha. Syrphoidea were non-monophyletic with respect to Pipunculus. Milichiidae were non-monophyletic because of Pachylophus. Sphaeroceroidea were, in most cases, placed as the sister-group to Ephydroidea. Within Calyptratae, Hippoboscoidea were sister to an assemblage of lineages composed of a muscoid grade and Oestroidea, the latter being monophyletic in the Bayesian analyses using the PhyloBayes site-heterogeneous mixture model.

AB  - Fritillaria is a taxonomically complex genus of Liliaceae that contains many important ornamental and medicinal species. In this study, we sequenced the chloroplast genomes of ten Fritillaria species distributed in central Asia and compared them to previously sequenced Fritillaria cp genomes. Comparison of 36 Fritillaria species' cp genomes identified as useful potential molecular markers due to their high level of divergence three coding regions and 11 intergenic spacers. Effective single sequence repeats (SSRs) for population genetic studies of Fritillaria were also identified. Phylogenetic analysis showed that two recently described species, F. baisunensis and F. rugillosa belong to F. subg. Rhinopetalum, and that the belonging of F. ussuriensis and F. meleagroides in F. subg. Fritillaria should be revised. These two species and F. camschatsencese currently assigned to F. subg. Liliorhiza, should be members of the same taxonomic unit. Fritillaria subg. Liliorhiza, although a small group, is more complicated than it was previously thought, and apparently comprises species too distant to be in one subgenus. Fritillaria maximowischii, currently assigned to F. subg. Liliorhiza should be treated as a new subgenus.

AB  - Helminthiasis due to hookworm infestations in humans and Haemonchus contortus in sheep cause untold levels of disease and economic losses worldwide. Drug resistance is an ever-growing problem with pathogenic helminths. Thus, there is a critical need for new treatment strategies for hookworms and H. contortus that depends on animal models. Because hookworms and H. contortus are obligate parasites, they can only be maintained using live animals. This review describes use of the Syrian golden hamster to propagate hookworms and Mongolian gerbil to propagate H. contortus. .

AB  - Simple Summary The elasmobranchs, being at the apex of the marine food chain, act as final receptors of polluting elements that are regularly discharged into the sea and, therefore, usually are considered good bioindicators of environmental pollution. The main goal of this study was to describe helminthic communities, hematological parameters, and the concentrations of trace elements in vertebrae, skin, and liver for a population of lesser spotted dogfish from the Tyrrhenian Sea. Findings suggest that there is sometimes a correlation among these parameters and between them as well as environmental pollution. Parasitological, hematological, and ecotoxicological analyses were carried out on a population of lesser spotted dogfish Scyliorhinus canicula from the central Mediterranean Sea. Parasitological analyses highlighted a poor helminthic community, highly dominated by a single taxon represented by the cestode Nybelinia sp. No differences in the parasitic load between females and males were observed. Hematological analyses showed that the number of leukocytes was significantly lower in the sharks that resulted in parasitism, and this could be due to the ability of some trace elements, such as arsenic, weakening the immune system and exposing animals to a higher risk of parasite infection, although further hematological and parasitological analyses are required on a larger number of samples. Trace elements analyses in the vertebrae, skin, and liver highlighted that the most abundant and potentially toxic elements were lead (Pb), arsenic (As), and cadmium (Cd). Other trace elements were also abundant, such as manganese (Mn), zinc (Zn), nickel (Ni), copper (Cu), and iron (Fe). Pb, As, and Mn showed the highest concentrations in vertebrae, while Cd, Cu, and Zn were the highest in the liver, probably due to their concentration in the prey items of the sharks; Fe and Ni showed the highest concentrations in the skin, due to their presence in the water column, especially along the coast where animals were collected. The concentration of some trace elements analyzed in the vertebrae decreased with the growth of the sharks. These results confirm that elasmobranchs, being predators at the apex of the marine food chain, act as final receptors for a series of polluting elements regularly discharged into the sea.

AB  - Social learning is complex, but people often seem to navigate social environments with ease. This ability creates a puzzle for traditional accounts of reinforcement learning (RL) that assume people negotiate a tradeoff between easybut-simple behavior (model-free learning) and complex-but-difficult behavior (e.g., model-based learning). We offer a theoretical framework for resolving this puzzle: although social environments are complex, people have social expertise that helps them behave flexibly with low cognitive cost. Specifically, by using familiar concepts instead of focusing on novel details, people can turn hard learning problems into simpler ones. This ability highlights social learning as a prototype for studying cognitive simplicity in the face of environmental complexity and identifies a role for conceptual knowledge in everyday reward learning.

AB  - Ketamine is an anesthetic drug that also has antidepressant properties, with quick action. Despite the great number of studies showing its effectiveness as a treatment for major depression, there is little information about its effects on postpartum depression, as pharmacological treatments bring risks to the health of both mother and child. Thus, this study aimed to evaluate the effects of prolonged treatment with subanesthetic doses of ketamine in a rat model of postpartum depression. Female dams were induced to postpartum depression by the maternal separation model from lactating day (LD) 2-12. They were divided into four groups: one control and three experimental groups, which were treated with different doses of ketamine (5, 10 or 20 mg/kg) from LD 2-21 i.p. Maternal studies were conducted from LD5 to LD21 and the offspring studies from postnatal day 2 through 90. Ketamine causes poor maternal care, with few neurochemical alterations. However, the highest dose used in this study had an antidepressant effect. Regarding the male offspring, indirect exposure to ketamine through breast milk caused few behavioral changes during infancy, but they were not permanent, as they faded in adulthood. Nevertheless, this exposure was able to cause alterations in their monoaminergic neurotransmission systems that were found in both infancy and adulthood periods.

AB  - A Festulolium grass is an intergeneric hybrid of fescue (Festuca L.) and ryegrass (Lolium L.) that combines the nutritional qualities and weather resistance of each. Its high nutritional value and resistance to extreme weather conditions are important considerations in the era of global climate change. Festulolium has been used as a forage crop for many years, but little information is available on the levels of biologically active compounds (beta-carotene and tocopherols) in Festuloliumbased diets and in the meat of animals fed such diets. The present study assessed the contents of beta-carotene, retinol and tocopherols and the proximate chemical composition of meat from young rams receiving diets based on silage made from different Festulolium cultivars (Becva, Felopa, Paulita), as compared with meat from rams fed a diet based on hybrid ryegrass. The meat of animals fed Festulolium silage-based diets contained more tocopherols and retinol than the meat of sheep receiving a hybrid ryegrass-based diet. Meat from rams fed diets based on silage made from Festulolium cvs. Felopa and Paulita was characterized by the highest concentrations of tocopherols and retinol. The results of this study indicate that Festulolium silage can be a desirable component of ram diets, but its efficacy may vary across cultivars.
   Abstract: This study analyzed the chemical composition and the beta-carotene, tocopherol and retinol content of meat (musculus longissimus lumborum, musculus gluteus maximus) from young rams fed different silage-based diets. The animals were divided into four groups depending on the type of silage in the feed ration (hybrid ryegrass, Festulolium cv. Becva, Festulolium cv. Felopa, Festulolium cv. Paulita). The concentrations of the examined lipophilic compounds were measured via highperformance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Animals fed a diet based on ryegrass silage had the highest intakes of alpha-, beta-, gamma- and delta-tocopherol and total tocopherols (p < 0.01). Muscles of rams fed Festulolium silage-based diets contained more tocopherols (p < 0.01) and retinol (p < 0.01 in m. g. maximus; p = 0.053 in m. l. lumborum) than the meat of animals receiving hybrid ryegrass-based diets. The highest amounts of tocopherols (p < 0.01) and retinol (p < 0.01 in m. g. maximus; p = 0.053 in m. l. lumborum) were found in meat from rams fed rations based on silage made from Festulolium cvs. Felopa and Paulita. The analysis revealed a positive correlation between the intake of tocopherols and the alpha-tocopherol content of meat (r = 0.99), as well as between the beta-carotene intake and the retinol content of meat (r = 0.92 in m. l. lumborum; r = 0.91 in m. g. maximus).

AB  - Background: The combination of Astragalus membranaceus and Carthamus tinctorius (AC) exhibits significant therapeutic effects in cerebral ischemia/reperfusion injury (CIRI). Understanding the metabolic characteristics of brain microregions and disturbances in tissues and systemic circulation is crucial for elucidating the mechanisms of CIRI and the therapeutic benefits of AC. However, in situ metabolic regulation of the complex brain structure has not been adequately studied, and the therapeutic mechanism of AC requires immediate clarification. Purpose: The present study aimed to unveil the specific metabolic reprogramming of CIRI at systemic and microregional levels, identify key metabolic pathways and metabolites, and elucidate the therapeutic mechanisms of AC. Methods: Air flow-assisted desorption electrospray ionization mass spectrometry imaging (AFADESI-MSI), a newly developed technique, was used to investigate metabolites in brain microregions. Hematoxylin-eosin, Nissl, and immunofluorescence staining were performed to visualize the microscopic changes associated with spatial metabolism. A comprehensive metabolomics study was conducted on serum, brain tissue, and microregions, along with neurological assessments, cerebral infarction measurements, and Evans blue experiments, to assess the systemic and local metabolic effects of AC treatment for CIRI. Results: AC significantly reduced neurological damage, minimized infarct size, and repaired blood-brain barrier damage in CIRI rats. AFADESI-MSI demonstrated that the metabolic imbalance caused by CIRI primarily occurs in the cerebral cortex, hippocampus, caudate putamen, thalamus, cerebellar cortex, and fiber tract regions. Significant changes in 16 metabolites were observed in these regions, corresponding to neuron damage, glial cell activation, and neural repair. 20 metabolites from serum and 4 from brain tissue varied significantly with the sham group. Comprehensive metabolomics analysis indicated a close relationship among serum, tissue, and microregional metabolism. CIRI-induced systemic and localized metabolic disorders involve 14 metabolic pathways. AC conferred therapeutic benefits in CIRI by reversing various metabolic imbalances. Conclusion: AFADESI-MSI efficiently visualized brain microregion metabolism. Comprehensive metabolomics analysis revealed detailed insights into the specific metabolic reprogramming in CIRI and the therapeutic impacts of AC. AC demonstrated significant clinical potential as an adjunct therapy to existing CIRI treatments.

AB  - Navigation through space is based on memory representations of landmarks ('place') or movement sequences ('response'). Over time, memory representations transform through consolidation. However, it is unclear how the transformation affects place and response navigation in humans. In the present study, healthy adults navigated to target locations in a virtual maze. The preference for using place and response strategies and the ability to recall place and response memories were tested after a delay of one hour (n = 31), one day (n = 30), or two weeks (n = 32). The different delays captured early-phase synaptic changes, changes after one night of sleep, and long-delay changes due to the reorganization of navigation networks. Our results show that the relative contributions of place and response navigation changed as a function of time. After a short delay of up to one day, participants preferentially used a place strategy and exhibited a high degree of visual landmark exploration. After a longer delay of two weeks, place strategy use decreased significantly. Participants now equally relied on place and response strategy use and increasingly repeated previously taken paths. Further analyses indicate that response strategy use predominantly occurred as a compensatory strategy in the absence of sufficient place memory. Over time, place memory faded before response memory. We suggest that the observed shift from place to response navigation is context-dependent since detailed landmark information, which strongly relied on hippocampal function, decayed faster than sequence information, which required less detail and depended on extrahippocampal areas.

AB  - Simple Summary Hybrid rice is produced by crossing a male sterile rice line (the A line) with a pollen doner that restores fertility (the restorer line). The consequential outbreeding can result in plant growth and yields that are above the average of the parental lines (a condition called heterosis). This gives rise to a normally higher productivity of hybrids compared to pure-line (inbred) rice varieties. However, hybrid rice has also been associated with higher herbivore damage compared to inbreds. In particular, susceptibility to the whitebacked planthopper (Sogatella furcifera) has been linked to the A line in early generation hybrids. We tested whether hybrids had heterosis for resistance to the whitebacked planthopper, brown planthopper (Nilaparvata lugens) and yellow stemborer (Scirpophaga incertulas) in a series of greenhouse and field experiments. In the field plots, heterosis resulted in relatively high hybrid yields. There were few cases of heterosis for resistance to herbivores in the greenhouse or field and only one of eight A lines was associated with susceptibility to planthoppers. Susceptibility to the yellow stemborer was largely due to plant physiology: larger, fast-growing and late-maturing varieties, including hybrids, were more vulnerable to stemborers. Therefore, susceptibility to stemborers was often a consequence of heterosis for plant biomass. We make a series of recommendations to improve screening and breeding for resistance to herbivores in hybrid rice.Abstract Three-line hybrid rice is produced by crossing male sterile (A line) rice with a fertility-restorer (R line). Fertile lines (B lines) are also required to maintain A line seed for breeding programs. We used a range of hybrids and their parental lines to assess the frequency and nature of heterosis for resistance to the whitebacked planthopper (Sogatella furcifera), brown planthopper (Nilaparvata lugens) and yellow stemborer (Scirpophaga incertulas). Heterosis is defined as trait improvement above the average of the parental lines as a result of outbreeding. Based on the results from a greenhouse study that challenged hybrids and their parental lines with each herbivore species, we found that susceptibility to planthoppers was associated with one of the eight A lines tested, but resistance was improved by crossing with a relatively resistant restorer. Higher frequencies of heterosis for susceptibility in comparisons between hybrids and their B lines suggest that susceptibility was not related to the cytoplasmic genomes of the associated sterile A lines. Furthermore, because none of the parental lines possessed currently effective resistance genes, improved resistance against planthoppers was probably due to quantitative resistance. In a related field trial, hybrids had generally higher yields than their fertile parents and often produced larger grain; however, they were often more susceptible to stemborers, leaffolders (Cnaphalocrocis medinalis) and other caterpillars (Rivula atimeta). This was largely a consequence of hybrid heterosis for plant biomass and was strongly affected by crop duration. We make a series of recommendations to improve hybrid breeding to reduce the risks of herbivore damage.

AB  - Brain injury/concussion is a growing epidemic throughout the world. Although evidence supports association between traumatic brain injury (TBI) and disturbance in brain glucose metabolism, the underlying molecular mechanisms are not well established. Previously, we reported the release of cellular prion protein (PrPc) from the brain to circulation following TBI. The PrPc level was also found to be decreased in insulin-resistant rat brains. In the present study, we investigated the molecular link between PrPc and brain insulin resistance in a single and repeated mild TBI-induced mouse model. Mild TBI was induced in mice by dropping a weight (similar to 95 g at 1 m high) on the right side of the head. The procedure was performed once and thrice (once daily) for single (SI) and repeated induction (RI), respectively. Micro PET/CT imaging revealed that RI mice showed significant reduction in cortical, hippocampal and cerebellum glucose uptake compared to SI and control. Mice that received RI also showed significant motor and cognitive deficits. In co-immunoprecipitation, the interaction between PrPc, flotillin and Cbl-associated protein (CAP) observed in the control mice brains was disrupted by RI. Lipid raft isolation showed decreased levels of PrPc, flotillin and CAP in the RI mice brains. Based on observation, it is clear that PrPc has an interaction with CAP and the dislodgment of PrPc from cell membranes may lead to brain insulin resistance in a mild TBI mouse model. The present study generated a new insight into the pathogenesis of brain injury, which may result in the development of novel therapy.

AB  - Livestock production is often a source of multiple pollutants in rivers. However, current assessments of water pollution seldomly take a multi-pollutant perspective, while this is essential for improving water quality. This study quantifies inputs of multiple pollutants to rivers from livestock production worldwide, by animal types and spatially explicit. We focus on nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), and Cryptosporidium (pathogen). We developed the MARINA-Global-L (Model to Assess River Inputs of pollutaNts to seAs for Livetsock) model for 10,226 sub-basins and eleven livestock species. Global inputs to land from livestock are around 94 Tg N, 19 Tg P, and 2.9 x 10(21) oocysts from Cryptosporidium in 2010. Over 57% of these amounts are from grazed animals. Asia, South America, and Africa account for over 68% of these amounts on land. The inputs to rivers are around 22 Tg Total Dissolved Nitrogen (TDN), 1.8 Tg Total Dissolved P (TDP), and 1.3 x 10(21) oocysts in 2010. Cattle, pigs, and chickens are responsible for 74-88% of these pollutants in rivers. One-fourth of the global sub-basins can be considered pollution hotspots and contribute 71-95% to the TDN, TDP, and oocysts in rivers. Our study could contribute to effective manure management for individual livestock species in sub-basins to reduce multiple pollutants in rivers.

AB  - We examine possible ways of functional adjustment of morphologically similar alimentary tracts in rodents with different dietary specializations. We study the structure of stomach and gut epithelial surface as well as the features of its colonization with microorganisms in five gerbil species: Psammomys obesus, Meriones crassus, Gerbillus henleyi, G. andersoni, and G. dasyurus. Data on the morphological diversity of mucosa-associated microbiota have been obtained and confirmed by the results of previous microbiology studies. Species differences in chymus acidity associated with dietary specialization have been determined. Variations in the activity of the endoglucanase microbial enzyme, which is crucial for rodents fed on cellulose-containing food, have also been detected. The importance of microbiota for functional adaptations to various food types in rodents with morphologically similar digestive tracts has been evaluated.

AB  - Simple Summary
   The moon is ubiquitous in the night sky and considered an important abiotic factor that influences animal activity. However, little is known about the relationship between moonlight and the daily, monthly, or seasonal frequency of wildlife-vehicle collisions (WVCs). Traditionally, the influence of moonlight on WVCs has been analyzed using the lunar phase (quarters) approach, which evaluates moonlight on a rough scale (only four 25% steps of the visible moon disc and a strict arrangement of phases over time). We used a different approach; we compared WVCs to the actual lunar disc illumination that is based on the specific daily percentage of the visible lunar disk (LDP). Our findings indicated a significant trend of increasing WVC frequencies with increasing LDP at night. We also examined the correlation between the daily numbers of WVCs and LDP for different months and seasons. Positive correlations between LDP and WVCs were stronger at night and during the late autumn-winter months, particularly in December, suggesting the importance of lunar illumination on WVCs. Our study suggests that the LDP approach may provide more possibilities for the evaluation and quantification of WVCs and lunar light relationships than the traditional lunar phase approach. The results can be useful for predicting and reducing WVCs at different times of the lunar illumination cycle and in different seasons.
   We investigated the relationship between lunar illumination based on the percentage of the visible lunar disk (LDP) and the frequency of wildlife-vehicle collisions (WVCs) in Lithuania. We analyzed WVC frequency during ten 10% LDP intervals to more precisely reflect the relationship between LDP and WVC. The 10% LDP interval approach showed a significant trend of increasing WVC frequencies with an increasing LDP at night. We also examined the correlation between the daily numbers of WVCs and LDP for different months and seasons. The relationship seemed to be stronger at night and during the late autumn-winter months, particularly in December, suggesting the importance of lunar illumination on WVCs. There was a weak positive correlation between LDP and overall daily number of WVCs (r(s) = 0.091; p < 0.001) and between LDP and night WVCs (r(s) = 0.104; p < 0.001). We found significant positive correlations for winter (December-February) (r(s) = 0.118; p = 0.012) and autumn (August-November) (r(s) = 0.127; p = 0.007). Our study suggests that the LDP interval approach may provide more possibilities for the evaluation and quantification of WVCs and lunar light relationships than the traditional lunar phase approach.

AB  - Ants play a key role in improving the structure and function of local communities. They interact with plants, herbivores, predators and parasitoids and are able to change their trophic role in space and time. These features, however, make it difficult to establish the net trophic role of ants in agroecosystems. Here we aim to determine the isotopic enrichment and tissue incorporation rates in ants of the Tapinoma nigerrimum complex, which are found abundantly in olive orchards (i.e. T. ibericum), to determine their trophic role through stable isotopes analysis. We compared the isotopic signature of ants feeding on (1) natural diets, (2) experimental diets and (3) contrasting diets of ants inhabiting natural habitats and olive orchards with different management systems. Then, we contrasted our isotopic results on natural diets with the prey of ant foragers in olive orchards. Our results showed that (1) ants from olive orchards had an isotopic signature different from that of a hyper-predator; (2) the isotopic signature did not vary significantly amongst different management practices and (3) the diet of ants in nature varies greatly on preys according to resource availability, which may be reflected in isotopic signatures. Therefore, T. ibericum is a species that can potentially contribute to control olive pests without posing a risk to other natural enemies because commonly it is not a hyper-predator. The information presented here could be used by farmers and technicians to enhance local biological control planning and/or strategies in olive orchards.

AB  - The historic DHP nucleus was serendipitously discovered by Arthur Hantzsch about 130 years ago and is still considered a hidden treasure for various pharmacological activities. Twenty-one DHP analogues were synthesized using the expedient one pot Hantzsch synthesis for screening as anticancer agents. Initially, the in vitro anti-proliferative single dose against a panel of 18 cancer cell lines showed that compounds 11b and 8f were the superlative candidates regarding their antitumor effect (GI% mean = 66.40% and 50.42%, correspondingly) compared to cisplatin (GI% mean = 65.58%) and doxorubicin (GI% mean = 74.56%). Remarkably, compound 11b showed a remarkable MDA-MB-468 anticancer activity (GI%=80.81%), higher than cisplatin (64.44%) and doxorubicin (76.72%), as well as strong antitumor activity against lung cancer A549 (GI%= 83.02%), more powerful than both cisplatin and doxorubicin. Compound 11b exhibited an exceptional anticancer activity against lung cancer cell line (A549) as its GI50 in nanomolar was (540 nM) with a 9-fold increase greater than cisplatin (GI50 = 4.93 mu M) and with a selectivity index = 131 to cancer cells over normal cells. Further mechanistic investigations proved that DHPs anticipate simultaneously TOPI and RTKs (VEGFR-2, HER-2 and BTK) which can stimulate BAX/BAK and the executioner caspases via rtPCR studies.

AB  - Human activities have primarily destroyed natural habitats, due to which captive breeding has become an important conservation tool. Besides conservation, it also provides opportunities for education, research, and recreational activities. In Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, several wild ungulate species are raised in captivity. However, there is a lack of detailed information about the ex-situ conservation status of these species. The present study gives a piece of benchmark information on wild ungulate species, breeding practices and the challenges that exist in captive breeding in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Province of Pakistan.

AB  - Milk fat is the foremost nutrient of milk and a vital indicator in evaluating milk quality. Accumulating evidence suggests that microRNAs (miRNAs) are involved in the synthesis of milk fat. The miR-200c is closely related to lipid metabolism, but little is known about its effect on the synthesis of milk fat in MECs of ewes. Herein, the effect of miR-200c on the proliferation of ovine mammary epithelial cells (MECs) and its target relationship with a predicted target gene were investigated. The regulatory effects of miR-200c on the expression of the target genes and the content of triglycerides in ovine MECs were further analyzed. The results revealed that the expression level of miR-200c was differentially expressed in both eight tissues selected during lactation and in mammary gland tissues at different physiological periods. Overexpression of miR-200c inhibited the viability and proliferation of ovine MECs, while inhibition of miR-200c increased cell viability and promoted the proliferation of ovine MECs. Target gene prediction results indicated that miR-200c would bind the 3 ' UTR region of pantothenate kinase 3 (PANK3). Overexpression of miR-200c reduced the luciferase activity of PANK3, while inhibition of miR-200c increased its luciferase activity. These findings illustrated that miR-200c could directly interact with the target site of the PANK3. It was further found that overexpression of miR-200c reduced the expression levels of PANK3 and, thus, accelerated the synthesis of triglycerides. In contrary, the inhibitor of miR-200c promoted the expression of PANK3 that, thus, inhibited the synthesis of triglycerides in ovine MECs. Together, these findings revealed that miR-200c promotes the triglycerides synthesis in ovine MECs via increasing the lipid synthesis related genes expression by targeting PANK3.

AB  - Biogas slurry is the residue liquid after anaerobic fermentation of biomass. The bio-slurry has the potential to promote plant growth and control pests. This study explores the pesticidal potency of anaerobic digestate focusing on structural elucidation through gas chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis. Samples were collected from three anaerobic digesters processing cow dung, mixed substrates, and pig waste. Physicochemical parameters such as pH, electrical conductivity, total dissolved solids, and nitrogen content were measured. The slurries exhibited slightly basic pH values (7.5-7.8) and electrical conductivity (13.8-21.9 mS/m). GC-MS analysis revealed diverse phytochemical compounds in the bio-slurries, such as gramine, 2,2-dimethoxybutane, and 4-methyl-3-penten-2-one, with potential pesticidal properties. Gramine exhibited insecticidal, herbicidal, and algaecidal effects, while 2,2-dimethoxyethane demonstrated fungicidal and herbicidal properties. Gramine was identified and possesses its potential as a natural biopesticide. The identified compounds offer promising alternatives to synthetic pesticides, emphasizing the potential of biogas slurry as a sustainable biopesticide resource.

AB  - Poor fetal growth affects eating behavior and the mesocorticolimbic system; however, its influence on the hippocampus has been less explored. Brain insulin sensitivity has been linked to developmental plasticity in response to fetal adversity and to cognitive performance following high-fat diet intake. We investigated whether poor fetal growth and exposure to chronic hyperpalatable food in adulthood could influence the recognition of environmental and food cues, eating behavior patterns, and hippocampal insulin signaling. At 60 days of life, we assigned male offspring from a prenatal animal model of 50% food restriction (FR) to receive either a high-fat and -sugar (HFS) diet or standard chow (CON) diet. Behavioral tests were conducted at 140 days, then tissues were collected. HFS groups showed a diminished hippocampal pAkt/Akt ratio. FR-CON and FR-HFS groups had higher levels of suppressor of cytokine signaling 3, compared to control groups. FR groups showed increased exploration of a novel hyperpalatable food, independent of their diet, and HFS groups exhibited overall lower entropy (less random, more predictable eating behavior) when the environment changed. Poor fetal growth and chronic HFS diet in adulthood altered hippocampal insulin signaling and eating patterns, diminishing the flexibility associated with eating behavior in response to extrinsic changes in food availability in the environment.

AB  - The abundance of monoterpenoids and phenolic compounds determines the medicinal quality and anti-insect properties of Agastache rugosa, which can be compromised by biotic stress such as herbivore attacks. The traditional use of chemical pesticides to mitigate herbivore interference is increasingly incompatible with sustainable agriculture. In response, nanotechnology-based biostimulants, which can activate metabolic processes to enhance plant growth and stress resistance, offer a more cost-effective and environmentally-friendly alternative. However, to date, it remains unknown how nano-biostimulants improve the therapeutic value and insect resistance of medicinal plants simultaneously. This study investigates the effect of 0-1000 mg/L of a nanobiostimulant salicylic acid functionalized chitosan nanocomposite (SCN) on the pharmacological and antiherbivore properties of medicinal plant A. rugosa. Results showed that 100 mg/L SCN significantly inhibited Spodoptera litura growth by 62.9 %, and increased plant shoot and root biomass by 107.2 % and 77.6 %, respectively. Moreover, 100 mg/L SCN significantly upregulated the expression of the key genes (e.g., LS, L3OH, and CHS) involved in monoterpene and phenolic compounds biosynthesis by 1.4-10.1 folds, thus boosting the production of active compounds such as pulegone, beta-myrcene, and chlorogenic acid by 1.5-24.4 folds. These enhancements were superior to salicylic acid or chitosan alone. Altogether, our findings promote the sustainable and eco-friendly application of nano-biostimulant in improving the quality of medicinal plants and green pest control in agroecosystems.

AB  - Edible insects represent a new functional source of nutrients that can contribute to solving nutritional deficiency problems. The antioxidant potential and bioactive compounds of nut bars with the addition of three edible insects were evaluated. Acheta domesticus L., Alphitobius diaperinus P. and Tenebrio molitor L. flours were used. A 30% share of insect flour in the bars resulted in significantly greater antioxidant activity (TPC increased from 190.19 for standard bars to 309.45 mg catechin/100 g for bars with 30% addition of cricket flour). Insect flour contributed significantly to an increase in 2,5-dihydrobenzoic acid (from 0.12 for bars with a 15% share of buffalo worm flour to 0.44 mg/100 g in the case of bars with a 30% share of cricket flour) and chlorogenic acid in all bars (from 0.58 for bars with a 15% share of cricket flour to 3.28 mg/100 g for bars with a 30% addition of buffalo worm flour), compared to the standard. The highest content of tocopherols was found in bars with cricket flour, compared to standard bars (43.57 and 24.06 mg/100 g of fat, respectively). The dominant sterol in bars enriched with insect powder was cholesterol. The highest amount of it was found in cricket bars, and the lowest in mealworm bars (64.16 and 21.62 mg/100 g of fat, respectively). The enrichment of nut bars with insect flours raises the levels of valuable phytosterols in the final product. The addition of edible insect flours reduced the perception of most sensory attributes of the bars, compared to the standard bar.

AB  - The development of cost-effective methods for laboratory and mass rearing of biological control agents necessarily includes the selection of the optimal diet. Experiments with some predatory coccinellids revealed so-called 'additive effects': feeding on mixed foods ensures lower mortality, faster larval development and adult maturation, higher fecundity, etc., than feeding on each of the components. These effects were demonstrated for eight of the 11 studied species (although not for all used combinations of foods). Meta-analysis shows that significant additive effect was found in 29.3% of 140 cases resulted from experiments with 11 species of predatory Coccinellidae performed in 21 published studies. However, if (1) one of the two mixed foods was artificial or factitious or if (2) one of the two mixed foods (that of higher quality) was limitedly provided, or if (3) the beneficial effect of mixed foods was estimated by fecundity, rate of maturation, or other indicators of reproductive activity, the probability of detection of a beneficial additive effect increased up to about 50%. These results could be used for the planning of further studies on the selection of optimal diets for laboratory and mass rearing of predatory ladybirds. In particular, a combination of a limited supply of an expensive high quality food with unlimited cheap low quality food could be the most promising and cost-effective approach.

AB  - Ethnopharmacological relevance: In Ethiopian traditional medicine the root of Taverniera abyssinica A.Rich is known as a remedy for sudden gastrointestinal cramping and fever. In this study we have isolated and identified the bioactive principle of Taverniera abyssinica that exerts effects on isolated smooth muscle tissues of the rabbit duodenum and guinea-pig ileum. Aim of the study: To isolate and purify the bioactive principle from the root of Taverniera abyssinica A.Rich by bioassay-guided fractionation, HPLC purification and masspectrometry, with further investigation of its bioac-tivity on isolated smooth muscle strips. Materials and methods: Roots of Taverniera abyssinica A.Rich extracted in 75% methanol/water were fractioned with a reverse phase column and then subjected to HPLC purification. Each fraction collected from the HPLC was tested for its bioactivity using electric field stimulation-evoked contractions of the rabbit duodenum and guinea-pig ileum. Finally, detailed structural analysis of the fraction displaying significant bioactivity was made by mass spectrometry. Results: Through bioassay-guided fractionation and HPLC purification the bioactive fractions were identified. These were tested for bioactivity on isolated smooth muscle strips which showed about 80% inhibition of contractions evoked by electric field stimulation. These compounds were identified as formononetin, afrormosin and tectorigenin by using masspectrometry applying relevant standards for detection. Conclusion: The traditionally claimed smooth muscle-relaxing effect of the roots of Taverniera abyssinica A.Rich is essentially due the three isolated and purified the two isoflavones formononetin, afrormosin as well as the metoxyisoflavone tectorigenin, along with possibly other not yet purified bioactive substances, however with similar smooth muscle-relaxing properties.

However, the interacting regulatory mechanisms between m6A modifications and miRNAs in skeletal muscle development remain unclear. In this study, miRNA sequencing analysis of goat primary myoblasts (GPMs) pre- and post-differentiation revealed that miR-503-5p was upregulated during myogenic differentiation, and its precursor was identified to contain m6A modification sites. Combined analysis of RIP, qRT-PCR and mRNA stability assay showed that Ythdf2 could recognize and bind the m6A site on pre-miR-5035p, thereby facilitating the maturation of pre-miR-503-5p in an m6A-dependent manner. Moreover, the overexpression of miR-503-5p significantly inhibits the proliferation of GPMs, promotes myogenic differentiation, and enhances mitochondrial biogenesis while activating the mTOR pathway. However, the suppression of mTOR activity can effectively counteract the accelerated myogenic differentiation induced by miR-503-5p overexpression. Collectively, our results indicate that Ythdf2-dependent m6A modification facilitates the maturation of pre-miR-503-5p, thereby promoting skeletal muscle differentiation through the activation of the mTOR pathway. These insights lay a valuable foundation for further investigation into the complexities of skeletal muscle development and the potential implications of epigenetic regulation in this process.

AB  - Plants adapt to balance growth-defense tradeoffs in response to both biotic and abiotic stresses. Green leaf volatiles (GLVs) are released after biotic and abiotic stresses and function as damage-associated signals in plants. Although, GLVs enter plants primarily through stomata, the role of stomatal regulation on the kinetics of GLV uptake remains largely unknown. Here, we illustrate the effect of stomatal closure on the timing and magnitude of GLV uptake. We closed stomata by either exposing maize (Zea mays) plants to darkness or applying abscisic acid, a phytohormone that closes the stomata in light. Then, we exposed maize seedlings to (Z)-3-hexen-1-ol and compared its dynamic uptake under different stomatal conditions. Additionally, we used (E)-3-hexen-1-ol, an isomer of (Z)-3-hexen-1-ol not made by maize, to exclude the role of internal GLVs in our assays. We demonstrate that closed stomata effectively prevent GLV entry into exposed plants, even at high concentrations. Furthermore, our findings indicate that reduced GLV uptake impairs GLV-driven induction of biosynthesis of sesquiterpenes, a group of GLV-inducible secondary metabolites, with or without herbivory. These results elucidate how stomata regulate the perception of GLV signals, thereby dramatically changing the plant responses to herbivory, particularly under water stress or dark conditions.
   Stomatal closure prevents the entry of green leaf volatiles, damage-associated signals, into maize, thus impairing their signaling functions in relation to the induction of terpenoid compounds.

AB  - Background: Arsenic is a widely distributed ecotoxic pollutant that has been found to cause neurotoxicity in a variety of species. Gut-brain axis is a two-way information network between the gut microbiome and the brain, which is closely related to organismal health. However, the role of the gut-brain axis in arsenic-induced neurotoxicity remains largely unknown. Methods: In order to explore whether there is a relationship between brain and gut microbiota of meat ducks, we performed molecular biological detection including RT-qPCR and Western blot, as well as morphological detection including, HE staining and immunohistochemistry. Meanwhile, intestinal contents were analyzed using 16 S ribosomal RNA gene sequencing and analysis Results: In this study, we investigated whether arsenic trioxide (ATO) can activate the gut microbiome-brain axis to induce intestinal and brain injury. The results showed that ATO-exposure disrupted the diversity balance of intestinal microbiota and integrity and injured the intestinal structure. ATO-exposure also reduced the number of glycogen and goblet cells in the duodenum. In addition, exposure to ATO caused intestinal inflammatory injury by activating NF-kappa B signaling pathway and promoting the expression of its target genes. Meanwhile, the tight junction-related proteins (ZO-1, occludin) of gut and brain were reduced by ATO exposure. Furthermore, results also revealed that ATO-exposure induced brain injury, including neuronal cell vacuolization and reduced numbers of neuronal cells in the cortex and hippocampus. Remarkably, ATO-exposure also disrupted neurotransmitter levels. Additionally, our further molecular mechanism study revealed that ATO-exposure increased the expression of autophagy and apoptosis related mRNA and proteins levels in the brain tissues. Conclusion: Altogether, these findings provide a new insight into that ATO-exposure induced intestinal injury and aggravated neurotoxicity via the gut-brain axis.

AB  - Ammonia (NH3) is a common pollutant mostly derived from pig manure composting under humid conditions, and it is absolutely necessary to develop materials for ammonia removal with high stability and efficiency. To this end, metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) have received special attention because of their high selectivity of harmful gases in the air, resulting from their large surface area and high density of active sites, which can be tailored by appropriate modifications. Herein, two synthetic metal-organic frameworks (MOFs), 2-methylimidazole zinc salt (ZIF-8) and zinc-trimesic acid (ZnBTC), were selected for ammonia removal under humid conditions during composting. The two MOFs, with different organic linkers, exhibit fairly distinctive ammonia absorption behaviors under the same conditions. For the ZnBTC framework, the ammonia intake is 11.37 mmol/g at 298 K, nine times higher than that of the ZIF-8 framework (1.26 mmol/g). In combination with theoretical calculations, powder XRD patterns, FTIR, and BET surface area tests were conducted to reveal the absorption mechanisms of ammonia for the two materials. The adsorption of ammonia on the ZnBTC framework can be attributed to both physical and chemical adsorption. A strong coordination interaction exists between the nitrogen atom from the ammonia molecule and the zinc atom in the ZnBTC framework. In contrast, the absorption of ammonia in the ZIF-8 framework is mainly physical. The weak interaction between the ammonia molecule and the ZIF-8 framework mainly results from the inherent severely steric hindrance, which is related to the coordination mode of the imidazole ligands and the zinc atom of this framework. Therefore, this study provides a method for designing promising MOFs with appropriate organic linkers for the selective capture of ammonia during manure composting.

AB  - Optimization of experimental materials synthesis and characterization through active learning methods has been growing over the last decade, with examples ranging from measurements of diffraction on combinatorial alloys at synchrotrons, to searches through chemical space with automated synthesis robots for perovskites. In virtually all cases, the target property of interest for optimization is defined a priori with the ability to shift the trajectory of the optimization based on human-identified findings during the experiment is lacking. Thus, to highlight the best of both human operators and AI-driven experiments, here we present the development of a human-AI collaborated experimental workflow, via a Bayesian optimized active recommender system (BOARS), to shape targets on the fly with human real-time feedback. Here, the human guidance overpowers AI at early iteration when prior knowledge (uncertainty) is minimal (higher), while the AI overpowers the human during later iterations to accelerate the process with the human-assessed goal. We showcase examples of this framework applied to pre-acquired piezoresponse force spectroscopy of a ferroelectric thin film, and in real-time on an atomic force microscope, with human assessment to find symmetric hysteresis loops. It is found that such features appear more affected by subsurface defects than the local domain structure. This work shows the utility of human-AI approaches for curiosity driven exploration of systems across experimental domains.

AB  - All-inorganic phosphor-in-glass (PiG) materials for laser-induced luminescent devices have emerged as an irresistible trend in the solid-state lighting field, owing to their remarkable advantages such as easy fabrication, excellent light quality and low-cost. Unfortunately, the unstable output light quality under high power conditions remains an inevitable issue for PiGs. Herein, we presented a highly transparent Ce:YAG-PiG with an irradiation-resistant glass matrix, which was achieved by combining Li2Si2O5 and beta-spodumene to optimize the glass composition. Driven by a static 3.4 W blue laser excitation, the Ce:YAG-PiG possessing an exceptional thermal conductivity (2.1 W/(m<middle dot>K)), demonstrated a satisfactory steady-state luminous flux of 639.1 lm and achieving a remarkable luminous efficiency up to 247.8 lm/W. To mitigate the impact of "thermal quenching" caused by thermal saturation, an effectively implemented high-speed rotating colour wheel laser illumination module with heat dissipation capabilities has been adopted. This combination mode relatively stable colour coordinates across various power levels and the emitted light exhibits excellent collimation. Under the irradiation of a 190 W high-power laser, it can achieve a maximum luminous flux exceeding 18,000 lm. This research provides a novel guiding direction for the development of phosphor composite materials as well as the future applications of PiG materials.

AB  - Spider mites become easy prey for ants when they leave their protective webs; therefore, the ability to avoid traces of ongoing ant activity should confer a selective advantage to mites. We examined avoidance of ant traces by the spider mites Tetranychus kanzawai and Tetranychus urticae. Both mite species avoided host plant leaves with active traces of Pristomyrmex punctatus or Formica japonica ants. Pristomyrmex punctatus trace avoidance by T. kanzawai lasted for more than 1 h, but not more than 3 h. Tetranychus kanzawai also avoided P. punctatus traces on plant stems, along which the mites access leaves. Moreover, T. kanzawai avoided hexane extracts of P. punctatus or F. japonica applied to a filter paper pathway. This study represents the first demonstration of a repellent effect of ant chemical traces on spider mites. Considering the substantial abundance and global distribution of ants in nature, such repellent effects may help to answer the long-standing question of why only a small fraction of available plant resources is used by herbivores. Although spider mites have developed resistance against many synthetic pesticides, natural compounds that simulate ant chemical traces may repel spider mites from agricultural crops.

AB  - Alpacas represent an exotic species for Italy, introduced no more than 20-30 years ago. Nevertheless, they are currently the most widespread camelid species reared in this country, highlighting the growing interest in breeding this species. So, it is useful to assess parameters on their growth in relation to the new environment. Thus, body weight and body measures were recorded on 49 healthy alpacas of Huacaya type (27 females, 22 males), along a period of 27 months. Overall, 111 individual observations were made. Data were analysed by ANOVA, as growth curves were estimated by applying the Gompertz's model. Multiple regression was finally used to estimate body weight from body measures. Body weight and linear measures, except for the distance between iliac crest and the length of the rump, were influenced by the category (calves, yearlings, adults) and by the age class within category (p < 0.05), while gender and interaction between gender and category were never significant (p > 0.05). Asymptotic weigh of males was 8.25% higher than females (p < 0.05). Moreover, males at maturity had higher withers (+0.96%), longer body (+2.70%) and chest measurements (+3.18%) than females. Asymptotic rump width (both at the ilium and at the ischium) was higher in females (respectively + 6.19%; +12.90%). According to our work, the best equation for the estimate of body weight from body measures was the following: 5.691 + 0.00005624 * chest circumference(3) + 0.00002298 * trunk length(3) - 1.155 * rump width between ischial tuberosities + 0.00001545 * height at rump(3) (R-2=0.957; SE of estimate = 4.36 kg), that is important for a better management of the species.

AB  - The seahorse is a traditional Chinese herbal medicine that has been utilized for the treatment of conditions such as osteoporosis, nonunion fractures, knee osteoarthritis, and herniated lumbar disks. Zebrafish is an excellent animal model to study the effects of herbal preparations on osteogenesis and bone metabolism, and bone biology is highly similar to that of mammals, so it has been used to develop multiple glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis (GIOP) models. Our study aimed to explore whether the decoction of Hippocampus erectus (DHe) administered in zebrafish larvae promotes bone health under physiological and osteoporotic conditions. In zebrafish larvae, 25 mu M prednisolone solution was successfully used to induce the zebrafish osteoporosis model, which can significantly inhibit the mineralization area and degree of bone mineralization, reduce the activity of alkaline phosphatase, and increase tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase activity. The results showed that 0.3 g/L DHe had a significant improvement effect on osteoporosis in zebrafish by enhancing the mineralization degree and phosphatase activity of zebrafish, while also promoting the expression of genes associated with bone development. It can be considered a good candidate to develop new drugs against osteoporosis.

TI  - Fine-tuning large language models for domain adaptation: exploration of training strategies, scaling, model merging and synergistic capabilities
T2  - NPJ COMPUTATIONAL MATERIALS
LA  - English
AB  - The advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) for domain applications in fields such as materials science and engineering depends on the development of fine-tuning strategies that adapt models for specialized, technical capabilities. In this work, we explore the effects of Continued Pretraining (CPT), Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), and various preference-based optimization approaches, including Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) and Odds Ratio Preference Optimization (ORPO), on fine-tuned LLM performance. Our analysis shows how these strategies influence model outcomes and reveals that the merging of multiple fine-tuned models can lead to the emergence of capabilities that surpass the individual contributions of the parent models. We find that model merging is not merely a process of aggregation, but a transformative method that can drive substantial advancements in model capabilities characterized by highly nonlinear interactions between model parameters, resulting in new functionalities that neither parent model could achieve alone, leading to improved performance in domain-specific assessments. We study critical factors that influence the success of model merging, such as the diversity between parent models and the fine-tuning techniques employed. The insights underscore the potential of strategic model merging to unlock novel capabilities in LLMs, offering an effective tool for advancing AI systems to meet complex challenges. Experiments with different model architectures are presented, including the Llama 3.1 8B and Mistral 7B family of models, where similar behaviors are observed. Exploring whether the results hold also for much smaller models, we use a tiny LLM with 1.7 billion parameters and show that very small LLMs do not necessarily feature emergent capabilities under model merging, suggesting that model scaling may be a key component. In open-ended yet consistent chat conversations between a human and AI models, our assessment reveals detailed insights into how different model variants perform, and shows that the smallest model achieves a high intelligence score across key criteria including reasoning depth, creativity, clarity, and quantitative precision. Other experiments include the development of image generation prompts that seek to reason over disparate biological material design concepts, to create new microstructures, architectural concepts, and urban design based on biological materials-inspired construction principles. We conclude with a series of questions about scaling and emergence that could be addressed in future research.

AB  - Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) offer a potent and effective alternative for treatment of antibiotic resistant microbes. Mastoparans or mastoparan like peptides are the most abundant peptides reported in vespid/social wasp venoms with potent antimicrobial activity. Polybia MP-1 is an amphipathic tetradecapeptide isolated from the venom of the vespid wasp Polybia paulista with potent antimicrobial activity and high selectivity for bacterial membranes. In the present study, the antimicrobial activity of Polybia MP-1 was evaluated against antibiotic resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolated from mastitic cow milk samples. The isolates (n = 20) were obtained from mastitic milk samples and screened for sensitivity to antibiotics (Amikacin, Ciprofloxacin, Gentamycin, Imipenem, Ceftazidime, Colistin, Ceftriaxone and Aztreonam) by disc diffusion assay. The isolates were also characterized for the presence of different genes (n = 27) by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). These genes encoded for virulence factors, biofilm formation and antibiotic resistance. A correlation study was carried out to establish the significance of presence of antibiotic resistant genes i.e. bla(TEM), bla(CTX-M), bla(SHV) and bla(OXA) and resistance against different antibiotics for the bacterial isolates. Out of twenty, 7 isolates were found to be multiple drug resistant (MDR). We determined the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of synthetic peptide, Polybia MP-1 against P. aeruginosa (ATCC 27853) and it was found to be 75 mu M (124 mu g/mL) whereas its minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) was found to be 150 mu M (2 X MIC). The Polybia MP-1 was able to effectively inhibit the growth of 5 out of 7 (71 %) MDR isolates at 6 X MIC (450 mu M). The Polybia MP-1 was highly membrane selective and hence showed very low to moderate haemolytic activity against cattle, buffalo and goat red blood cells (RBCs). It further showed potent anti-biofilm activity against P. aeruginosa ATCC 27853 at 8 X MIC (600 mu M). Thus, synthetic Polybia MP-1 has potent antimicrobial activity against antibiotic resistant P. aeruginosa and can be explored as an alternative to antibiotics for the management of disease conditions like mastitis in cattle.

AB  - A paradigm in the plant defence literature is that defending against herbivores comes at a cost to growth, resulting in a growth-defence trade-off. However, while there is strong evidence for growth-defence trade-offs across species, evidence is mixed within species.
   Several mechanisms can account for this equivocal support within species, but teasing them apart requires examining growth-defence relationships both within and among populations, an approach seldom employed.
   We examined correlations between plant biomass (growth) and terpene production (defence) within and among populations of Monarda fistulosa, a perennial herb. We sampled populations from Montana and Wisconsin, regions that differ in resource availability characterized by different summer precipitation and associated abiotic conditions that influence plant productivity.
   We found negative, neutral and positive growth-defence correlations, depending on the scale examined. Negative correlations occurred across populations originating from divergent regions, positive correlations occurred across populations originating from within the high-resource region and neutral correlations were found within single populations.
   Collectively, these results challenge the general expectation of ubiquitous trade-offs and support emerging views that resource availability (as it affects productivity) shapes the evolution of defence at different scales.

AB  - The nutritional value of larvae of the rhinoceros beetle, Oryctes sp., a popular delicacy and source of animal feed in western Kenya is unknown. This study aimed to determine the nutritional composition of Oryctes sp. larvae consumed in western Kenya and compare the nutrient values across four sampling counties i.e. Busia, Bungoma, Trans Nzoia and Kakamega. The hypotheses tested were: (1) the beetle larvae were rich in nutrients including moisture, crude protein, crude fibre, crude fat, carbohydrates, minerals, flavonoids and vitamins; and (2) these nutrient values were not affected by the county of collection of the samples. The nutritional values of triplicates of larval samples collected from the four counties were analysed using standard chemical procedures and compared using one-way analysis of variance. The larvae contained approximately 18, 42, 2, 1, and 19% moisture, crude protein, crude fibre, crude fat and carbohydrates on dry matter basis, respectively. Nine minerals namely magnesium, iron, zinc, calcium, copper, aluminium, cobalt, manganese and sodium were detected in the larvae at approximately 493, 26, 14, 267, 3, 14, 1, 9 and 221 mg/100 g, respectively. Furthermore, appreciable levels of flavonoids and vitamins A, E, nicotinic acid, nicotinamide, B2, B5, B6 and B9 were recorded in the larvae. The nutritional composition of the larvae was unique in each county, thereby providing opportunity to use insects from different sites for specific nutritional needs of consumers. The nutrient contents of the larvae were comparable or superior to that of conventional food sources. The larvae were particularly richer in flavonoids than most conventional foods which are currently relied upon as sources of dietary flavonoids. The beetle larvae are therefore vital in fighting malnutrition.

AB  - Unlike the majority of marine mammal species, Hawaiian monk seals (Neomonachus schauinslandi) and West Indian manatees (Trichechus manatus latirostris) reside exclusively in tropical or subtropical waters. Although potentially providing an energetic benefit through reduced maintenance and thermal costs, little is known about the cascading effects that may alter energy expenditure during activity, dive responses and overall energy budgets for these warm-water species. To examine this, we used open-flow respirometry to measure the energy expended during resting and swimming in both species. We found that the average resting metabolic rates (RMRs) for both the adult monk seal (753.8 +/- 26.1 kJ h(-1), mean +/- s.e.m.) and manatees (887.7 +/- 19.5 kJ h(-1)) were lower than predicted for cold-water marine mammal species of similar body mass. Despite these relatively low RMRs, both total cost per stroke and total cost of transport (COTTOT) during submerged swimming were similar to predictions for comparably sized marine mammals (adult monk seal: cost per stroke=5.0 +/- 0.2 J kg(-1) stroke(-1), COTTOT =1.7 +/- 0.1 J kg(-1) m(-1); manatees: cost per stroke=2.0 +/- 0.4 J kg(-1) stroke(-1),COTTOT =0.87 +/- 0.17 J kg(-1) m(-1)). These lower maintenance costs result in less variability in adjustable metabolic costs that occur during submergence for warm-water species. However, these reduced maintenance costs do not appear to confer an advantage in overall energetic costs during activity, potentially limiting the capacity of warm-water species to respond to anthropogenic or environmental threats that require increased energy expenditure.

AB  - Bell pepper crops can face combined abiotic (water deficit) and biotic (herbivory) stresses during development. The use of silicon (Si) has gained importance in improving crop resistance to various stressors. Four experiments were conducted to study how the application of Si sources [silicon with potassium (KSi), silicon with phosphorus and calcium (P-CaSi), or basic silicon (BSi)] and application methods [foliar (F), drench (D), and combined (F + D)] ameliorated the effects of herbivory (Poliphagotarsonemus latus and Bemisia tabaci) and water deficit on the physiology and growth of bell pepper plants. In all experiments, the Nathalie hybrid was grown in 10 kg plastic pots filled with sandy clay loam soil. In the first experiment, plants were soil drenched with three different Si sources at three different rates (0, 5, or 10 mL<middle dot>L-1). In general, Si promoted plant growth and diminished arthropod infestation when the Si application rate was increased. The second experiment showed that any Si application method (F, D, or F + D) improved bell pepper physiology and resulted in fewer individual pest arthropods. In the third and fourth experiments, water deficit regimes caused lower stomatal conductance and plant growth; however, they did not enhance pest arthropod attack in bell pepper. With respect to KSi application, plant physiology was improved under abiotic stress conditions. These findings indicate that utilizing any silicon source can serve as a supplementary method to enhance plant development and decrease the occurrence of pest arthropods in bell pepper crops, especially during periods of water scarcity.

AB  - Ticks of the genus Dermacentor Koch, 1844 (Acari: Ixodidae) are poorly known systematically due to their habitation in harsh topographic environments and high mountains. Dermacentor ticks are diversely distributed in the Palearctic, Nearctic, and Oriental regions. There is no available information on the occurrence of Dermacentor marginatus in Pakistan; thus, the current investigation aimed the first morphological and molecular confirmation of this species and associated Anaplasma marginale and Rickettsia raoultii. Ticks were collected from goats (Capra hircus) and morphologically identified. Genomic DNA was extracted from 18/26 (69.23%) tick specimens, including 11 males and 7 females (1 unfed and 6 fed females). Extracted DNA was subjected to PCR for the amplification of genetic markers like 16S rDNA and cox1 for ticks, 16S rDNA for Anaplasma spp., and gltA and ompB for Rickettsia spp. A total of 26 D. marginatus ticks composed of 19 males (73.07%) and 7 females (26.9%) [1 (3.84%) unfed and 6 (23.07%) fed females] were collected from goats. According to amplicons via BLAST analysis, the 16S rDNA sequence showed 97.28-98.85% identity and the cox1 sequence showed 95.82-98.03% identity with D. marginatus. Additionally, the 16S rDNA sequence for Anaplasma sp. was detected in D. marginatus that showed 100% identity with Anaplasma marginale. Rickettsial gltA and ompB sequences for Rickettsia sp. showed 100% identity with Rickettsia raoultii. In phylogenetic analysis, ticks' 16S rDNA and cox1 sequences clustered with the same species. In phylogenetic analysis, A. marginale based on 16 rDNA clustered with A. marginale, while gltA and ompB sequences clustered with R. raoultii. This is the first study on the genetic characterization of D. marginatus and associated A. marginale and R. raoultii in Pakistan. The northern areas of Pakistan, which need to be explored in terms of ticks and associated pathogens due to their zoonotic threats, have been neglected due to the inaccessible climatic conditions.

AB  - Phosphorus (P) recovery from wastewater through biochar is an alternative to build a sustainable circular economy and save non-renewable P reservoirs. The efficiency of cations in removing P from wastewater under different pyrolysis conditions is still lacking. We aimed at studying P adsorption and release from biochar enriched with Al3+ and Mg2+, prepared under air-limited and N-2-flow pyrolysis conditions. Biochar samples were produced from pig manure (PMB) and impregnated, separately, with 20% of AlCl3 and MgCl2 solutions on both pyrolysis conditions. The materials were characterized for pH, electrical conductivity (EC), total nutrient content, ash, specific surface area (SSA), pore-volume, FTIR, XRD, and SEM-EDX. Phosphorus adsorption was studied by kinetics and adsorption isotherms, as well as desorption. The biochar impregnated with Mg2+ and produced in the muffle furnace achieved the maximum P adsorption (231 mg g(-1)), and 100% of the adsorbed P was released in solutions of Mehlich-1 and citric acid 2%. The pyrolysis conditions had a small or no influence on the biochar properties governing P adsorption, such as chemical functional groups, surface area, quantity and size of pores, and formation of synthetic minerals. Therefore, it is possible to produce biochar without using N-2 as a carrier gas when it comes to P adsorption studies. Mechanisms of P removal comprise precipitation with cations, surface complexation, ligand exchange reactions, and electrostatic attraction on the biochar surface. Overall, Mg-impregnated biochar is a suitable matrix to remove P from aqueous media and to add value to organic residues while producing an environmentally friendly material for reuse in soils.

AB  - The cyst nematodes, subfamily Heteroderinae, are plant pathogens of worldwide economic significance. A new cyst nematode of the genus Heterodera within the Heteroderinae, Heterodera camelliae n. sp., was isolated from roots and rhizospheric soil of tea plants in Guizhou province, China. The new species was characterized by having the cyst lemon-shaped with distinct neck and vulval cone, length x width = 435 (373-516) x 361 (301-441) mu m, bifenestrate fenestration, fenestral length of 47.9 (36.3-58.7) mu m, fenestral width of 22.6 (17.1-30.0) mu m, vulval slit 31.7 (27.7-35.5) mu m, underbridge absent or weak, bullae absent; second stage juvenile with body 362 (335-376) mu m long, with well-developed stylet of 22.4 (21.3-23.7) mu m and basal knobs concave anteriorly, lateral field areolated with four incisures, tail 43.4 (38.6-53.4) mu m long, hyaline region 18.4 (12.8-22.3) mu m long and shorter than stylet. The new species was close to H. ripae in the Humuli group base on morphology and morphometrics. Phylogenetic relationships within populations and species of Heterodera are given based on the analysis of the ITS-rRNA, 28S-rRNA D2-D3 region and the partial COI gene sequences herein. The phylogenetic trees showed that the new species clustered with Humuli group species but with separate species status. A key to the species of Humuli group and groups of the genus Heterodera is also provided in this study.

AB  - A short peptide termed NEMO-binding domain (NBD) peptide has an inhibitory effect on nuclear factor kappa-B (NF-kappa B). Despite its efficacy in inhibiting inflammatory responses, the precise neuroprotective mechanisms of NBD peptide in spinal cord injury (SCI) remain unclear. This study aims to determine whether the pyroptosis-related aspects involved in the neuroprotective effects of NBD peptide post-SCI.Using RNA sequencing, the molecular mechanisms of NBD peptide in SCI are explored. The evaluation of functional recovery is performed using the Basso mouse scale, Nissl staining, footprint analysis, Masson's trichrome staining, and HE staining. Western blotting, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays, and immunofluorescence assays are used to examine pyroptosis, autophagy, lysosomal membrane permeabilization (LMP), acid sphingomyelinase (ASMase), and the NF-kappa B/p38-MAPK related signaling pathway.NBD peptide mitigated glial scar formation, reduced motor neuron death, and enhanced functional recovery in SCI mice. Additionally, NBD peptide inhibits pyroptosis, ameliorate LMP-induced autophagy flux disorder in neuron post-SCI. Mechanistically, NBD peptide alleviates LMP and subsequently enhances autophagy by inhibiting ASMase through the NF-kappa B/p38-MAPK/Elk-1/Egr-1 signaling cascade, thereby mitigating neuronal death. NBD peptide contributes to functional restoration by suppressing ASMase-mediated LMP and autophagy depression, and inhibiting pyroptosis in neuron following SCI, which may have potential clinical application value.
   Spinal cord injury (SCI) is a serious and potentially fatal disease, but there is currently no effective treatment for SCI. The current study shows that NBD peptide contributes to functional restoration by suppressing ASMase-mediated LMP and autophagy depression, and inhibiting pyroptosis in neuron following SCI. These findings indicate that NBD peptide may have potential clinical application value. image

AB  - Biogas slurry has the problems of having a low concentration, having a large production volume, and containing many small-molecule organic pollutants. During the fertigation process of biogas slurry, many small-molecule organic pollutants may pose potential pollution risks to groundwater. In this study, the ultrafiltration membrane technology was used to separate small-molecule organics in the biogas slurry to prepare ultrafiltration concentrated biogas slurry (UCBS). To research the impact of UCBS and raw biogas slurry (RBS) on the small molecule organic pollution of groundwater, a laboratory soil column simulation leaching device was used to conduct leaching experiments with 4 types of UCBS and RBS in acric ferralsols and hydragric anthrosols for two quarters (8 fertilization periods). The results of the study show that both UCBS and RBS caused nitrate pollution to groundwater. UCBS has a lower risk of organic pollution to groundwater than RBS. Irrigating UCBS in hydragric anthrosols has a higher risk of organic pollution of groundwater than that in acric ferralsols. Analysis of the molecular weight distribution of dissolved organic matter (DOM) in the leaching solution showed that the organic pollutants were mainly small molecules <10 kDa. According to 3D excitation-emission matrix (3D-EEM) analysis, the main organic pollutants in the leaching solution were fulvic acid, microbial protein metabolites and humic acid organic compounds. The research results show that the pretreatment of biogas slurry by ultrafiltra-tion can reduce the risk of small-molecule organic pollution of groundwater in land application, which can provide a new scientific basis to standardize biogas slurry land application technical guidelines and reduce groundwater pollution.

AB  - Tea trichomes synthesize numerous specialized metabolites to protect plants from environmental stresses and contribute to tea flavours, but little is known about the regulation of trichome development. Here, we showed that CsMYB1 is involved in the regulation of trichome formation and galloylated cis-catechins biosynthesis in tea plants. The variations in CsMYB1 expression levels are closely correlated with trichome indexes and galloylated cis-catechins contents in tea plant populations. Genome resequencing showed that CsMYB1 may be selected in modern tea cultivars, since a 192-bp insertion in CsMYB1 promoter was found exclusively in modern tea cultivars but not in the glabrous wild tea Camellia taliensis. Several enhancers in the 192-bp insertion increased CsMYB1 transcription in modern tea cultivars that coincided with their higher galloylated cis-catechins contents and trichome indexes. Biochemical analyses and transgenic data showed that CsMYB1 interacted with CsGL3 and CsWD40 and formed a MYB-bHLH-WD40 (MBW) transcriptional complex to activate the trichome regulator genes CsGL2 and CsCPC, and the galloylated cis-catechins biosynthesis genes anthocyanidin reductase and serine carboxypeptidase-like 1A. CsMYB1 integratively regulated trichome formation and galloylated cis-catechins biosynthesis. Results suggest that CsMYB1, trichome and galloylated cis-catechins are coincidently selected during tea domestication by harsh environments for improved adaption and by breeders for better tea flavours.

AB  - The expansion of agricultural activities led to the need for the intensive use of pesticides, which allowed large-scale food production. Worldwide reports of intoxication and deleterious effects on humans and livestock animals have raised the need to better understand the effects of pesticides. The species Sus scrofa domesticus, in addition to being a livestock species, is also considered an excellent translational animal model for research. We analyzed the effects of the fungicide Captan on the cartilage of the growth plate after oral subchronic exposure. Captan was added to the animals' food at a concentration of 500 mg/kg of food, and this was administered for a period of 7 weeks. Our results showed that even without macroscopic damage, several foci of fibrosis, chondrocyte necrosis, and tissue disorganization were observed. These types of damage highlight the risk arising from exposure to this fungicide for the normal development of long bones, suggesting that the indiscriminate use of Captan represents real risks for humans and animals.

AB  - Characterized by the gradual loss of physiological integrity, impaired function, and increased susceptibility to death, aging is considered the primary risk factor for major human diseases, such as cancer, diabetes, cardiovascular disorders, and neurodegenerative diseases. The time-dependent accumulation of cellular damage is widely considered the general cause of aging. While the mechanism of normal aging is still unresolved, researchers have identified different markers of aging, including genomic instability, telomere attrition, epigenetic alterations, loss of proteostasis, deregulated nutrient-sensing, mitochondrial dysfunction, cellular senescence, stem cell exhaustion, and altered intercellular communication. Theories of aging can be divided into two categories: (1) aging is a genetically programmed process, and (2) aging is a random process caused by gradual damage to the organism over time as a result of its vital activities. Aging affects the entire human body, and aging of the brain is undoubtedly different from all other organs, as neurons are highly differentiated postmitotic cells, and the lifespan of most neurons in the postnatal period is equal to the lifespan of the brain. In this chapter, we discuss the conserved mechanisms of aging that may underlie the changes observed in the aging brain, with a focus on mitochondrial function and oxidative stress, autophagy and protein turnover, insulin/IGF signaling, target of rapamycin (TOR) signaling, and sirtuin function.

AB  - Queen-worker caste dimorphism is a typical trait for honeybees (Apis mellifera). We previously showed a maternal effect on caste differentiation and queen development, where queens emerged from queen-cell eggs (QE) had higher quality than queens developed from worker cell eggs (WE). In this study, newly-emerged queens were reared from QE, WE, and 2-day worker larvae (2L). The thorax size and DNA methylation levels of queens were measured. We found that queens emerging from QE had significantly larger thorax length and width than WE and 2L. Epigenetic analysis showed that QE/2L comparison had the most different methylated genes (DMGs, 612) followed by WE/2L (473), and QE/WE (371). Interestingly, a great number of DMGs (42) were in genes belonging to mTOR, MAPK, Wnt, Notch, Hedgehog, FoxO, and Hippo signaling pathways that are involved in regulating caste differentiation, reproduction and longevity. This study proved that honeybee maternal effect causes epigenetic alteration regulating caste differentiation and queen development.

AB  - Studies have shown that exposure to either microplastics (MPs) or di-(2-ethylhexyl) phthalic acid (DEHP) alone can cause neurotoxicity in animals, but it remains uncertain whether and to what extent co-exposure to these two substances, which often occur together in reality, can also induce neurotoxicity. This study aimed to investigate the neurotoxicity and molecular mechanisms of combined exposure to DEHP and polypropylene microplastics (synthetic PP-MPs were used), the microplastics most commonly encountered by young children, in immature mice. The results showed that exposure to PP-MPs and/or DEHP did cause neurotoxic effects in immature mice, including induction of neurocognitive and memory deficits, damage to the CA3 region of the hippocampus, increased oxidative stress, and decreased AChE activity in the brain. The severity of the neurotoxicity increased with increasing concentrations of PP-MPs, combined exposure to PP-MPs and DEHP exhibited additive or syn-ergistic effects. Transcriptomic analyses revealed that the PP-MPs and/or DEHP exposure altered the expression profiles of gene clusters involved in the stress response, and in protein processing in endoplasmic reticulum. Quantitative analyses further indicated that PP-MPs and/or DEHP exposure inhibited the activity of the heat shock response mediated by heat shock transcription factor 1, while chronically activated the unfolded protein response, consequently inducing neurotoxicity through neuronal apoptosis and neuroinflammation in the immature mice. As a pioneer study to highlight the neurotoxicity induced by combined exposure to PP-MPs and DEHP in immature mice, this research provides new insights into mitigating the health risks of PP-MPs and DEHP exposure in young children.

AB  - The role of the TAAR1 receptor, one of the trace amine-associated receptors (TAARs) family, in the formation of the behavioral component of the stress response was studied. The behavior of female TAAR1 knockout (TAAR1 KO) mice and wild-type (WT) mice was investigated in tests of elevated plus maze and elevated zero maze (EPM and EZM) and forced swimming test (FST) under normal conditions and after uncontrolled restraint stress exposure for 30 min. In the EPM test, the initial level of locomotor and exploratory activity, as well as the anxiety, was identical in both groups of mice. In the EZM test, the initial indicators of anxiety in female TAAR1 KO mice compared to female WT mice were higher, and locomotor activity was lower. When testing mice in the EZM 30 minutes after the end of stress exposure, it was found that the anxiety in female WT mice sharply increased, and the indicators of locomotor activity and exploratory behavior significantly decreased. The behavioral indicators in the EZM test in TAAR1 KO mice before and after stress were identical. A pronounced behavioral component of the stress response was observed in both TAAR1 KO and WT mice during testing in EPM. There were no significant differences between TAAR1 KO and WT mice during testing in EPM four hours after stress exposure. In the FST test the latency to the first immobility was initially longer in TAAR1 KO mice compared to the WT mice, but 24 hours after the stress this indicator has significantly decreased. As a result, TAAR1 KO and WT mice no longer differed in all behavioral indicators in the FST. Three weeks after acute restraint stress, both TAAR1 KO and WT groups showed a significant increase in immobility duration and a decrease in latency to the first immobility, however no difference between the both groups of animals were found. Thereby, we found the complete absence of behavioral change immediately after stressor exposure in TAAR1 KO compared to the WT mice.

AB  - Ketogenic diets and medium-chain triglycerides are gaining attention as treatment of neurological disorders. Their major metabolites, beta-hydroxybutyrate (beta HB) and the medium-chain fatty acids (MCFAs) octanoic acid (C8) and decanoic acid (C10), are auxiliary brain fuels. To which extent these fuels compete for metabolism in different brain cell types is unknown. Here, we used acutely isolated mouse cerebral cortical slices to (1) compare metabolism of 200 mu M [U-C-13]C8, [U-C-13]C10 and [U-C-13]beta HB and (2) assess potential competition between metabolism of beta HB and MCFAs by quantifying metabolite C-13 enrichment using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) analysis. The C-13 enrichment in most metabolites was similar with [U-C-13]C8 and [U-C-13]C10 as substrates, but several fold lower with [U-C-13]beta HB. The C-13 enrichment in glutamate was in a similar range for all three substrates, whereas the C-13 enrichments in citrate and glutamine were markedly higher with both [U-C-13]C8 and [U-C-13]C10 compared with [U-C-13]beta HB. As citrate and glutamine are indicators of astrocytic metabolism, the results indicate active MCFA metabolism in astrocytes, while beta HB is metabolized in a different cellular compartment. In competition experiments, C-12-beta HB altered C-13 incorporation from [U-C-13]C8 and [U-C-13]C10 in only a few instances, while C-12-C8 and C-12-C10 only further decreased the low [U-C-13]beta HB-derived C-13 incorporation into citrate and glutamine, signifying little competition for oxidative metabolism between beta HB and the MCFAs. Overall, the data demonstrate that beta HB and MCFAs are supplementary fuels in different cellular compartments in the brain without notable competition. Thus, the use of medium-chain triglycerides in ketogenic diets is likely to be beneficial in conditions with carbon and energy shortages in both astrocytes and neurons, such as GLUT1 deficiency.

AB  - Camellia oleifera Abel. (C. oleifera), one of the four woody oil-producing plants in the world produces edible oils with high percentage of unsaturated fatty acid content in seeds. The mature C. oleifera seeds continue to undergo a series of physiological changes after harvest. To this end, the dynamic changes in nutrients, oil content, fatty acid composition, and endogenous hormone content in C. oleifera seeds under different natural drying times after harvest were investigated. The content of soluble sugar and soluble protein of C. oleifera seeds increased with the extension of natural drying, especially soluble sugar content increased nearly 2-fold at 30 d after post-harvest natural drying compared with that of the control group. The content of oil reached a peak (23.6%) at 30 d after post-harvest natural drying. During the post-harvest natural drying process, the relative content of palmitic acid and oleic acid increased, while the relative content of palmitic acid and linoleic acid decreased. Furthermore, the levels of unsaturated fatty acids (oleic acid, linoleic acid, linolenic acid, and arachidonic acid) increased significantly with increasing natural drying time. The overall trend of endogenous hormones SA, SL, and ACC concentrations increased with the post-harvest natural drying process. Furthermore, the concentration of SA, SL, and ACC were positively correlated with oil content. Altogether, post-harvest natural drying for 30 days significantly promoted the anabolism of oil and improved the quality of C. oleifera seeds. These findings provide a scientific basis for reasonable post-harvest treatment to improve Camellia oil yield.

AB  - Compared with atmospheric bulk/wet deposition, dry deposition has lacked evaluation for a long time. A new method was used to determine and evaluate the atmospheric potentially toxic elements (PTEs) dry deposition at the urban site (US) and the rural site (RS) from early 2019 to February 2022 in Shenyang, China. The dry deposition fluxes of most PTEs were greater at the US than the RS (p < 0.01), with the exception of those of Cd and Pb. We also found that atmospheric Cr dry deposition was more severe in Shenyang with respect to the global scale, especially in the urban area (36.29 mg/(m(2)& sdot;yr)). Based on the principal component analysis and correlation analysis, Cd and Pb in the urban area originated from transportation, whereas Ni, Cu, Cr and Zn originated from natural processes and other anthropogenic activities that could produce airborne dust. Additionally, Cd and Pb at the RS came from road traffic, Cr, Cu and Zn originated from other human activities, and Ni was mostly of natural origin. According to the predictions based on the potential risk assessment model, the contamination risk for PTEs in the surface soils of development land under the influence of atmospheric deposition would be low in the long term, but the risk for Cd in agricultural land warrants more attention because it was predicted to exceed the risk screening value within 3 years. Furthermore, atmospheric deposition and the application of pig manure could lead to a rapid increase in the Cd concentration in experimental fields.

AB  - Polystyrene microplastics (PS-MPs) have emerged as a concerning pollutant in modern society due to their widespread production and usage. Despite ongoing research efforts, the impact of PS-MPs on mammalian behavior and the mechanisms driving these effects remain incompletely elucidated. Consequently, effective strategies for prevention have yet to be developed. To fill these gaps, C57BL/6 mice were orally administered with 5 & mu;m PS-MPs for 28 consecutive days in this study. The open-field test and the elevated plus-maze test were performed to evaluate the anxiety-like behavior, 16S rRNA sequencing and untargeted metabolomics analysis were used to detect the changes of gut microbiota and serum metabolites. Our results indicated that PS-MPs exposure activated hippocampal inflammation and induced anxiety-like behavior in mice. Meanwhile, PS-MPs disturbed the gut microbiota, impaired the intestinal barrier, and aroused peripheral inflammation. Specifically, PS-MPs increased the abundance of pathogenic microbiota Tuzzerella, while lowered the abundance of probiotics Faecalibaculum and Akkermansia. Interestingly, eliminating the gut microbiota protected against the deleterious effects of PS-MPs on intestinal barrier integrity, reduced the levels of peripheral inflammatory cytokines, and ameliorated anxiety-like behavior. Additionally, green tea's primary bioactive constituent, epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG), optimized gut microbial composition, improved intestinal barrier function, reduced peripheral inflammation, and exerted anti-anxiety effects by inhibiting the hippocampal TLR4/MyD88/NF-& kappa;B signaling cascade. EGCG also remodeled serum metabolism, especially modulated purine metabolism. These findings suggested that gut microbiota participates in PS-MPs-induced anxiety-like behavior by modulating the gut-brain axis, and that EGCG could serve as a potential preventive strategy.

AB  - Macroautophagy/autophagy is a cellular and energy homeostatic mechanism that contributes to maintain the number of primordial follicles, germ cell survival, and anti-ovarian aging. However, it remains unknown whether autophagy in granulosa cells affects oocyte maturation. Here, we show a clear tendency of reduced autophagy level in human granulosa cells from women of advanced maternal age, implying a potential negative correlation between autophagy levels and oocyte quality. We therefore established a co-culture system and show that either pharmacological inhibition or genetic ablation of autophagy in granulosa cells negatively affect oocyte quality and fertilization ability. Moreover, our metabolomics analysis indicates that the adverse impact of autophagy impairment on oocyte quality is mediated by downregulated citrate levels, while exogenous supplementation of citrate can significantly restore the oocyte maturation. Mechanistically, we found that ACLY (ATP citrate lyase), which is a crucial enzyme catalyzing the cleavage of citrate, was preferentially associated with K63-linked ubiquitin chains and recognized by the autophagy receptor protein SQSTM1/p62 for selective autophagic degradation. In human follicles, the autophagy level in granulosa cells was downregulated with maternal aging, accompanied by decreased citrate in the follicular fluid, implying a potential correlation between citrate metabolism and oocyte quality. We also show that elevated citrate levels in porcine follicular fluid promote oocyte maturation. Collectively, our data reveal that autophagy in granulosa cells is a beneficial mechanism to maintain a certain degree of citrate by selectively targeting ACLY during oocyte maturation.

AB  - Aim: The peripheral tumor growth is accompanied by the accumulation of inflammatory mediators in the blood that can negatively influence blood-brain barrier function and neuronal structure and develop the cancer-associated depression. The aim of the study was to evaluate the neurobiological effects of lithium on hepato-cellular carcinoma mice model.Methods: In this study we analyzed the locomotor activity of lithium-treated tumor-bearing mice using the Phenomaster instrument. Inductively coupled plasma mass-spectral analysis was used to determine lithium levels in blood, brain, liver, kidneys, tumors and muscle tissues. The prefrontal cortex neurons ultrastructure was assessed by transmission electron microscopy. Expression of BDNF, GRP78, EEA1, LAMP1, and LC3 beta in neurons was determined by immunohistochemical analysis.Results: A decrease in locomotor activity was found in animals with tumors. At the same time, the low expression levels of the neurotrophic factor BDNF and early endosomal marker EEA1 were revealed, as well as the decreased amount of synaptic vesicles and synapses was shown. Signs of endoplasmic reticulum stress and autophagy development in neurons of animals with tumors were noted. Lithium carbonate administration had a corrective effect on animal's behavior and the prefrontal cortex neurons structure. Conclusions: In summary, lithium can restore the neuronal homeostasis in tumor-bearing mice.

AB  - A combined transcriptomic, metabolic, and dual expression analysis was used to discover the MYB transcription factor that regulates benzoxazinoid biosynthesis under biotic and abiotic stresses in wheat.
   Benzoxazinoids are specialized metabolites that are highly abundant in staple crops, such as maize and wheat. Although their biosynthesis has been studied for several decades, the regulatory mechanisms of the benzoxazinoid pathway remain unknown. Here, we report that the wheat transcription factor MYB31 functions as a regulator of benzoxazinoid biosynthesis genes. A transcriptomic analysis of tetraploid wheat (Triticum turgidum) tissue revealed the up-regulation of two TtMYB31 homoeologous genes upon aphid and caterpillar feeding. TaMYB31 gene silencing in the hexaploid wheat Triticum aestivum significantly reduced benzoxazinoid metabolite levels and led to susceptibility to herbivores. Thus, aphid progeny production, caterpillar body weight gain, and spider mite oviposition significantly increased in TaMYB31-silenced plants. A comprehensive transcriptomic analysis of hexaploid wheat revealed that the TaMYB31 gene is co-expressed with the target benzoxazinoid-encoded Bx genes under several biotic and environmental conditions. Therefore, we analyzed the effect of abiotic stresses on benzoxazinoid levels and discovered a strong accumulation of these compounds in the leaves. The results of a dual fluorescence assay indicated that TaMYB31 binds to the Bx1 and Bx4 gene promoters, thereby activating the transcription of genes involved in the benzoxazinoid pathway. Our finding is the first report of the transcriptional regulation mechanism of the benzoxazinoid pathway in wheat.

AB  - Influenza virus causes approximately 291,000 to 646,000 human deaths worldwide annually. It is also a disease of zoonotic importance, affecting animals such as pigs, horses, and birds. Even though vaccination is being used to prevent influenza virus infection, there are limited options available to treat the disease. Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) are RNA molecules with more than 200 nucleotides that do not translate into proteins. They play important roles in the physiological and pathological processes. In this study, we identified a novel transcript, Lnc-PINK1-2:5 that was upregulated by influenza virus. This lncRNA was predominantly located in the nucleus and was not affected by type I interferons. Overexpression of Lnc-PINK1-2:5 reduced the influenza viral mRNA and protein levels in cells as well as titres in culture media. Knockdown of Lnc-PINK1-2:5 using CRISPR interference enhanced the virus replication. Antiviral activity of Lnc-PINK1-2:5 was independent of influenza virus strains. RNA sequencing analysis revealed that Lnc-PINK1-2:5 upregulated thioredoxin interacting protein (TXNIP) during influenza virus infection. Overexpression of TXNIP reduced influenza virus infection, suggesting that TXNIP is an antiviral gene. Knockdown of TXNIP abolished the Lnc-PINK1-2:5-mediated increase in influenza virus infection. In conclusion, the newly identified Lnc-PINK1-2:5 isoform is an anti-influenza lncRNA acting through the upregulation of TXNIP gene expression.

AB  - Simple Summary: To explore a safe and effective way to potentiate the systemic immunity of animals against infectious diseases in an economical way, the interleukin-7 (IL-7) gene of Tibetan pig was utilized to construct a recombinant eukaryotic plasmid. We first detected the bioactivity of expressed IL-7 on porcine lymphocytes in vitro and then encapsulated the IL-7 gene with different chitosan (CS) and its two modified derivatives, CS-PEG-PEI and CS-PEG-GAL nanoparticles. Then, we injected mice intramuscularly or intraperitoneally with various nanoparticles containing the IL-7 gene to evaluate their immune effects in vivo. We observed a significant increase in neutralizing antibodies and specific IgG levels in response to the rabies vaccine in the treated mice compared to the controls. Treated mice also manifested elevated leukocytes, CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, and mRNA levels of toll-like receptors (TLR1/4/6/9), IL-1, IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-7, IL-23, and transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta). Notably, the recombinant IL-7 gene encapsulated in CS-PEG-PEI provoked the best increases of immunoglobulins, CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, TLRs, and cytokines in the blood of the mice, implying that chitosan-PEG-PEI can become a promising carrier for in vivo IL-7 gene expression to enhance the innate and adaptive immunity for the prevention of animal diseases.
   To investigate a safe and effective approach for enhancing the in vivo expression of recombinant genes and improving the systemic immunity of animals against infectious diseases, we employed the interleukin-7 (IL-7) gene from Tibetan pigs to construct a recombinant eukaryotic plasmid (VRTPIL-7). We first examined VRTPIL-7's bioactivity on porcine lymphocytes in vitro and then encapsulated it with polyethylenimine (PEI), chitosan copolymer (CS), PEG-modified galactosylated chitosan (CS-PEG-GAL) and methoxy poly (ethylene glycol) (PEG) and PEI-modified CS (CS-PEG-PEI) nanoparticles using the ionotropic gelation technique. Next, we intramuscularly or intraperitoneally injected mice with various nanoparticles containing VRTPIL-7 to evaluate their immunoregulatory effects in vivo. We observed a significant increase in neutralizing antibodies and specific IgG levels in response to the rabies vaccine in the treated mice compared to the controls. Treated mice also exhibited increased leukocytes, CD8+ and CD4+ T lymphocytes, and elevated mRNA levels of toll-like receptors (TLR1/4/6/9), IL-1, IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-7, IL-23, and transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta). Notably, the recombinant IL-7 gene encapsulated in CS-PEG-PEI induced the highest levels of immunoglobulins, CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, TLRs, and cytokines in the mice's blood, suggesting that chitosan-PEG-PEI may be a promising carrier for in vivo IL-7 gene expression and enhanced innate and adaptive immunity for the prevention of animal diseases.

AB  - Temporal lobe epilepsy is a severe disorder of the central nervous system associated with an imbalance of excitation and inhibition in the brain, manifested by recurrent seizures. Approximately 30% of patients with epilepsy are pharmacoresistant, meaning that existing antiepileptic drugs can not completely control the seizures. One approach to treating refractory epilepsy is to surgically remove the seizure foci, usually located in the temporal cortex, hippocampus, or amygdala. This permits sustained remission in approximately 60-75% of cases. The study of morphological and functional features of neuronal networks in epileptic foci of patients with refractory temporal lobe epilepsy is necessary to understand the mechanisms of pathogenesis of this disease and to develop new approaches to its treatment. This study analyzed the electrophysiological properties of temporal cortex neurons obtained during surgical removal of epileptic foci in children with refractory temporal lobe epilepsy. The biophysical membrane properties of the neurons in brain slices were investigated using the patch-clamp method. We compared them with the properties of pyramidal neurons of the rat cortex. We found that human neurons are characterized by much higher excitability than rat neurons. They generate action potentials in response to minimal depolarization and maintain a high frequency of discharges. At the same time, they are characterized by a high membrane input resistance. The identified biophysical characteristics of neurons may underlie the pathological process leading to the generation of pharmacoresistant seizures in children with temporal lobe epilepsy.

AB  - Simple Summary Siberian musk deer (Moschus moschiferus L.) populations and their habitat decreased significantly over the past decades due to unsustainable, long-term hunting and deforestation. To support the species' conservation, we assessed its potential distribution, conservation priority areas, core patch fragmentation, and potential connectivity corridors in Northeast China. We concluded that large areas of a high-quality M. moschiferus habitat with low fragmentation and low human influence remain in the northern Greater Khingan Mountains. In contrast, a habitat in the Lesser Khingan Mountains and the Changbai Mountains was highly fragmented and highly influenced by human activity. The Greater Khingan Mountains offer a suitable habitat for the recovery of M. moschiferus populations in Northeast China. These findings offer recommendations to support the Chinese government's goal of establishing protected area systems with national parks in Northeast China. Species conservation actions are guided by available information on the biogeography of the protected species. In this study, we integrated the occurrence data of Siberian musk deer (Moschus moschiferus L.) collected from 2019 to 2021 with species distribution models to estimate the species' potential distribution in Northeast China. We then identified conservation priority areas using a core-area zonation algorithm. In addition, we analyzed core patch fragmentation using FRAGSTATS. Lastly, we identified potential connectivity corridors and constructed a potential protection network based on the least-cost path and the circuit theory. The results showed concentrations of M. moschiferus in the northern Greater Khingan Mountains, the southeastern Lesser Khingan Mountains, and the eastern Changbai Mountains, with a potential distribution area of 127,442.14 km(2). Conservation priority areas included 41 core patches with an area of 106,306.43 km(2). Patch fragmentation mainly occurred in the Changbai Mountains and the Lesser Khingan Mountains. We constructed an ecological network composed of 41 core patches and 69 linkages for M. moschiferus in Northeast China. The results suggest that the Greater Khingan Mountains represent the most suitable area to maintain the stability of M. moschiferus populations in Northeast China. Considering the high habitat quality requirements of M. moschiferus and its endangered status, we propose that the Chinese government accelerates the construction of the Greater Khingan Mountains National Park and the Lesser Khingan Mountains National Park and enlarges the Northeast China Tiger and Leopard National Park to address the fragmentation of protected areas and the habitat of M. moschiferus.

AB  - No single microbial source tracking (MST) marker can be applied to determine the sources of fecal pollution in all water types. This study aimed to validate a high-throughput quantitative polymerase chain reaction (HT-qPCR) method for the simultaneous detection of multiple MST markers. A total of 26 fecal-source samples that had been previously collected from human sewage (n = 6) and ruminant (n = 3), dog (n = 6), pig (n = 6), chicken (n = 3), and duck (n = 2) feces in the Kathmandu Valley, Nepal, were used to validate 10 host-specific MST markers, i.e., Bacteroidales (BacHum, gyrB, BacR, and Pig2Bac), mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) (swine, bovine, and DogmtDNA), and viral (human adenovirus, porcine adenovirus, and chicken/turkey parvovirus) markers, via HTqPCR. Only Dog-mtDNA showed 100 % accuracy. All the tested bacterial markers showed a sensitivity of 100 %. Nine of the 10 markers were further used to identify fecal contamination in groundwater sources (n = 54), tanker filling stations (n = 14), drinking water treatment plants (n = 5), and river water samples (n = 6). The human-specific Bacteroidales marker BacHum and ruminant-specific Bacteroidales marker BacR was detected at a high ratio in river water samples (83 % and 100 %, respectively). The results of HT-qPCR were in agreement with the standard qPCR. The comparable performances of HT-qPCR and standard qPCR as well as the successful detection of MST markers in the fecal -source and water samples demonstrated the potential applicability of these markers for detecting fecal contamination sources via HT-qPCR.

AB  - Residual feed intake (RFI) gained attention as a potential alternative to the feed conversion ratio (FCR). Thus, this study aimed to estimate genetic parameters for different feed efficiency (FE) traits (FCR, RFI1 to RFI5) and their genetic correlation to on-test daily weight gain (ADG), backfat (BFT), loin muscle area (LMA), lean percentage (LP), and total feed intake (FI) for 603 Male Duroc (DD), 295 Landrace (LL), and 341 Yorkshire (YY). The common spatial pen effect was also estimated in these traits. Five RFI measures were estimated by regressing daily feed intake on initial testing age (ITA), initial testing weight (IBW), and ADG for RFI1; other models were the same as RFI1 except for additional BFT for RFI2; LMA for RFI3; BFT and LMA for RFI4; BFT, LMA, and average metabolic body weight (AMBW) instead of IBW for RFI5. Genetic parameters estimated using two animal models and the REML method showed moderate heritability for FCR in all breeds (0.22 and 0.28 for DD, 0.31 and 0.39 for LL, 0.17 and 0.22 for YY), low heritability for the majority of RFI measures in DD (0.15 to 0.23) and YY (0.14 to 0.20) and moderate heritability for all RFI measures in LL (0.31 to 0.34). Pen variance explained 7% to 22% for FE and 0% to 9% for production traits' phenotypic variance. The genetic correlation revealed that selection against less complex RFI1 in DD and LL and RFI2 in YY would bring the most advantageous reduction to FI (0.71 for DD, 0.49 for LL, 0.43 YY) without affecting ADG in all breeds (0.06 for DD, -0.11 for LL, 0.05 for YY), decrease in BFT, and increase in LP in DD (0.51 in BFT, -0.77 in LP) and LL (0.45 in BFT, -0.83 in LP). Therefore, inclusion of these breed-specific RFI measures in the future selection criteria would help improve feed efficiency in the swine industry.

AB  - Ammonia (NH3) is a harmful gas in livestock houses. So far, many researchers have demonstrated that NH3 is detrimental to animal and human organs. Selenium (Se) is one of the essential trace elements in the body and has a good antioxidant effect. However, there was little conclusive evidence that Se alleviated NH3 poisoning. To investigate the toxic mechanism of NH3 on pig spleen and the antagonistic effect of L-selenomethionine, a porcine NH3-poisoning model and an L-selenomethionine intervention model were established in this study. Our results showed that NH3 exposure increased the apoptosis rate, while L-selenomethionine supplementation alleviated the process of excessive apoptosis. Immunofluorescence staining, real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR), and western blot results confirmed that exposure to NH3 changed the expression levels of interleukin family factors, apoptosis, death receptor, and oxidative stress factors. Our study further confirmed that excessive NH3 induced inflammatory response and mediated necroptosis leading to cell apoptosis by activating the Nrf2 signaling pathway. Excessive NH3 could mediate spleen injury through oxidative stress-induced mitochondrial dynamics disorder. L-Selenomethionine could alleviate inflammation and abnormal apoptosis by inhibiting the IL-17/TNF-alpha/FADD axis. Our study would pave the way for comparative medicine and environmental toxicology.

AB  - Ionic liquid (IL) electrolytes and carbon nanotube (CNT) electrodes have exhibited promising electrochemical performance in supercapacitors. Nevertheless, the adaptability of tricationic ILs (TILs) in CNT-based supercapacitors remains unknown. Herein, the performance of supercapacitors with (6,6), (8,8), (12,12), and (15,15) CNT electrodes in the TIL [C6(mim)3](Tf2N)3 was assessed via molecular dynamics simu-lations, paying attention to the electric double-layer (EDL) structures and the relations between the CNT curvature and capacitance. The results disclose that counterion and co-ion number densities near CNT electrodes have a marked reduction, compared with that of the graphene electrode. The capacitance of the EDL in the TIL increases significantly as the CNT curvature increases and the capacitance of the TIL/CNT systems is higher than that of the TIL/graphene system. Moreover, different EDL structures in the TIL and the monocationic IL (MIL) [C6mim][Tf2N] near CNT electrodes were revealed, showing higher-concentration anions [Tf2N]- at the CNT surfaces in the TIL. It is also verified that the TIL has a greater energy-storage ability under high potentials. Furthermore, the almost flat or weakly camel-like capacitance-voltage (C-V) curve of EDLs in the TIL turns into a bell shape in the MIL, because of the ion accumulation at the CNT surfaces and the associations between ions.

AB  - Background Trisomy of human chromosome 21 (Hsa21) results in a constellation of features known as Down syndrome (DS), the most common genetic form of intellectual disability. Hsa21 is orthologous to three regions in the mouse genome on mouse chromosome 16 (Mmu16), Mmu17 and Mmu10. We investigated genotype-phenotype relationships by assessing the contribution of these three regions to memory function and age-dependent cognitive decline, using three mouse models of DS, Dp1Tyb, Dp(17)3Yey, Dp(10)2Yey, that carry an extra copy of the Hsa21-orthologues on Mmu16, Mmu17 and Mmu10, respectively.Hypothesis Prior research on cognitive function in DS mouse models has largely focused on models with an extra copy of the Mmu16 region and relatively little is known about the effects of increased copy number on Mmu17 and Mmu10 on cognition and how this interacts with the effects of aging. As aging is is a critical contributor to cognitive and psychiatric changes in DS, we hypothesised that ageing would differentially impact memory function in Dp1Tyb, Dp(17)3Yey, and Dp(10)2Yey, models of DS.Methods Young (12-13 months and old (18-20 months mice Dp1Tyb, Dp(17)3Yey and Dp(10)2Yey mice were tested on a battery of object recognition memory test that assessed object novelty detection, novel location detection and associative object-in place memory. Following behavioral testing, hippocampal and frontal cortical tissue was analysed for expression of glutamatergic receptor proteins using standard immunoblot techniques.Results Young (12-13 months and old (18-20 months mice Dp1Tyb, Dp(17)3Yey and Dp(10)2Yey mice were tested on a battery of object recognition memory test that assessed object novelty detection, novel location detection and associative object-in place memory. Following behavioral testing, hippocampal and frontal cortical tissue was analysed for expression of glutamatergic receptor proteins using standard immunoblot techniques.Conclusion Our results show that distinct Hsa21-orthologous regions contribute differentially to cognitive dysfunction in DS mouse models and that aging interacts with triplication of Hsa21-orthologous genes on Mmu10.

AB  - Plants use a variety of secondary metabolites to defend themselves against herbivore insects. Methyl salicylate (MeSA) is a natural plant-derived compound that has been used as a plant defence elicitor and a herbivore repellent on several crop plants. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of MeSA treatment of Brassica rapa subsp. chinensis ('Hanakan' pak choi) on its interactions with peach potato aphids, Myzus persicae, and their natural enemy, Diaeretiella rapae. For this, we selected two concentrations of MeSA (75 mg/L and 100 mg/L). Our results showed that aphid performance was significantly reduced on plants treated with MeSA (100 mg/L). In a cage bioassay, the MeSA (100 mg/L)-treated plants showed lower adult survival and larviposition. Similarly, the MeSA (100 mg/L)-treated plants had a significantly lower aphid settlement in a settlement bioassay. In contrast, the M. persicae aphids did not show any significant difference between the MeSA (75 mg/L)-treated and control plants. In a parasitoid foraging bioassay, the parasitoid D. rapae also did not show any significant difference in the time spent on MeSA-treated and control plants. A volatile analysis showed that the MeSA treatment induced a significant change in volatile emissions, as high numbers of volatile compounds were detected from the MeSA-treated plants. Our results showed that MeSA has potential to induce defence in Brassica against M. persicae and can be utilised in developing sustainable approaches for the management of peach potato aphids.

AB  - The members of the fourth subgroup of R2R3-MYB (Sg4 members) are well-known inhibitors of phenylpropanoid and lignin synthesis pathways. The C2 domain is closely related to the transcriptional inhibitory activity of Sg4 members. Phosphorylation modification enhances the transcriptional inhibitory activity of Sg4 members. Here, we identified a phosphorylation site on the C2 domain of CsMYB4a from tea plants (Camellia sinensis). A mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), named CsMPK3-2, phosphorylated this site on the C2 domain of CsMYB4a. Further experiments revealed that phosphorylation of CsMYB4a weakened its ability to inhibit the gene expression of PAL, C4H, and 4CL in the phenylpropanoid pathway and activated the expression of transcription factor YABBY5, maintaining the adaxial-abaxial polarity of the leaf. Knocking out NtYAB5 in CsMYB4a transgenic tobacco partially repaired the leaf wrinkling phenotype caused by CsMYB4a. The C1 domain exhibited an activation function when the C2 domain of CsMYB4a was phosphorylated by CsMPK3-2, causing this reversal phenomenon. These results enrich our understanding of the regulatory diversity of Sg4 members.

AB  - Cryopreservation of goat spermatozoa is challenging due to several factors, including one of the most essential, i.e., oxidative stress. It is particularly essential in goat semen due to its scanty ejaculate volume and high sperm concentration. This leaves a narrow sperm-to-seminal plasma ratio owing to marginal antioxidant support; moreover, semen extension further dilutes the antioxidant level, leading to an imbalance of oxidant-antioxidant equilibrium. The present study aimed to evaluate the effect of quercetin on curtailing oxidative stress and its reflection on the post-thaw survivability and membrane integrity of goat spermatozoa. For this study, six bucks were selected. Six ejaculates from each buck totaling 36 ejaculates were collected, which were then split into five parts; furthermore, each part was added with a semen extender having a particular concentration of additive. Group C without quercetin and T-1 containing Vitamin E at 3 mmol/mL were considered the control and positive control respectively, whereas T-2, T-3, and T-4 contain 10, 20, and 30 mu mol/mL of Quercetin respectively. The final sperm concentration of each group was kept at 200 x 10(6) spermatozoa/mL. All groups were subjected to equilibration at 4 degrees C for 4 h, then filled in French mini (0.25 mL) straws, followed by sealing and cryopreservation. Samples after 72 h of cryopreservation were subjected to evaluation of plasma membrane integrity and viability through staining, acrosomal integrity, and mitochondrial membrane activity through flow cytometry. Evaluation of sperm kinematics as well as the oxidant-antioxidant status of sperm (ROS and nitric oxide) and seminal plasma (SOD, CAT, GPx, FRAP, and lipid peroxidation through MDA estimation) were also carried out. Quercetin, when supplemented at 20 mu mol/mL in buck semen extender, significantly (p < 0.01) improved cryopreserved sperm functions in terms of plasma membrane integrity, viability, acrosomal integrity, mitochondrial membrane activity, and sperm kinematics of buck semen. Similarly, Quercetin supplementation at 20 mu mol/mL significantly reduced reactive oxygen and nitrogen species (RONS) in sperm and improved the antioxidant status of seminal plasma, which was indicated by reduced oxidative damage and improved the antioxidant status of buck semen. In conclusion, Quercetin at 20 mu mol/mL reduced oxidative stress, improved semen antioxidant status, and improved sperm membranes integrity and kinematics.

AB  - Exposure to early life stress (ELS) is associated with a variety of detrimental psychological and neurodevelopmental effects. Importantly, ELS has been associated with regional alterations and aberrant connectivity in the structure and functioning of brain regions involved in emotion processing and self-regulation, creating vulnerability to mental health problems. However, longitudinal research regarding the impact of ELS on functional connectivity between brain regions in the default mode network (DMN) and fronto-limbic network (FLN), both implicated in emotion-related processes, is relatively scarce. Neuroimaging research on ELS has mostly focused on single nodes or bi-nodal connectivity instead of functional networks. We examined how ELS is associated with connectivity patterns within the DMN and FLN during rest in early adulthood. The participants (n = 86; 47 females) in the current functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study were young adults (18-21 years old) whose families had participated in a longitudinal study since pregnancy. ELS was assessed both prospectively (parental reports of family relationship problems and mental health problems during pregnancy and infancy) and retrospectively (self-reported adverse childhood experiences). Inter-subject representational similarity analysis (IS-RSA) and multivariate distance matrix regression (MDMR) were used to analyze the association between ELS and the chosen networks. The IS-RSA results suggested that prospective ELS was associated with complex alterations within the DMN, and that retrospective ELS was associated with alterations in the FLN. MDMR results, in turn, suggested that that retrospective ELS was associated with DMN connectivity. Mean connectivity of the DMN was also associated with retrospective ELS. Analyses further showed that ELS-related alterations in the FLN were associated with increased connectivity between the prefrontal and limbic regions, and between different prefrontal regions. These results suggest that exposure to ELS in infancy might have long-lasting influences on functional brain connectivity that persist until early adulthood. Our results also speak for the importance of differentiating prospective and retrospective assessment methods to understand the specific neurodevelopmental effects of ELS.

AB  - Over 30% of the Chinese tea plantation is supplied with excess fertilizer, especially nitrogen (N) fertilizer. Whether or not foliar N application on tea plants at the dormancy stage could improve the quality of spring tea and be a complementary strategy to reduce soil fertilization level remains unclear. In this study, the effects of foliar N application on tea plants were investigated by testing the types of fertilizers and their application times, and by applying foliar N under a reduced soil fertilization level using field and N-15-labeling pot experiments. Results showed that the foliar N application of amino acid liquid fertilizer two times at the winter dormancy stage was enough to significantly increase the N concentration of the mature leaves and improved the quality of spring tea. The foliar application of 2% urea or liquid amino acid fertilizer two times at the winter dormancy stage and two times at the spring dormancy stage showed the best performance in tea plants among the other foliar N fertilization methods, as it reduced the soil fertilization levels in tea plantations without decreasing the total N concentration of the mature leaves or deteriorating the quality of spring tea. Therefore, foliar N application on tea plants at its dormancy stage increases the N concentration of the mature leaves, improves the quality and yield of spring tea, and could be a complementary strategy to reduce soil fertilization levels.</p>

AB  - Gibberellins (GAs) play important roles in regulating reproductive development, especially flower development. However, the regulation of GA metabolism and GA signaling component genes of flower bud development in Camellia oleifera is not entirely understood. In this study, 6-year-old C. oleifera 'Huashuo' was used as the experimental material. Exogenous GA3 and GA biosynthesis inhibitors, chlormequat chloride (CCC) and uniconazole (UCZ), were applied to investigate the flower development, levels of GA3, GA metabolism, and the expression of genes involved in GA signaling across the different treatments. Our results demonstrate that exogenous GA3 promoted flower bud growth and accelerated blooming, with the rate of petaloid-anther transformation reaching up to 64.11% during the peak blooming period. Cytological analysis showed that the anthers in the GA3-treated flowers exhibited abnormal longitudinal elongation 30 days after spraying, and gradually developed into petaloid anthers. KEGG analysis revealed that the GA3 treatment regulated the plant hormone signal transduction. The genes encoding DELLA protein accounted for the largest proportion (52.45%) of the gibberellin signal transduction pathway DEGs. GA3 enhanced gibberellin content by regulating the gibberellin biosynthesis gene CoGA20ox1 during early flower development, and GID1 also showed a significant response to GAs. Additionally, the expression of genes associated with flower development (FT, LFY, SOC1, SVP) and those involved in petaloid-anther (MADS-box family members AP1, AGL8) exhibited significant differences. These results elucidated the regulatory effects of gibberellins and their inhibitors on anther development via the GA pathway in C. oleifera, which provides a foundation for further investigation into the mechanism of flower development.

AB  - Feed is very important for fish farming. The appropriate composition and proportion of feed ingredients can promote the growth of fish, maintain normal physiology and behavior, and even improve the resistance ability to disease and stress, etc. The core of artificial compound feed (ACF) is the composition and proportion of lipid, protein, and carbohydrate, which are also the main nutritional components required by fish. Appropriate levels and ratios can promote fish growth and save costs, and the improper would affect the biological clock systems of fish, leading to metabolic abnormalities. This study explored the preparation of ACF for H. kuda. The composition and proportion of the three main nutrients in ACF were screened based on the synchronicity between six pairs of clock genes (Clock, Bmal1, Per1, Per2, Per3, Cry1, and Cry2) in the central and peripheral clock systems, as well as the expression of eight lipid-metabolism genes (Hmgcr, Mvk, Mvd, Lss, Fdps, Cetp, Scap, Srebp1, Srebp2) in the liver and their synergy with liver clock genes. The results showed that, based on several parameters such as gene expression cycle, relative expression level, and top phase appearance time, the best synergy between the central and peripheral circadian clock systems was observed in ACF with crude fat content of 8.80%, crude protein content more than 38.4%, and carbohydrate content of 23.5%. Based on the expression relationship between lipid metabolism genes and circadian clock genes in the liver, it was further clarified that the optimal levels of fat, protein, and carbohydrate were determined with 8.80%, 38.4%, and 23.5%, respectively. After 4 weeks of breeding validation, compared with frozen Mysis, the screened ACF fed for H. kuda showed significant advantages in body length specific growth rate (SGRL), body weight specific growth rate (SGRW), and feed conversion rate (FCR).

AB  - Three digestate utilization scenarios for bio-fertilizer production are evaluated with life cycle assessment. The aim is to determine the environmental performance of the digestate post-treatment with the goal to decrease the loss of nitrogen and phosphorus, support circular nutrient management, and increase the substitution of mineral fertilizers. The functional unit (FU) of the study is the utilization of 1 kg dry matter rawdigestate, in three scenario designs. Scenario 1 (S1) describes a system where the raw digestate is directly spread on soil. In scenario 2 (S2) the raw digestate is processed by centrifugation with two recovered phases (liquid and solid digestate), which are spread on agricultural soil. In scenario 3 (S3) a more advanced post-treatment system is modelled, where the raw digestate is phase separated with centrifugation followed by drying of the solid digestate and further processing of the liquid digestate with a membrane filtration and a reverse osmosis unit. The studied scenarios show a global warming potential ranging from -0.14 (S3) to -0.36 (S1) kg CO2 eq per FU. The fossil resource depletion per FU was decreased in scenario 1 (-0.053 kg oil eq) and scenario 2 (-0.049 kg oil eq) but increased in scenario 3 (0.002 kg oil eq). The terrestrial acidification potential ranges from 0.09 (S3) to 0.18 (S1) kg SO2 per FU. The digestate post-treatment is a sustainable solution able to tackle the problem of excess nutrients and their management in agricultural areas. It could replace conventional nitrogen removal processes (aerobic biological treatment) by a valorization chain keeping the nutrients in closed loop.

AB  - The societal consensus on the need for smoking cessation is well-established, yet the number of tobacco users continues to rise. This trend is largely driven by the potent physiological effects of nicotine, which significantly increase the likelihood of tobacco use initiation. Certain compounds found in everyday foods, such as theobromine and caffeine in cocoa products, also exhibit psychostimulatory properties. However, comprehensive studies on the effects of consuming these compounds in the context of tobacco use are limited. This study investigates the role of theobromine, a primary active component in cocoa, in modulating the positive physiological effects of nicotine and explores the underlying mechanisms. Our findings reveal that while low doses of theobromine do not alter nicotine's addictive properties, they amplify its positive physiological effects. Notably, theobromine's impact on nicotine varies significantly between the hippocampus and cerebellum, highlighting region-specific interactions.

AB  - It is shown that the highest antimicrobial activity (100%) against strains of Kl. pneumonia and St. pneumonia of strains causing pneumonia occurs when using protein-like fractions (AMP) obtained from CL after cultivation of LAB of strains of the genus Enterococcus isolated from fermented milk of goats and donkeys, and the lowest activity of AMP from CL of strains isolated from fermented milk of cows (20-50%). It was shown that the isolated polysaccharides of strains of the genus Enterococcus, which have antimicrobial activity, consist of glucose and galactose molecules. The difference in the effectiveness of the influence of polysaccharides depends on the source of the isolated pathogens, depends on the concentration of the polysaccharide, the genus and species of the strain causing pneumonia. It is concluded that some metabiotics of the Enterococcus genus are promising for use as bioinhibitors of the growth of pathogenic bacteria.

AB  - The binding mode to TAP (i.e., the peptide transporter associated with antigen processing) from a viral peptide thus far has been unknown in the field of antiviral immunity, but an interfering mode from a virus-encoded TAP inhibitor has been well documented with respect to blocking the TAP function. In the current study, we predicted the structure of the pig TAP transporter and its inhibition complex by the small viral protein ICP47 of the herpes simplex virus (HSV) encoded by the TAP inhibitor to exploit inhibition of the TAP transporter as the host's immune evasion strategy. We found that the hot spots (residues Leu5, Tyr22, and Leu51) on the ICP47 inhibitor interface tended to prevail over the favored Leu and Tyr, which contributed to significant functional binding at the C-termini recognition principle of the TAP. We further characterized the specificity determinants of the peptide transporter from the pig TAP by the ICP47 inhibitor effects and multidrug TmrAB transporter from the Thermus thermophillus and its immunity regarding its structural homolog of the pig TAP. The specialized structure-function relationship from the pig TAP exporter could provide insight into substrate specificity of the unique immunological properties from the host organism. The TAP disarming capacity from all five viral inhibitors (i.e., the five virus-encoded TAP inhibitors of ICP47, UL49.5, U6, BNLF2a, and CPXV012 proteins) was linked to the infiltration of the TAP functional structure in an unstable conformation and the mounting susceptibility caused by the host's TAP polymorphism. It is anticipated that the functional characterization of the pig TAP transporter based on the pig genomic variants will lead to additional insights into the genotype and single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in relation to antiviral resistance and disease susceptibility.

AB  - Lipids provide essential fatty acids necessary for proper fish growth and maintenance of crucial functions. The fatty acid profile of the dietary lipids effects the smell, taste, and fatty acid profile of the final product which is of high consumer concern. The omega-3 fatty acids, docosahexaenoic acid (DHA; 22:6n-3) and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA; 20:5n-3), are of primary concern as they provide significant health benefits such as reducing inflammation and improving heart and health function. However, the DHA; 22:6n-3 and EPA; 20:5n-3 available for aquaculture feeds is primarily provided by fish oil which is already limited in availability and expensive, and dietary lipids are consistently being replaced with oil sourced from plants. To identify the physiological mechanisms responsible for the conversion of dietary plant lipids and deposition of the omega-3 fatty acids DHA; 22:6n-3 and EPA; 20:5n-3 in rainbow trout, families obtained from three generations of trait selection were evaluated. After screening 450 fish from 30 families for relative EPA +DHA levels, thirty-six fish were selected based on individual and family performance and separated into low, average, and high-performance groups (12 fish per group). The high performing group averaged 8.86 % for EPA+DHA muscle fatty acid ratios, the average group was 6.33 %, and the low performing group was 4.84 %. Transcriptomic and proteomic analysis of liver and muscle tissue was used to evaluate differences between these groups to identify potential mechanisms responsible for the trait. No genes or proteins were identified in the muscle that were linked to lipid synthesis or deposition. However, while in the liver a few genes with notable association to lipid synthesis were detected across individual group comparisons, there were no potential proteins linked to lipid processing that were found to be significantly upregulated in fish across all comparisons that presented with increased EPA and DHA muscle values. However, protein fatty acid binding protein levels were found to change significantly and in a corresponding manner between all treatment groups and could be used as a selective marker for genetic improvement of lipid bioconversion and storage.

AB  - Impaired synaptic plasticity is a hallmark of a number of neurological disorders successfully reproduced in animal models. Short-term forms of plasticity provide dynamic regulation of synaptic efficacy in response to various patterns of neuronal activity and largely depend on maintaining optimal conditions of the neuronal microenvironment, the key regulator of which is the blood-brain barrier (BBB). In recent years, the BBB has been considered an active participant in central nervous system homeostasis, and its dysfunction is recognized as a trigger for many neurological pathologies. We have developed an in vitro protocol that mimics the early consequences of BBB dysfunction by adapting the ionic composition of the incubation solution to blood plasma with the addition of thrombin. In the present study, we analyzed short-term synaptic plasticity in the hippocampal CA3-to-CA1 networks during the early phase following modeled BBB breakdown. Data obtained reveals significant alterations in short-term synaptic plasticity in the hippocampus under conditions of BBB dysfunction. We observed enhanced paired-pulse facilitation (PPF) at interstimulus intervals of 25 and 50 ms, suggesting a presynaptic locus for the changes in neurotransmitter release. Furthermore, a significant increase in the amplitude of post-tetanic potentiation (PTP) was recorded, indicating an increased reactivity of the CA3-to-CA1 neural networks. The selective enhancement of the early, activity-dependent phase of plasticity following high-frequency stimulation, in the absence of changes in the overall temporal dynamics, suggests a specific modulation of pattern-dependent short-term plasticity in BBB pathology. Induction of seizure-like activity of hippocampal neural networks has previously been demonstrated under identical conditions. Therefore, the present study characterizes specific alterations in synaptic properties due pathological condition formation that may ultimately lead to long-term consequences.

AB  - Depression is a neuropsychiatric disorder with a high impact on the worldwide population. To overcome depression, antidepressant drugs are the first line of treatment. However, pre-clinical studies have pointed out that antidepressants are not entirely efficacious and that the quality of the living environment after stress cessation may play a relevant role in increasing their efficacy. As it is unknown whether a short daily exposure to environmental enrichment during chronic stress and antidepressant treatment will be more effective than just the pharmacological treatment, this study analyzed the effects of fluoxetine, environmental enrichment, and their combination on depressive-associated behavior. Additionally, we investigated hippocampal neurogenesis in mice exposed to chronic mild stress. Our results indicate that fluoxetine reversed anhedonia. Besides, fluoxetine reversed the decrement of some events of the hippocampal neurogenic process caused by chronic mild stress. Conversely, short daily exposure to environmental enrichment changed the deterioration of the coat and anhedonia. Although, this environmental intervention did not produce significant changes in the neurogenic process affected by chronic mild stress, fluoxetine plus environmental enrichment showed similar effects to those caused by environmental enrichment to reverse depressive-like behaviors. Like fluoxetine, the combination reversed the declining number of Ki67, doublecortin, calretinin cells and mature newborn neurons. Finally, this study suggests that short daily exposure to environmental enrichment improves the effects of fluoxetine to reverse the deterioration of the coat and anhedonia in chronically stressed mice. In addition, the combination of fluoxetine with environmental enrichment produces more significant effects than those caused by fluoxetine alone on some events of the neurogenic process. Thus, environmental enrichment improves the benefits of pharmacological treatment by mechanisms that need to be clarified.</p>

AB  - The physiological state of overwintering tea leaves is crucial for the growth and quality formation of spring tea shoots. Low temperatures in winter can easily cause damage to overwintering tea plants, leading to leaf chlorosis and abnormal physiological functions. Many pieces of research have shown that shading could promote chlorophyll (Chl) accumulation in tea leaves, but the impact on overwintering tea plants is not yet known. In this study, different shading rates (no-shading, S0%; 30% shading, S30%; 75% shading, S75%) were used to treat overwintering tea plants, which explored the effect of shading on the color and physiological functions of tea leaves. The results showed that Chl, carotenoid, and soluble sugar (SS) contents were S75% > S30% > S0%, and the net photosynthetic rate (Pn) was S75% > S30% > S0%. Transcriptome analysis showed that the genes involved in chlorophyll and carotenoid metabolism (such as protochlorophyllide reductase POR and zeaxanthin epoxidase ZEP) and photosynthesis (such as photosystem II P680 reaction center D2 protein PsbA and photosystem II CP47 chlorophyll apoprotein PsbB) were significantly up-regulated under shading. In addition, many differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were enriched in "starch and sucrose metabolism (ko00500)" and "anthocyanin biosynthesis (ko00942)" pathways. In summary, this study provided a theoretical basis and technical support for maintaining green leaves and normal physiological functions of overwintering tea plants.

AB  - Psychological stress affects the neuroendocrine regulation, which modulates mental status and behaviors. Melatonin, a hormone synthesized primarily by the pineal gland, regulates many brain functions, including circadian rhythms, pain, sleep, and mood. Selective pharmacological melatonin agonist ramelteon has been clinically used to treat mood and sleep disorders. Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a psychiatric condition associated with severe trauma; it is generally triggered by traumatic events, which lead to severe anxiety and uncontrollable trauma recall. We recently reported that repeated social defeat stress (RSDS) may induce robust anxiety-like behaviors and social avoidance in mice. In the present study, we investigated whether melatonin receptor activation by melatonin and ramelteon regulates RSDS-induced behavioral changes. Melatonin treatment improved social avoidance and anxiety-like behaviors in RSDS mice. Moreover, treatment of the nonselective MT1/MT2 receptor agonist, ramelteon, markedly ameliorated RSDS-induced social avoidance and anxiety-like behaviors. Moreover, activating melatonin receptors also balanced the expression of monoamine oxidases, glucocorticoid receptors, and endogenous antioxidants in the hippocampus. Taken together, our findings indicate that the activation of both melatonin and ramelteon regulates RSDS-induced anxiety-like behaviors and PTSD symptoms. The current study also showed that the regulatory effects of neuroendocrine mechanisms and cognitive behaviors on melatonin receptor activation in repeated social defeat stress.

AB  - This study aimed to investigate whether dietary fiber pectin can alleviate PM2.5-induced pulmonary inflamma-tion and the potential mechanism. PM2.5 samples were collected from a nursery pig house. The mice were divided into three groups: the control group, PM2.5 group and PM2.5 + pectin group. The mice in the PM2.5 group were intratracheally instilled with PM2.5 suspension twice a week for four consecutive weeks, and those in the PM2.5 + pectin group were subject to the same PM2.5 exposure, but fed with a basal diet supplemented with 5% pectin. The results showed that body weight and feed intake were not different among the treatments (p > 0.05). However, supplementation with pectin relieved PM2.5-induced pulmonary inflammation, presenting as slightly restored lung morphology, decreased mRNA expression levels of IL-1 & beta;, IL-6 and IL-17 in the lung, decreased MPO content in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BLAF), and even decreased protein levels of IL-1 & beta; and IL-6 in the serum (p < 0.05). Dietary pectin altered the composition of the intestinal microbiota, increasing the relative abundance of Bacteroidetes and decreasing the ratio of Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes. At the genus level, short-chain fatty acid (SCFA)-producing bacteria, such as Bacteroides, Anaerotruncus, Prevotella 2, Parabacteroides, Ruminococcus 2 and Butyricimonas, were enriched in the PM2.5 +pectin group. Accordingly, dietary pectin increased the concentra-tions of SCFAs, including acetate, propionate, butyrate and valerate, in mice. In conclusion, dietary fermentable fiber pectin can relieve PM2.5-induced pulmonary inflammation via alteration of intestinal microbiota compo-sition and SCFA production. This study provides a new insight into reducing the health risk associated with PM2.5 exposure.

AB  - The corpus luteum (CL) is a temporary endocrine structure in the female ovaries that develops cyclically in mature females during luteinization. This study aimed to determine the in vitro effects of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARy) ligands on the transcriptomic profile of the porcine CL in the mid-and late-luteal phase of the estrous cycle using RNA-seq technology. The CL slices were incu-bated in the presence of PPARy agonist -pioglitazone or antagonist -T0070907. We identified 40 differentially expressed genes after treatment with pioglitazone and 40 after treatment with T0070907 in the mid-luteal phase as well as 26 after pioglitazone and 29 after T0070907 treatment in the late-luteal phase of the estrous cycle. In addition, we detected differences in gene expression between the mid-and late-luteal phase without treatment (409 differentially expressed genes). This study revealed a number of novel candidate genes that may play a role in controlling the function of CL by regulating signaling pathways related to ovarian steroidogenesis, metabolic processes, cell differentiation, apoptosis, and immune responses. These findings become a basis for further studies to explain the mechanism of PPARy action in the reproductive system.(c) 2023 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Laying hen manure (LHM) is a major source of pollution due to its high nitrogen (N) and moisture content (MC). Therefore, reducing the MC of LHM is necessary to retain its recyclable value and reduce environmental pollution. One effective way is by incorporating sodium bentonite (SB) and wheat straw (WS) as amendments in the LHM. This work aimed to optimize the drying conditions of LHM and investigate the effect of SB and WS utilization on the dehydration rate, reduction of crude protein (CP), and reduction of ammonium-N (N H4+-N). The response surface methodology (RSM) was used to optimize these processes. For this purpose, two sets of experiments (drying of LHM with and without SB and Ws) were designed. The independent parameters were air temperature (70, 80, and 90 degrees C), air velocity (1, 1.5, and 2 m s-1), layer thickness (5, 10, and 15 mm), SB (2%, 4%, and 6%), and WS (3%, 7.5%, and 12%). The results indicated that temperature and WS had the most significant influence on all responses. To maximize the dehydration rate and minimize the reduction of CP and N H4+-N, the optimal conditions were a temperature of 78 degrees C, air velocity of 1 m s-1, and layer thickness of 5 mm in the first set of experiments, and a temperature of 80 degrees C, air velocity of 1.5 m s-1, layer thickness of 11 mm, 6% SB, and 12% WS in the second set of experiments. Under the optimum conditions, LHM treated with 6% SB and 12% WS retained 10% more CP and 58% more N H4+-N than untreated LHM. Therefore, according to the obtained results, SB and WS are recommended as additives to reduce the CP and N H4+-N losses of LHM during the drying process.

AB  - Increased humoral adaptive immune response in the low-fertility Suffolk breed at the luteal phase indicates unresolved inflammation in the cervix of Suffolk that may contribute to reduced cervical sperm transport in the subsequent follicular phase.
   Worldwide, cervical artificial insemination using frozen-thawed semen yields low pregnancy rates. The only exception to this is in Norway, where vaginal insemination with frozen-thawed semen yields pregnancy rates in excess of 60% and which has been attributed to the specific ewe breed used. Our previous work demonstrated differences in cervical gene expression at the follicular phase of the estrous cycle in ewe breeds with known differences in pregnancy rates. In this study, we characterized the cervical transcriptome of the same ewe breeds [Suffolk, Belclare, Fur, and Norwegian White Sheep (NWS)] during the luteal phase, as an optimal environment at the luteal phase could better prepare the cervix for sperm migration through the cervix at the subsequent follicular phase. High-quality RNA extracted from postmortem cervical tissue was analyzed by RNA sequencing. After stringent filtering, 1051, 1924, and 611 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were detected in the low-fertility Suffolk breed compared with Belclare, Fur, and NWS, respectively. Gene ontology analysis identified increased humoral adaptive immune response pathways in Suffolk. Increased expression of multiple immune genes supports the presence of an active immune response in the cervix of Suffolk ewes, which differentiates them significantly from the other three ewe breeds. Inflammatory pathways were upregulated in the Suffolk, resulting in higher expression of the potent pro-inflammatory cytokines. Therefore, higher levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines indicate unresolved inflammation in the cervix of the low-fertility Suffolk breed that could contribute to reduced cervical sperm transport in the next follicular phase.

AB  - The activity of the pituitary gland determines the success of female reproduction. The knowledge regarding the reproductive-status-related changes in the transcriptome of the porcine pituitary is limited. This study aimed to determine and compare the transcriptome profile of the pituitary gland collected from pigs during maternal recognition of pregnancy, i.e. on days 12-13 of pregnancy and during the respective days of the estrous cycle. Analysis indicated 482 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) with an FC > 1.5 (P < 0.05) in the pituitary of pregnant vs. estrous-cyclic pigs. Among them, 68 were up-regulated and 414 were down-regulated. The evaluated DEGs were annotated into 39 gene ontology (GO) biological process terms, 13 GO cellular component terms, and 10 GO molecular function terms. Among the evaluated DEGs were selected genes coding for proteins potentially involved in the regulation of early pregnancy in pigs and used for gene interaction analysis and validation of microarray results. An analysis of the relationships among DEGs in pituitaries collected during maternal recognition of pregnancy showed that some of them are connected with, for example, TGFb signaling pathway, PRL synthesis, adipocytokines pathway and immune response during maternal recognition of pregnancy. These findings expand the knowledge regarding the molecular mechanisms appearing in the porcine pituitary during the maternal recognition period of pregnancy. (c) 2022 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Temporal lobe epilepsy is characterized by the developmentof associated neurological and psychiatric disorders. Obviously,one of the possible reasons of such violations is a disturbancein the balance of the excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmittersystems of the hippocampus. Chronic abnormalities in the molecularmechanisms regulating of the hippocampal glutamatergic system activityin temporal lobe epilepsy are currently poorly understood. In thepresent study, we used Krushinsky-Molodkina (KM) rats subjectedto repeated audiogenic seizures to simulate temporal lobe epilepsy.Molecular mechanisms of regulation of glutamate production by hippocampal neuronswere analyzed one week after the end of medium-term (14 seizures)and long-term (21 seizures) kindling. In the hippocampus of KM rats,audiogenic kindling resulted in activation of ERK1/2 kinases andthe transcription factor CREB and increased expression of the transcription factor Fra1, glutaminase and the vesicular glutamate transporters VGLUT1and 2, key proteins responsible for glutamate production. Thesedata indicate increased activity of glutamatergic hippocampal neuronsthat persists for a week of rest after the end of the the last audiogenic stimulation.Moreover, our data demonstrated upregulation of mGluR1 glutamatereceptors, whose activation stimulates Ca2+ releaseand thus induces excitotoxicity. Long-term enhancement of the glutamatergictransmission induced by the repeated epileptiform seizures is notonly responsible for further epileptogenesis, but may also underliethe development of neurodegenerative complications.

TI  - Olanzapine add-on treatment promotes neuronal differentiation of neural stem cells compared with fluoxetine alone
T2  - BIOSCIENCE REPORTS
LA  - English
AB  - The addition of olanzapine to fluoxetine produces an antidepressant effect on fluoxetine nonresponders. Promoting hippocampal neurogenesis is associated with the successful treatment of depression. The present study aimed to investigate the interaction of olan-zapine and fluoxetine in regulating neurogenesis. We found that fluoxetine alone does not affect cell proliferation and inhibits the neuronal differentiation of cultured neural stem cells (NSCs), but promotes NSCs proliferation and exerts no effect on neuronal fate when NSCs are cocultured with neurons. In addition, fluoxetine alone also does not alter the neuronal fate of newborn hippocampal cells in vivo. Although fluoxetine treatment elicits different re-sults, our data consistently show that olanzapine alone does not affect the proliferation and neuronal differentiation of NSCs. The combination of olanzapine and fluoxetine has no pro-found effect on NSCs proliferation compared with fluoxetine alone, but olanzapine add-on treatment produces a greater number and percentage of differentiated neurons from NSCs. Further investigations are needed to explore the underlying mechanisms of the increased neurogenesis caused by the combination of olanzapine with fluoxetine.

AB  - Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1), one of the expression products of the proglucagon (pg) gene, is an incretin mainly secreted by the gastrointestinal system. In mammals, GLP-1 has hypoglycemic and food-inhibiting effects; while in some fish species, it has been confirmed to increase blood glucose by promoting gluconeogenesis and stimulating glycogenolysis. In order to more deeply understand the role of GLP-1 in the process of glycometabolism in herbivorous fish, the pg gene was cloned from Spinibarbus denticulatus to obtain its sequence characteristics, and the changes in blood glucose level and pg gene expression in S. denticulatus were further explored by feeding with three kinds of carbohydrates and intraperitoneal injection of GLP-1. Basal and temporal blood glucose levels and pg gene expression of S. denticulatus (91.68 +/- 10.79 g) were measured at 0, 1, 3, 5, 7, and 12 h after oral administration (n=4). Then, the changes of blood glucose levels and pg and glucokinase (gk) gene expressions of S. denticulatus (94.29 +/- 10.82 g) were determined at 0, 30, 60, and 120 min after intraperitoneal injection (n=4). It was shown that polysaccharides could induce the upregulation of pg gene expression faster than monosaccharides and stimulate the secretion of GLP-1 in the intestine. Intraperitoneal injection of GLP-1 peptide rapidly raised blood glucose levels, and pg gene expression in the anterior intestine, whole brain, and hepatopancreas decreased continuously after 30 minutes. These results showed that S. denticulatus might inhibit the excessive accumulation of blood glucose by reducing the expression of the pg gene and increasing the expression of gk gene in a short time. It was speculated that GLP-1 of S. denticulatus might have a "gut-brain-liver" pathway similar to mammals in glycemia regulation. Therefore, this study provided a novel perspective for explaining the functional differences of GLP-1 in herbivorous fish and mammals.

AB  - This study aimed to evaluate the influence of sodium monensin on the hepatic accumulation of copper in sheep. Twenty-four Santa Ines crossbred sheep were used and allocated in a 2 x 2 factorial experiment with six repetitions and considering the factors dietary copper (basal and high) and supplementation (with and without sodium monensin). Thus, four homogeneous groups were formed: control (basal diet); monensin (Mon), 30 ppm of monensin; copper (Cu), 10 10 mg/ kg BW per day of copper; monensin + copper (MonCu). The experimental period lasted 14 weeks. Liver and bile samples were collected at the beginning and end of the experiment to determine mineral element concentrations, and weekly blood samples for biochemical, hematological, and mineral evaluation. Liver copper concentrations at the beginning of the experiment did not vary between groups, while mean liver copper concentrations at the end of the experiment were higher in the MonCu, Cu, and Mon groups when compared to the control. At the end of the study, hepatic copper concentration was influenced by copper (p = 0.0001) and monensin ( p = 0.0003) supplementation. Copper-supplemented groups had reduced liver iron contents (p = 0.0287) and increased copper concentrations in bile. The biochemical evaluation showed increased serum GGT and AST activity (p < 0.05) in the Cu and MonCu groups from the eleventh week on compared to the control and Mon groups. The increase in activity of these enzymes was influenced by copper supplementation (p = 0.0340). Monensin interferes positively with the hepatic accumulation of copper and the supplementation of this additive may predispose sheep to copper poisoning.

AB  - Cornea is the major barrier to drug delivery to the eye, which results in low bioavailability and poor efficacy of topical eye treatment. In this work, we first select cornea-binding aptamers using tissue-SELEX on pig cornea. The top two abundant aptamers, Cornea-S1 and Cornea-S2, could bind to pig cornea, and their Kd values to human corneal epithelial cells (HCECs) were 361 and 174 n & mcy;, respectively. Aptamer-functionalized liposomes loaded with cyclosporine A (CsA) were developed as a treatment for dry eye diseases. The Kd of Cornea-S1- or Cornea-S2-functionalized liposomes reduces to 1.2 and 15.1 n & mcy;, respectively, due to polyvalent binding. In HCECs, Cornea-S1 or Cornea-S2 enhanced liposome uptake within 15 min and extended retention to 24 h. Aptamer CsA liposomes achieved similar anti-inflammatory and tight junction modulation effects with ten times less CsA than a free drug. In a rabbit dry eye disease model, Cornea-S1 CsA liposomes demonstrated equivalence in sustaining corneal integrity and tear break-up time when compared to commercial CsA eye drops while utilizing a lower dosage of CsA. The aptamers obtained from cornea-SELEX can serve as a general ligand for ocular drug delivery, suggesting a promising avenue for the treatment of various eye diseases and even other diseases.
   Using pig cornea as a target, aptamers were selected using the tissue-SELEX method. By attaching the aptamers to liposomes loaded with cyclosporin A, improved treatment of dry eye disease was achieved in vitro and in vivo. image

AB  - Dung beetles use excrement for feeding and reproductive purposes. Although they use a range of dung types, there have been several reports of dung beetles showing a preference for certain feces. However, exactly what determines dung preference in dung beetles remains controversial. In the present study, we investigated differences in dung beetle communities attracted to horse or cow dung from a functional diversity standpoint. Specifically, by examining 18 functional traits, we sought to understand if the dung beetle assembly process is mediated by particular traits in different dung types. Species specific dung preferences were recorded for eight species, two of which prefer horse dung and six of which prefer cow dung. Significant differences were found between the functional traits of the mouthparts of the dung beetles attracted to horse dung and those that were attracted to cow dung. Specifically, zygum development and the percentage of the molar area and the conjunctive area differed between horse and cow dung colonizing beetles. We propose that the quantitative differences in the mouthpart traits of the species attracted to horse and cow dung respectively could be related to the differential capacity of the beetles to filtrate and concentrate small particles from the dung. Hence, the dung preference of dung beetles could be related to their ability to exploit a specific dung type, which varies according to their mouthpart traits. Moreover, we found that larger and nester beetles preferred cow dung, whereas smaller and non-nester beetles preferred horse dung. This finding could be related to the tradeoff between fitness and parental investments, and to the suitability of the trophic resource according to the season and species phenology.

AB  - This study was conducted to evaluate the Al3+ tolerance of sixteen camelina genotypes and to use melatonin or nano-selenium to alleviate Al3+-induced stress. A Petri dish study indicated seedling root length was suitable for describing the dose-response of seedling growth with increased Al3+ concentrations. Based on GR(50) (Al3+ concentration causing a 50% reduction in the seedling root length), CamK6 (232.0 mg L-1) and CamK2 (97.0 mg L-1) were the most Al3+-tolerant and -sensitive genotypes, respectively. Under Al3+ stress, CamK6 and CamK2 treated by melatonin (50 mu M) or nano-Se (0.4 mg L-1) showed a similar plant height and seed yield plant(-1) (CamK6: 123.6 +/- 9.8 cm and 0.562 +/- 0.62 g; CamK2: 109.2 +/- 8.7 cm and 0.49 +/- 0.5 g) as the controls (CamK6: 121.1 +/- 10.2 cm and 0.554 +/- 0.4 g; CamK2: 110.0 +/- 9.8 cm and 0.5 +/- 0.4 g), and the values were greater than for the Al3+-treated plants (CamK6: 96.4 +/- 9.2 cm and 0.48 +/- 0.34 g; CamK2: 97.3 +/- 8.1 cm and 0.42 +/- 0.31 g). The results showed that melatonin or nano-Se through modulating biochemical reactions (e.g., antioxidant enzyme) can alleviate Al3+-induced growth inhibition in camelina. This study suggested melatonin or nano-Se can alleviate Al3+-induced growth inhibition by maintaining seed yield and improving oil quality in camelina.

AB  - BackgroundThe effectiveness of Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) cotton against target arthropod larvae is decreasing day by day. The comparative effect of Bt expression among Bt cotton varieties and different plant parts was observed against the cotton bollworms: Helicoverpa armigera and Pectinophora gossypiella larvae.ResultsIn the present study, larval mortality of H. armigera was higher than P. gossypiella among selected Bt cultivars. Median lethal concentration (LC50) values were 8.91, 13.4, 14.0, and 36.4 for P. gossypiella, while 5.91, 4.04, 2.37, and 8.26 for H. armigera of FH-142, MNH-886, IR-3701, and FH-Lalazar, respectively. These values depicted that P. gossypiella had more Bt resistance problem than H. armigera larvae. The host range of both targeted insect larvae was different from each other due to the polyphagous feeding nature of the larvae of H. armigera that feed on different host plants, but P. gossypiella attacked only cotton with monophagous feeding habit. It was also notable from results that Bt expression in reproductive parts where the attacked pink bollworm was lower than the American bollworm, so the former had the maximum chance of resistance due to repeated exposure to Bt.ConclusionsIt was concluded that farmers be advised to follow the practice of growing non-Bt as a refuge crop to reduce the problem of Bt resistance in the target arthropod species.

AB  - Objective Many cultures use herbal medicines in pregnancy as a safer treatment than traditional medicine to promote the mother and/or baby health. Horse chestnut, a medicinal herb that mainly contains aescin, is used for its vagotonic impact, vascular protection, and antiedematous properties. This research sought to assess the impact of prenatal administration of horse chestnut extract on fetal development of rats, which is a novel achievement in teratogenesis studies.Methods Pregnant rats were allocated randomly into four groups. Horse chestnut extract was administered through oral gavage to the animals from day 0 to day 16 of pregnancy at doses of 10, 20, and 40 mg/kg. On day 18, after the cesarean process, the effects of the extract were estimated by morphological, skeletal, and histological studies.Results Administration of the extract resulted in a substantial decrease in weight, head diameter, tail diameter, and crown-rump length of fetuses. There were no malformations and no lack of toes and legs, and all internal organs of the fetus were completely formed. Also, there was no difference in the overall skeletal opacity and density between the control and treatment groups. Moreover, heart cells and neurons were seen in all the groups but the formation of the central vein, portal area, and hepatic sinusoids were not observed in groups that received the extract.Conclusion The result of this study revealed that oral administration of horse chestnut extract in pregnant rats could cause teratogenicity. However, some additional clinical studies may be necessary but according to our data, consumption of this herbal extract during pregnancy is not recommended.

AB  - Reports are increasing on the emergence of COVID-19-associated mucormycosis (CAM) globally, driven particularly by low- and middle-income countries. The recent unprecedented surge of CAM in India has drawn worldwide attention. More than 28,252 mucormycosis cases are counted and India is the first country where mucormycosis has been declared a notifiable disease. However, misconception of management, diagnosing and treating this infection continue to occur. Thus, European Confederation of Medical Mycology (ECMM) and the International Society for Human and Animal Mycology (ISHAM) felt the need to address clinical management of CAM in low- and middle-income countries. This article provides a comprehensive document to help clinicians in managing this infection. Uncontrolled diabetes mellitus and inappropriate (high dose or not indicated) corticosteroid use are the major predisposing factors for this surge. High counts of Mucorales spores in both the indoor and outdoor environments, and the immunosuppressive impact of COVID-19 patients as well as immunotherapy are possible additional factors. Furthermore, a hyperglycaemic state leads to an increased expression of glucose regulated protein (GRP- 78) in endothelial cells that may help the entry of Mucorales into tissues. Rhino-orbital mucormycosis is the most common presentation followed by pulmonary mucormycosis. Recommendations are focused on the early suspicion of the disease and confirmation of diagnosis. Regarding management, glycaemic control, elimination of corticosteroid therapy, extensive surgical debridement and antifungal therapy are the standards for proper care. Due to limited availability of amphotericin B formulations during the present epidemic, alternative antifungal therapies are also discussed.

AB  - Camelina (Camelina sativa (L.) Crantz) is an emerging industrial crop from the Brassicaceae family, with its seed oil and cake being used for food, feed, and fuel applications. In this study, the relationships between economically important agronomic traits including seed yield (SY), days to maturity (DM), 1000-seed weight (TSW), seed protein content (PC), seed oil content (OC), and fatty acid composition in 136 doubled haploid (DH) camelina lines were investigated under rain-fed conditions in two consecutive years. There was prominent diversity among the studied DH lines for the agronomic traits such as seed yield, erucic acid, omega3, protein content, etc. Based on the Pearson correlation analysis of the data, SY was positively correlated with DM and OC, and negatively correlated with TSW, PC, and linolenic acid (C18:3) content. The positive relationships of the main characteristics, relevant to industrial applications, suggest the feasibility of developing new higher-yielding camelina cultivars with high seed oil content. The high seed yield of some camelina lines (DH044 and DH075) during the two growing seasons showed the potential of the lines. On the other hand, the contrasting genotypes for key traits in this study promised a favorable source to develop the superior breeding lines with higher seed yield and food/nonfood traits. Therefore, it can be concluded that the diversity of camelina DH lines traits is crucial for developing new cultivars. Furthermore, the present study reports some significant correlations among the DH lines, which may be useful for the current and future camelina breeding program.

AB  - This study presents the assessment of water scarcity associated with livestock production in a watershed in Southern Brazil where 115 farms (poultry, pig, and milk) are located. The methods, AWARE-available water remaining, and BWSI-blue water scarcity index, were applied monthly for the year 2018, and the characterization factors (CF) were regionalized into five scenarios evaluated by varying water availability and environmental water requirements. Livestock water consumption accounted for 94.1% of the total water consumed. Low water scarcity was observed in all scenarios (BWSI < 0). The highest CFAWARE was observed in scenario 3, ranging from 2.15 to 9.70 m(3 )world eq.m(3 ), with higher water scarcity in summer. In the same scenario, pig production presented the highest annual average water scarcity footprint (WSF) of 90.3 m(3 ) world eq./t carcass weight. Among milk production systems, pasture-based systems presented the highest annual average WSF of 52.7 m(3 ) world eq./t fat protein corrected milk, surpassing semi-confined and confined systems by 12.4% and 3.5%, respectively. In scenario 3, poultry production presented an annual average WSF of 49.3 m(3 ) world eq./t carcass weight. This study contributes knowledge to the livestock sector to perform the assessment of water scarcity.

AB  - Simple Summary This study models the effects of temperature on age-dependent fecundity of the ladybird Stethorus gilvifrons, which is an important predator of herbivorous spider mites such as Tetranychus urticae. Based on the fecundity of S. gilvifrons fed on T. urticae, examined at six constant temperatures from 15 to 34 degrees C, we generated thermal performance curves by using four non-linear models (Enkegaard, Analytis, Bieri-1, and Bieri-2). The thermal performance models presented here can be used to determine the optimal temperature for mass-rearing, simulate daily egg production, and predict field occurrence patterns and seasonal population dynamics of this predator. The models constitute an essential step towards developing temperature-based simulation models of the population dynamics of S. gilvifrons interacting with its spider mite prey. The ladybird, Stethorus gilvifrons (Mulsant) (Coleoptera: Coccinellidae), is an important predator of two-spotted spider mites, Tetranychus urticae Koch (Acari: Tetranychidae), in southeastern Europe and western and southwestern Asia, such as Iran, India, and Turkey. To enhance forecasting the occurrence and performance of this predator in natural control and improve its usage in biological control, we evaluated and compared four non-linear oviposition models, i.e., Enkegaard, Analytis, Bieri-1, and Bieri-2. The models were validated by using data of age-specific fecundity of female S. gilvifrons at six constant temperatures (15, 20, 25, 27, 30, and 34 degrees C). All four models provided good fit quality to age-dependent oviposition at 15 to 30 degrees C (R-2 0.67 to 0.94; R-adj(2) 0.63 to 0.94) but had a poor fit at 34 degrees C (R-2 0.33 to 0.40; R-adj(2) 0.17 to 0.34). Within temperatures, the best performing models were Bieri-1 (R-2), Bieri-2 (R-adj(2)), and Analytis (RSS) at 15 degrees C, Bieri-1 at 27 degrees C, and Analytis at 20, 25, and 30 degrees C. Analytis was the best suited model across the wide temperature range tested (from 15 to 30 degrees C). The models presented here allow for prediction of the population dynamics of S. gilvifrons in field and greenhouse crops in temperate and subtropical climates.

AB  - Mechanical harvesters have attracted tremendous attention as self-powered strain sensors; previous harvesters required high stress to stretch the fiber because of their high Young's modulus and low elasticity. We report on a mechano-electrochemical harvesting (MECH) fiber based on the new buckle structure, which has a low Young's modulus (2 MPa) with high elasticity (up to 100%) in a similar physiological fluid. MECH converts mechanical energy into electrical energy by changing the capacitance due to changing the surface area caused by the microbuckle on the surface. The damage to the cells can be minimized by their softness; the fiber was stitched on the tissue of the pig stomach while maintaining the performance like a suture fiber. Additionally, the fiber successfully operated in an organ-similar system, which is composed of the stomach or bladder of a pig. The fiber has a high potential to be applied in wearable energy sources and self-powered strain sensors.

AB  - Evolutionary adaptations in the Syngnathidae teleost family (seahorses, pipefish and seadragons) culminated in an array of spectacular morphologies, key immune gene losses, and the enigmatic male pregnancy. In seahorses, genome modifications associated with immunoglobulins, complement, and major histocompatibility complex (MHC II) pathway components raise questions concerning their immunological efficiency and the evolution of compensatory measures that may act in their place. In this investigation heat-killed bacteria (Vibrio aestuarianus and Tenacibaculum maritimum) were used in a two-phased experiment to assess the immune response dynamics of Hippocampus erectus. Gill transcriptomes from double and single-exposed individuals were analysed in order to determine the differentially expressed genes contributing to immune system responses towards immune priming. Double-exposed individuals exhibited a greater adaptive immune response when compared with single-exposed individuals, while single-exposed individuals, particularly with V. aestuarianus replicates, associated more with the innate branch of the immune system. T. maritimum double-exposed replicates exhibited the strongest immune reaction, likely due to their immunological naivety towards the bacterium, while there are also potential signs of innate trained immunity. MHC II upregulated expression was identified in selected V. aestuarianus-exposed seahorses, in the absence of other pathway constituents suggesting a possible alternative or non-classical MHC II immune function in seahorses. Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analysis highlighted prominent angiogenesis activity following secondary exposure, which could be linked to an adaptive immune process in seahorses. This investigation highlights the prominent role of T-cell mediated adaptive immune responses in seahorses when exposed to sequential foreign bacteria exposures. If classical MHC II pathway function has been lost, innate trained immunity in syngnathids could be a potential compensatory mechanism.

AB  - Naringin (Nr) has been identified to have antidepressant-like effects through repeated treatment. However, the underlying mechanism of the rapid antidepressant-like effects of Nr was still unclear. The present study used behavioral tests, classic depressive model and pharmacological methods to reveal the rapid antidepressant-like potential of Nr. We found that a single dose of Nr (20 mg/kg) produced antidepressant-like action after 2 h in the tail suspension test (TST) and forced swimming test (FST). Moreover, ketamine-like effects were also demonstrated by using the chronic mild stress model (CMS) and learned helplessness (LH), and the results showed that Nr reversed all behavioral defects, TST, FST, source preference test (SPT) in CMS, and LH testing, TST, FST in LH model, at 2 h after a single administration. In addition, Nr (20 mg/kg) could improve the abnormal expressions of NMDA receptor NR1 and PKA/CREB/BDNF pathway in hippocampus 2 h after a single administration in CMS mice. Further investigation revealed that activation of NMDA receptors by NMDA (750 mg/kg) could block the antidepressant effects of acute administration of Nr (20 mg/kg). However, the inhibition of NMDA receptors by MK-801 (0.05 mg/kg) promoted the subdose of Nr (10 mg/kg) to have antidepressant effect, which was similar to the effective dose Nr (20 mg/kg). Taken together, acute dose of Nr produces rapid antidepressant-like action, and the underlying mechanism could be through inhibiting NMDA receptors in the hippocampus.

AB  - Characterizing flavour-related metabolites of Camellia sinensis (L.) Kuntze is essential for enhancing tea quality and understanding the biochemical foundations of its distinctive taste and aroma. Metabolites like catechins, polyphenols and flavonoids not only contribute to the sensory appeal of tea but also offer multiple health benefits. Comprehensive profiling of these metabolites in indigenous tea germplasm - an underexplored genetic resource -offers valuable insights into their genetic diversity and potential application in breeding programs to develop new cultivars with tailored flavour profiles. In this context, a study was conducted to characterize flavour-related metabolites, including pigment, total polyphenols, catechins and their derivatives, caffeine, tannins and antioxidant activity, across 169 ancient tea germplasm of Assam. Comparative analysis among Assam, China and Cambod-type like varieties revealed significant differences, with F-values highly significant at 0.001. Quantification using RP-HPLC identified catechins, caffeines and gallic acid in the following order of abundance: (-)-Epigallocatechingallate > Caffeine > (-)-Epicatechin > (-)-Epicatechingallate > Gallic acids > (-)- Epigallocatechins > ( +)- Catechins, with Epigallocatechingallate as the predominant contributor. Notably, Cambod-type germplasm exhibited higher metabolite concentrations compared to Assam and China types. High heritability (h(2)b) values for all measured traits indicated minimal environmental influence. Additionally, a strong correlation between pigment, catechins and their derivatives, caffeine likely explains the astringent and bitterness properties of tea. Moreover, high antioxidant activity can boost tea's market value. The findings could not only enhance the understanding of tea's flavour profiles but also pave the way for development of higher-quality tea and improved breeding material for future research programmes.

AB  - The carotenoid-derived volatile d-ionone makes an important contribution to tea fragrance. Here, we qualitatively and quantitatively analysed 15 carotenoids in tea leaves of 13 cultivars by UHPLC-APCI-MS/MS. The 13 cultivars were divided into two groups by PCA (Principal Component Analysis) clustering analysis of their carotenoid content, and OPLS-DA (Orthogonal projections to latent structures) indicated that the levels of d-carotene (VIP = 2.89) and lutein (VIP = 2.30) were responsible for much of the variation between the two groups. Interestingly, the d-carotene to d-ionone conversion rates in Group 1 were higher than in Group 2, while the d-carotene content was significantly lower in Group 1 than in Group 2. The d-ionone content was significantly higher in Group 1. Pearson Correlation Coefficient calculation between the tran-scription level of candidate genes (CsCCD1 and CsCCD4) and the accumulation of d-ionone indicated that CsCCD1 may involve in the formation of d-ionone in 13 cultivars. Prokaryotic expression and in vitro enzyme activity assays showed that 'Chuanhuang 1' had an amino acid mutation in carotenoid cleavage dioxygenases 1 (CsCCD1) compared with 'Shuchazao', resulting in a significantly higher d-ionone content in 'Chuan-huang 1'. Sequence analysis showed that 'Chuanhuang 1' and 'Huangdan' had different CsCCD1 promoter sequences, leading to significantly higher CsCCD1 expression and d-ionone accumulation in 'Chuanhuang 1'. These results indicated that the promoter and coding sequence diversity of CsCCD1 might contribute to the differential accumulation of d-ionone in different tea cultivars.

AB  - The hippocampus is one of the brain structures most vulnerable to hypoxia. The cellular pool in the hippocampal subgranular zone (SGZ) neurogenic niche is maintained by the adaptive mechanisms, such as functional changes in the mitochondrial respiratory chain complexes and the reactivity of astroglia that provides structural and metabolic support for neurons. To reveal the dynamics of adaptive changes in neurons and glia of the hippocampal dentate gyrus in response to single (60 min) and repeated (8 and 20 bouts) intermittent hypobaric hypoxia exposures (5000 m equivalent to 10.5% O-2), the localization and content of mitochondrial respiratory Complex IV cytochrome c oxidase subunit 1 (MTCO1), astrocyte markers glutamine synthetase (GS) and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), as well as the immature neuron marker doublecortin (DCX), were studied in low-resistant rats by immunomorphological methods. After a single hypoxic exposure, the MTCO1 content significantly increased in neurons, while after 8 hypoxic episodes, the GS level increased in astrocytes. Changes in the latter were most prominent in the astrocytic processes, indicative of hypoxia-induced GS redistribution. The number of DCX-positive neurons in the SGZ significantly decreased after 20 hypoxic episodes. At the same time, DCX-positive glia-like cells were found in the hippocampal polymorphic layer, while GFAP labeling revealed an increase in the number of astrocytes, which may be partly due to a shift in the direction of cell differentiation in the neurogenic niche. Thus, hypoxia first intensifies mitochondrial respiratory chain activity in the neurons of the hippocampal granular cell layer, followed by the activation of astrocytes that modulate glutamate metabolism. The relationship between the dynamics of adaptive energy metabolism reactions in neurons and glia and changes in neurogenesis after 20 hypoxic episodes suggests that repeated (long-term) hypoxia promotes a shift in the differentiation of SGZ neural progenitors toward astroglia. However, this issue requires further investigation to identify the nature of DCX-positive cells more accurately.

AB  - Memory processes have long been known to determine food choices (Rozin & Zellner, 1985) but recognition memory of food and its cognitive, homeostatic and neuroanatomical predictors are still largely understudied.60 healthy, overweight, non-restrictive eating adults (20 females) took part in a food wanting and subsequent food recognition and lure discrimination task at four time points after a standardized breakfast shake. With advanced tractography of 3 T diffusion-weighted imaging data, we investigated the influence of the uncinate fasciculus' (UF) brain microstructure on the interplay of food wanting and memory processes. The analysis was preregistered in detail and conducted with Bayesian multilevel regression modeling.Target recognition (d') and lure discrimination (LDI) performance of food tended to be higher than of art images while single image food memory accuracy evidently dominated art memory. On this single item level, wanting enhanced recognition accuracy and caloric content enhanced food memory accuracy. The enhancement by reward anticipation was most pronounced during memory encoding. Subjective hunger level did not predict performance on the memory task. The microstructure of the UF did neither evidently affect memory performance outcomes nor moderate the wanting enhancement of the recognition accuracy. Interestingly, female participants outperformed males on the memory task, and individuals with stronger neuroticism showed poorer memory performance.We shed light on to date understudied processes in food decision-making: reward anticipation influenced recognition accuracy and food memory was enhanced by higher caloric content, both effects might shape food decisions. Our findings indicate that brain microstructure does not affect food decision processes in adult populations with overweight. We suggest extending investigation of this interplay to brain activity as well as to populations with eating behaviour disorders.

AB  - Black agrarian movements in the US have variously worked towards gaining equality within broader society and access to resources from dominant institutions as well as separation and independence from dominant systems and the creation of alternative institutions and structures. Often associated with different groups or movements, these differing tactical approaches are at times at odds, creating fissures between groups or movements or tensions among individuals. But they also can be used as complementary tactics towards a long-term vision of developing alternative socio-economic systems. This paper explores how a plurality of rural development tactics manifests within a single organization using the Federation of Southern Cooperatives/Land Assistance Fund (Federation) as a case study. More narrowly, this paper examines a specific on-the-ground configuration of organizers and farmers working with the Federation who are using goat farming as a tool for rural development in western Alabama. By focusing on the practices, expressed goals, and interactions of the people involved in one particular effort, this paper shows plurality to be a quality that is tactically useful for (1) navigating between a long-term strategic vision and the pragmatic survival within the current system and (2) building strategic coherence while respecting individual differences. Drawing on ethnographic research, this paper focuses on the practiced and relational ways farmers and organizers work to synthesize the plurality embedded within the Federation's Black development ideology in order to build sustainable and effective forms of change.

AB  - Simple Summary Body condition score (BCS) is an assessment of the amount of fat and muscle covering the lumbar spine and short ribs of sheep. It is widely used as a management tool to assess the nutritional status of sheep. This study investigated whether managing triplet-bearing ewes at a higher or lower BCS between pregnancy scanning and lamb marking impacted the survival of the ewes or their lambs. Triplet-bearing ewes of Maternal (crossbred or composite) or Merino breed were allocated to one of two treatments at pregnancy scanning: 'High' or 'Low' BCS. The BCS of individual ewes was assessed at pregnancy scanning, pre-lambing and marking, and ewe and lamb mortality to marking, recorded for each mob. Survival of triplet-bearing Merino ewes and their lambs was greater when ewes were managed at the High BCS compared to the Low BCS. The BCS treatment had no effect on the survival of Maternal ewes or their lambs. Survival of triplet-born Merino but not Maternal lambs was greater when ewes had a greater BCS pre-lambing or gained BCS between pregnancy scanning and pre-lambing. Triplet-bearing ewes of Maternal and Merino breed that gained BCS between pregnancy scanning and pre-lambing had greater survival to marking. Producers should, therefore, manage the nutrition of triplet-bearing Merino ewes so that ewes are in greater BCS at lambing and/or to gain BCS between pregnancy scanning and lambing to improve ewe and lamb survival. Triplet-bearing Maternal ewes should be managed to gain BCS between pregnancy scanning and lambing to improve ewe survival. This study evaluated the impacts of management of body condition score (BCS) between pregnancy scanning and lamb marking on the mortality of triplet-bearing ewes and their lambs at 19 research sites across Southern Australia. Triplet-bearing ewes of Maternal (crossbred or composite) or Merino breed were randomly allocated to treatment at pregnancy scanning at an average of 97 days from the start of joining: High or Low BCS. The BCS of individual ewes was assessed at pregnancy scanning, pre-lambing (average of 137 days from the start of joining) and marking (average of 165 days from the end of joining), and ewe and lamb mortality to marking, recorded for each mob. The average BCS at pregnancy scanning was 3.4 for Maternal ewes and 3.3 for Merino ewes. There were no breed by BCS treatment effects on the BCS of ewes at pregnancy scanning or lamb marking or on the change in BCS between pregnancy scanning and pre-lambing or between pre-lambing and marking. The change in BCS differed between the High and Low BCS treatments, between pregnancy scanning and pre-lambing (0.12 vs. -0.33; p < 0.001) and between pre-lambing and marking (-0.39 vs. 0.07; p < 0.001) but did not differ between breeds. The average BCS at marking for ewes managed at the High and Low BCS treatments was 3.1 and 3.0 for Maternals and 3.0 and 2.8 for Merinos. Survival of triplet-bearing Merino ewes (p < 0.01) and their lambs (p < 0.001) was greater when ewes were managed at the High BCS compared to the Low BCS. The BCS treatment did not impact the survival of Maternal ewes or their lambs. The survival of Merino but not Maternal lambs was higher when ewes were in greater BCS pre-lambing (p < 0.01) and when ewes gained BCS between pregnancy scanning and pre-lambing (p < 0.01). Ewe mortality was lower when ewes gained BCS between pregnancy scanning and pre-lambing (p < 0.05). Merino ewes were more likely to die than Maternal ewes for a given change in BCS between pregnancy scanning and pre-lambing (p = 0.065).
   Overall, our findings demonstrate that producers should manage the nutrition of triplet-bearing Merino ewes so that ewes are in greater BCS at lambing and/or to gain BCS between pregnancy scanning and lambing to improve ewe and lamb survival. Triplet-bearing Maternal ewes should be managed to gain BCS between pregnancy scanning and lambing to improve ewe survival.

AB  - Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), represents an enormous new threat to our healthcare system and particularly to the health of older adults. Although the respiratory symptoms of COVID-19 are well recognized, the neurological manifestations, and their underlying cellular and molecular mechanisms, have not been extensively studied yet. Our study is the first one to test the direct effect of serum from hospitalised COVID-19 patients on human hippocampal neurogenesis using a unique in vitro experimental assay with human hippocampal progenitor cells (HPC0A07/03 C). We identify the different molecular pathways activated by serum from COVID-19 patients with and without neurological symptoms (i.e., delirium), and their effects on neuronal proliferation, neurogenesis, and apoptosis. We collected serum sample twice, at time of hospital admission and approximately 5 days after hospitalization. We found that treatment with serum samples from COVID-19 patients with delirium (n = 18) decreased cell proliferation and neurogenesis, and increases apoptosis, when compared with serum samples of sex- and age-matched COVID-19 patients without delirium (n = 18). This effect was due to a higher concentration of interleukin 6 (IL6) in serum samples of patients with delirium (mean +/- SD: 229.9 +/- 79.1 pg/ml, vs. 32.5 +/- 9.5 pg/ml in patients without delirium). Indeed, treatment of cells with an antibody against IL6 prevented the decreased cell proliferation and neurogenesis and the increased apoptosis. Moreover, increased concentration of IL6 in serum samples from delirium patients stimulated the hippocampal cells to produce IL12 and IL13, and treatment with an antibody against IL12 or IL13 also prevented the decreased cell proliferation and neurogenesis, and the increased apoptosis. Interestingly, treatment with the compounds commonly administered to acute COVID-19 patients (the Janus kinase inhibitors, baricitinib, ruxolitinib and tofacitinib) were able to restore normal cell viability, proliferation and neurogenesis by targeting the effects of IL12 and IL13. Overall, our results show that serum from COVID-19 patients with delirium can negatively affect hippocampal-dependent neurogenic processes, and that this effect is mediated by IL6-induced production of the downstream inflammatory cytokines IL12 and IL13, which are ultimately responsible for the detrimental cellular outcomes.

AB  - Phytoliths represent an important fraction of soil's components and they are incorporated through different agents. One of the sources of phytoliths to soils and sediments is dung. In particular, in agroecosystems, the incorporation of phytoliths from dung may be of importance, since pastures (grasses) belong to one of the highest producer families. The main objective of this work was to compare the content and state of phytoliths in rumen and dung samples from cows in relation to the phytoliths produced in the forage plants eaten. Secondly, we analyzed if phytolith assemblages differed between dung collected in different pastures in Pampean region, Argentina. Phytoliths from rumen and dung samples from five fistulated cows were compared with the main forage species eaten (Festuca arundinacea). Also, dung of three different pastures (two naturals and one controlled) were compared. Phytoliths of plants and dung were extracted by a calcination technique, while rumen samples were treated with hydrogen peroxide. In rumen and dung samples, the morphologies derived from Festuca arundinacea plants had different stages of degradation: the ACUTE BULBOSUS and the PAPILLATE were the most degraded, while the RONDELS remained with little wear. A high percentage of phytoliths remained unidentified, probably due to their degradation state. Through phytolithmorphometric analysis, it was possible to identify that the principal organ eaten by cows was the inflorescence.

AB  - Cystic Fibrosis (CF) is a genetic disease caused by mutations in the CF transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene. The F508del and G542X are the most common mutations found in US patients, accounting for 86.4% and 4.6% of all mutations, respectively. The F508del causes deletion of the phenylalanine residue at position 508 and is associated with impaired CFTR protein folding. The G542X is a nonsense mutation that introduces a stop codon into the mRNA, thus preventing normal CFTR protein synthesis. Here, we describe the generation of CFTRF508del/F508del and CFTRG542X/G542X lambs using CRISPR/Cas9 and somatic cell nuclear transfer (SCNT). First, we introduced either F508del or G542X mutations into sheep fetal fibroblasts that were subsequently used as nuclear donors for SCNT. The newborn CF lambs develop pathology similar to CFTR-/- sheep and CF patients. Moreover, tracheal epithelial cells from the CFTRF508del/F508del lambs responded to a human CFTR (hCFTR) potentiator and correctors, and those from CFTRG542X/G542X lambs showed modest restoration of CFTR function following inhibition of nonsense-mediated decay (NMD) and aminoglycoside antibiotic treatments. Thus, the phenotype and electrophysiology of these novel models represent an important advance for testing new CF therapeutics and gene therapy to improve the health of patients with this life-limiting disorder.

AB  - To efficiently and accurately complete the plugging task and enable rapid maintenance and repair operations of submarine pipelines by pipeline intelligent plugging robot (PIPR), this study innovatively designs an autonomous plugging hydraulic control system for PIPR. Based on this, the simulation is used to confirm the viability of the control system, and the changes in displacement, flow, speed, and load of the control system are analyzed. A plugging hydraulic control experimental device was built to study the changes in hydraulic cylinder parameters and axial displacement of the rubber cylinder during the plugging process, as well as the influence of the law of different output flow rates on the plugging speed. The results show that the control cycle of the designed hydraulic control system can make the robot's actuators operate in an orderly manner without interference, and the displacement, flow, and speed of the hydraulic cylinders are consistent with the theoretical design values. When the rubber cylinder deformation axial displacement reaches 50.1 mm, the rubber cylinder enters the constrained deformation stage, and the axial displacement reaches 61.55 mm, the system can realize 10 MPa pressure oil and gas plugging. The hydraulic system flow rate has a significant effect on the plugging speed, as the flow rate of the hydraulic system increases, the rate at which the hydraulic cylinder squeezes the rubber cylinder reaches the axial displacement standard of 61.55 mm increases, but the growth trend gradually slows. This study provides data reference and theoretical guidance for the design of autonomous plugging control system of PIPR, which is an important guideline for the research and development of PIPR.

AB  - Simple Summary Bamboo shoot processing waste is usually directly discarded, resulting in the waste of bamboo resources and environmental pollution. Fermented bamboo shoot processing waste (FBSPW) for feed processing is an important way to reuse bamboo shoot processing waste. In this study, to evaluate the feasibility of FBSPW as a feed additive for weaned piglets, we analyzed the effects of different concentrations of FBSPW added to feed on growth performance, serum parameters, and gut microbiota of weaned piglets. Our results showed that the addition of FBSPW significantly decreased the average daily feed intake, serum triglyceride content, and urea nitrogen of weaned piglets compared to the control. The cecum and cecal microbiota of weaned piglets fed the basal diet with 12% FBSPW were significantly different compared to the control. The addition of 12% FBSPW to weaned piglet feed could improve their nitrogen and lipid metabolisms and have beneficial effects on gut microbiota. Gut microbiota (GM) plays a vital role in the nutrition and metabolism of weaned piglets. Some feed additives can be used to adjust the composition of GM to improve the health of weaned piglets. In this study, we investigated the effects of adding fermented bamboo shoot processing waste (FBSPW) to diet on growth performance, serum parameters, and GM of weaned piglets. Seventy-two piglets were divided into four groups and were fed diets containing 0% (control), 4% (group A), 8% (group B), and 12% (group C) FBSPW for 50 days. We found that the addition of FBSPW significantly decreased the average daily feed intake, serum triglyceride content, and urea nitrogen of weaned piglets compared to the control. The cecum and cecal microbiota of weaned piglets fed the basal diet with 12% FBSPW were significantly different compared to the control. A basal diet with 12% FBSPW significantly reduced the taxon feature number, and the relative abundance of Tenericutes in the cecum and cecal microbiota of weaned piglets compared with the control. The addition of 12% FBSPW to weaned piglet feed could improve their nitrogen and lipid metabolisms and have beneficial effects on GM.

AB  - In the context of the Persian leopard restoration program in the Russian Caucasus, an in-depth analysis was conducted to understand the hunting behaviors of rewilded Persian leopards and evaluate the program's effectiveness. From 2016 to 2023, GPS telemetry data from 14 leopards (8 males and 6 females) aged 20 months and older, released in the Western (WeC) and Central (CeC) Caucasus, were analyzed. Using cluster location analysis, we determined 243 kill sites categorized by prey-size into large, medium, and small classes. In the WeC, leopards exhibit a significantly higher proportion of large prey compared to the CeC (43%, N = 49 vs. 5.4%, N = 148, p < 0.01). There is no significant difference in the proportion of medium-sized prey, but there is a striking contrast in the proportion of small prey (WeC 16.2%, CeC 57.4% (p < 0.01)). No significant differences were found in the time spent on prey between male and female leopards, regardless of the region. Female leopards capture their next prey 215 +/- 184 hours (Mean +/- SD; N = 131) after leaving the previous one, covering a distance of 46 +/- 40 km (Mean +/- SD, max 191 km). Male leopards, in contrast, take 265 +/- 246 hours (Mean +/- SD, N = 110) between kills, with a distance of 59 +/- 60 km (Mean +/- SD, max 366 km) between them. In the WeC, the kill rate for leopards are lower than in the CeC, with averages of a prey every 264 +/- 273 hours and 62 +/- 64 km (N = 77) compared to 152 +/- 172 hours and 47 +/- 41 km (N = 165), respectively. Leopards in the CeC spend significantly more time on kill sites with large and medium-sized prey compared to small prey. In contrast, leopards in the WeC show no significant difference in the time spent on prey of different size classes. This disparity is explained by the fact that large and medium-sized prey are more challenging to conceal and defend from competitors whose populations densities are higher in the WeC than the CeC. 20% of large and medium-size prey kill sites of leopard in the Western Caucasus have been visited by bears or wolves. This suggests that environmental factors and attractive high ungulate population densities may also play a critical role in shaping predator-prey dynamics and interspecific competition in the region. It is imperative to evaluate the availability of potential prey across different size classes, alongside with moderate levels of competitor populations. These factors can play a decisive role during the crucial first year of the leopard's adaptation to life in the wild, ultimately determining the success of species restoration initiatives.

AB  - This paper presents mathematical models that can simulate the cardiovascular system of a healthy sheep under normal resting conditions in which the heart rate changes significantly. The models include several new modelling features that are introduced progressively. The contraction of the cardiac chambers is modelled using a time-dependent muscle force with constant elasticity instead of time dependent elasticity. A new hypothesis about the mechanical contraction of the atria generates realistic pressure volume (PV) loops. The inter-ventricular interaction is modelled as well. Additionally, hysteresis is incorporated in the aortic valve to produce an end-systolic reverse (negative) flow. Most of the model parameter values are based on previous literature data while time periods of delay, atrial and ventricular contraction are derived using experimental data from 14 sheep. We provide new relationships between contraction time and delay as a function of heart period. The effects of different aspects of our modelling on the mean cardiac output, stroke volume, ejection time, ejection fraction and PV loops are studied. Model outputs are compared with published experimental results where possible, and are within a wide range of physiological observations.

AB  - An outbreak of African swine fever (ASF) in China in 2018 caused substantial economic losses to the swine industry. To accurately diagnose clinical infection with ASF virus (ASFV), we developed a TaqMan probe-based duplex real-time PCR that simultaneously detected two discontinuous genes in the virus genome, thereby pre -venting the inaccurate results obtained with only one reaction. Two sets of ASFV gene-specific primers, along with two fluorescent TaqMan probes were designed to target conserved regions of the B646L and B438L genes. This method had high sensitivity and specificity, with a limit of detection of 10 copies/mu L, and it did not cross-react with the genomes of other viral pathogens that affect pigs (i.e., CSFV, PRRSV, PEDV, PRV, PPV and PCV2). Overall, 180 clinical samples from ASFV-infected pig farms were used to compare this method with a commercial kit, which yielded excellent consistency (98.3%). This new diagnostic method should greatly improve the effi-ciency of ASFV surveillance and reduce economic losses, providing benefits for both animal and public health.

AB  - Redox homeostasis plays a pivotal role in maintaining the oocyte's developmental capacity. However, accumulating evidence indicated that an excessive amount of reactive oxygen species (ROS) was produced during oocyte in vitro maturation (IVM). Therefore, it is necessary to develop strategies for further improving the anti-oxidative potential of IVM oocytes. This study aims to investigate the effects of hydroxyapatite (HA) nanoparticles on redox homeostasis maintenance during ovine oocyte IVM. Additionally, the mechanism underlying the protective role of HA against oxidative stress was systematically analyzed. In this study, HA nanoparticles were introduced at concentrations of 0.1%, 0.3%, and 0.5% during the IVM process. The survival rate of oocytes was assessed to identify the maximum concentration of HA nanoparticles without cytotoxicity after a 24 h culture period. The levels of ROS, glutathione (GSH), mitochondrial membrane potential, and early apoptosis were evaluated to determine the impact of HA nanoparticles on the antioxidant capacity of the oocytes. Furthermore, Smart-RNA sequencing technology was utilized to identify differentially expressed mRNAs (DEMs) induced by nanoparticles during the maturation process. The results indicated that 0.3% HA had no adverse effect on the oocyte survival rate, suggesting its potential applicability in IVM. What's more, antioxidant capacity assessments revealed that 0.3% HA nanoparticles significantly reduced ROS levels, increased GSH levels, and enhanced mitochondrial membrane potential; however, there was no difference in early apoptosis. Furthermore, a total of 928 DEMs were identified, including 377 upregulated and 551 downregulated mRNAs in oocytes treated with HA. Functional enrichment analysis of the DEMs using GO, KEGG, GSEA, and STEM revealed that HA nanoparticles enhanced oocyte maturation by modulating ROS through thermogenesis signaling pathway. Additionally, core genes such as ATP8, NDUFB10, PPARG, and COX5B were predominantly enriched in the thermogenic pathway.

AB  - In humans, a dietary intake of omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids along with antioxidants has been shown to have anti-inflammatory and antioxidant activities. In pigs, on the other hand, there are few studies dealing with the use of omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids in the diet. For this reason, our study aimed to investigate the differences in gene expression of the Longissimus thoracis muscle of Italian Large White pigs fed with four different diets: a standard diet for growing-finishing pigs and three experimental diets; one supplemented with extruded linseed, a source of omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids, another with extruded linseed plus vitamin E and selenium as antioxidants, and another with extruded linseed plus oregano and grape skin extracts, which are natural polyphenols. From the results of the expression analysis, it was possible to deduce that, in the diets, the oxidative stability of the n-3 fatty acids increased, consistent with an increase in the fluidity of cell membranes, and increasing the anti-inflammatory potential of muscle. This can determine the high quality of the muscle tissue as regards the lipid composition; consequently, the meat will be qualitatively better for human health.The addition of n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (n-3 PUFAs) to the swine diet increases their content in muscle cells, and the additional supplementation of antioxidants promotes their oxidative stability. However, to date, the functionality of these components within muscle tissue is not well understood. Using a published RNA-seq dataset and a selective workflow, the study aimed to find the differences in gene expression and investigate how differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were implicated in the cellular composition and metabolism of muscle tissue of 48 Italian Large White pigs under different dietary conditions. A functional enrichment analysis of DEGs, using Cytoscape, revealed that the diet enriched with extruded linseed and supplemented with vitamin E and selenium promoted a more rapid and massive immune system response because the overall function of muscle tissue was improved, while those enriched with extruded linseed and supplemented with grape skin and oregano extracts promoted the presence and oxidative stability of n-3 PUFAs, increasing the anti-inflammatory potential of the muscular tissue.

AB  - Deoxynivalenol (DON) is one of the mycotoxins that contaminate cereals and feed, thereby endangering human and animal health. Dihydroartemisinin (DHA), a derivative of artemisinin, has anti-inflammatory and antioxi-dant functions in addition to anti-malaria and anti-cancer. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of DHA on alleviating liver apoptosis and inflammation induced by DON in piglets. The experimental design followed a 2 (normal diet and DON-contaminated diet) x 2 (with and without supplementation of DHA) factorial arrangement. 36 weaned piglets were subjected to a 21-day experiment. Results showed that DON increased ALT activity, the levels of TNF-alpha, IL-1 beta and IL-2, and reduced the levels of total protein (TP) and albumin (ALB) in the serum. However, DHA decreased the levels of TNF-alpha, IL-1 beta and IL-2, and increased the levels of TP and ALB. Also, DON decreased glutathione (GSH) content and catalase (CAT) activity, and increased methane dicarboxylic aldehyde (MDA) content. But GSH content was increased by DHA. In addition, DHA decreased DON-induced increase in apoptosis rate of hepatocytes. Furthermore, DON activated death receptor pathway to promote apoptosis by up-regulating the protein expression of FasL and caspase-3, and the mRNA expression of FasL, TNFR1, caspase-8, Bid, Bax, CYC and caspase-3. However, DHA reduced caspase-3 protein expression, as well as the mRNA expression of FADD, Bid, Bax, CYC and caspase-3. Besides, DON also activated TNF/NF-kappa B pathway to induce an inflammatory response by up-regulating TNF-alpha protein expression, and the mRNA expression of TNFR1, RIP1, IKK beta, I kappa B alpha, IL-1 beta and IL-8. Nevertheless, DHA reduced the mRNA expression of RIP1, I kappa B alpha, NF-kappa B, IL-1 beta and IL-6, and the protein expression of TNF-alpha and NF-kappa B. In conclusion, DHA improved DON-induced negative effects on serum biochemical parameters and inflammatory cytokine levels, hepatic antioxidant ca-pacity, hepatic apoptosis and inflammation.

AB  - Both the Yamal-Belyi and Gydan populations of the wild reindeer (Rangifer tarandus) are endangered with no exact reasons. In this puzzle it is very important to analyze the reindeer diet on Belyi and Shokalskii islands of the Arctic Ocean, where its populations are mainly concentrated in summer, especially in order to compare them with greater white-fronted (Anser albifrons) and brant (Branta bernicla) geese that use the same food resources. The herbivores are shown to feed on more than 40 plant species on those islands. The more mobile species using more habitat types show more diverse diets, but both food diversity and food selectivity depend on their morphophysiological features. Both white-fronted goose populations are more abundant than both brant goose populations and continue growing, while the brant goose populations have a stable trend. This agrees with the broader and less selective diet of white-fronted goose compared to the brant goose diet. However, both reindeer populations on the islands, although showing the widest and least selective diet, undergo a sharp decline which is therefore not influenced by food competition. This only allows us to suggest the maintenance of usual reservation rules on the islands, which can provide at least equal initial conditions in using the limited resources for all herbivore species.

AB  - Cyanoacrylate glues are a renowned synthetic tissue sealant that cures rapidly through polymerization at room temperature, felicitating medical glues to treat skin wounds and surgical openings. Despite a wide range of cyanoacrylates available, only 2-octyl cyanoacrylates (OCA) provides the best biocompatibility. In this study, the polymerization and adhesive properties of 2-octyl cyanoacrylates (OCA) are explored in the presence of a highly biocompatible and biochemically inert polymer, poly(ethylene glycol) polyhedral oligomeric silsesquioxane (PEG-POSS). The effect of PEG-POSS on the polymerization of OCA is examined on a plastic surface and over pig skin. A peel-test is performed to evaluate the strength of OCA adhesive properties between two pieces of pig skin samples. Additionally, thin films of OCA are prepared using different fillers and evaluated for tear test. The results reveal that when applied on the plastic or pig skin, PEG-POSS initiated polymerization in OCA yields a high molecular weight OCA polymer with much better adhesive properties compared to commercially available cyanoacrylate adhesives. The relative change in the molecular weights of OCA compared to commercially available cyanoacrylate bioadhesives such as Dermaflex is much higher. The pig skin peeling test shows that OCA needs higher peeling force than Dermaflex.

AB  - This study aimed to assess the effects of water quality (contamination with manure) on water and feed intake and subsuquent milk production, and lying behaviour in dairy cattle. Fifteen lactating Holstein-Friesian cows were provided one of three water treatments in a cross-over design; clean (tap) water, or water contaminated with either 0.5 mg or 1 mg fresh manure/g water. Cows were managed individually in indoor pens and milk production, feed and water intake (free and via feed) and lying behaviour were recorded daily. Live weight was recorded before and after each treatment exposure. Cows were in their pens for 5 days with clean water (baseline) before given one of the three water treatments for 4 consecutive days. Between each baseline/treatment period the cows were managed as one group on pasture for 5 days with clean water to minimize any carryover effects. This was repeated until all cows had undergone all treatments. Data were analysed using analysis of variance of the 4-day treatment averages and repeated measures analysis of variance to examine day trends within treatment phases. There was an overall treatment effect on free water intake (P < 0.001, SED: 2.34); cows drank more of the clean water (78.0 L/day, range: 49.2?118.0 L) compared to when it was contaminated with 0.5 mg (68.4 L/day, range: 53.5?82.8 L) or 1 mg manure/g water (67.0 L/day, range: 50.6?86.8 L). The water intake of the two contaminated water treatments increased over the 4 days to be the same as the clean water treatment by day 4 (treatment * day interaction, P = 0.002). The cows obtained considerable amount of water from their feed (on average 48 L/day), however, there was no treatment effect on this water intake (P = 0.511). There was no treatment effect on feed intake, live weight or lying behaviour (P ? 0.064). Our results show that cows are sensitive to manure contamination of their drinking water. Cows consumed less contaminated water for the first three days of exposure, however, this was not evident on day four, and the reasons for this are unclear. Water quality did not influence feed intake, production or lying behaviour, however, this could be due to the relatively low levels of contamination used, and/or the high water intake from the feed (cut pasture) may have contributed to meeting metabolic requirements to maintain milk production.

AB  - Introduction: Cryptorchidism is a hereditary anomaly characterized by the incomplete descent of one or both testicles to the scrotum. One of the challenges of this anomaly is that the retained testicle maintains its endocrine function. As a consequence, cryptorchid animals produce hormone-tainted meat in comparison to castrated animals and are likely to be more aggressive. Cryptorchidism can lead to reduced animal welfare outcomes and cause economic losses. Identifying genetic markers for cryptorchidism is an essential step toward mitigating these negative outcomes and may facilitate genome manipulation to reduce the occurrence of cryptorchidism. Attempts to identify such markers have used genome-wide association studies. Using whole-exome sequencing, we aimed to identify single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the coding regions of cryptorchid pigs and to characterize functional pathways concerning these SNPs. Methods: DNA was extracted and sequenced from 5 healthy and 5 cryptorchid animals from the Landrace breed, using the Illumina HiSeq 2500 platform. Data were pre-processed using the SeqyClean tool and further mapped against the swine reference genome (Sus scrofa 11.1) using BWA software. GATK was used to identify polymorphisms (SNPs and InDels), which were annotated using the VEP tool. Network prediction and gene ontology enrichment analysis were conducted using the Cytoscape platform, and STRING software was used for visualization. Results: A total of 63 SNPs were identified across the genes PIGB, CCPG1, COMMD9, LDLRAD3, TRIM44, MYLPF, SEPTIN, ZNF48, TIA1, FAIM2, KRT18, FBP1, FBP2, CTSL, DAPK1, DHX8, GPR179, DEPDC1B, ENSSSCG00000049573, ENSSSCG00000016384, ENSSSCG00000022657, ENSSSCG00000038825, and ENSSSCG00000001229. Using pathway enrichment analyses and network prospection, we have identified the following significant adjusted p value threshold of 0.001 involved with the biological function pathways of estrogen signaling, cytoskeleton organization, and the pentose phosphate pathway. Conclusion: Our data suggest the involvement of new SNPs and genes in developing cryptorchidism in pigs. However, further studies are needed to validate our results in a larger cohort population. Variations in the GPR179 gene, with implications at the protein level, may be associated with the appearance of this anomaly in the swine. Finally, we are showing that the estrogen signaling pathway may be involved in the pathophysiological mechanisms of this congenital anomaly as previously reported in GWAS.

AB  - Simple Summary: Because udder shape and milkability are strongly correlated, particular structural traits might be chosen in the future to increase milking effectiveness in sheep. Among udder conformation traits, udder depth and length are most strongly associated with milk output. An efficient selection approach to examine external udder conformation in relation to lamb growth rates and colostrum quality might be produced by a practical method of visual assessments of udder conformation and structure. However, there has not been much research on how the external udder conformation of meat-breed sheep relates to the quality of colostrum and lamb growth rates. The goal of this study was to investigate the relationship among external udder conformation and colostrum quality and lamb growth rates in Suffolk ewes using visual evaluations of the external udder. The study showed that ewes with a 'normal' udder conformation had greater mean total protein and Brix values in colostrum compared with ewes with an 'abnormal' conformation. Udder conformation based on the parameters of udder floor, udder depth, teat placement, teat lesions, and presence of wool did not appear to have a significant effect on lamb body weight or growth rates. Although udder conformation appears to affect colostrum quality, more research is needed to determine how it affects lamb growth, morbidity, and mortality during the first week of life. In sheep raised for meat production, the relationship between external udder conformation, colostrum quality, and lamb growth rates has not received much attention. We hypothesized that ewes with a more desirable udder conformation at lambing would have greater colostrum quality and greater growth rates in lambs. Fifty Suffolk ewes were used in this study. Within 6-8 h of parturition, colostrum samples from both halves of the udder were collected and visual scoring of the udder was conducted. Colostrum quality was measured for total proteins using both optical and Brix refractometers. On day 2, day 45, and day 60 after parturition, lamb weights were recorded, and udder conformation measurements were repeated. A visual scoring system evaluating udder floor (scale 1-4), udder depth (scale 1-9), teat placement (scale 1-9), teat/mammary lesions (present or absent), and the presence of wool (present or absent) was used to assess the external udder conformation. Normal udder parameters included udder depth scores of 5 or 6; udder floor scores of 1 or 2; teat placement scores of 4, 5, or 6; and the absence of teat/mammary lesions and wool. All ewes not meeting normal parameters were considered to have an abnormal udder. The data were analyzed using the GLM procedure. Mean total colostrum protein was greater (p = 0.03) in ewes displaying a 'normal' udder conformation compared with those with an 'abnormal' conformation (14.82 +/- 0.5 and 13.31 +/- 0.3 mg/dL, respectively). Mean Brix values were also greater (p = 0.03) for ewes with a 'normal' udder compared to an abnormal udder confirmation (21.70 +/- 0.8 and 19.54 +/- 0.5, respectively). On day 2 after parturition, the mean lamb body weight was not different between ewes with 'normal' and abnormal udders (5.38 +/- 0.26 vs. 5.46 +/- 0.15). No differences (p > 0.05) in lamb weights were detected between ewes with normal and abnormal udder conformations on day 45 and 60 after parturition. These data provide evidence of greater colostrum total protein values and greater Brix values present in ewes with a 'normal' udder conformation.
   There were no differences in the weights of lambs born to ewes with normal or abnormal udder conformations.

AB  - Kisspeptin (Kp), an upstream regulator of GnRH release, is essential for the development and function of reproductive axis. Previously, we demonstrated the localization of Kp and its receptor (Kiss1r) in the active follicle in the bubaline ovary. Present study aimed to determine the effect of Kp on granulosa cell (GCs) functions, especially oestradiol (E-2) and progesterone (P-4) production, and differential expression of genes regulating the proliferation, apoptosis and steroidogenesis in the buffalo. The ovaries with 6-10 mm size follicles obtained from the cyclic buffaloes after slaughtering were used for isolation of GCs for in vitro study. The primary GCs culture was treated with Kp (0, 10, 50 and 100 nM) and incubated for 48 h. Production of E-2 and P-4 was estimated in the culture supernatant by ELISA. The expression of gonadotropin receptors (FSHR and LHR), steroidogenic genes (STAR, 3 beta-HSD, CYP19A1), proliferation marker (PCNA), apoptotic factors (CASP3 and BCL2) and Kp signalling molecule (extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2, ERK1/2 and p-ERK1/2) was studied in the GCs by qPCR. Significant E-2 production was found in the Kp 50 and 100 nM groups (p < .05), whereas P-4 production was reduced in Kp 100 nM group (p < .05). There was concomitant upregulation of FSHR, ERK1/2, STAR and CYP19A1 in the Kp 100 nM treated GCs. In addition, Kp at 100 nM stimulated the proliferation of GCs by upregulating the expression of BCL2 (5.0 fold) and PCNA (94.9 fold). Further, high immunoreactivity of p-ERK1/2 was observed in the Kp-treated GCs. It was concluded that Kp at 100 nM concentration stimulated E-2 production by upregulating the steroidogenic pathway through ERK1/2, STAR and CYP19A1 and modulating PCNA and BCL2 expressions in the GCs. Further experiments are warranted using Kp antagonist in different combinations to establish the signalling pathway in Kp-mediated steroidogenesis in the GCs for developing strategies to control ovarian functions.

AB  - PREMISE: The economically important, cosmopolitan soapberry family (Sapindaceae) comprises ca. 1900 species in 144 genera. Since the seminal work of Radlkofer, several authors have attempted to overcome challenges presented by the family's complex infra-familial classification. With the advent of molecular systematics, revisions of the various proposed groupings have provided significant momentum, but we still lack a formal classification system rooted in an evolutionary framework.
   METHODS: Nuclear DNA sequence data were generated for 123 genera (86%) of Sapindaceae using target sequence capture with the Angiosperms353 universal probe set. HybPiper was used to produce aligned DNA matrices. Phylogenetic inferences were obtained using coalescence-based and concatenated methods. The clades recovered are discussed in light of both benchmark studies to identify synapomorphies and distributional evidence to underpin an updated infra-familial classification.
   KEY RESULTS: Coalescence-based and concatenated phylogenetic trees had identical topologies and node support, except for the placement of Melicoccus bijugatus Jacq. Twenty-one clades were recovered, which serve as the basis for a revised infra-familial classification.
   CONCLUSIONS: Twenty tribes are recognized in four subfamilies: two tribes in Hippocastanoideae, two in Dodonaeoideae, and 16 in Sapindoideae (no tribes are recognized in the monotypic subfamily Xanthoceratoideae). Within Sapindoideae, six new tribes are described: Blomieae Buerki & Callm.; Guindilieae Buerki, Callm. & Acev.-Rodr.; Haplocoeleae Buerki & Callm.; Stadmanieae Buerki & Callm.; Tristiropsideae Buerki & Callm.; and Ungnadieae Buerki & Callm. This updated classification provides a backbone for further research and conservation efforts on this family.

AB  - Functional mapping during brain surgery is applied to define brain areas that control critical functions and cannot be removed. Currently, these procedures rely on verbal interactions between the neurosurgeon and electrophysiologist, which can be time-consuming. In addition, the electrode grids that are used to measure brain activity and to identify the boundaries of pathological versus functional brain regions have low resolution and limited conformity to the brain surface. Here, we present the development of an intracranial electroencephalogram (iEEG)-microdisplay that consists of freestanding arrays of 2048 GaN light-emitting diodes laminated on the back of micro-electrocorticography electrode grids. With a series of proof-of-concept experiments in rats and pigs, we demonstrate that these iEEG-microdisplays allowed us to perform real-time iEEG recordings and display cortical activities by spatially corresponding light patterns on the surface of the brain in the surgical field. Furthermore, iEEG-microdisplays allowed us to identify and display cortical landmarks and pathological activities from rat and pig models. Using a dual-color iEEG-microdisplay, we demonstrated coregistration of the functional cortical boundaries with one color and displayed the evolution of electrical potentials associated with epileptiform activity with another color. The iEEG-microdisplay holds promise to facilitate monitoring of pathological brain activity in clinical settings.

AB  - Asiatic acid is a natural triterpene found in Centella asiatica that acts as an effective free radical scavenger. Our previous research showed that asiatic acid delayed porcine oocyte ageing in vitro and improved preimplantation embryo development competence in vitro; however, the protective effects of asiatic acid against oxidative stress in porcine oocyte maturation are still unclear. Here, we investigated the effects of asiatic acid on porcine oocyte in vitro maturation (IVM) and subsequent embryonic development competence after parthenogenetic activation (PA) and in vitro fertilization (IVF). The results of the present research showed that 10 mM asiatic acid supplementation did not affect the expansion of cumulus cells or polar body extrusion of porcine oocytes, while asiatic acid application significantly increased the subsequent blastocyst formation rate and quality of porcine PA and IVF embryos. Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) is a reactive oxygen species (ROS) that induces oxidative stress in porcine oocytes. As expected, asiatic acid supplementation not only decreased intracellular ROS levels but also attenuated H2O2 induced intracellular ROS generation. Further analysis revealed that asiatic acid supplementation enhanced intracellular glutathione production, mitochondrial membrane potential, and ATP generation at the end of IVM. In summary, our results reveal that asiatic acid supplementation exerts beneficial effects on porcine oocytes by regulating oxidative stress during the IVM process and could act as a potential antioxidant in porcine oocytes matured in vitro production systems.

AB  - Excessive consumption of highly processed foods, such as chips, crisps, biscuits and coffee, exposes the human to different doses of acrylamide. This chemical compound has a multidirectional, adverse effect on human and animal health, including the central and peripheral nervous systems. In this study, we examined the effect of different doses of acrylamide on the enteric nervous system (ENS) of the porcine jejunum. Namely, we took into account the quantitative changes of neurons located in the jejunum wall expressing substance P (SP), galanin (GAL), a neuronal form of nitric oxide synthase (nNOS), the vesicular acetylcholine transporter (VAChT) and cocaine- and amphetamine-regulated transcript (CART). The obtained results indicate that acrylamide causes a statistically significant increase in the number of neurons immunoreactive to SP, GAL, VAChT and CART in all types of examined enteric plexuses and a significant drop in the population of nNOS-positive enteric neurons. Changes were significantly greater in the case of a high dose of acrylamide intoxication. Our results indicate that acrylamide is not indifferent to ENS neurons. A 28-day intoxication with this substance caused marked changes in the chemical coding of ENS neurons in the porcine jejunum.

AB  - The importance of social interactions has been reported in a variety of animal species. In human and rodent models, social isolation is known to alter social behaviors and change anxiety or depression levels. During the coronavirus pandemic, although people could communicate with each other through other sensory cues, social touch was mostly prohibited under different levels of physical distancing policies. These social restrictions inspired us to explore the necessity of physical contact, which has rarely been investigated in previous studies on mouse social interactions. We first conducted a long-term observation to show that pair-housed mice in a standard laboratory cage spent nearly half the day in direct physical contact with each other. Furthermore, we designed a split-housing condition to demonstrate that even with free access to visual, auditory, and olfactory social signals, the lack of social touch significantly increased anxiety-like behaviors and changed social behaviors. There were correspondingly higher levels of the pro-inflammatory cytokine interleukin-6 in the hippocampus in mice with no access to physical contact. Our study demonstrated the necessity of social touch for the maintenance of mental health in mice and could have important implications for human social interactions.

AB  - Plant-associated microbes have been reported as important but overlooked drivers of plant-herbivorous insect interactions. Influence of plant-associated microbes on plant-insect interactions is diverse, including beneficial, detrimental, and neutral. Here, we determined the effects of three Penicillium fungi, including Penicillium citrinum, Penicillium sumatrense, and Penicillium digitatum, on the oviposition selection and behavior of the yellow peach moth (YPM), Conogethes punctiferalis (Guenee). Compared with fungi noninfected apples (NIA), mechanically damaged apples (MDA), and P. citrinum in potato dextrose agar medium (PC), the oviposition selection and four-arm olfactometer experiments both showed that mated YPM females preferred to P. citrinum-infected apples (PCA). For P. sumatrense or P. digitatum, we also found that mated YPM females preferred to P. sumatrense-infected apples (PSA) or P. digitatum-infected apples (PDA), respectively. Among three Penicillium fungi-infected apples, the selection rates including oviposition and olfactometer behavior of mated YPM females on PDA were both higher than those on PSA and PCA. Further analyses of host plant volatile organic compounds (VOCs) by GC-MS showed that the absolute contents of ethyl hexanoate and (Z, E)-alpha-farnesene in PCA, PSA, and PDA were all higher than those in NIA, and a total of 16 novel VOCs were detected in fungi-infected apples (PCA, PSA, and PDA), indicating that fungi infection changed the components and proportions of apple VOCs. Taken together, three Penicillium fungi play significant roles in mediating the host selection of YPMs via altering the emissions of VOCs. These findings will be beneficial for developing formulations for field trapping of YPMs in the future.

AB  - Lime and Na2S, used in dehairing in the tannery industry, cause the generation of toxic wastes. Ecological security and financial issues demand a look for innovative approaches to leather dehairing free from pollution. The primary goal of this investigation was to explore keratinolytic protease producing bacteria from tannery waste, their genomic evaluation and to assess their possible use in the dehairing process. A newly isolated Gramnegative bacterium (LRI-TA6) was characterized and checked for its keratinolytic protease producing ability. The strain was identified as Chryseobacterium cucumeris through whole genome sequencing. The genome was 4,541,898 bp in size and contain 4,426 protein coding sequences (CDS) with 36.38 % of GC content. Twenty-five open reading frames (CDS) were found as protease producing genes notably DegQ (serine protease), DegS, and ATP-dependent protease DP (EC 3.4.21.-). The isolate revealed enzyme production throughout an extended pH range of 5.0 to 8.0, and a broad temperature range of 10 degrees C to 38 degrees C. The isolate LRI-TA6 was sensitive to all five antibiotics (amoxicillin, tetracycline, gentamicin, ciprofloxacin, and vancomycin) with zone diameter ranges from 17.2 f 0.8 to 32 f 0.0 mm. The enzyme was shown to have 29.9 f 6.7 and 83.6 f 0.2 U/ml of keratinolytic and proteolytic activity, respectively. By employing crude keratinase, the removal of hair from goat skin was accomplished in 18 h. This study is the first report to isolate and characterize C. cucumeris from tannery waste and also the amazing 18 h dehairing capabilities and thus might be utilized for further studies towards commercial synthesis of keratinase for use in leather processing sectors.

AB  - The apple snail Pomacea canaliculata is native to South America and has been introduced into many regions outside its natural range. Despite being one of the world's 100 worst invasive species, little is known about the pathologies caused by parasites other than digeneans. Here, we identify and characterize a xenoma-forming ciliate in P. canaliculata from three waterbodies in the province of Buenos Aires, Argentina, using histology, transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and molecular analyses. Under a stereomicroscope, the xenomas appeared individually as white nodules measuring up to 2 mm in diameter. Of the 133 snails examined by histology, 23 were infected with xenomas (17 %) that occupied the connective tissue of most organs, with 74 % of these were located in the kidney. Snails from the three water bodies were infected. The highest prevalence was observed in the Mar del Plata Port Reserve Pond (25 %), followed by Los Padres Lake (16.4 %) and Pig & uuml;e<acute accent>-Venado Channel (14.4 %). Of the infected snails, 70 % had a low infection intensity (fewer than 10 xenomas per slide). No significant inflammatory response was observed in host tissues. However, in specimens with xenoma accumulations, significant tissue changes were observed, including organ enlargement in the gill lamellae, mantle border, and lung, as well as tubule compression and connective tissue replacement in the digestive gland. The host cell becomes hypertrophied, and its nucleus disintegrates. Although no cilia were observed in histological sections, TEM analysis revealed that the organisms had cilia near the cytostome and around the body, a large food vacuole, a macronucleus, and a micronucleus. Phylogenetic analysis of the SSU rDNA sequence placed the ciliate in the class Phyllopharyngea, showing the closest relationship to an uncultured eukaryote identified by BLAST. This is the fifth record of xenoma-inducing ciliates in mollusks and the first report in a gastropod.

AB  - The only vaccine against Haemonchus contortus is limited by short-lived antibody persistence and the need for frequent booster immunizations. This study leveraged the advantages of nano-adjuvants in enhancing antigen presentation and immune regulation to evaluate the efficacy of novel adjuvants (IMX, AddaS03) and the conventional QuilA combined with H11 protein. Goats were divided into four groups (IMX + H11, AddaS03 + H11, QuilA + H11, and infected control). They were immunized three times and challenged with 6000 infective third-stage larvae (iL3s) of H. contortus on the day of the third immunization, with the experiment lasting for 98 days. The results showed that vaccination with IMX + H11 conferred the strongest protection, demonstrating 88.3% efficacy in fecal egg count (FEC) reduction and 75.8% efficacy against worm burden, followed by QuilA + H11 (85.2% FEC reduction and 68% worm burden reduction) and AddaS03 + H11 (79.4% FEC reduction and 61.3% worm burden reduction). Serum IgG analysis revealed high antibody levels in all immunized groups. Cytokine detection found that IMX + H11 significantly upregulated IL-2 and IFN-gamma expression in PBMCs and TNF-alpha expression in splenocytes, activating Th1-type responses and immune memory. QuilA + H11 showed weaker Th1 activation, and AddaS03 + H11 faced limitations due to insufficient antibody persistence for long-term protection. These findings suggest that IMX can induce highly efficient humoral and cellular immunity, providing a new direction for the optimization of H. contortus vaccines and suggesting the importance of nano-adjuvants for precise regulation of immune patterns.

AB  - Simple Summary: The brown planthopper is a major rice pest in Asia that causes extensive damage where farmers apply large amounts of nitrogenous fertilizers. Over the last 50 years, host-plant resistance, i.e., a plant's ability to deter planthoppers or reduce their survival and reproduction, has been the main focus of public research into planthopper management. However, there have been calls for increased attention to issues of rice tolerance against the planthopper, i.e., a plant's ability to withstand attack and compensate for damage. We examined the interactions between planthoppers and 16 varieties of rice under varying levels of soil nitrogen. The varieties included susceptible, resistant and tolerant lines. We found that nitrogen generally increased planthopper fitness across the varieties; however, relative resistance was maintained in varieties with major resistance genes. Functional plant loss was found to be greatest in susceptible varieties after planthopper attack, and generally declined in resistant and tolerant varieties under increasing nitrogen levels. This increase in tolerance was most apparent among resistant and moderately resistant, large-sized, fast-growing varieties that were capable of overcoming relatively high weight and growth rate reductions.The brown planthopper, Nilaparvata lugens (Stal), is a key challenge to rice production in Asia. Outbreaks of planthoppers are associated with excessive fertilizer applications; consequently, we examined planthopper interactions with susceptible, tolerant and resistant varieties of rice under varying levels of soil nitrogen in a greenhouse experiment. We compared planthopper fitness (survival x reproduction) and plant tolerance (functional plant loss index) for 16 varieties at 0, 80 and 150 Kg added nitrogen ha(-1). The planthoppers grew larger, developed more quickly and laid more eggs on susceptible varieties, compared with the resistant and tolerant varieties. Moreover, soil nitrogen generally increased planthopper fitness on resistant varieties, but relative resistance was maintained. Functional plant loss was highest among the susceptible varieties, but weight and growth rate reductions per mg of planthopper were often highest in the tolerant varieties. Tolerance was associated with large, fast-growing plants, with at least moderate resistance to the planthopper. Susceptibility was associated with a small size and/or an absence of resistance genes. Our results suggested that early-tillering rice plants can be both resistant and tolerant to the brown planthopper, but cannot be both susceptible and tolerant of planthoppers at high densities. This indicates that at least moderate resistance is required for tolerance against this herbivore. Furthermore, although dwarf varieties had a low tolerance of planthoppers, they could express resistance through functioning resistance genes.

AB  - Circulating tumor cells (CTCs) are important precursors of colorectal cancer (CRC) metastasis. The epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) process facilitates CTC invasion by allowing these cells to evade antimetastatic checkpoints to mediate distant metastasis. However, the specific molecular mechanism of tumor EMT remains largely unknown. Based on our previous research on the YAP1 pathway, we further studied the upstream molecule small nucleolar RNA host gene 16 (SNHG16), whose expression was correlated with advanced TNM stage, distant metastasis, and poor prognosis in CRC patients. Furthermore, loss-and gain-of-function assays revealed that SNHG16 promoted CRC colony formation, proliferation, migration, invasion, EMT, mesenchymal-like CTC generation, and liver metastasis through YAP1. Mechanistically, SNHG16 acted as a miRNA sponge to sequester miR-195-5p on Ago2, thereby protecting YAP1 from repression. Moreover, YAP1 bound TEA domain transcription factor 1 (TEAD1) to form a YAP1/TEAD1 complex, which in turn bound two sites in the promoter of SNHG16 and regulate SNHG16 transcription. Finally, in vivo experiments showed that the inhibition of SNHG16 suppressed tumor progression, and that YAP1 rescued the effect of SNHG16 on tumor progression. Herein, we have clarified a hitherto unexplored SNHG16-YAP1/TEAD1 positive feedback loop, that may be a candidate target for CRC treatment.

AB  - Cellulose is essential in the growth and development of herbivores. However, its limited utilization by herbivores is a key factor restricting their feed conversion rates. Cellulase can hydrolyze cellulose into glucose, and the addition of exogenous cellulase preparations to feed is an effective method for improving the cellulose utilization rate of ruminants. Nevertheless, the decomposition efficiency of exogenous cellulase is unstable and susceptible to various external factors. In this study, the endoglucanase III gene from Apriona germari (AgEGase III) was introduced into silkworms to investigate whether transgenic silkworms with cellulose-digesting capabilities outperformed normal silkworms in terms of growth, reproduction, and economic traits. The results show that the transgenic silkworms exhibited increased body size, weight, feeding efficiency, and digestibility compared to the wild-type silkworms. The cocoon weight, shell weight, cocoon-shell ratio, and pupa weight were notably elevated by 11%, 37%, 23%, and 9%, respectively. Additionally, the egg weight and egg-laying quantity of the female moth were also significantly increased compared to those of the wild type. Furthermore, feeding transgenic silkworms with an artificial feed containing additional cellulose demonstrated their ability to digest and utilize cellulose, leading to improved growth and development. This study offers theoretical support for the development of transgenic ruminant species that express cellulolytic enzymes.

AB  - Simple Summary We studied the activity patterns, population dynamics, and spatial distribution of Dendrothrips minowai Priesner, one of the most destructive pests of tea plants in tea plantations. A large proportion of D. minowai individuals were caught in traps placed at heights ranging from 5 cm below to 25 cm above the position of tender leaves at the top of the tea plant, with most captures at a height of 10 cm above this position. The flight activity of D. minowai was highest from 10:00 to 16:00 h on sunny days in the spring and from 06:00 to 10:00 h and from 16:00 to 20:00 h in the summer. The distributions of D. minowai females and nymphs on leaves were aggregated according to Taylor's power law and Lloyd's patchiness index. The D. minowai populations were dominated by females, and the density of males was high in June. The seasonal prevalence of tea thrips captured with sticky traps in the field was bimodal; adult thrips overwintered on the bottom leaves. The peak periods of activity were from April to June and from August to October. This work provides new insights that have implications for enhancing the efficacy of measures to control D. minowai. The stick tea thrips, D. minowai Priesner (Thysanoptera: Thripidae), is one of the most economically significant thrips pests of tea (Camellia sinensis (L.) O. Ktze.) in China. Here, we sampled D. minowai in tea plantations from 2019 to 2022 to characterize its activity patterns, population dynamics, and spatial distribution. A large proportion of D. minowai individuals were caught in traps placed at heights ranging from 5 cm below to 25 cm above the position of tender leaves at the top of the tea plant, and the greatest number of individuals were captured at a height of 10 cm from the position of tender leaves at the top of the tea plant. Thrips were most abundant from 10:00 to 16:00 h in the spring and from 06:00 to 10:00 h and from 16:00 to 20:00 h on sunny days in the summer. The spatial distribution of D. minowai females and nymphs was aggregated on leaves according to Taylor's power law (females: R-2 = 0.92, b = 1.69 > 1; nymphs: R-2 = 0.91, b = 2.29 > 1) and Lloyd's patchiness index (females and nymphs: C > 1, Ca > 0, I > 0, M*/m > 1). The D. minowai population was dominated by females, and male density increased in June. Adult thrips overwintered on the bottom leaves, and they were most abundant from April to June and from August to October. Our findings will aid efforts to control D. minowai populations.

AB  - Melatonin, a major signal of the circadian system, is also involved in brain functions such as learning and memory. Chronic melatonin treatment is known to improve memory performances, but the respective contribution of its central receptors, MT1 and MT2, is still unclear. Here, we used new single receptor deficient MT(1)(-/-)and MT(2)(-/-)mice to investigate the contribution of each receptor in the positive effect of chronic melatonin treatment on long-term recognition memory. The lack of MT2 receptor precluded memory-enhancing effect of melatonin in the object recognition task and to a lesser extent in the object location task, whereas the lack of MT1 receptor mitigated its effect in the object location task only. Our findings support a key role of MT2 in mediating melatonin's beneficial action on long-term object recognition memory, whereas MT1 may contribute to the effect on object location memory.

AB  - Glutamate dehydrogenase (GDH) is a central enzyme in nitrogen metabolism, assimilating ammonia into glutamine or deaminating glutamate into alpha-oxoglutarate. Tea (Camellia sinensis L.) plants assimilate ammonium efficiently, but the role of CsGDH in ammonium assimilation remains unclear. We confirmed that tea has three GDH isogenes: CsGDH1-3. Bioinformatic analysis showed that CsGDH1 encodes the beta-GDH subunit, CsGDH2/3 encode the alpha-GDH subunit, and their proteins all feature an NADH-specific motif. CsGDH1 is mainly expressed in mature leaves and roots, CsGDH3 is mainly expressed in new shoots and roots, and CsGDH2 has the highest expression level in flowers compared to the other five tissues. Expression patterns of CsGDHs and glutamine synthetase isogenes (CsGSs) under different ammonium concentrations suggested that CsGDHs cooperate with CsGSs to assimilate ammonium, especially under high ammonium conditions. Inhibition of GS and its isogenes resulted in significant induction of CsGDH3 in roots and CsGDH2 in leaves, indicating their potential roles in ammonium assimilation. Moreover, CsGDHs transcripts were highly abundant in chlorotic tea leaves, in constrast to those of CsGSs, suggesting that CsGDHs play a vital role in ammonium assimilation in chlorotic tea mutant. Altogether, our circumstantial evidence that CsGDHs cooperate with CsGSs in ammonium assimilation provides a basis for unveiling their functions in tea plants.

AB  - Using sodium chloride (NaCl) for de-icing roads is known to have severe consequences on freshwater organisms when washed into water bodies. N-(1,3-dimethylbutyl)-N '-phenyl-p-phenylenediamine, also known as 6PPD, is an antiozonant mainly found in automobile tire rubber to prevent ozone mediated cracking or wear-out. Especially the ozonated derivate, 6PPD-quinone, which is washed into streams after storm events, has been found to be toxic for coho salmon. Studies on other freshwater organisms could not confirm those findings, pointing towards distinct species-specific differences. Storm events result in greater run-offs from all water-soluble contaminants into freshwater bodies, potentially enhancing the concentrations of both chloride and 6PPD during winter. Here we show that these two contaminants have synergistic negative effects on the population growth of the rotifer Brachionus calyciflorus, a common freshwater herbivore. Hence, while only high concentrations of 6PPD and even higher concentrations of 6PPD-quinone, beyond environmentally relevant concentrations, had lethal effects on rotifers, the addition of NaCl enhanced the sensitivity of the rotifers towards the application of 6PPD so that their negative effects were more pronounced at lower concentrations. Similarly, 6PPD increased the lethal effect of NaCl. Our results support the species-specific toxicity of 6PPD and demonstrate a synergistic effect of the antiozonant on the toxicity of other environmentally relevant stressors, such as road salt contamination.

AB  - Background: Polar lipids from dairy are novel sources of energy that may replace other dietary lipids and impact plasma lipidomic profiles in piglets. This study evaluated the impact of feeding diets rich in polar lipids on the plasma lipidome of piglets during the weaning period. Material and Methods: Weaned male piglets (n = 240; 21 days of age; 6.3 +/- 0.5 kg of BW) were blocked by initial weight and distributed into 48 pens of five animals each in a complete randomized block design with a 2 x 3 factorial arrangement of treatments as follows: a plant-based diet rich in neutral lipids from soybeans (24 pens; SD) or a polar lipid-rich diet by-product of cheese making (24 pens; PD) from weaning until the 21st day of the nursery phase. Within each diet group, animals received one of three milk replacers (MR; 0.5 L/d/animal) for the first 7 days after weaning: (1) commercial MR containing animal and coconut lipids (CO); (2) polar lipid-based MR (PO); or (3) soybean lipids-based MR (SO). Results: The PD diet group increased the plasma concentrations of sphingolipids, phospholipids, and cholesterol esters, but did not impact the concentrations of glycerolipids (GLs). Both the PO and CO milk replacers increased the plasma concentrations of ceramide, acyl-chain phosphatidyl choline, and cholesterol esters. The plasma concentrations of GLs containing 18-carbon fatty acids such as 18:0, 18:1, 18:2, and 18:3, were higher in SD, whereas GLs containing 16:0 and 20:3 were higher in PD. Conclusions: In summary, the diet lipid type significantly modulated the plasma lipid composition in piglets 7 days after weaning. The dietary inclusion of polar lipids in diets for growing pigs can modulate the plasma lipidomic profile, relative to plant-based diets rich in soybean lipids. Cost may be a major consideration when using these lipids in pig diets. Their health benefits need to be further characterized in other models of stress and inflammation.

AB  - Porcine epidemic diarrhea (PED) is an acute, highly contagious, and infectious disease caused by porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV). PEDV can affect pigs of all ages, with 50 similar to 100% mortality in neonatal piglets and substantial economic losses in the swine industry. In the present study, 347 fecal and intestinal samples were collected from seven regions in China during 2020-2022. A comprehensive molecular investigation of the spike (S) gene of PEDV strains was carried out, which included phylogenetic analysis of the obtained PEDV sequences. Epidemiological surveillance data indicate that the GIIc subgroup strains are widely distributed among pigs. A PEDV strain was successfully isolated from positive small intestine samples and identified through RT-PCR detection using specific N gene primers of PEDV, indirect immunofluorescence assay (IFA), TEM analysis, genome sequencing, and full-length S gene analysis, named PEDV/SC/2022. RDP and SimPlot analysis showed that the isolate originated from the recombination of PEDV/AH2012 and PEDV/AJ1102. In conclusion, our findings contribute to the current understanding of PEDV epidemiology and provide valuable information for the control of PED outbreaks in China.

AB  - The Alzheimer's disease leads to neurodegenerative processes and affecting negatively million people worldwide. The treatment of the disease is still difficult and incomplete in practice. Galanthamine is one of the most commonly used drugs against the illness. The main aim of this work is design and synthesis of new derivatives of galanthamine comprising peptide moiety as well as study of their beta-secretase inhibitory activity and the anti-aggregating effect. All new derivatives of galanthamine containing analogues of Leu-Val-Phe-Phe (A beta 17-A beta 20) were synthesized in solution using fragment and consecutive condensation approaches. The new derivatives were characterized by melting points, NMR, and HPLC/MS. They were tested in vitro for beta-secretase inhibition activity by means of fluorescent method and were investigated in vitro for anti-aggregation activity on sheep platelet-rich plasma. Although the new compounds do not contain a structural element responsible for the beta-secretase inhibition, five of them show high or good beta-secretase inhibitory activity between 19.98 and 51.19% with IC50 between 1.95 and 5.26 nM. Four of the new molecules were able to inhibit platelet aggregation between 55.0 and 90.0% with IC50 between 0.69 and 1.36 mu M. Four of the compounds were able to inhibit platelet aggregation and two of them have high anti-aggregating effects.

AB  - Simple Summary: Midline2 (MID2) is widely involved in development, innate immunity, cancer, viral infections, and disease, but its role in pigs remains unexplored. In this study, we describe the structure and function of porcine MID2. Our results revealed that the gene of pMID2 is highly conserved with human and other vertebrate animals and its expression is started by NF-kappa B. pMID2 is distributed in cell membrane and cytoplasm and widely expressed in pig lung, spleen, and other organs. Moreover, pMID2 could enhance the activity of the ISRE promoter, and is mainly involved in the JAK-STAT signaling pathway. The above findings provide useful information for studying the function of pMID2 in pigs. Midline2 (MID2/TRIM1) is a member of the tripartite motif-containing (TRIM) family, which is involved in a wide range of cellular processes. However, fundamental studies on porcine MID2 (pMID2) are still lacking. In this study, we identified and characterized the full length MID2 gene of pig (Sus scrofa). The sequence alignment analysis results showed that pMID2 had an N-terminal RING zinc-finger domain, BBC domain, and C-terminal COS box, FN3 motif, and PRY-SPRY domain that were conserved and similar to those of other vertebrates. Furthermore, pMID2 had the highest expression levels in porcine lung and spleen. Serial deletion and site-directed mutagenesis showed that the putative nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kappa B) binding site may be an essential transcription factor for regulating the transcription expression of pMID2. Furthermore, the immunofluorescence assay indicated that pMID2 presented in the cell membrane and cytoplasm. To further study the functions of pMID2, we identified and determined its potential ability to perceive poly (I:C) and IFN-alpha stimulation. Stimulation experiments showed pMID2 enhanced poly (I:C)-/IFN-alpha-induced JAK-STAT signaling pathway, indicating that pMID2 might participate in the immune responses. In conclusion, we systematically and comprehensively analyzed the characterizations and functions of pMID2, which provide valuable information to explore the pMID2 functions in innate immunity. Our findings not only enrich the current knowledge of MID2 in IFN signaling regulation but also offer the basis for future research of pig MID2 gene.

AB  - Alchemilla kiwuensis Engl. (Rosaceae) (A. kiwuensis) is an herbaceous plant traditionally used by Cameroonians to treat epilepsy and other central nervous system disorders. The present study evaluated the antiepileptogenic and antiepileptic effects of A. kiwuensis (40 mg/kg, 80 mg/kg) following Pentylenetetrazole (PTZ)-induced kindling as well as its sub-chronic toxicity. Following an initial i.p administration of a challenge dose (70 mg/kg), Wistar rats of both sexes received sub convulsive doses (35 mg/kg) of PTZ every other day, one hour after the oral gavage of animals with treatments, until two consecutive stage 4, in all animals of negative control. Seizure progression, latency, duration, and repetition were noted. Twenty-four hours later, animals were dissected to extract their hippocampi. The resulting homogenates were used to evaluate Malondialdehyde, reduced glutathione, catalase activity, GABA, GABA-Transaminase, glutamate, glutamate transporter 2, IL-1 & beta; and TGF-1 & beta;. Sub-chronic toxicity was conducted according to OECD 407 guidelines. The lyophilisate of A. kiwuensis significantly increased the latency of seizure appearance, delayed seizure progression and decreased seizure repetition and duration. Biochemical analysis revealed that the lyophilisate significantly increased the catalase activity, reduced glutathione, GABA, glutamate transporter 2 and TGF-1B levels. The lyophilisate equally caused a significant decreased in the GABA-Transaminase activity, malondialdehyde, and IL-1 & beta; levels. There was no noticeable sign of toxicity. A. kiwuensis possesses antiepileptic and antiepiletogenic effects by enhancing GABAergic neurotransmission and antioxidant properties, coupled to modulation of glutamatergic and neuroinflammatory pathways and is innocuous in a sub-chronic model. These justifies its local use for the treatment of epilepsy.

AB  - Coastal areas are usually characterized by a high human population with attendant groundwater pollution through increased salinization from varied sources. This study was done to assess the pollution status, suitability of groundwater and associated hydrogeochemical processes of the shallow sandy aquifer near the coastal section of Lagos State, Southwestern Nigeria. A total of fifty-nine hand-dug wells were randomly selected, from which water samples were collected and subjected to physicochemical and statistical analyses. Water quality indices (Pollution Index of Groundwater (PIG) and Irrigation quality indices) and Chloro-Alkaline Indices (CAI 1&2) were calculated while plots of Gibbs and Piper diagrams as well as factor analysis were also carried out. The order of abundance of dissolved ions were Na > Ca > Mg > K for cations and HCO3>Cl > SO4>NO3 for anions. Presently, there appears to be no pollution threat to the groundwater, and the bulk of the samples are found fit for agricultural use. Rock weathering, ion exchange, occasional sea surge and municipal contamination activities constitute the geochemical processes affecting the groundwater quality in the study area. It could be postulated that consistent activities of sea water surge and municipal contamination might impair the groundwater quality of the sandy aquifers in the nearest future.

AB  - This work shows the results of an experimental campaign aimed at selecting earth-based sustainable mixes for 3D printing. For this scope, 18 mixes were realized, varying the types of components, their amount in the mix and the hydration rate. Specifically, the analyzed components are locally-available soil, hydraulic lime binder, unaltered rice husk, shredded rice husk, marble waste dust, municipal solid waste incinerator bottom ash, silica sand, and natural fibers, including jute, coconut, sisal and goat hair. Each mix was tested in terms of printability via a preliminary test, then compressive and flexural strength were measured at 28 days, and lastly shrinkage was experimentally investigated. Among the analyzed mixes, two of them were further optimized to realize some 3D printed blocks and verify their effective printability in a full-scale construction project. Results demonstrated that it is possible to obtain mixes with relatively good strength and limited shrinkage. According to a multi-criteria efficiency evaluation carried out here, it was possible to evaluate which mix performs best, considering the mechanical performance, the economic price and the carbon footprint of each mix. Particularly, a mixture containing lime as binder and sisal as long fibers allows attaining a compressive strength of 1.26 MPa, embodied carbon of about 0.05239 kgCO2eq/kg with a selling price of 0.137euro/kg, being the most efficient one. Instead, the optimized mixture used for real-scale printing achieved 11.04 MPa of compressive and 1.26 MPa of flexural strength.

AB  - In addition to the antidepressant properties of ketamine at subanesthetic doses, studies have revealed ketamine's influence on memory acquisition, consolidation, and reconsolidation. The effects of acute low-dose ketamine administration on conditioned memory have been investigated extensively in rodents through conditioned fear memory and morphine-induced conditioned place preference. In contrast to conditioned memory, the novel object recognition (NOR) task assesses the natural format of memory by exploiting the rodents' natural preference for novelty. Acute low-dose ketamine administration impairs NOR acquisition and consolidation, but its influence on reconsolidation remains unclear. We investigated the issue as well as the involvement of BDNF/TrkB pathway in this process by administering ketamine (i.p., 10 mg/kg, immediately or 6 h after reactivation, or without reactivation) and ANA-12 (i.p., 0.5 mg/kg, 5 min after ketamine/vehicle administration). ANA-12 is a selective antagonist for the BDNF TrkB receptor. Ketamine administration, immediately after (rather than without) reactivation, significantly increased the NOR preference index, thus suggesting an enhanced memory reconsolidation rather than consolidation. Ketamine exerted no significant effect when administered 6 h after reactivation, thereby suggesting 6 h to be an effective time window. ANA-12 administration significantly reduced the ketamine-induced NOR preference index increase, thus suggesting that the blockage of ketamine improves NOR reconsolidation. However, this blockage had no significant effect on the ketamine-induced hippocampal BDNF level increase. In conclusion, acute low-dose ketamine administration improves NOR memory reconsolidation by increasing hippocampal BDNF levels and subsequent BDNF binding to the TrkB receptor.

AB  - Accurate machine learning streamflow prediction often requires coupling data-driven models with preprocessing techniques. This study aims to improve the performance of deep learning (DL) models, including long short-term memory, recurrent neural network (RNN), and gated recurrent unit (GRU) by incorporating maximal overlap discrete wavelet entropy transform (MODWET) techniques for streamflow forecasting. The merit of MODWET over maximal overlap discrete wavelet transform (MODWT) is that MODWET utilizes Entropy to determine the optimal decomposition level and suitable wavelet function, which was an unaddressed problem in wavelet-based decomposition models. Suitable decomposition level prevents providing unnecessary information or missing essential information. In this study we show that a unique decomposition level and wavelet filter is not suitable for any dataset. The research focuses on monthly streamflow data from three case studies in the CAMEL dataset in the USA. The accuracy of the models is evaluated using statistical measures such as Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE), root-mean-squared error, percent bias, and correlation coefficient (r). To determine the optimal model, a Taylor diagram is utilized. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of coupling MODWET with DL models in flood forecasting. Furthermore, genetic programming (GP) and partial correlation index (PCI) are employed for predictor selection. Hybrid models, namely MODWET-GP-GRU (NSE of 0.83), MODWET-GP-RNN (NSE of 0.95), and MODWET-PCI-GRU (NSE of 0.95), outperform simple DL models in terms of NSE and Taylor diagram evaluation. This study emphasizes the potential of hybrid models that combine DL algorithms with the recently proposed MODWET technique for streamflow prediction.

AB  - Both FoxO transcription factors and the circadian clock act on the interface of metabolism and cell cycle regulation and are important regulators of cellular stress and stem cell homeostasis. Importantly, FoxO3 preserves the adult neural stem cell population by regulating cell cycle and cellular metabolism and has been shown to regulate circadian rhythms in the liver. However, whether FoxO3 is a regulator of circadian rhythms in neural stem cells remains unknown. Here, we show that loss of FoxO3 disrupts circadian rhythmicity in cultures of neural stem cells, an effect that is mediated via regulation of Clock transcriptional levels. Using Rev-Erb & alpha;-VNP as a reporter, we then demonstrate that loss of FoxO3 does not disrupt circadian rhythmicity at the single cell level. A meta-analysis of published data revealed dynamic co-occupancy of multiple circadian clock components within FoxO3 regulatory regions, indicating that FoxO3 is a Clock-controlled gene. Finally, we examined proliferation in the hippocampus of FoxO3-deficient mice and found that loss of FoxO3 delayed the circadian phase of hippocampal proliferation, indicating that FoxO3 regulates correct timing of NSC proliferation. Taken together, our data suggest that FoxO3 is an integral part of circadian regulation of neural stem cell homeostasis.

AB  - While direct effects of biopesticides, such as those of plant and microbial origin, on various organisms have been extensively documented, the interactions between biopesticides and plants have been largely neglected. Plant-based (bio) pesticides can include metabolites that signal stress or imminent herbivore attack, activating plant signaling pathways and gene expression involved in antiherbivore defenses. Similarly, entomopathogenic microbes can adopt an endophytic lifestyle, colonizing or being recognized by crop plants and inducing a primed state that makes plants more resistant to subsequent arthropod pest infestations. Besides effects within the biopesticide-treated plants, we predict that biopesticides can influence multitrophic interactions in the agroecosystem due to their interactions between treated and neighboring nontreated plants, as well as indirect effects from volatile organic compounds released by biopesticides on the plant surface, which arthropod pests and their natural enemies use as cues for finding hosts or food resources. Here we review and interpret empirical studies examining plant-mediated effects and indirect effects of biopesticides on arthropod pests and their entomophagous biological control agents in the context of pest management. Unlike synthetic pesticides, most studies indicate conducive effects of biopesticides for pest management, considering the interactions among plants, pests, and natural enemies. However, further efforts to understand plant-mediated and indirect effects of biopes ticides on interactions with natural enemies and plant-plant communication are needed to optimize their use in sustainable pest management strategies.

AB  - Simple Summary New-born piglets often fail to thrive during suckling without any obvious signs of clinical disease, which causes significant economic loss and suffering. This is, in part, caused by enhanced production values, with too many piglets produced for the sow to provide adequate nutrition to its offspring. These piglets may not be receiving enough milk from the sow and may be removed to controlled environment pens and fed a complete commercial milk replacer to provide adequate nutrition and enhanced care. However, milk replacers do not traditionally contain the milk sugars found in sow milk that stimulate the development of a healthy immune system and gut microbiota. In this study, the effects of supplementing milk replacer with simple milk sugars on gut health, the microbiome and immune-protective goblet cells were investigated. Commercial milk replacer supplemented with milk sugars significantly increased the abundance of beneficial gut bacteria, improved gut health and the numbers of protective immune goblet cells. Results indicate that milk sugars given in milk replacer may be a useful addition in the husbandry of non-thriving, poorly performing piglets when moved to environmentally controlled pens away from sows and fit siblings by modulating their microbiome and gut health performance. Poorly performing piglets receiving commercial milk replacers do not benefit from the naturally occurring probiotic galacto-oligosaccharides otherwise found in sow milk. Study objectives were to investigate the effects of complete milk replacer supplemented with galacto-oligosaccharides on the microbiome, gut architecture and immunomodulatory goblet cell expression of poorly performing piglets that could benefit from milk replacement feeding when separated from sows and housed with fit siblings in environmentally controlled pens. The study is novel in that it is one of the first to investigate the effects of supplementing complete milk replacer with galacto-oligosaccharides in poorly performing piglets. Gastrointestinal tract samples were collected from piglets, and the microbiome composition was assessed by 16s ribosomal ribonucleic acid gene sequencing. Gut architectural features, villus/crypt ratio and enumeration of goblet cells in tissues were assessed by histopathological techniques. The most abundant taxa identified at the genus level were Lactobacillus, Streptococcus, Prevotella, Lactococcus and Leuconostoc. Milk replacer plus galacto-oligosaccharides significantly improved gut architectural features and villus/crypt ratio throughout the gastrointestinal tract, increased the number of goblet cells and revealed a differential abundance of beneficial probiotic bacteria, particularly Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium. In these respects, galacto-oligosaccharide-supplemented milk replacer may be a useful addition to animal husbandry in poorly performing, non-thriving animals when moved to environmentally controlled pens away from sows and fit siblings, thereby modulating the microbiome and gastrointestinal tract performance.

AB  - Chronic pancreatitis (CP) is an irreversible and progressive inflammatory disease. Knowledge on the development and progression of CP is limited. The goal of the study was to define the serum profile of pro-inflammatory cytokines and the cell antioxidant defense system (superoxidase dismutase-SOD, and reduced glutathione-GSH) over time in a cerulein-induced CP model and explore the impact of these changes on selected cytokines in the intestinal mucosa and pancreatic tissue, as well as on selected serum biochemical parameters. The mRNA expression of CLDN1 and CDH1 genes, and levels of Claudin-1 and E-cadherin, proteins of gut barrier, in the intestinal mucosa were determined via western blot analysis. The study showed moderate pathomorphological changes in the pigs' pancreas 43 days after the last cerulein injection. Blood serum levels of interleukin (IL)-1-beta, IL-6, tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha), C-reactive protein (CRP), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase (GGTP), SOD and GSH were increased following cerulein injections. IL-1-beta, IL-6, TNF-alpha and GSH were also increased in jejunal mucosa and pancreatic tissue. In duodenum, decreased mRNA expression of CDH1 and level of E-cadherin and increased D-lactate, an indicator of leaky gut, indicating an inflammatory state, were observed. Based on the current results, we can conclude that repetitive cerulein injections in growing pigs not only led to CP over time, but also induced inflammation in the intestine. As a result of the inflammation, the intestinal barrier was impaired.

AB  - Emotional contagion refers to the sharing of emotional states between individuals and can cause depressive behaviors in healthy persons who live with depressed individuals. Negative emotional contagion has been observed in animal models, but the vast majority of studies are short-term and bear little resemblance to long-term human relationships. Thus, the first aim of this study was to establish an animal model of stress-induced negative emotional contagion that develops across time and between pairs. To accomplish this, we tested the hypothesis that sedentary male rats that cohabitate for five weeks with a stress-exposed female will exhibit a depression-like phenotype that is observable on behavioral and physiological measures. In addition, drawing from a comprehensive literature that describes the beneficial effects of prior exercise on stress-related behavior, we tested our second hypothesis that in males that were paired with a stressed female, prior voluntary exercise will diminish the impact of negative emotional contagion. We found that pair housing a healthy male with a stressed female led to emotional contagion; males gained less body weight, were anhedonic, demonstrated heightened anxiety-like behavior, had lower serum brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) levels, had decreased hippocampal BDNF-stimulated tyrosine receptor kinase B (TrkB) signaling and had increased pro-inflammatory cytokine expression in the hippocampus. For the most part, the five-week exercise window that occurred prior to pair housing had few effects in non-stress paired rats, but had partial, yet substantial protective effects in rats that were pair-housed with a stressed female. Specifically, stress-paired, exercised rats showed less depressive-like behavior, had partially preserved hippocampal BDNF-stimulated TrkB signaling, had normalized serum BDNF concentration, and had hippocampal cytokine and immediate early gene levels that were equivalent to controls. These preclinical findings introduce a new model of negative emotional contagion between dyads of male-female rats and support the view that inclusion of exercise programs would be beneficial for persons that may, in the future, be susceptible to negative emotional contagion.

AB  - Long-term monitoring networks that generate data on pest abundance are the foundation of integrated pest management. Monitoring can estimate local risk from pests and identify when pests first arrive in particular fields. However, while data on pest abundance are collected for the purpose of making management decisions in individual fields, it is often unclear how such data can be used to make landscape scale predictions of risk from pests. We addressed this by using inverse-distance weighted interpolation models to generate predictions of abundance for multiple potato crop pests from long-term monitoring data. Specifically, we collected 30,999 abundance datapoints of four pests for 4 to 11 years and used interpolation to predict abundance of each pest across a 40,250 km(2) area; these predictions were compared to observed pest data to validate our approach. We show predicted pest abundance was strongly and positively correlated with observed abundance for each of the four pests studied, with Spearman rank correlations from 0.5 to 0.8. Moreover, our interpolation approach was robust to variation in the type of monitoring data used, although interpolation parameters that produced the best fit to observed data differed slightly across species and ranged from 1 to 2. This suggests that variation in the biological traits of pests can affect interpolation models, and that models should be tailored to individual species. Overall, our study shows that interpolation is a powerful tool to integrate pest monitoring data into predictive maps that can guide management for crop pests across broad spatial scales.

AB  - Porcine skeletal muscle development is closely linked to meat production efficiency and quality. The accumulation of porcine intramuscular fat is influenced by the hyperplasia and hypertrophy of adipocytes within the muscle. However, the cellular profiles corresponding to the two stages of muscle development remain undetermined. Single-nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq) can elucidate cell subsets in tissues, capture gene expression at the individual cell level, and provide innovative perspectives for studying muscle and intramuscular fat formation. In this study, a total of 78,302 nuclei and 9 clusters of cells, which included fibro/adipogenic progenitor (FAP), myonuclei, adipocytes, and other cell types, of Xidu black pigs, were identified on Day 1 and Day 180. The pattern of cell clustering varied between the two developmental stages. Notably, the percentage of adipocytes in the Day 180 group was higher than in the Day 1 group (0.51% vs. 0.15%). Pseudo-time sequence analysis indicated that FAPs could differentiate into adipocytes and myonuclei cells, respectively. The THRSP gene was identified as a biomarker for swine intramuscular fat cells, and its down-regulation resulted in significant reduction in lipid droplet formation in porcine preadipocytes. Our research provides new insights into the cellular characteristics of intramuscular fat formation, which may facilitate the development of novel strategies to enhance intramuscular fat deposition and improve pork quality.

AB  - Simple Summary: Published data on the influence of corn particle size (PS) and conditioning temperature (CT) on the performance of broilers are limited. Corn provides a high-energy feed ingredient for broiler chicken diets and is usually ground before being incorporated into mash diets. On the other hand, several factors, including items that are related to assay methodology, bird factors, and dietary factors, e.g., PS and processing, can influence the nutrient utilization of poultry, ultimately affecting the performance of broiler chickens. The aim of this present study was to investigate the interactive impacts of corn PS and CT growth performance, carcass traits, intestinal morphology and immune system in broiler chickens. The results showed that the PS and the CT affected the growth performance of broiler chickens, and this issue shows that feed-producing companies should pay attention to the PS of feed mills, especially corn, as well as the CT. This study aimed to investigate the interactions between corn particle size (PS) and conditioning temperature (CT) on the performance, carcass traits, intestinal morphology, and immune responses in broilers fed a corn-soybean meal-based diet. A total of 360 one-day-old male broiler chicks (Ross 308) were randomly allocated into six dietary treatments in a 2 x 3 factorial arrangement, consisting of two corn PS (finely ground with geometric mean diameter (GMD) of 357 mu m (PSF) vs. coarsely ground corn with GMD of 737 mu m (PSC), and three CT [unconditioned (CTU), conditioned at 75 degree celsius (CT75) and 90 degree celsius (CT90)]. Birds were accommodated in 30 pens with five replicates and 12 chicks per each pen. There was no interaction between corn PS and CT on the growth performance and immune response of broilers at any growth phases. However, during the starter (0-10 days) period, the average daily weight gain (ADWG) and feed conversion ratio (FCR) of PSF-fed birds were significantly improved compared to those fed PSC (p < 0.05). During the starter (0-10 days) and grower (11-24 days) periods, increasing the conditioning temperature of corn increased the ADWG, while in the starter phase only the CT75 caused a lower FCR (p < 0.05). Broilers fed PSF corn showed the lowest FCR during the finisher (25-42 days) period compared to those fed PSC (p < 0.05). Conditioning corn at 75 degree celsius reduced FCR during the finisher (25-42 days) period compared to the birds fed CTU and CT90 corn (p < 0.05). In whole experimental periods (1-42 days), PSF and CT75 treatment increased the ADWG compared to the PSC and CTU (p < 0.05). The CT75 treatment improved primary total anti-sheep red blood cell (SRBCs) titer (IgT) and IgM and secondary IgT and IgG responses compared to the other experimental groups (CTU and CT90) (p < 0.05). No significant PS x CT interaction was found on the Newcastle disease (ND) antibody titer of broiler chickens (p > 0.05). Feeding CT75 corn reduced duodenum and jejunum relative lengths compared to the birds fed diets containing CTU corn. Significant PS x CT interactions (p < 0.05) were observed for villus height, villus height to crypt depth, crypt depth, muscle thickness, and absorption surface area of the jejunum. The highest carcass yield was observed in the PSF-CT75 group (p < 0.05).
   In conclusion, the use of finely ground corn (PSF) conditioned at 75 degree celsius (CT75) was beneficial to growth performance, development of the digestive tract, jejunum histomorphometry and the immune responses of broilers.

AB  - Endometriosis is a benign gynecological condition in which endometrial-like tissue grows outside of the uterus, and the mechanisms of its pathogenesis are not fully understood. The anatomical and physiological parallels between pigs and humans have made pigs a good model for investigating other human diseases. Here, we report on the development of a swine model for endometriosis in which the peritoneal cavity was inoculated with autologous endometrial tissue fragments labeled with fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) dye-doped silica nanoparticles. After 6 weeks of endometriosis induction, FITC positive endometriotic lesions were observed on the peritoneal surface of the abdominal wall as well as on the serosal surfaces of the uterus and small intestine. Histological analysis of the endometriotic lesions revealed endometrial-like epithelial and stromal cells that were morphologically comparable to human endometriotic lesions. The identification of epithelial and stromal cells in these lesions was confirmed by immunostaining of e-cadherin, an endometrial epithelial marker, and Chicken ovalbumin upstream promoter-transcription factor II, an endometrial stromal marker. Our results illustrate successful induction of endometriosis with fluorescent-labeled endometriotic lesions to identify in situ endometriotic lesions. According to the size and physiological similarity of pigs to humans, this is an important first step toward the development of a non-invasive tool to diagnose endometriosis. Furthermore, the availability of a new large animal model for translational endometriosis research provides a novel preclinical animal model for laparoscopic monitoring and retrieval of experimental endometriotic lesions with ample serum for serial analyses.
   Sentence: A preclinical swine model for endometriosis research is established by transplanting fluorescent-labeled endometrial tissues and the subsequently formed endometriotic lesions were distinguishable from surrounding normal tissues.

AB  - Major depression disorder is a debilitating psychiatric disease affecting millions of people worldwide. This disorder is the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in high-income countries. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors such as fluoxetine are first-line drugs for treating depression-related disorders, but not all patients respond well to these antidepressants. This study aimed to evaluate whether fluoxetine combined with aerobic exercise can affect lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced depressive-like behavior, hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis dysregulation, and brain inflammation in mice. Male mice were exposed to fluoxetine, swimming exercise, or a combination of both and finally treated with LPS. We measured depression-related symptoms such as anhedonia, behavioral despair, weight gain, and food intake. Hormones (corticosterone and testosterone) and cytokines (IL-1 beta, IL-6, TNF-alpha, IL-10) were also measured in serum and brain (hippocampus and prefrontal cortex), respectively. The findings indicated that LPS induced anhedonia and behavioral despair and increased corticosterone, hippocampal IL-1 beta, TNF-alpha, and decreased testosterone and hippocampal IL-10 in mice. Fluoxetine and exercise separately reduced LPS-induced depressive-like behavior, while their combination synergistically reduced these symptoms in LPS-treated mice. We found fluoxetine alone increased food intake and body weight in LPS-treated mice. Fluoxetine and exercise combination reduced corticosterone, hippocampal TNF-alpha, and prefrontal IL-6 and TNF-alpha levels and increased testosterone and hippocampal and prefrontal IL-10 levels more effectively than fluoxetine alone in LPS-treated mice. This study suggests that swimming exercise combined with fluoxetine can affect depression-related behavior, HPA axis, and brain inflammation more effectively than when they are used separately.

AB  - Curvularia species are saprophytic dematiaceous fungi commonly isolated from environmental sources. Most often, they are responsible for allergic fungal rhinosinusitis, an intense, allergic inflammatory sinus disease in immunocompetent individuals. Though invasive infections are rare and more commonly observed in immunocompromised patients, recent reports indicate an increasing trend of invasive sinusitis caused by Curvularia species in immunocompetent hosts. Over the past few years, new species of the genus Curvularia are increasingly being recognized as human pathogens. Here, we report the first human infection caused by Curvularia warraberensis, a cryptic species of Curvularia primarily described as an endophyte in Australian grasses. The 33-year-old female presented with chronic invasive sinusitis of the sphenoid and ethmoid sinuses that progressed to involve the pituitary gland, mid-brain, the facial-vestibulocochlear nerve complex, and basilar artery. The patient underwent endoscopic sinus surgery. Histopathology, microscopic examina-tion and culture of biopsy tissues revealed a dematiaceous fungus that was identified as C. warraberensis, based on sequencing the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) and large subunit (LSU) regions of ribosomal DNA. Antifungal susceptibility testing (AFST) showed low minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) for ampho-tericin B (1 mg/mL), itraconazole (0.25 mg/mL) and posaconazole (0.125 mg/mL). Accurate identification and AFST are crucial for making treatment decisions as some Curvularia species demonstrate variable susceptibil-ity to antifungal agents. The patient died despite combined surgical and medical intervention owing to late presentation and delay in initiating antifungal therapy. A high index of suspicion together with an early diag-nosis and aggressive treatment may improve the outcome in such cases. (c) 2022 SFMM. Published by Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.

AB  - The fatty acid-solamine conjugate C16:3(7Z,10Z,13Z)-solamine was isolated from leaves of the wild potato species Solanum bulbocastanum and structurally characterized using spectroscopic methods. The exogenous application of C16:3(7Z,10Z,13Z)-solamine reduced the feeding of Colorado potato beetles (Leptinotarsa decemlineata) and potato flea beetles (Epitrix papa) on Solanum tuberosum leaf disks and inhibited the germination of sporangia produced by the oomycete pathogen Phytophthora infestans and subsequent plant infection. The use of liquid chromatography-coupled tandem mass spectrometry enabled the detection and characterization of numerous acyl solamines in S. bulbocastanum leaves and in the belowground organs of numerous accessions of eight wild potato species and of cultivars of S. tuberosum. The annotated acyl solamines comprise medium- and long-chain fatty acyl solamines, whose acyl groups differ in chain length, the number of double bond equivalents, and the number of oxygenations, as well as hydroxycinnamoyl solamines. The profiles of the detected acyl solamines exhibited notable variation between different Solanum species, as well as between different tissues within a species. The potential role of acyl solamines in plant defense and their potential utility in plant protection and resistance breeding are discussed.

AB  - Oxidative stress can induce apoptosis of granulosa cells and lead to follicular atresia, thereby reducing the number of pigs giving birth. The aim of this study was to investigate the protective effect of Periplaneta americana peptide (PAP) on the apoptosis of the granulosa cells of pig ovaries (PGCs) induced by hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) via FoxO1. PGCs were treated with H2O2 to establish a cell apoptosis model. Cell viability was measured using the cell counting kit-8 (CCK-8) assay, and cell apoptosis was detected using flow cytometry. The malondialdehyde (MDA) level and nitric oxide (NO) content were detected to reflect the oxidative stress. Western blotting, qRT-PCR and overexpression were undertaken to determine the expression of FoxO1 and caspase-3, and immunofluorescence was used to detect FoxO1 in the nucleus and cytoplasm. PGCs were treated with 100 mu M H2O2 for 6 hr, which resulted in oxidative damage and apoptosis and an apoptosis rate for PGCs of 32.95%. Next, PGCs were treated with 400 mu g/ml PAP for 24 hr to repair the apoptosis induced by H2O2. PAP improved cell viability in H2O2-stimulated PGCs, the increased MDA level and NO content caused by H2O2 stimulation were reversed and the apoptotic rate of PGCs was reduced. The qRT-PCR and Western blotting results indicated that PAP decreased the H2O2-induced apoptosis and the expression of FoxO1 and caspase-3 in PGCs. The effect of PAP was the same following FoxO1 overexpression. FoxO1 was expressed in the nucleus when stimulated by H2O2 or overexpression; however, it migrated to the cytoplasm following PAP treatment. PAP decreased the apoptosis of PGCs induced by H2O2 by regulating FoxO1 expression and nuclear translocation.

AB  - Meat quality is one of the most important economic traits in pig breeding and production. Intramuscular fat (IMF) is a major factor that improves meat quality. To better understand the alternative splicing (AS) events underlying meat quality, long-read isoform sequencing (Iso-seq) was used to identify differential (D)AS events between the longissimus thoracis (LT) and semitendinosus (ST), which differ in IMF content, together with short-read RNA-seq. Through Iso-seq analysis, we identified a total of 56,789 novel transcripts covering protein-coding genes, lncRNA, and fusion transcripts that were not previously annotated in pigs. We also identified 456,965 AS events, among which 3930 were DAS events, corresponding to 2364 unique genes. Through integrative analysis of Iso-seq and RNA-seq, we identified 1174 differentially expressed genes (DEGs), among which 122 were DAS genes, i.e., DE-DAS genes. There are 12 overlapped pathways between the top 20 DEGs and DE-DAS genes, as revealed by KEGG (Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes) analysis, indicating that DE-DAS genes play important roles in the differential phenotype of LT and ST. Further analysis showed that upregulated DE-DAS genes are more important than downregulated ones in IMF deposition. Fatty acid degradation and the PPAR (peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor) signaling pathway were found to be the most important pathways regulating the differential fat deposition of the two muscles. The results update the existing porcine genome annotations and provide data for the in-depth exploration of the mechanisms underlying meat quality and IMF deposition.

AB  - Amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) analysis was conducted on the wabisuke camellia and its relative camellia species. Genetic polymorphism was identified among the 'Uraku' camellia, its offspring 'Tosa-uraku' and Camellia japonica, whereas the two accessions of the old 'Uraku' showed monomorphism in all the fragments. The results suggested that the two old 'Uraku' trees are asexually-propagated clonal strains. The genetic distance between wabisuke cultivars and Chinese camellias and between wabisuke camellias and C. sinensis was much further than that between wabisuke cultivars and Camellia japonica. It has also been suggested that wabisuke camellias can be classified into two subgroups, I-1 and I-2, and that Subgroup I-2 originated from C. japonica, while Subgroup I-1, including 'Uraku' (synonym: 'Tarokaja'), was developed by the repeated hybridization of C. japonica to interspecific hybrids with the Chinese camellias, e.g., C. pitardii var. pitardii, or by the involvement of related species not investigated in this study.

AB  - This paper presents a brucellosis disease model with reaction-diffusion and time delay. The model takes into account both the direct and indirect transmission of infected animals and pathogens in the environment. By analyzing the associated characteristic equation, the local stability of the unique positive equilibrium point is established. The existence of Hopf bifurcations at the positive equilibrium point is also examined by considering the discrete time delay as a bifurcation parameter. Additionally, an optimal control analysis is conducted to minimize disease outbreaks and control costs. This includes reducing the exposure of susceptible animals to infected animals, removing infected animals from herds, and reducing emissions of brucella into the environment. By constructing Hamiltonian function and applying Pontryagin's maximum principle, the necessary conditions for the existence of optimal control are given. Finally, the existence of bifurcation periodic solutions and the effectiveness of control strategies are illustrated through numerical simulations.

AB  - Background: Fetal-placental development depends on a continuous and efficient supply of nutrients from maternal blood that are acquired by exchange through the placenta. However, the placenta is a low permeability barrier, and effective transport of substances depends on specific transport mechanisms. Active transport requires that ions or nutrients be moved against an electrical and/or concentration gradient. In pigs, active transport of ions occurs across the chorioallantois placenta to produce an electrochemical gradient that changes throughout gestation. The aim of this study was to utilize Ussing chambers to detect regulation of ion transport across the porcine chorioallantois by a factor(s) within the uterine-placental environment of pigs. Methods: For the measurement of transchorioallantoic voltage potential as an index of ion transport across the placenta, pieces of chorioallantoic tissue from Day 60 of gestation were mounted into the cassettes of Ussing chambers, and treatments were added to the mucasal side of the tissue. Treatments included: (1) media incubated with Day 60 chorioallantois (placenta-conditioned media); (2) osteopontin/secreted phosphoprotein 1 (OPN/SPP1) purified from cow's milk; (3) placenta-conditioned media from which OPN/SPP1 was removed; and (4) recombinant rat OPN with an intact RGD integrin binding sequence or a mutated RAD sequence. Ouabain was added to both sides of the chamber. Immunofluorescence was utilized to localize beta 3 integrin, aquaporin 8 and OPN/SPP1 in porcine placental tissues, and OPN/SPP1 within porcine lung, kidney and small intestine. Results: Day 60 chorioallantoic membranes had greater transepithelial voltage in the presence of porcine placenta-conditioned media, indicating that a molecule(s) released from the placenta increased ion transport across the placenta. OPN/SPP1 purified from cow's milk increased ion transport across the placenta. When OPN/SPP1 was removed from placenta-conditioned media, ion transport across the placenta did not increase. Recombinant rat OPN/SPP1 with a mutated RGD sequence that does not bind integrins (RAD) did not increase ion transport across the placenta. Ouabain, an inhibiter of the sodium-potassium ion pump, ablated ion transport across the placenta. Conclusions: The present study documents a novel pericellular matrix role for OPN/SPP1 to bind integrins and increase ion transport across the porcine chorioallantoic placenta.

AB  - Simple SummaryCurrently, more and more people keep dogs, and the gastrointestinal diseases of pet dogs have brought great losses to families. However, the condition of the dog's feces is closely related to the health of its stomach and intestines. We can know the intestinal condition of dogs in advance by scoring dog feces, and implement measures such as food adjustments. The PURINA FECAL SCORING CHART and the WALTHAM (TM) Faeces Scoring System are good at scoring dog feces visually, but some scoring experience is required. Therefore, this paper proposes an artificial intelligence method to automatically classify the condition of dog feces by combining their classification criteria with the assistance of animal experts. This method can achieve an accuracy of 88.27%, improving the diagnostic efficiency of veterinarians.In a natural environment, factors such as weathering and sun exposure will degrade the characteristics of dog feces; disturbances such as decaying wood and dirt are likely to make false detections; the recognition distinctions between different kinds of feces are slight. To address these issues, this paper proposes a fine-grained image classification approach for dog feces using MC-SCMNet under complex backgrounds. First, a multi-scale attention down-sampling module (MADM) is proposed. It carefully retrieves tiny feces feature information. Second, a coordinate location attention mechanism (CLAM) is proposed. It inhibits the entry of disturbance information into the network's feature layer. Then, an SCM-Block containing MADM and CLAM is proposed. We utilized the block to construct a new backbone network to increase the efficiency of fecal feature fusion in dogs. Throughout the network, we decrease the number of parameters using depthwise separable convolution (DSC). In conclusion, MC-SCMNet outperforms all other models in terms of accuracy. On our self-built DFML dataset, it achieves an average identification accuracy of 88.27% and an F1 value of 88.91%. The results of the experiments demonstrate that it is more appropriate for dog fecal identification and maintains stable results even in complex backgrounds, which may be applied to dog gastrointestinal health checks.

AB  - Successful implementation of automated blood sampling (ABS) into a telemetry instrumented canine cardiovascular model provides simultaneous cardiovascular assessment of novel compounds while collecting multiple blood samples for analysis of drug level, cytokines, and biomarkers. Purpose-bred male Beagle dogs (n = 36) were instrumented with a dual-pressure telemetry transmitter and vascular access port. Modifications to acclimation practices, surgical procedures, and housing were required for implementation of ABS in our established cardiovascular canine telemetry colony. These modifications have increased the use and reproducibility of the model by combining early pharmacokinetic and cardiovascular studies, thus achieving both refinement and reduction from a 3R perspective. In addition, the modified model can shorten timelines and reduce the compound requirement in early stages of drug development. This telemetry-ABS model provides an efficient means to quickly identify potential effects on key cardiovascular parameters in a large animal species and to obtain a more complete pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic profile for discovery compounds.

AB  - Extracellular vesicles (EVs) facilitate intercellular communication by transferring cargo between cells in a variety of tissues. However, how EVs achieve cell -type -specific intercellular communication is still largely unknown. We found that Notch1 and Notch2 proteins are expressed on the surface of neuronal EVs that have been generated in response to neuronal excitatory synaptic activity. Notch ligands bind these EVs on the neuronal plasma membrane, trigger their internalization, activate the Notch signaling pathway, and drive the expression of Notch target genes. The generation of these neuronal EVs requires the endosomal sorting complex required for transport -associated protein Alix. Adult Alix conditional knockout mice have reduced hippocampal Notch signaling activation and glutamatergic synaptic protein expression. Thus, EVs facilitate neuron -to -neuron communication via the Notch receptor-ligand system in the brain.

AB  - The hypertrophy and conversion of postnatal muscle fibers largely determine the yield and quality of meat, which is closely related to the economic value of pigs. MicroRNA (miRNA), as a kind of endogenous noncoding RNA molecule, is widely involved in myogenesis of livestock and poultry. The longissimus dorsi tissues of Lantang pigs at 1 and 90 days (LT1D and LT90D) were collected and profiled by miRNA-seq. We found 1871 and 1729 miRNA candidates in LT1D and LT90D samples, and 794 miRNAs were shared. We identified 16 differentially expressed miRNAs between two tested groups and explored the function of miR-493-5p inmyogenesis. The miR-493-5p promoted the proliferation and inhibited the differentiation of myoblasts. Using GO and KEGG analyses of 164 target genes of miR-493-5p, we found that ATP2A2, PPP3CA, KLF15, MED28, and ANKRD17 genes were related to muscle development. RT-qPCR detection showed that the expression level of ANKRD17 was highly expressed in LT1D libraries, and the double luciferase report test preliminarily proved that miR-493-5p and ANKRD17 have a directly targeting relationship. We established miRNA profiles for the longissimus dorsi tissues of 1-day-old and 90-day-old Lantang pigs and found that miR-493-5p was differentially expressed and associated with myogenesis by targeting ANKRD17 gene. Our results should serve as a reference for future studies on pork quality.

AB  - Camelthorn (Alhagi maurorum Medik) is a desert plant that can withstand a variety of abiotic challenges, including water stress and harsh weather, making it potentially useful for cleaning cadmium (Cd) from contaminated soils. The current study aims to determine the degree of plant tolerance to Cd toxicity and the possibility of using it in the phytoremediation of Cd- contaminated soils. Camelthorn plants were cultivated in soil polluted with Cd at doses of 0, 25, 50, 100, and 200 mg kg(-1). The growth, nutrient uptake, Cd concentrations, and some biochemical compounds were determined to study the response of camelthorn plants to Cd stress. Exposure of camelthorn plants to 200 mg kg(-1) of Cd inhabited the synthesis of leaf-chlorophyll by 49% compared to the control and reduced the concentrations of nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), potassium (K), calcium (Ca), iron (Fe), and zinc (Zn) by 43, 36, 43, 50, 67, and 36%, respectively. Camelthorn plants can tolerate up to 11 mg kg(-1) of available soil Cd, 65 mg kg(-1) in the root, and 22 mg kg(-1) in the shoot before experiencing Cd toxicity. Camelthorn plants increased the levels of carbohydrates, total phenols, and proline compounds that were used in the scavenging of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Moreover, the plants increased the activity of antioxidant enzymes, i.e., superoxide dismutase (SOD) and peroxidase (POD), to mitigate the oxidative stress caused by Cd toxicity. The root-shoot transfer (TF) of Cd varied between 0.27 to 0.48, while the bioaccumulation factor (BAF) varied between 1.2 and 2.32. Camelthorn plants have a BAF value higher than 1 and a TF value lower than 1. Camelthorn plants accumulate Cd in the roots with low root-shoot transfer and are suitable for phytostabilization technology. Camelthorn plants have a potent antioxidant defense against the toxicity of Cd, and this finding is a good tool in the remediation of Cd-contaminated soil.

AB  - This study provides the first data on the relationship between chemical composition and biomechanical/physiological characteristics of foliar gymnosperm compressions from the Lower Cretaceous of Santa Cruz, Argentina. Studied taxa include: Squamastrobus tigrensis, Pseudoctenis ornata, Ginkgoites tigrensis, Ruflorinia orlandoi, and Ptilophyllum micropapillosum. The properties determined include: density, tensile strength (resistance to fracture), tensile modulus of elasticity (stiffness), and leaf mass per area (metabolic cost of tissue construction). They are calculated using a 3D -multivariate model based on data obtained by Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy and trait relationships linking density and the properties mentioned above. Samples have a predominantly aromatic chemical composition with variable carbonyl contents. The chemical groups detected are associated with diagenetically-resistant molecules, possibly including lignins, phenylpropanoids, tannins, and resin -like compounds. The results indicate that these plant taxa may have allocated variable amounts of resources (metabolic costs) for the development of aromatic, biomechanically resistant, and relatively long-lived foliar tissues. The determined chemical, biomechanical, and physiological properties of these leaves suggest their potential as a food source for herbivores. Thus, S. tigrensis leaves might have been unpleasantly astringent, difficult to eat and digest due to their hard tissues, and possibly even hazardous. Conversely, the leaves of G. tigrensis, P. ornata, R. orlandoi, and P. micropapillosum may have been easy to eat due to their softer tissues, offering food of intermediate -high nutritional value. The use of FTIR spectroscopy proves useful to perform detailed and realistic studies on the biomechanics, physiology, and autecology of extinct plants.

AB  - To understand the role of Zn and Cd in anti-viral defence, Zn/Cd hyperaccumulator Noccaea caerulescens plants grown with deficient (0.3 mu M), replete (10 mu M) and excess (100 mu M) Zn2+ and Cd (10 mu M Zn2+ + 1 mu M Cd2+) were infected with Turnip yellow mosaic virus (TYMV). Gas exchange and chlorophyll fluorescence kinetics analyses demonstrated direct TYMV effects on photosynthetic light reactions but N. caerulescens was more resistant against TYMV than the previously studied non-hyperaccumulator N. ochroleucum. Virus abundance and photosynthesis inhibition were the lowest in the high Zn and Cd treatments. RNAseq analysis of 10 mu M Zn2+ plants revealed TYMV-induced upregulation of Ca transporters, chloroplastic ZTP29 and defence genes, but none of those that are known to be strongly involved in hyperaccumulation. Synchrotron mu-XRF tomography, however, showed that Zn hyperaccumulation remained strongest in vacuoles of epidermal storage cells regardless of infection. This was in contrast to N. ochroleucum, where apoplastic Zn drastically increased in response to TYMV. These results suggest that the antiviral response of N. caerulescens is less induced by the onset of this biotic stress, but it is rather a permanent resistant state of the plant. Real-time qPCR revealed upregulation of ferritin in Zn10 infected plants, suggesting Fe deprivation as a virus defence strategy under suboptimal Zn supply.

AB  - The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of dietary fiber on the serum biochemistry, bile acid profile, and gut microbiota in piglets. Twenty-four pigs (initial body weight: 10.53 +/- 1.23 kg) were randomly divided into three treatments with eight replicate pens of one pig per pen for 21 d. The dietary treatments consisted of the following: (1) a fiber-free diet (NS); (2) a fiber-free diet + 3% fructooligosaccharides (SI); (3) a fiber-free diet + 3% dietary fiber mixture (fructooligosaccharides, long-chain inulin, and microcrystalline cellulose at the ratio 1:1:1; MIX). The results showed that compared with the NS group, the 3% SI diet reduced the serum total cholesterol (TC) concentration of the piglets (p < 0.05). The metabolomics results showed that the 3% SI diet increased the level of taurohyocholic acid (THCA) and alpha-muricholic acid, and the 3% MIX diet increased the level of THCA and cholic acid (p < 0.05). The use of 3% SI or MIX decreased the glycodeoxycholic acid (GDCA) level in the bile of the piglets (p < 0.05). The correlation analysis shows that the GDCA was positively related to the TC. The 16S rRNA gene sequencing results showed that UCG-002 and Holdemanella were enriched in the SI group, while Bacteroides was enriched in the MIX group. The microbial function prediction indicated that SI supplementation tended to elevate the relative abundance of gut bacteria capable of expressing bile acid-metabolizing enzymes. To sum up, the regulatory effect of dietary fiber on lipid metabolism is related to bile acids in piglets. Compared with MIX, SI is more likely to regulate bile acids through the gut microbiota.

AB  - Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) has been associated with depression and inadequate response to antidepressants. While ketamine has demonstrated efficacy in treating depression, its impact on pre-existing liver injury and depression remains unclear. This study aimed to evaluate the effects of ketamine treatment in a murine model of depression and liver damage, considering age-related differences. Young and aged male C57BL/6N mice were submitted to chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS) and methionine-choline-deficient (MCD) diet to induce depressive-like behavior and NAFLD. Behavioral testing (sucrose preference test, open field test, novel object recognition test, Crawley's sociability test) were used to assess ketamine's (50 mg/kg) effect on behavior. Hepatic ultrasonography was utilized to evaluate liver status. The cortical and hippocampal NeuN+, GFAP+, and Iba1+ signals were quantified for each animal. Ketamine administration proved effective in relieving anhedonia and anxiety-like behavior, regardless of liver damage. Although ketamine treatment did not improve memory in animals with liver damage, it enhanced sociability, particularly in aged subjects. The acute administration of ketamine did not affect the severity of liver injury, but seems to affect astrogliosis and neuronal loss. Although animal models of depression only replicate certain clinical features of the condition, they remain valuable for evaluating the complex and varied effects of ketamine. By applying such models, we could demonstrate ketamine's therapeutic versatility, and also indicate that responses to the treatment may differ across different age groups.

AB  - The use of e-cigarettes/e-vapour, and the consumption of a high-fat diet (HFD), are two popular lifestyle choices associated with alterations in the hippocampus. This study, using a mouse model, investigated the effects of exposure to e-vapour (& PLUSMN; nicotine) and HFD (43% fat) consumption, on the expression of nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) subunits & alpha;3, & alpha;4, & alpha;7 and & beta;2, apoptosis markers caspase-3 and TUNEL, microglial marker Iba-1, and astrocyte marker GFAP, in hippocampal subregions of dentate gyrus (DG) and cornu ammonis (CA) 1-3. The major findings included: (1) HFD alone had minimal effect with no consistent pattern or interaction between the markers, (2) E-vapour (& PLUSMN; nicotine) predominantly affected the CA2 subregion, decreasing & alpha;7 and & beta;2 nAChR subunits and Iba-1, (3) Nicotine e-vapour increased TUNEL across all subregions, and (4) HFD, in the presence of nicotine-free e-vapour, decreased caspase-3 and increased TUNEL across all regions, and decreased Iba-1 in the CA subregions, while HFD and nicotine-containing e-vapour, subregion specifically affected the & alpha;3, & alpha;4 and & alpha;7 nAChR subunits, with a protective effect against change in GFAP in the DG and Iba-1 in the CA1 and CA3. These findings highlight that e-vapour itself alters nAChRs, particularly in the CA2 subregion, associated with a decrease in neuroinflammatory response (Iba-1) across the whole hippocampus, and the addition of nicotine increases cell apoptosis across the whole hippocampus. HFD alone was not detrimental in our model, but in the presence of nicotine-free e-vapour, it differentially affected apoptosis, while the addition of nicotine increased nAChR subunits.

AB  - Skin aging has become a major urgent problem to be solved. Evidence reveals that oxidation and glycosylation are two dominant inducements of aging. Resveratrol (RES) with outstanding anti-oxidant effect and carnosine (CAR) with superb anti-glycation property were selected as two model drugs to evaluate the feasibility of their synergistic anti-aging effect. RES and CAR at the most desired mass ratio, supplying the most superior synergistic anti-aging effects were further encapsulated in liposomes (LP), which were separately coated with chitosan (CS) and catechol chitosan (Cat-CS) to increase the transdermal penetration. Their anti-aging efficacy was explored in human skin fibroblast (HSF) and human immortalized keratinocytes (HaCaT) cells, as well as the back skin of guinea pigs. Herein, RES and CAR at the mass ratio of 2:1 exhibited the most ideal synergistic anti-aging effect. The constructed liposomes have been shown to possess excellent fundamental properties and sustained-release properties. The aging-related indicator levels in the two cells and guinea pigs were obviously improved for the RES + CAR@Cat-CS-LP group. Additionally, skin appearance, tissue morphology, and collagen content were visibly improved, indicating its perfect anti-aging effect. In conclusion, RES + CAR@Cat-CS-LP is expected to be exploited as a potential anti-aging drug delivery system.

AB  - Kolmarden djurpark keeps one of the most northern living giraffe Giraffa camelopardalis groups in the world, and this comes with its challenges. For a long part of the year, the outside temperature is too cold for giraffes, resulting in extended periods spent indoors, combined with a shorter duration of trees bearing leaves than further south. In an attempt to reduce the stereotypical behaviours of Kolmarden' giraffes, the effect of giving 70% of feed in slow-feeding barrels was compared with providing 100% of the feed in slow-feeding barrels. The results show a significant increase in feeding behaviours for most of the individuals along with a reduction in stereotypical behaviours. At the same time there was an increase in activity during the night. Kolmarden djurpark practices a 'breed and cull' regime for the giraffe group. One of the reasons to do so is for the welfare of the animals. To investigate this, one female was studied before and after giving birth, along with one control animal. The results show a reduction in stereotypical behaviours, suggesting that the mother's welfare increased. Forcing zoo herbivores to 'work' for all of their feed, rather than just adding some enrichment diets for occupation alongside an otherwise easily accessible diet, and permitting natural reproductive behaviours, may be two strategies to improve welfare that should be considered and further investigated.

AB  - Food consumption patterns are currently at the heart of sustainability debates globally, with many studies calling for decreases in Animal Source Foods (ASF) consumption. This has been increasingly argued for school meal schemes, considering their sheer size and the fact that by targeting young people they have the potential to enable long-term changes in consumption habits. However, the potential and consequences of dietary transitions away from ASF in school catering services are still under investigation. This work analyses the environmental and cost implications of ASF reduction in school canteens, exploring the possible sustainability impacts of menus based on individual ingredients for a set of Italian schools. We use a mixed-method approach that combines optimisation models, life cycle assessment, life cycle costing, and stakeholder consultation. The linear programming method is employed here to design four alterative school meal scenarios, starting from the menus currently served (SCB). Scenario 1 (SC1) minimises beef and dairy consumption, scenario 2 (SC2) minimises pig and poultry consumption, scenario 3 (SC3) minimises the consumption of all meat and dairy products, and scenario 4 (SC4) maximises the consumption of pulses. Each scenario is then assessed through a cradle-to-grave life cycle assessment approach for key economic (i.e. costs) and environmental impacts (i.e. greenhouse gas emissions). Results suggest that reducing ASF in school food schemes can ensure nutritional quality and at the same time have environmental and economic benefits. The largest benefits accrue when minimising beef and dairy (SC1), leading to a 22% reduction in Global Warming Potential (GWP) and a 1% reduction in cost per meal. The minimisation of pig and poultry products in SC2 increases the GWP by 2% and costs by 3%, while the minimisation of all meat and dairy products reduces GWP by 12% and increases meal cost by 4% (SC3). Finally, by maximising pulses intake, the GWP per meal decreases by 12% and the cost by 1% (SC4). Overall, food procurement has the highest environmental impact and meal preparation the highest economic impact. Further research should investigate the acceptability of such menus and translate the theoretical findings of our model into more practical day-to-day school meal options.

AB  - Lactobacillus johnsonii is a microbial biomarker associated with lipid deposition, but the mechanism by which it accelerates fatty acid absorption and deposition remains unclear. In this study, we isolated a strain of L. johnsonii MS0621 from the feces of Ningxiang pigs, an obese animal model, and evaluated its probiotic properties with high resistance to temperature and intestinal fluids. Colonization by L. johnsonii MS0621 increased the abundance of gut Lactobacillus in lean DLY pigs, concomitant with increases in fatty acid absorption in the intestine and lipid depositions in the fat and muscle tissues. The lipid absorption-promoting effect was further detected in IPEC-J2 cells treated with live L. johnsonii MS0621 and the bacteria-free supernatants, as evidenced by high triglyceride synthesis and the expression of CD36, a key lipid transporter. Metabolomics analysis showed that (R)-leucic acid is a potential metabolite targeting CD36 expression to guarantee lipid absorption and deposition. The mechanism might involve direct interaction with CD36, as molecular docking and inhibition of CD36 blocked L. johnsonii MS0621 or derived metabolite-mediated lipid absorption. In conclusion, we uncovered an important role of L. johnsonii MS0621 derived (R)-leucic acid in regulating the absorption and deposition of intestinal fatty acids via regulation of CD36 expression.

AB  - In this study, thymol (TYM) at dietary levels of 0, 1, 1.5, 2, and 2.5 g/kg diet was used to evaluate its effects on growth, digestive performance, immunity, and resistances to the infection induced by Streptococcus iniae in the rainbow trout, Oncorhynchus mykiss. A number of 450 fish (35.8 & PLUSMN;4.4 g; Mean & PLUSMN;SD) were distributed to 15 tanks (30 fish/tank) in three replicates and fed TYM for 60 days. After feeding period, Fish fed 1.5-2.5 g TYM showed better growth, higher digestive enzyme activity, and body protein content compared to other diets (P < 0.05). Regression analysis indicated a polynomial relationship between growth parameters and dietary TYM levels. Based upon the varied growth parameters, the optimum dietary TYM level was 1.89% for FCR. TYM at dietary levels of 1.5-2.5 g significantly enhanced liver antioxidant enzyme activity [superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione peroxidase (GPx), and catalase (CAT)], immune components in blood [alternative complement activity (C3), total immunoglobulin (Ig), lysozyme activity, bactericidal activity, and total protein], and in mucus [alkaline phosphatase (ALP), protease activity, lysozyme activity, bactericidal activity, and total protein] compared to other diets (P < 0.05). TYM at dietary levels of 2-2.5 g significantly decreased malondialdehyde (MDA) levels compared to other experimental groups (P < 0.05). In addition, use of TYM at dietary levels of 1.5-2.5 g upregulated the expression of the immune-related genes (C3, Lyz, and Ig) (P < 0.05). In contrast, the expression of inflammatory genes, tumor necrosis factor (TNF-alpha) and Interleukin-8 (IL-8) significantly were downregulated in response to 2-2.5 g TYM (P < 0.05). The hematology of the fish also altered in response to dietary TYM, where the values of corpuscular hemoglobin concentration (MCHC), hemoglobin (Hb), red blood cell (RBC), hematocrit (Hct), and white blood cell (WBC) significantly increased in fish fed 2-2.5 g TYM compared to other diets (P < 0.05). In addition, MCV significantly decreased in response to 2-2.5 g TYM (P < 0.05). After challenge with Streptococcus iniae, the survival rate was significantly higher in fish fed 2-2.5 g TYM compared to other diets (P < 0.05). The results of the present study concluded that TYM in the diet of rainbow trout can improve the fish growth and immunity and increase the resistance of the fish to Streptococcus iniae infection. The results of this study recommend an optimized dietary level of 2-2.5 g TYM for the fish.

AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a devastating neurodegenerative disorder, and there is a pressing need to identify disease-modifying factors and devise interventional strategies. The circadian clock, our intrinsic biological timer, orchestrates various cellular and physiological processes including gene expression, sleep, and neuroinflammation; conversely, circadian dysfunctions are closely associated with and/or contribute to AD hallmarks. We previously reported that the natural compound Nobiletin (NOB) is a clock-enhancing modulator that promotes physiological health and healthy aging. In the current study, we treated the double transgenic AD model mice, APP/PS1, with NOB-containing diets. NOB significantly alleviated beta-amyloid burden in both the hippocampus and the cortex, and exhibited a trend to improve cognitive function in these mice. While several systemic parameters for circadian wheel-running activity, sleep, and metabolism were unchanged, NOB treatment showed a marked effect on the expression of clock and clock-controlled AD gene expression in the cortex. In accordance, cortical proteomic profiling demonstrated circadian time-dependent restoration of the protein landscape in APP/PS1 mice treated with NOB. More importantly, we found a potent efficacy of NOB to inhibit proinflammatory cytokine gene expression and inflammasome formation in the cortex, and immunostaining further revealed a specific effect to diminish astrogliosis, but not microgliosis, by NOB in APP/PS1 mice. Together, these results underscore beneficial effects of a clock modulator to mitigate pathological and cognitive hallmarks of AD, and suggest a possible mechanism via suppressing astrogliosis-associated neuroinflammation.

AB  - Nuclear small RNAs have emerged as an important subset of non-coding RNA species that are capable of regulating gene expression. A type of small RNA, microRNA (miRNA) have been shown to regulate development of the ovarian follicle via canonical targeting and translational repression. Little has been done to study these molecules at a subcellular level. Using cell fractionation and high throughput sequencing, we surveyed cytoplasmic and nuclear small RNA found in the granulosa cells of the pig ovarian antral preovulatory follicle. Bioinformatics analysis revealed a diverse network of small RNA that differ in their subcellular distribution and implied function. We identified predicted genomic DNA binding sites for nucleus-enriched miRNAs that may potentially be involved in transcriptional regulation. The small nucleolar RNA (snoRNA) SNORA73, known to be involved in steroid synthesis, was also found to be highly enriched in the cytoplasm, suggesting a role for snoRNA species in ovarian function. Taken together, these data provide an important resource to study the small RNAome in ovarian follicles and how they may impact fertility.

AB  - A validated imaging marker for beta-cell mass would improve understanding of diabetes etiology and enable new strategies in therapy development. We previously identified the membrane-spanning protein GPR44 as highly expressed and specific to the beta cells of the pancreas. The selective GPR44 antagonist MK-7246 was radiolabeled with carbon-11 and the resulting positron-emission tomography (PET) tracer [C-11]MK-7246 was evaluated in a pig model and in vitro cell lines. The [C-11]MK-7246 compound demonstrated mainly hepatobiliary excretion with a clearly defined pancreas, no spillover from adjacent tissues, and pancreatic binding similar in magnitude to the previously evaluated GPR44 radioligand [C-11]AZ12204657. The binding could be blocked by preadministration of nonradioactive MK-7246, indicating a receptor-binding mechanism. [C-11]MK-7246 showed strong potential as a PET ligand candidate for visualization of beta-cell mass (BCM) and clinical translation of this methodology is ongoing.

AB  - The pig is an important translational model for studying intestinal physiology and disorders for its many homologies with humans, including the organization of the enteric nervous system (ENS), the major regulator of gastrointestinal functions. This study focused on the quantification and neurochemical characterization of substance P (SP) neurons in the pig ascending (AC) and descending colon (DC) in wholemount preparations of the inner submucosal plexus (ISP), outer submucosal plexus (OSP), and myenteric plexus (MP). We used antibodies for the pan-neuronal marker HuCD, and choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) and neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS), markers for excitatory and inhibitory transmitters, for multiple labeling immunofluorescence and high-resolution confocal microscopy. The highest density of SP immunoreactive (IR) neurons was in the ISP (222/mm(2) in the AC, 166/mm(2) in the DC), where they make up about a third of HuCD-IR neurons, compared to the OSP and MP (19-22% and 13-17%, respectively, P < 0.001-0.0001). HuCD/SP/ChAT-IR neurons (up to 23%) were overall more abundant than HuCD/SP/nNOS-IR neurons (< 10%). Most SP-IR neurons contained ChAT-IR (62-85%), whereas 18-38% contained nNOS-IR with the highest peak in the OSP. A subpopulation of SP-IR neurons contains both ChAT- and nNOS-IR with the highest peak in the OSP and ISP of DC (33-36%) and the lowest in the ISP of AC (< 10%, P < 0.001). SP-IR varicose fibers were abundant in the ganglia. This study shows that SP-IR neurons are functionally distinct with variable proportions in different plexuses in the AC and DC reflecting diverse functions of specific colonic regions.

AB  - Microbial bioagents and botanicals contrastingly different in modes of action, and despite being used over the years, their comparative efficacy are not yet fully explored with regard to management of grey blight disease caused by Pseudopestalotiopsis curvatispora Petch in tea plantation of Assam, India. Four microbial antagonists based formulations and seven botanicals at 2.5-10% concentration were tesed against mycelial growth of grey blight pathogen through dual culture assay and poisoned food technique, respectively, under in vitro conditions. Resultantly, two botanicals viz., Pongamia pinnata L. and Xanthium strumarium L. and two microbial bioformulations viz., Biometa as Metarhizium anisopliae and Biogreen as Trichoderma viride-based consortium of microbial antagonists were evaluated, singly and in combination through field studies in a grey blight affected 12-year-old tea plantation (grey blight susceptible clone TV-23) established on acidic Inceptisol with regard to suppression in grey blight disease incidence (PDI), green tea yield, culturable soil microbial population, leaf nutrients composition, and biochemical properties of tea. The consortium of microbial antagonists (Biogreen + Biometa) registered 11.34% higher suppression in grey blight disease at 4% concentration over combination of P. pinnata + X. strumarium at 10% concentration, both sprayed 5 times at 30 days interval in 150-days period, besides single microbial antagonist (Biometa) being inferior to consortium of microbial antagonists (Biogreen). Such a reduction in PDI resulted in 22.9% higher yield of green tea leaves with consortium of bioagents over botanicals due to significant elevation in soil culturable microbial population, and leaf nutrient composition. These responses were eventually associated with an improvement in biochemical properties (Polyphenols, caffeines, and antioxidants acivity) of tea. Our study, hence, provided both, in vitro and field evidence in favor of multipronged benfits of consortium of microbial antagonists for an extended control of grey blight disease of tea, a reliable alternative to conventionally used chemical fungicides towards tea health care with enhanced quality parameters.

AB  - Understanding extensive transcriptional reprogramming events mediated by wounding during the oolong tea manufacturing process is essential for improving oolong tea quality. To improve our comprehension of the architecture of the wounding-induced gene regulatory network, we systematically analyzed the high-resolution transcriptomic and metabolomic data from wounding-treated (after turnover stage) tea leaves at 11 time points over a 220-min period. The results indicated that wounding activates a burst of transcriptional activity within 10 min and that the temporal expression patterns over time could be partitioned into 18 specific clusters with distinct biological processes. The transcription factor (TF) activity linked to the TF binding motif participated in specific biological processes within different clusters. A chronological model of the wounding-induced gene regulatory network provides insight into the dynamic transcriptional regulation event after wounding treatment (the turnover stage). Time series data of wounding-induced volatiles reveal the scientific significance of resting for a while after wounding treatment during the actual manufacturing process of oolong tea. Integrating information-rich expression data with information on volatiles allowed us to identify many high-confidence TFs participating in aroma formation regulation after wounding treatment by using weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA). Collectively, our research revealed the complexity of the wounding-induced gene regulatory network and described wounding-mediated dynamic transcriptional reprogramming events, serving as a valuable theoretical basis for the quality formation of oolong tea during the post-harvest manufacturing process.

AB  - Oral ingestion of a glucose solution following severe stress is a simple and effective way of preventing several of the negative sequelae of stress in rats. Similar resilience is obtained through hormetic training - pre-exposure to mild-to-moderate stress prior to severe stress. Here, we examined whether hormetic training is facilitated when a glucose solution is available following each hormetic training session. In Experiment 1, all rats were pre-exposed to a 30 min hormetic session of 25 inescapable tailshocks on each of 3 days. The schedule or hormesis differed between groups. The hormetic sessions occurred on either 3 consecutive days or with an interpolated day of rest between each hormetic session. Furthermore, in each of these conditions, one group had access to water and one group had access to a 40% glucose solution immediately after each hormetic session to complete a 2x2 factorial design. All groups were exposed to 100 inescapable tailshocks on the day following the end of hormetic training. Shuttle-escape testing occurred 24 h later. In Experiment 2, rats received two consecutive days of 100 inescapable tailshocks. Water or glucose was available following each session. Testing occurred 24 h after the second shock exposure. Experiment 1 replicated previous findings that rats exposed to hormetic training with interpolated rest did not show exaggerated fear responding or shuttle-escape deficits that normally result from 100 inescapable tailshocks, but training was ineffective if no rest was given between stress sessions. However, all post-stress glucose groups showed an elimination of helpless behavior. In Experiment 2, it was revealed that even 100 tailshocks can be made hormetic by post-stress glucose consumption.

T2  - BIOINFORMATICS
LA  - English
AB  - Motivation: Large Language Models (LLMs) are being adopted at an unprecedented rate, yet still face challenges in knowledge-intensive domains like biomedicine. Solutions such as pre-training and domain-specific fine-tuning add substantial computational overhead, requiring further domain-expertise. Here, we introduce a token-optimized and robust Knowledge Graph-based Retrieval Augmented Generation (KG-RAG) framework by leveraging a massive biomedical KG (SPOKE) with LLMs such as Llama-2-13b, GPT-3.5-Turbo and GPT-4, to generate meaningful biomedical text rooted in established knowledge. Results: Compared to the existing RAG technique for Knowledge Graphs, the proposed method utilizes minimal graph schema for context extraction and uses embedding methods for context pruning. This optimization in context extraction results in more than 50% reduction in token consumption without compromising the accuracy, making a cost-effective and robust RAG implementation on proprietary LLMs. KG-RAG consistently enhanced the performance of LLMs across diverse biomedical prompts by generating responses rooted in established knowledge, accompanied by accurate provenance and statistical evidence (if available) to substantiate the claims. Further benchmarking on human curated datasets, such as biomedical true/false and multiple-choice questions (MCQ), showed a remarkable 71% boost in the performance of the Llama-2 model on the challenging MCQ dataset, demonstrating the framework's capacity to empower open-source models with fewer parameters for domain-specific questions. Furthermore, KG-RAG enhanced the performance of proprietary GPT models, such as GPT-3.5 and GPT-4. In summary, the proposed framework combines explicit and implicit knowledge of KG and LLM in a token optimized fashion, thus enhancing the adaptability of general-purpose LLMs to tackle domain-specific questions in a cost-effective fashion.

AB  - The dynamic nature of cortical activation changes during language acquisition, including second-language learning, has not been fully elucidated. In this study, we administered two sets of reading and listening tests (Pre and Post) to participants who had begun to learn Japanese abroad. The two sets were separated by an interval of about 2 months of Japanese language training. We compared the results of longitudinal functional MRI experiments between the two time-points and obtained the following major findings. First, the left-dominant language areas, as well as bilateral visual and auditory areas, were activated, demonstrating the synergistic effects of multiple modalities. There was also significant activation in the bilateral hippocampi, indicating the expected involvement of memory-related processes. Second, consistent with the behavioral improvements from Pre to Post, the brain activations decreased in the left inferior and middle frontal gyri during the listening tests, as well as in the visual areas (the bilateral inferior and superior parietal lobules, and left inferior and middle occipital gyri) during the reading tests, while activations in the right superior and middle temporal gyri increased during the listening tests. These modality-dependent activation changes could not be explained by domain-general cognitive factors, such as habituation or familiarization, because we used completely different test sets for Pre and Post. Third, the posterior hippocampus showed a main effect of the hemisphere, whereas the anterior hippocampus showed a significant main effect of the event (i.e., specific to first listening events), reflecting initial encoding of auditory information alone. In summary, activation changes from Pre to Post indicate functional changes in modality-dependent networks over a short period of staying abroad, which would enable effective acquisition of a second language.

AB  - Simple Summary Foot lesions of piglets are reported in several articles and might be linked to floor conditions or sow performance. Therefore, the present study evaluated claw horn growth and evaluated foot lesions and bruising from the day of birth until the end of the suckling period in three different genetic lines. Differences among genetic lines were detected.Abstract The objective of this study is to evaluate foot lesions and claw horn growth of piglets from the day of birth until the end of the suckling period and describe the prevalence and extent in three different genetic lines. Therefore, bruising, dorsal horn lesions, claw horn growth, and weight gain were evaluated five times during growth, starting with the day of birth (day 0 of life) and ending with the end of nursery (day 68 +/- 2 of life). Totally, 74 piglets of three genetic lines (German Landrace x Large White; Pietrain x Pietrain-Duroc; pure German Landrace) were examined. Bruising and dorsal horn lesions reached maximum levels at day 7 (+/- 1) of life (with up to 91% of piglets having bruising marks and up to 94.1% of piglets having dorsal horn lesions). Differences among genetic lines were detected, with German Landrace x Large White crossbreds showing the highest percentage of bruising, but Pietrain x Pietrain-Duroc crossbreds showed the highest score for dorsal horn lesions at day 0. Until weaning (day 28 +/- 1), front feet were more affected by bruising than hind feet (70.3% of the front feet and 64% of the hind feet showed bruising), but at the end of nursery (day 68 +/- 2), hind feet showed a higher percentage of affected feet than front feet (65.5% vs. 41.3%). Several factors affect bruising scores in piglets, including body weight, age at examination, litter size, sex, parity, breed, and claw horn length. Additionally, significant differences for claw horn length were detected among the genetic lines from birth to end of nursery.

AB  - Ruminants are essential for global food security, but these are major sources of the greenhouse gas methane. Methane yield is controlled by the cycling of molecular hydrogen (H2), which is produced during carbohydrate fermentation and is consumed by methanogenic, acetogenic, and respiratory microorganisms. However, we lack a holistic understanding of the mediators and pathways of H2 metabolism and how this varies between ruminants with different methane-emitting phenotypes. Here, we used metagenomic, metatranscriptomic, metabolomics, and biochemical approaches to compare H2 cycling and reductant disposal pathways between low-methane-emitting Holstein and high-methane-emitting Jersey dairy cattle. The Holstein rumen microbiota had a greater capacity for reductant disposal via electron transfer for amino acid synthesis and propionate production, catalyzed by enzymes such as glutamate synthase and lactate dehydrogenase, and expressed uptake [NiFe]-hydrogenases to use H2 to support sulfate and nitrate respiration, leading to enhanced coupling of H2 cycling with less expelled methane. The Jersey rumen microbiome had a greater proportion of reductant disposal via H2 production catalyzed by fermentative hydrogenases encoded by Clostridia, with H2 mainly taken up through methanogenesis via methanogenic [NiFe]-hydrogenases and acetogenesis via [FeFe]-hydrogenases, resulting in enhanced methane and acetate production. Such enhancement of electron incorporation for metabolite synthesis with reduced methanogenesis was further supported by two in vitro measurements of microbiome activities, metabolites, and public global microbiome data of low- and high-methane-emitting beef cattle and sheep. Overall, this study highlights the importance of promoting alternative H2 consumption and reductant disposal pathways for synthesizing host-beneficial metabolites and reducing methane production in ruminants.

AB  - The quality of sperm significantly influences the reproductive efficiency of pig herds. High-quality sperm is necessary for efficient fertilization and to maximize the litter numbers in commercial pig farming. However, the understanding of genes regulating porcine sperm motility and viability is limited. In this study, we validated porcine sperm/Sertoli-specific promoters through the luciferase reporter system and identified vital genes for sperm quality via loss-of-function means. Further, the shRNAs driven by the ACE and SP-10 promoters were used to knockdown the SPAG6 and PPP1CC genes which were provisionally important for sperm quality. We assessed the effects of SPAG6 and PPP1CC knockdown on sperm motility by using the sperm quality analyzer and flow cytometry. The results showed that the ACE promoter is active in both porcine Sertoli cells and sperms, whereas the SP-10 promoter is operating exclusively in sperm cells. Targeted interference with SPAG6 and PPP1CC expression in sperm cells decreases the motility and increases apoptosis rates in porcine sperms. These findings not only offer new genetic tools for targeting male germ cells but also highlight the crucial roles of SPAG6 and PPP1CC in porcine sperm function.

   The motility of the smooth muscle of the rumen and the reticulum is tightly synchronized since they are responsible for degrading the ingested fibrous diet. It involves mixing contractions of partially digested material (cycle A), cyclic eructation of fermented gases (cycle B), and contractions associated with regurgitation and rumination (cycle C). Disorders of cycles A, B, and C in reticulo-rumen contraction occurred in cases of many metabolic diseases. Since the smooth muscle electromyography (EMG) is closely associated with the motility pattern, our study aimed to implement the long-term EMG telemetry recording method to analyze the basic reticulo-rumen motility pattern in conscious unrestrained sheep. The study was conducted on nine ewes chronically fitted with bipolar electrodes in the rumen and reticulum. Cycles A and B occurred constantly in a similar share, whereas cycles C appeared every 30 min and lasted for the most part 15-30 min. EMG signal analysis showed more differences at the level of single bursts than on burst bundles. Recording reticulo-rumen EMG signal with a long-term telemetry approach offers a reliable tool to assess the forestomach motility in conscious, unrestrained sheep, allowing for easy recognition of reticulo-rumen cycles.
   The reticulum and rumen are considered a single functional unit (the reticulo-rumen) with regards to myoelectrical and contractile activities. The specialized contractions of the reticulo-rumen provide constant mixing of partially digested material (cycle A), its flow into the omasum during eructation (cycle B), and regurgitation-rumination (cycle C). This study aimed to investigate the feasibility of electromyography (EMG) registered by a long-term telemetry method for assessment of the basic reticulo-rumen myoelectrical activity in sheep, to develop the effective recognition of the reticulo-rumen cycles at rest with no food stimulation, and to investigate the relationship between cycles A, B, and C in such basic conditions. The experiment was carried out on nine ewes. Myoelectric activity of the rumen, reticulum, and abomasum was recorded by the combination of three silver bipolar electrodes and a 3-channel transmitter implant. The myoelectrical activity registered successfully in the reticulum and rumen was determined as three characteristic patterns of cycles A, B, and C. The percentage of each type of cycle changed at different intervals from equally cycles A (43-50%) and B (50-56%), occurring when cycle C was not observed to the domination of cycle C (57-73%) with a decrease of cycles A (6-14%) and B (20-28%). The long-term EMG telemetry registration is feasible in the assessment of the reticulo-rumen myoelectrical activity in sheep.

AB  - Oilseeds are the world's second-largest food reserve after cereals. Camelina sativa, a member of the Brassicaceae family, is an oilseed crop known for its adaptability to rainfed cultivation, low input requirements and high-quality oil. This study aimed to identify key traits influencing seed yield and oil composition, particularly fatty acid profiles, in Camelina sativa. The research was conducted at Razi University in Kermanshah, Iran. Using gas chromatography, we analysed the fatty acid profiles of 136 doubled haploid camelina lines, detecting 18 distinct fatty acids categorised into saturated, monounsaturated and polyunsaturated types. Significant variations were observed in the fatty acid composition among the lines. Yield components such as NPP, BY, SHW and PSW showed strong positive correlations with grain yield (GY) (r <= 0.813), while traits like SL, SP, SA and WS exhibited weak negative correlations. A notable negative correlation was found between oil and protein content (r =-0.769, P < 0.01), ranging from 32.72 % to 38.55 % and 25.66 % to 30.45 %. Linolenic acid levels ranged from 28.95 % to 34.90 % and linoleic acid levels varied between 16.07 % and 22.24 %. These findings highlight the potential of Camelina sativa as a sustainable oilseed crop for marginal environments. Identifying traits directly related to seed yield is a critical aspect of plant breeding, as it enables the development of improved varieties with higher productivity. Future research should optimise breeding strategies to enhance yield and oil quality while exploring its potential in biofuel and nutritional applications.

AB  - Cognitive challenges and brain structure variations are common in autism spectrum disorder (ASD) but are rarely explored in middle-to-old aged autistic adults. Cognitive deficits that overlap between young autistic individuals and elderlies with dementia raise an important question: does compromised cognitive ability and brain structure during early development drive autistic adults to be more vulnerable to pathological aging conditions, or does it protect them from further decline? To answer this question, we have synthesized current theoretical models of aging in ASD and conducted a systematic literature review (Jan 1, 1980 - Feb 29, 2024) and meta-analysis to summarize empirical studies on cognitive and brain deviations in middle-to-old aged autistic adults. We explored findings that support different aging theories in ASD and addressed study limitations and future directions. This review sheds light on the poorly understood consequences of aging question raised by the autism community to pave the way for future studies to identify sensitive and reliable measures that best predict the onset, progression, and prognosis of pathological aging in ASD.

AB  - Myostatin (MSTN), an inhibitor of skeletal muscle growth, is also expressed in penile smooth muscle; however, it is unclear whether MSTN plays an inhibitory role in penile smooth muscle growth. We investigated the role of MSTN in the smooth muscle of the penile corpus cavernosum of pigs using MSTN homozygous mutant knockout (KO) and wild type (WT) pigs (n = 4 in each group). The mean of area fraction (%) of smooth muscle in the penile corpus cavernosum was 65.9 % +/- 1.79 in the KO and approximately 41.7 % +/- 5.39 in the WT (P < 0.001). KO pigs showed significantly increased expression of smooth muscle-specific genes, including smooth muscle protein 22 (TAGLN) (6.62-fold), smooth muscle myosin heavy chain (MYH11) (2.41-fold), myocardin (MYOCD) (3.05-fold), and serum response factor (SRF) (4.95-fold), and decreased expression of vimentin (VIM) (1.36-fold). Immunofluorescence staining and Western blotting showed smooth muscle-specific expression of alpha-smooth muscle actin (SMA) and calponin was higher in KO pigs (P < 0.05) than in WT pigs. KO pigs had less fat deposition inside the corpus cavernosum, and showed downregulation of adiponectin (ADIPOQ) and fatty acid synthase (FASN) (2.5-fold and 1.9-fold loss, respectively). In vitro experiments showed MSTN interference pro-moted corporal smooth muscle cell growth and expression of smooth muscle-specific markers, whereas it downregulated the expression of fat-specific genes, ADIPOQ and FASN. MSTN inhi-bition could promote smooth muscle growth and decrease fat deposition in the corpus cav-ernosum. MSTN, thus, could be a possible target for the treatment of smooth muscle dystrophy -related disorders such as erectile dysfunction.

AB  - Silent infarcts (SI) are subcortical cerebral infarcts occurring in the absence of typical ischemia symptoms and are linked to cognitive decline and dementia development. There are no approved treatments for SI. One potential treatment is tamoxifen, a selective estrogen receptor modulator. It is critical to establish whether treatments effectively target the early consequences of SI to avoid progression to complete injury. We induced SI in the dorsal hippocampal CA1 of rats and assessed whether tamoxifen is protective 24 h later against cognitive deficits and injury responses including gliosis, apoptosis, inflammation and changes in estrogen receptors (ERs). SI led to subtle cognitive impairment on the object place task, an effect ameliorated by tamoxifen administration. SI did not lead to detectable hippocampal cell loss but increased apoptosis, astrogliosis, microgliosis and inflammation. Tamoxifen protected against the effects of SI on all measures except microgliosis. SI increased ER alpha and decreased ER beta in the hippocampus, which were mitigated by tamoxifen. Exploratory data analyses using scatterplot matrices and principal component analysis indicated that SI rats given tamoxifen were indistinguishable from controls. Further, SI rats were significantly different from all other groups, an effect associated with low levels of ER alpha and increased apoptosis, gliosis, inflammation, ER beta, and time spent with the unmoved object. The results demonstrate that tamoxifen is protective against the early cellular and cognitive consequences of hippocampal SI 24 h after injury. Tamoxifen mitigates apoptosis, gliosis, and inflammation and normalization of ER levels in the CA1, leading to improved cognitive outcomes after hippocampal SI.

AB  - Rice leaffolder, Cnaphalocrocis medinalis (Guenee) can cause serious damage under favourable conditions. Host plant resistance is an economical and eco-friendly option for management of this pest. To identify resistance sources against leaffolder, six antibiosis parameters and five biochemical constituents were quantified in seven rice genotypes. The total larval duration ranged from 15.09-19.57 days in these genotypes. The expression of antibiosis as prolonged larval duration was recorded in W1263, IET22155 and TKM6 (18.46-19.57 days), while percentage pupation (54-74%) was significantly less on these genotypes. No effect of genotypes was observed on pupal duration, adult emergence and adult longevity. The expression of biochemical constituents like total soluble and reducing sugars, free amino acids and total soluble proteins was less in IET22155, W1263 and TKM6, while total phenol content was more in IET22155 and TKM6, both in 50 and 70 days old plants. Negative correlations were observed between larval duration and total soluble sugars (r = -0.69), reducing sugar (r = -0.80) and free amino acids (r = -0.76). Similarly, total phenol content was negatively correlated with larval survival (r = -0.62) and pupal weight (r = -0.79) and positively correlated to larval duration (r = 0.68). The variation in expression of antibiosis parameters and biochemical constituents among genotypes against leaffolder can be used to unravel the basis of antibiosis resistance and to develop durable leaffolder resistant varieties.

AB  - Plant secondary metabolites that defend leaves from herbivores also occur in floral nectar. While specialist herbivores often have adaptations providing resistance to these compounds in leaves, many social insect pollinators are generalists, and therefore are not expected to be as resistant to such compounds. The milkweeds, Asclepias spp., contain toxic cardenolides in all tissues including floral nectar. We compared the concentrations and identities of cardenolides between tissues of the North American common milkweed Asclepias syriaca, and then studied the effect of the predominant cardenolide in nectar, glycosylated aspecioside, on an abundant pollinator. We show that a generalist bumblebee, Bombus impatiens, a common pollinator in eastern North America, consumes less nectar with experimental addition of ouabain (a standard cardenolide derived from Apocynacid plants native to east Africa) but not with addition of glycosylated aspecioside from milkweeds. At a concentration matching that of the maximum in the natural range, both cardenolides reduced activity levels of bees after four days of consumption, demonstrating toxicity despite variation in behavioral deterrence (i.e., consumption). In vitro enzymatic assays of Na+/K+-ATPase, the target site of cardenolides, showed lower toxicity of the milkweed cardenolide than ouabain for B. impatiens, indicating that the lower deterrence may be due to greater tolerance to glycosylated aspecioside. In contrast, there was no difference between the two cardenolides in toxicity to the Na+/K+-ATPase from a control insect, the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster. Accordingly, this work reveals that even generalist pollinators such as B. impatiens may have adaptations to reduce the toxicity of specific plant secondary metabolites that occur in nectar, despite visiting flowers from a wide variety of plants over the colony's lifespan.

AB  - Wild teas are valuable genetic resources for studying evolution and breeding. Here, we report the complete chloroplast genome of the ancient Korean tea 'Hadong Cheon-nyeon Cha' (C. sinensis var. sinensis), which is known as the oldest tea tree in Korea. This study determined seven Camellia sinensis var. sinenesis, including Hadong Cheon-nyeon Cha (HCNC) chloroplast genome sequences, using Illumina sequencing technology via de novo assembly. The chloroplast genome sizes ranged from 157,019 to 157,114 bp and were organized into quadripartite regions with the typical chloroplast genomes. Further, differences in SNPs and InDels were detected across the seven chloroplast genomes through variance analysis. Principal component and phylogenetic analysis suggested that regional constraints, rather than functional constraints, strongly affected the sequence evolution of the cp genomes in this study. These genomic resources provide evolutionary insight into Korean tea plant cultivars and lay the foundation for a better understanding of the ancient Korean tea plant HCNC.

AB  - To evaluate the antioxidant activity of flavonoids extracted from Chinese herb mulberry leaves (ML), flavonoids from mulberry leaves (FML) were extracted and purified by using ultrasonic-assisted enzymatic extraction and D101 macroporous resin. Using LC-MS/MS-Liquid Chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry analysis, hesperidin, rutoside, hyperoside, cyanidin-3-o-glucoside, myricitrin, cyanidin, and quercetin were identified, and NMR and UV were consistent with the verification of IR flavonoid characteristics. The antioxidant activity of FML has also been evaluated as well as the protective effect on 2,2 0-azobis (2-amidinopropane) dihydrochloride (AAPH)-induced oxidative stress. The results showed that FML exhibited powerful antioxidant activity. Moreover, FML showed dose-dependent protection against AAPH-induced sheep erythrocytes' oxidative hemolysis. In the enzymatic antioxidant system, pretreatment with high FML maintained the balance of SOD, CAT, and GSH-Px; in the non-enzymatic antioxidant system, the content of MDA can be effectively reduced after FML treatment. This study provides a research basis for the development of natural products from mulberry leaves.

AB  - Furanoids are a class of contaminants prevalent in both airborne and occupational environments, with potential health implications through inhalation, oral ingestion, and skin penetration. Given their diminutive molecular size, there is a presumption that furanoids can readily permeate the skin. To systematically explore this presumption, we investigated the skin absorption and toxicity of a series of furans (furfuryl alcohol, furfuryl acetate, furfural, methyl 2-furoate, and 5-methylfurfural) using in silico, in vitro, and in vivo models. The in vitro permeation test (IVPT) from neat and aqueous suspension (5 mM) of furans demonstrated a facile absorption through pig and nude mouse skins. The lipophilicity of furans significantly influenced skin deposition, with higher lipophilicity displaying greater deposition. However, an opposing trend emerged in the receptor compartment accumulation. In barrier-defective skin simulating atopic dermatitis (AD) and psoriasis, enhanced deposition occurred with more hydrophilic furans but not with the more lipophilic ones. In the cell-based study, furanoids induced the proliferation of keratinocytes and skin fibroblasts except for the compounds with the aldehyde group (furfural and 5-methylfurfural). Both furfuryl acetate and 5-methylfurfural activated keratinocytes via the overexpression of COX-2 and PGE2 by 1.5-2-fold. This stimulation involved the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway. For the in vivo mouse skin treatment, we selected furfuryl acetate (hydrophilic) and 5-methylfurfural (lipophilic). Both furans showed different patterns of skin lesions, where repeated application of furfuryl acetate caused epidermal hyperplasia and scaling, while 5-methylfurfural predominantly evoked skin inflammation and barrier disintegration. Toxicokinetics analysis revealed a higher plasma concentration of topically applied furfuryl acetate than that of the 5-methylfurfural (5.04 versus 2.34 nmol/ml), resulting in the mild injury of furfuryl acetate-treated peripheral organs. Conversely, no notable adverse effects on organs were observed for the 5-methylfurfural. This study established the relationship between cutaneous absorption and the toxicity of furans following skin exposure.

AB  - The Spodoptera genus is defined as the pest-rich genus because it contains some of the most destructive lepidopteran crop pests, characterized by a wide host range. During feeding, the caterpillars release small amounts of oral secretion (OS) onto the wounded leaves. This secretion contains herbivore-induced molecular patterns (HAMPs) that activate the plant defense response, as well as effectors that may inhibit or diminish the plant's anti-herbivory response. In this study, we explored the protein components of the OS of two Spodoptera species, Spodoptera exigua and Spodoptera littoralis. We identified 336 and 276 proteins, respectively, with a major role in digestion. Using a label-free quantitative proteomics approach, we investigated changes in protein abundance in the OS of both species after switching from a laboratory artificial diet to detached pepper and tomato leaves. Several proteins, such as various lipases, polycalin and a beta-1,3-glucan binding protein, were more abundant in the OS of leaf-fed larvae in both species. Conversely, a tryptophan-aspartic acid (WD)-repeat containing protein significantly decreased upon feeding on plant leaves in both species. Phenotypic plasticity dependent on each Spodoptera-plant combination was observed for several peptidases, potentially related to the need to overcome the effects of proteinase inhibitors differentially produced by the two plant species, and for several REPAT proteins, possibly related to the specific modulation of each Spodoptera-plant interaction. Altogether, our results provide useful information for understanding the interaction of these two polyphagous Spodoptera species with the host plants, and help to identify evolutionary traits that may influence the outcome of herbivory in each of these two related species.

AB  - Pectin is a dynamic and complex polysaccharide that forms a substantial proportion of the primary plant cell wall and middle lamella of forage ingested by grazing ruminants. Pectin methylesterases (PMEs) are enzymes that belongs to the carbohydrate esterase family 8 (CE8) and catalyze the demethylesterification of pectin, a key polysaccharide in cell walls. Here we present the crystal structure of the catalytic domain of PmeC5 that is associated with a gene from Butyrivibrio fibrisolvens D1T that encodes a large secreted pectinesterase family protein (2089 aa) determined to a resolution of 1.33 & Aring;. Protein in silico modelling of the secreted pectinesterase confirmed the presence of an additional pectate lyase (PL9) and adhesin-like domains. The structure of PmeC5 was the characteristic right-handed parallel beta-helical topology and active site residues of Asp231, Asp253, and Arg326 typical of the enzyme class. PmeC5 is a large modular enzyme that is characteristic of rumen B. fibrisolvens megaplasmids and plays a central role in degrading plant cell wall components and releasing methanol in the rumen environment. Such secreted PMEs are significant contributors to plant fiber digestion and methane production, making them attractive targets for both methane mitigation strategies and livestock productivity enhancement.

AB  - Simple Summary Bioavailability of inorganic zinc in animals is low, and large amounts of zinc are excreted into feces, resulting in potential negative impacts on the environment and waste of zinc resources. To reduce zinc supplementation in animal feed, prepared and characterized chitosan-zinc (CS-Zn) chelate was studied to investigate its bioavailability. Dietary CS-Zn improved the weight gain of weaned piglets as compared to ZnSO4. The Zn source had a significant influence on the liver, pancreas Zn contents, and the protein expression of ZnT1 and ZIP5 in duodenal mucosa. The Zn contents in the liver and pancreas and the protein expressions of ZnT1 and ZIP5 increased linearly with increases in the added Zn level. Multiple linear regression and the slope-ratio methodology showed that the bioavailability of CS-Zn was 110.9% or 149.0% relative to ZnSO4, respectively, using zinc content in the liver or pancreas as the response parameter. These results indicate that CS-Zn shows enhanced bioavailability, suggesting a good potential substitute for inorganic zinc in animal nutrition. The present study was conducted to explore the bioavailability of chitosan-zinc chelate (CS-Zn) in weaned piglets, and its characteristics of prepared and oral safety were also involved. A total of 210 crossbred weaned piglets (Duroc x Landrace x Large White) with a mean body weight of 6.30 kg were randomly assigned into seven dietary treatments involving a 2 x 3 factorial arrangement with two Zn sources (CS-Zn and ZnSO4) and three levels of added Zn (50, 100, 150 mg Zn/kg) plus a Zn-unsupplemented control diet. The feeding trial lasted 42 days. The AFM image of CS-Zn showed a rougher appearance and smaller size particles. The changes in spectrum peaks evidenced the successful chelating of Zn2+ with chitosan. The XRD patterns revealed the formation of a new crystalline phase. Moreover, the oral acute toxicity test of CS-Zn showed no lethal effects on mice. Weaned piglets fed dietary CS-Zn showed improved weight gain and decreased diarrhea incidence. Additionally, the bioavailability of CS-Zn was higher than that of ZnSO4 in piglets. Taken together, these results indicate that the prepared CS-Zn chelate, with rough surface and crystalline phase, is non-toxic and show enhanced bioavailability.

AB  - An important source of greenhouse gases in Brazil is the nitrous oxide (N2O) emission from pasture, and microorganisms play an important role in nitrogen transformations in the soil. This study aimed to evaluate N2O emission and NH3 volatilization from bovine excreta in pasture in an integrated crop-livestock system (ICL) in the Brazilian Cerrado. Three treatments (urine, dung and control) were performed in two pastures (Area 1-three-year pasture of Urochloa ruziziensis and Area 2-one-year pasture of Urochloa brizantha cv. Piat & atilde;), with two application times of the excreta (dry and rainy season), during two successive years of application. Compared to the control, the excreta deposition on ICL increased soil N2O and NH3 fluxes. In the dry season, N2O fluxes were associated with higher ammonium (NH4+) availability. In the rainy season, these fluxes were related to NO3- availability and water-filled pore space (WFPS). In both areas, NH3 volatilization was higher after urine than dung application, especially in the dry season. The highest N2O emission factors were obtained for urine (0.32%), the rainy season (0.36%), and older pasture (Area 1: 0.24%). All these values were below the mean IPCC default values (0.77%). These results indicate that N2O emissions in pasture should be evaluated in regional conditions.

AB  - Forty-eight Pelibuey x Katahdin male intact lambs (25.12 +/- 3.79 kg LW) were used in a 70-d growing-finishing trial. Dietary treatments consisted of total mixed corn-based diet supplemented with: (1) no feed additives (Control); (2) 150 mg of essential oils blend plus 0.10 mg of 25-hydroxy-Vit-D3/kg diet offered throughout the 70-d experimental period (EOD3); (3) Control diet fed during the first 35 days and zilpaterol hydrochloride (ZH) supplementation at 6 mg/kg diet offered during the final 35 days of the experiment (32 days with ZH with a withdrawal 3-d before harvest), and (4) basal diet supplemented with EOD3 during first 35 days finishing, and EOD3 in combination with ZH (EOD3 + ZH) during the subsequent 32-days with ZH withdrawal 3 days before harvest. The temperature-humidity index during the experiment averaged 80.4 +/- 3.2. There were no treatment interactions (p > 0.20) on growth performance and carcass measures. Supplemental EOD3 did not affect (p = 0.43) dry matter intake (DMI), but increased (p < 0.01) carcass adjusted average daily gain (ADG, 9.2%), gain efficiency (GF, 6.7%), and observed vs. expected dietary net energy for maintenance (NEm, 4.8%) and for gain (NEg, 6.4%). Supplemental ZH did not affect dry matter intake (DMI, p = 0.50) but increased (p < 0.01) carcass adjusted ADG (14.5%), GF (13%) and observed vs. expected dietary NEm (9%) and NEg (11.7%). Compared to control lambs, the combination of both additives increased ADG (24.9%), GF (21.2%), and observed vs. expected dietary NEm and NEg (14.2% and 18.9%, respectively). There were no treatment interactions on carcass characteristics, visceral organ mass, or on gene expression of IGF1, IGF2 and mTOR in longissimus muscle (LM). Supplemental EOD3 increased hot carcass weight (HCW; 4.0%, p < 0.01) but did not affect other carcass measures. Supplemental EOD3 decreased (3%, p = 0.03) intestine mass weight (g intestine/kg empty body weight). Supplemental ZH increased HCW (6%, p < 0.01), dressing percentage (1.7%, p = 0.04), and LM area (9.7%, p < 0.01), and decreased kidney-pelvic-fat percentage (16.2%, p < 0.01), fat thickness (14.7%, p = 0.03), and visceral fat. Compared to controls, the combination of EOD3 with ZH increased HCW (10.2%). It is concluded that growth performance responses to supplemental EOD3 and ZH are additive. Both supplements can be fed in combination without detrimental effects on expected benefits when fed separately. In addition, ZH supplementation improves carcass traits.

AB  - Ethnopharmacological relevance Paeonia lactiflora is a famous Traditional Chinese medicine widely used for immunological regulation. Paeoniflorin, the main component of Paeonia lactiflora, exerts neuroprotective and antidepressant-like effects in rodents.
   Aim of the study: Fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF-2) is essentially required in the central nervous system as it acts as both a neurotrophic factor and an anti-inflammatory factor participating in the regulation of proliferation, differentiation and apoptosis of neurons in the brain. However, it is unclear whether paeoniflorin could exert antidepressant effects via regulating FGF-2.
   Materials and methods: In the present study, the effects of paeoniflorin were evaluated in depressive mice induced by the endotoxin lipopolysaccharide (LPS) injection.
   Results: The results showed that paeoniflorin markedly increased sucrose preference and reduced immobility time in LPS mice, indicating antidepressant effects. Consistent with the results from molecular docking showing paeoniflorin antagonizes TLR4, NF-kappa B and NLRP3, the biochemical analysis also indicated paeoniflorin inhibited TLR4/NF-kappa B/NLRP3 signaling, decreased proinflammatory cytokine levels and microglial activation in the hippocampus of LPS induced mice. In addition, the levels of neuronal FGF-2 and the density of dendritic spine were improved by paeoniflorin. More importantly, the FGFR1 inhibitor SU5402 prevented the antidepressant effects of paeoniflorin and blocked the neuroinflammatory and neurogenic regulatory effects of paeoniflorin, indicating that FGF-2/FGFR1 activation was required for the effects of paeoniflorin.
   Conclusion: Taken together, the results demonstrate that paeoniflorin exhibits neuroprotective and antidepressant effects in mice, which may be mediated by activating neuronal FGF-2/FGFR1 signaling via the inhibition of microglial activation in the hippocampus.

AB  - A series of notes on taxonomy, nomenclature, morphology and distributions of native species of vascular plants in Kyrgyzstan is presented. Anaphalis roseoalba is treated as a synonym of A. virgata; Hippolytia herderi and H. megacephala are new synonyms of H. senecionis; Hippolytia darvasica and H. schugnanica are new synonyms of H. tomentosa; Campanula capusii is a synonym of C. lehmanniana. Allium polyphyllum is the correct name for a species related to A. carolinianum, which occurs in the Tian-Shan. Hedysarum ledebourii is the correct name for the illegitimate H. neglectum. Iris sect. Cristatae has priority over Iris sect. Juno, whereas Isis is established as the correct generic name for Phaeiris. Veronica tenuissima is a superfluous replacement for V. tetraphylla. Stachys nana is proposed as a new combination for the species previously known as Hypogomphia turkestana. The illegitimate generic name Chaetolimon (Bunge) Lincz. is replaced by the new generic name Hissarolimon, for which two species-level combinations are also provided. Authorship and nomenclature are clarified or corrected for seven names; spelling is corrected for one name. Lectotypes are designated for four names. Ten species are reported as new to the country, and the presence of one species is confirmed. Two species are excluded from the flora of Kyrgyzstan, and one species is excluded from the flora of Uzbekistan. Range extensions in Kyrgyzstan are reported for seven species. Distributions in Kyrgyzstan are verified and mapped for seven species. Complete distribution ranges are mapped for four species. The IUCN conservation status of Iris austrotschatkalica is assessed as 'Critically Endangered' because its known populations are distantly located and severely affected by land use and development. With these additions and corrections, the total number of vascular plant species in Kyrgyzstan reaches 4043.

AB  - Microgreens are young plants of various vegetables, medicinal and aromatic plants, cereals and edible wild plants that were first associated with nouvelle cuisine as decoration in dishes due to their attractive appearance and strong flavor. Recently, they have become more sought after in the market due to their high nutritional value. This is due to the growing interest of consumers in a healthy lifestyle that includes a varied diet with emphasis on fresh, functional foods. Nowadays, commercial production of microgreens is shifting to modern hydroponic systems due to their numerous advantages, such as accelerated plant growth and biomass production, earlier harvesting, and more production cycles that positively affect yield and chemical composition. Therefore, the aim of this study was to determine the content of specialized metabolites and antioxidant capacity of hydroponically grown alfalfa (Medicago sativa) cv. 'Kangaroo', yellow beet (Beta vulgaris var. conditiva) cv. 'Yellow Lady', red cabbage (Brassica oleracea L. var. rubra) cv. 'Red Carpet', and fennel (Foeniculum vulgare) cv. 'Aganarpo' microgreens. The highest content of total phenols (408.03 mg GAE/100 g fw), flavonoids (214.47 mg GAE/100 g fw), non-flavonoids (193.56 mg GAE/100 g fw) and ascorbic acid (74.94 mg/100 g fw) was found in fennel microgreens. The highest content of all analyzed chlorophyll pigments (Chl_a 0.536 mg/g fw, Chl_b 0.248 mg/g fw, and TCh 0.785 mg/g fw) was found in alfalfa microgreens. However, in addition to alfalfa, high levels of chlorophyll a (0.528 mg/g fw), total chlorophyll (0.713 mg/g fw) and the highest level of total carotenoids (0.196 mg/g fw) were also detected in fennel microgreens. The results suggest that microgreens grown on perlite in floating hydroponics have high nutritional potential as a functional food important for human health and therefore could be recommended for daily diet.

AB  - Desecheo Island (117 ha) was historically an important seabird island in the Caribbean with 15 species recorded, of which seven are known to breed, including major populations of brown boobies and red-footed bobbies. The introduction of invasive mammals, plus the use of the island as a bombing range, contributed to the extirpation of five of the seven known breeding populations of seabird species and vastly reduced numbers of the remaining two species. The island became a National Wildlife Refuge in 1976 and major conservation interventions have included the eradication of invasive goats, rhesus macaques and rats between 1976 and 2016. Removing these critical threats from the island has allowed other active restoration goals to be realized, including restoring seabird colonies to the island. Here, we report on the installation of social attraction equipment in 2018 to augment bridled tern and brown noddy colonies and establish a species of conservation concern, the Audubon's shearwater. We supported these actions through a review of historic seabird nesting and roosting on Desecheo. Motion-sensing cameras were installed to document activity at each social attraction site and evaluate the effectiveness of our methods. During the 2 years of deployment and monitoring, a total of seven bridled tern nests were documented in new and historic sites for the species, two of them next to a decoy colony; however, no brown noddy visits or nests were detected. In 2018 and 2019, one and two Audubon's shearwaters, respectively, were attracted to one of the sound system speakers, representing the first record for this species on the island. Social attraction efforts on Desecheo appears to be a feasible activity that may help support seabird recolonization and support conservation goals for this National Wildlife Refuge.

AB  - BackgroundWith the development of communication technology, the public is paying increasing attention to whether electromagnetic radiation is harmful to health. Mobile phone communication has entered the 5G era, and there are almost no reports on electromagnetic radiation at 2650 MHz. Therefore, it is necessary to evaluate the risk of adverse effects of 5G mobile phone EMR exposure on the human brain. MethodsMale animals were continuously exposed to 2650 MHz-EMR for 28 days with a whole-body averaged specific absorption rate (WBSAR) of 2.06 W/kg for 4 h per day. Mouse behavior was assessed using the open-field test (OFT), elevated-plus maze (EPM), and tail suspension test (TST). The Morris water maze (MWM), HE staining, and TUNEL staining were used to evaluate the spatial memory ability and pathological morphology of hippocampal dentate gyrus cells. Additionally, the expression levels of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), aminobutyric acid (GABA), and glucocorticoid (GR) in the hippocampus were detected by western blotting and immunohistochemistry, while the corticosterone (CORT) level in serum was detected by ELISA. ResultsIn the OFT, the total distance traveled, central distance traveled, and residence time significantly decreased in the EMR exposure group (p < .05). In EPM, the percentage of the number of times to open the arm and the percentage of time to open the arm significantly decreased in the EMR exposure group. However, in the TST, the two groups had no significant difference in the 4-min immobility time. In the MWM, the escape latency of the EMR exposure group was shorter than that of the control group, with no significant difference. Furthermore, CORT levels in serum were significantly increased in the EMR exposure group (p < .05), while the expression of BDNF and GR proteins in the hippocampus was reduced (p < .05), but there was no significant difference in GABA expression. ConclusionsOur results indicate that exposure to 2650 MHz-EMR (WBSAR: 2.06 W/kg, 28 days, 4 h per day) had no significant effect on the spatial memory ability of mice (in comparison to little effect). The exposure may be associated with anxiety-like behavior in mice but not related to depression-like behavior in mice.

AB  - This study investigated effects of volatile blends released from undamaged (UD), insect-damaged [ID, plants fed by larvae of Spilosoma obliqua Walker (Lepidoptera: Arctiidae)] and mechanically-damaged (MD) plants of three green gram cultivars [PDM 54, Pusa Baisakhi and Samrat] including synthetic blends on the behavior of conspecific adult moths in Y-tube olfactometer bioassays. Females showed attraction towards volatile blends of UD, ID and MD plants of these green gram cultivars against the control solvent (CH2Cl2). The components of volatile blends in UD plants of three green gram cultivars are not similar, but no any difference was found among three cultivars in term of the attractive effect on the insect moths when volatile blends from UD plants of these three cultivars were tested against one another. Females were more attracted towards volatile blends of ID plants of a particular cultivar compared to UD plants of the same cultivar. Total amount of volatiles was higher in ID plants than UD plants. Some herbivore-induced plant volatiles - (Z)-3-hexenal, 1-hexanol, (Z)-3-hexenyl acetate, 2-octanol and ocimene were attractive to the insect moths. Females were attracted towards three synthetic blends resembling amounts present in natural volatile blends of ID plants of these three cultivars in Y-tube olfactometer and wind tunnel bioassays, suggesting that involvement of host-specific chemical cues in long-range host location by S. obliqua females. If attraction of adult S. obliqua to these synthetic volatile blends is upheld by field trials then these blends may find practical application in detection and monitoring of S. obliqua populations.

AB  - Activated small ubiquitin-like modifiers (SUMOs) have been implicated in neuropathological processes following ischemic stroke. However, the target proteins of SUMOylation and their contribution to neuronal injury remain to be elucidated. MLK3 (mixed-lineage kinase 3), a member of the mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase (MAPKKK) family, is a critical regulator of neuronal lesions following cerebral ischemia. Here, we found that SUMOylation of MLK3 increases in both global and focal ischemic rodent models and primary neuronal models of oxygen and glucose deprivation (OGD). SUMO1 conjugation at the Lys401 site of MLK3 promoted its activation, stimulated its downstream p38/c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) cascades, and led to cell apoptosis. The interaction of MLK3 with PIAS3, a SUMO ligase, was elevated following ischemia and reperfusion. The PINIT domain of PIAS3 was involved in direct interactions with MLK3. Overexpression of the PINIT domain of PIAS3 disrupted the MLK3-PIAS3 interaction, inhibited SUMOylation of MLK3, suppressed downstream signaling, and reduced cell apoptosis and neurite damage. In rodent ischemic models, the overexpression of the PINIT domain reduced brain lesions and alleviated deficits in learning, memory, and sensorimotor functions. Our findings demonstrate that brain ischemia-induced MLK3 SUMOylation by PIAS3 is a potential target against poststroke neuronal lesions and behavioral impairments.

AB  - Veterinarians are increasingly confronted with new technologies, such as Precision Livestock Farming (PLF), which allows for automated animal monitoring on commercial farms. At the same time, we lack information on how veterinarians, as stakeholders who may play a mediating role in the public debate on livestock farming, perceive the use and the impact of such technologies. This study explores the meaning veterinarians attribute to the application of PLF in the context of public concerns related to pig production. Semi-structured interviews were carried out with pig veterinarians located in the Netherlands and Germany. By using an inductive and semantic approach to reflexive thematic analysis, we developed four main themes from the interview data: (1) the advisory role of the veterinarian, which is characterized by a diverse scope, including advice on PLF, generally positive evaluations and financial dependencies; (2) the delineation of PLF technologies as supporting tools, which are seen as an addition to human animal care; (3) the relationship between veterinarian and farmer, which is context-related, ranging from taking sides with to distancing oneself from farmers; and (4) the distance between agriculture and society, in the context of which PLF has both a mitigating and reinforcing potential. The present findings indicate that veterinarians play an active role in the emerging field of PLF in livestock farming. They are aware of and reflect on competing interests of different groups in society and share positions with different stakeholders. However, the extent to which they are able to mediate between stakeholder groups in practice seems to be constrained by external factors, such as financial dependencies.

AB  - Oilseed plants accumulate triacylglycerol (TAG) up to 80% of seed weight with the TAG fatty acid composition determining its nutritional value or use in the biofuel or chemical industries. Two major pathways for production of diacylglycerol (DAG), the immediate precursor to TAG, have been identified in plants: de novo DAG synthesis and conversion of the membrane lipid phosphatidylcholine (PC) to DAG, with each pathway producing distinct TAG compositions. However, neither pathway fits with previous biochemical and transcriptomic results from developing Physaria fendleri seeds for accumulation of TAG containing >60% lesquerolic acid (an unusual 20 carbon hydroxylated fatty acid), which accumulates at only the sn-1 and sn-3 positions of TAG. Isotopic tracing of developing P. fendleri seed lipid metabolism identified that PC-derived DAG is utilized to initially produce TAG with only one lesquerolic acid. Subsequently a nonhydroxylated fatty acid is removed from TAG (transiently reproducing DAG) and a second lesquerolic acid is incorporated. Thus, a dynamic TAG remodeling process involving anabolic and catabolic reactions controls the final TAG fatty acid composition. Reinterpretation of P. fendleri transcriptomic data identified potential genes involved in TAG remodeling that could provide a new approach for oilseed engineering by altering oil fatty acid composition after initial TAG synthesis; and the comparison of current results to that of related Brassicaceae species in the literature suggests the possibility of TAG remodeling involved in incorporation of very long-chain fatty acids into the TAG sn-1 position in various plants.

AB  - The allocation of energy toward gamete production, parental care, mate choice, and secondary sexual signals fosters divergence in selection between the sexes, giving rise to opposing fitness strategies and sexual antagonism. The shared genetic makeup results in single genomic loci that harbor a gene or variant with varying fitness impacts on each sex. The resolution of this intralocus sexual conflict relies on intersex bias in gene expression and/or the formation of sex-linked genomic regions, which may also play a role in regulating sex determination. Shifts in the sex determination locus may happen. While the precise mechanisms driving these shifts are unknown, sexual antagonism was long believed to be a major contributor. To investigate the link between sexual antagonism and sex determination, we selected three syngnathid species along the gradient of their unique male pregnancy that evolved with different intensities of precopulatory sexual selection, i.e. sex-specific roles in mate choice. Examining intersex genetic divergence (Fst) and patterns of sex-biased expression, we revealed that precopulatory sexual selection and male pregnancy, rather than male pregnancy alone, are the primary drivers of sexual antagonism. In addition, we identified processes involving noncoding RNAs and biased variant expression as mediators of sexual antagonism. Notably, we discovered an intraspecies sex chromosome polymorphism in the seahorse Hippocampus erectus. The polymorphism may have resulted from generations of captive breeding or represents a natural polymorphism in wild populations. Our findings suggest that sexual antagonism resolution mechanisms can directly shape sex determination evolution across species, providing key insights into the molecular pathways underlying reproductive adaptation and diversification.

AB  - Plants have evolved diverse secondary metabolites to counteract biotic stress. Volatile organic compounds (VOCs) are released upon herbivore attack or pathogen infection. Recent studies suggest that VOCs can act as signalling molecules in plant defence and induce resistance in distant organs and neighbouring plants. However, knowledge is lacking on the function of VOCs in biotrophic fungal infection on cereal plants. We analysed VOCs emitted by 13 +/- 1-day-old barley plants (Hordeum vulgare L.) after mechanical wounding using passive absorbers and TD-GC/MS. We investigated the effect of pure VOC and complex VOC mixtures released from wounded plants on the barley-powdery mildew interaction by pre-exposure in a dynamic headspace connected to a powdery mildew susceptibility assay. Untargeted metabolomics and lipidomics were applied to investigate metabolic changes in sender and receiver barley plants. Green leaf volatiles (GLVs) dominated the volatile profile of wounded barley plants, with (Z)-3-hexenyl acetate (Z3HAC) as the most abundant compound. Barley volatiles emitted after mechanical wounding enhanced resistance in receiver plants towards fungal infection. We found volatile-mediated modifications of the plant-pathogen interaction in a concentration-dependent manner. Pre-exposure with physiologically relevant concentrations of Z3HAC resulted in induced resistance, suggesting that this GLV is a key player in barley anti-pathogen defence. The complex VOC mixture released from wounded barley and Z3HAC induced e.g. accumulation of chlorophyll, linolenic acid and linolenate-conjugated lipids, as well as defence-related secondary metabolites, such as hordatines in receiving plants. Barley VOCs hence induce a complex physiological response and disease resistance in receiver plants.

AB  - Lipid dyshomeostasis and neuroinflammation are key hallmarks of neuropsychiatric and neurodegenerative disorders, including major depressive disorder and Alzheimer's disease. In particular, polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) and their derivatives called oxylipins gained specific interest in this context, especially considering their capacity to orchestrate neuroinflammatory responses via direct modulation of microglia. The hippocampus and hypothalamus are crucial brain regions for regulating mood and cognition that are implicated in a variety of neuropsychiatric and neurodegenerative disorders and there is ample evidence for the sex-bias in risks for the development as well as sex-bias in the presentation of such psychiatric diseases, including the neuroinflammatory response. To better understand the local PUFA/oxylipin profiles and microglia responses in disease, we here assessed their brain region and sex-dependent profiles in homeostatic brains. In 2-month-old male and female mice, we measured non-esterified (free) PUFA/oxylipin profiles using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry and characterized microglia morphology via immunohistochemistry. The hypothalamus and hippocampus exhibit a different free PUFA/oxylipin profile, independent of sex. The hippocampus was characterized by a higher density of complex Iba1+ microglial cells than the hypothalamus, without sex effects. Hypothalamic microglial morphology correlated more strongly with free PUFA- and oxylipin species than hippocampal microglia, correlating with species from both the N-3 and N-6 PUFA metabolization pathways, while hippocampal microglial parameters correlated only with N-6 pathway-related species. Our findings provide a basis for future studies to investigate the relationship between PUFAs, their derivatives and neuroinflammation in the context of diseases.

AB  - Alternaria leaf spot is a major disease of Brassica crops, and it causes huge economic loss to both the cultivated Brassica oilseeds and vegetables. The present study was aimed to develop a nondestructive robust method for screening of wild Brassica species and to find resistant wild species against Alternaria brassicicola (Schw.) Wiltsh. For this, 38 wild species of Brassicaceae were screened at adult plant stage by an in vitro detached leaf inoculation method in three consecutive years i.e. 2019-2020, 2020-2021 and 2021-2022. The new screening protocol created favourable environment (temperature 25 +/- 2 degrees C; relative humidity > 90%) for the pathogen by using incubator. The host leaves were retained in turgid condition by placing sucrose 5% w/v on slanting cut at petiolar base. The consistency in reactions of the wild species against A. brassicicola during all three years of testing indicates the robustness of the protocol. Multiple parameters were recorded on leaf condition and disease response of the wild species and devised a score system for disease rating. Complete resistance was observed in Capsella while resistance in Lepidium, Camelina and Biscutella. Both Capsella bursa pastoris (L.) Medik (early) and C. bursa pastoris (late) were symptomless resistant. Camelina sativa (L.) Crantz, Diplotaxis erucoides (L.) DC and Diplotaxis gomez-campoi Mart.-Laborde were found to be resistant against A. brassicicola. The significant correlation between disease parameters indicates the robustness and effectiveness of the screening protocol for wild Brassica species.

AB  - African swine fever (ASF) is a haemorrhagic fever of swine that severely constrains pig production, globally. In Uganda, at least 388 outbreaks of ASF were documented from 2001 to 2012. We undertook a retrospective serological and molecular survey of ASF virus (ASFV) using banked samples collected from seven districts (Pallisa, Lira, Abim, Nebbi, Kabarole, Kibaale, and Mukono) of Uganda. Six assays (ELISA for antibody detection, diagnostic p72 gene PCR and genomic amplification, and sequencing of four gene regions (p72 [P], p54 [A], CVR of the 9RL-ORF [C], and TK [T]), hereinafter referred to as P-A-C-T (PACT)) were evaluated. Antibodies to ASFV were detected in the Abim district (6/25; 24.0%), and the remainder of the serum samples were negative (187/193; 96.9%). For the tissue samples, ASFV detection by assay was 8.47% for P, 6.78% for A, 8.47% for C, and 16.95% for T. The diagnostic PCR (p72 gene) detected seven positive animals from four districts, whereas the TK assay detected ten positives from all seven districts. In addition to the superior detection capability of TK, two virus variants were discernible, whereas CVR recovered three variants, and p72 and p54 sequencing each identified a single variant belonging to genotype IX. Our results indicate that dependence on serology alone underestimates ASF positivity in any infected region, that multi-locus sequence analysis provides better estimates of outbreak strain diversity, and that the TK assay is superior to the WOAH-prescribed conventional p72 diagnostic PCR, and warrants further investigation.

AB  - Against the background of high demand for protein-rich feed in the EU and the environmental degradation associated with intensive livestock farming, insect-based feed is discussed as a potential sustainable alternative to conventional feed. However, the establishment of such an innovation depends not only upon technical and economic feasibility, but also on social factors impacting acceptability. The aim of this paper was to determine the acceptability of different social actor groups towards the use of insects as livestock feed, and to gain insights into value-based arguments leading to positive or negative attitudes and perceived benefits and risks. By means of qualitative content analysis, we analysed responses of an EU public consultation process linked to the authorization of insect protein in pig and poultry feed. We found a broad range of value-based arguments that influence the complex judgement process of acceptability that have been neglected in prior quantitative surveys. In particular, our results bring forward more critical voices, such as animal welfare concerns and scepticism that insect-based feed can contribute to a more sustainable livestock system. Based on these findings, we discuss whether insects as feed are a viable contribution to a sustainability-oriented transformation of the agri-food system. We conclude that under certain conditions (when raised on low-value organic side streams such as manure) insect-based livestock feed may contribute to incremental sustainability improvements. Overall, however, the innovation has limitations, not only in terms of regulatory conditions but especially with regard to ethical concerns.

AB  - Acute administration of MK-801 (dizocilpine), an N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) antagonist, can establish animal models of psychiatric disorders. However, the roles of microglia and inflammation-related genes in these animal models of psychiatric disorders remain unknown. Here, we found rapid elimination of microglia in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and hippocampus (HPC) of mice following administration of the dual colony-stimulating factor 1 receptor (CSF1R)/c-Kit kinase inhibitor PLX3397 (pexidartinib) in drinking water. Single administration of MK-801 induced hyperactivity in the open-field test (OFT). Importantly, PLX3397-induced depletion of microglia prevented the hyperactivity and schizophrenia-like behaviors induced by MK-801. However, neither repopulation of microglia nor inhibition of microglial activation by minocycline affected MK-801-induced hyperactivity. Importantly, microglial density in the PFC and HPC was significantly correlated with behavioral changes. In addition, common and distinct glutamate-, GABA-, and inflammation-related gene (116 genes) expression patterns were observed in the brains of PLX3397-and/or MK-801-treated mice. Moreover, 10 common inflammation-related genes (CD68, CD163, CD206, TMEM119, CSF3R, CX3CR1, TREM2, CD11b, CSF1R, and F4/80) with very strong correlations were identified in the brain using hierarchical clustering analysis. Further correlation analysis demonstrated that the behavioral changes in the OFT were most significantly associated with the expression of inflammation-related genes (NLRP3, CD163, CD206, F4/80, TMEM119, and TMEM176a), but not glutamate-or GABA-related genes in PLX3397-and MK-801-treated mice. Thus, our results suggest that microglial depletion via a CSF1R/c-Kit kinase inhibitor can ameliorate the hyperactivity induced by an NMDAR antagonist, which is associated with modulation of immune-related genes in the brain.

AB  - Environmental arsenic contamination is a serious global issue that adversely affects human health and diminishes the quality of harvested produce. Glutathione (GSH) is known to bind and detoxify arsenic and other toxic metals. A steady level of GSH is maintained within cells via the gamma-glutamyl cycle. The gamma-glutamyl cyclotransferases (GGCTs) have previously been shown to be involved in GSH degradation and increased tolerance to toxic metals in plants. In this study, we characterized the GGCT2;1 homolog from Camelina sativa for its role in arsenic tolerance and accumulation. Overexpression of CsGGCT2;1 in Camelina under CaMV35S constitutive promoter resulted in strong tolerance to arsenite (AsIII). The overexpression (OE) lines had 2.6-3.5-fold higher shoots and sevenfold to tenfold enhanced root biomass on media supplemented with AsIII, relative to wild-type plants. The CsGGCT2;1 OE lines accumulated 40-60% less arsenic in root and shoot tissues compared to wild-type plants. Further, the OE lines had similar to twofold higher chlorophyll content and 35% lesser levels of malondialdehyde (MDA), an indicator of membrane damage via lipid peroxidation. There was a slight but non-significant increase in 5-oxoproline (5-OP), a product of GSH degradation, in OE lines. However, the transcript levels of Oxoprolinase 1 (OXP1) were upregulated, indicating the accelerated conversion of 5-OP to glutamate, which is further utilized for the resynthesis of GSH to maintain GSH homeostasis. Overall, this research suggests that genetically modified Camelina may have the potential for cultivation on contaminated marginal lands to reduce As accumulation; thereby could help in addressing food safety issues as well as future food and biofuel needs.

AB  - The palaeoecology of megamammals has been commonly accessed by stable isotope. Particularly in the Americas, this approach has been focusing efforts on the study of intertropical species, especially from a key paleozoogeographical region in the Late Quaternary of South America: the Brazilian Intertropical Region (BIR). Here we present an isotopic study (delta C-13) conducted on bioapatite samples of Smilodon populator, Protocyon troglodytes and Arctotherium wingei from the BIR. We discuss their potential prey preferences, niche width and overlap, and paleoenvironmental reconstitutions. Our results suggest a generalist carnivorous diet for P. troglodytes (delta C-13 = - 5.0 parts per thousand; B-A = 0.83), a specialist C-3 herbivorous diet and opportunistic scavenger behaviour for A. wingei (delta C-13 = - 11.0 +/- 2.1 parts per thousand; B-A = 0.00), and a specialist carnivorous diet for S. populator (delta C-13 = - 8.5 +/- 1.6 parts per thousand; B-A = 0.06). Within the Late Pleistocene of the BIR, P. troglodytes possibly inhabited open savanna-like environments, while S. populator and A. wingei occupied arboreal savanna forests. An atypical preference for small and medium-size prey for the predator S. populator, and a mainly herbivorous diet with a slight amount of meat for the bear A. wingei is also discussed.

AB  - To contribute to research on female models of Alzheimer's disease (AD), our aim was to study the effect of intracerebroventricular (ICV) injection of streptozotocin (STZ) in female rats, and to evaluate a potential neuroprotective action of ovarian steroids against STZ. Female rats were either ovariectomized (OVX) or kept with ovaries (Sham) two weeks before ICV injections. Animals were injected with either vehicle (artificial cerebrospinal fluid, aCSF) or STZ (3 mg/kg) and separated into four experimental groups: Sham + aCSF, Sham + STZ, OVX + aCSF and OVX + STZ. Nineteen days post-injection, we assessed different behavioral aspects: burying, anxiety and exploration, object recognition memory, spatial memory, and depressive-like behavior. Immunohistochemistry and Immunoblot analyses were performed in the hippocampus to examine changes in AD-related proteins and neuronal and microglial populations. STZ affected burying and exploratory behavior depending on ovarian status, and impaired recognition but not spatial memory. STZ and ovariectomy increased depressive-like behavior. Interestingly, STZ did not alter the expression of beta-amyloid peptide or Tau phosphorylated forms. STZ affected the neuronal population from the Dentate Gyrus, where immature neurons were more vulnerable to STZ in OVX rats. Regarding microglia, STZ increased reactive cells, and the OVX + STZ group showed an increase in the total cell number. In sum, STZ partially affected female rats, compared to what was previously reported for males. Although AD is more frequent in women, reports about the effect of ICV-STZ in female rats are scarce. Our work highlights the need to deepen into the effects of STZ in the female brain and study possible sex differences.

AB  - Statistical learning, the ability of the human brain to uncover patterns organized according to probabilistic relationships between elements and events of the environment, is a powerful learning mechanism underlying many cognitive processes. Here we examined how memory for statistical learning of probabilistic spatial configurations is impacted by interference at the time of initial exposure and varying degrees of wakefulness and sleep during subsequent offline processing. We manipulated levels of interference at learning by varying the time between exposures of different spatial configurations. During the subsequent offline period, participants either remained awake (active wake or quiet wake) or took a nap comprised of either non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep only or NREM and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. Recognition of the trained spatial configurations, as well as a novel configuration exposed after the offline period, was tested approximately 6-7 h after initial exposure. We found that the sleep conditions did not provide any additional memory benefit compared to wakefulness for spatial statistical learning with low interference. For high interference, we found some evidence that memory may be impaired following quiet wake and NREM sleep only, but not active wake or combined NREM and REM sleep. These results indicate that learning conditions may interact with offline brain states to influence the longterm retention of spatial statistical learning.

AB  - The antifungal and biological control effects of phytochemicals from the leaves and seeds of Acacia concinna and Lantana camara were analyzed against plant phytofungi and the mealy bug Maconellicoccus hirsutus. The methanol and aqueous extract derived from A. concinna and L. camara inhibited the growth of phytofungi. The methanol extracts showed the broad spectrum antimicrobial properties as they inhibited the mycelial growth of Alternaria alternate K3, Fusarium oxysporum S10, Fusarium solani L16, Aspergillus flavus J12, and Colletotrichum falcatum Went C9. The methanolic extract of A. concinna seed inhibited the growth of A. flavus J12 and the mycelia growth was 10 +/- 2 mm after three days, whereas the leaf extract effectively inhibited mycelia growth (23 +/- 1 mm) after seven days of culture. Minimum inhibitory concentration values of methanolic extract of A. concinna seed was 125 +/- 25 mu g/mL against A. alternate K3, and 100 +/- 0 mu g/mL against F. solani L16. The phenolic content was 479 +/- 13.8 GAE/g dw in A. concinna in seeds while in L. camara seeds it was 548 +/- 20.1 GAE/g dw. The flavonoid content was high in L. camara seed extract (282 +/- 10.1 mg QE/g) than A. concinna seeds (214 +/- 2.49 mg QE/g). The methanolic extract of leaves and seeds showed pesticide activity against mealy bug. The mortality of the adult mealy bugs was maximum after 72 h of treatment. The concentration of L. camara seed extract (0.2%-1.0%) exhibited increased mortality than control. Additionally, L. camara and A. concinna extracts improved activity against mealy bug. Considering these facts, medicinal plants-derived secondary metabolites represent a novel source of various bioactive potentials with synergism against phytopathogenic fungi and insect pests.

AB  - Mangrove forests are sources and sinks for various pollutants. This study analyzed the current status of heavy metal and arsenic (As) pollution in mangrove surface sediments in rapidly industrializing and urbanizing port cities. Surface sediments of mangroves at Wulishan Port on the Leizhou Peninsula, China, were analyzed using inductively coupled plasma emission spectrometry (ICP-AES) and inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) for the presence of Cr, Pb, Ni, Zn, Cd, Cu, As, and Hg. The Pollution load index, Nemerow pollution index, and Potential ecological risk index were employed to evaluate the pollutant. Multivariate statistical methods were applied for the qualitative analysis of pollutant sources, and the APCS-MLR receptor model was used for quantification. This study indicated the following results: (1) The average content of eight pollutants surpassed the local background level but did not exceed the Marine Sediment Quality standard. The pollution levels across the four sampling areas were ranked as III > IV > I > II. The area II exhibited relatively lower pollution levels with the grain size of the sediments dominated by sand, which was not conducive to pollutant adsorption and enrichment. (2) The factor analysis and cluster analyses identified three primary sources of contamination. As, Cr, Ni, and Pb originated from nearby industrial activities and their associated wastewater, suggesting that the primary source was the industrial source. Cd, Cu, and Zn stem from the cement columns utilized in oyster farming, alongside discharges from mariculture and pig farming, establishing a secondary agricultural source. Hg originated from ship exhaust burning oil and vehicle emissions in the vicinity, representing the third traffic source. (3) The APCS-MLR receptor model results demonstrated industrial, agricultural, and traffic sources contributing 47.19 %, 33.13 %, and 13.03 %, respectively, with 6.65 % attributed to unidentified sources.

AB  - The differential capacitance profile of electro-chemical interfaces reflects the physical properties of the double layer. For carbon electrodes and ionic-liquid-based electrolytes, these capacitance profiles are not fully understood. In this work, we utilize constant voltage molecular dynamics simulations to compute differential capacitance profiles of ionic liquids [BMIm(+)][BF4-] and [BMIm(+)][TFSI-] mixed with acetonitrile and 1,2-dichloroethane, at model graphene electrodes. We find that both pure and 10% mole fraction ionic liquid electrolytes exhibit camelshaped capacitance profiles with two peaks on either side of a minimum centered at the potential of zero charge. This profile shape results from the electric-field-induced rearrangement of ion structure within the inner layer closest to the electrode interface. At a low potential, the ionic liquid inner layer is concentrated with nonpolar trifluoromethyl and butyl functional groups of the anions and cations, corresponding to the minimum of the capacitance profiles. With increasing voltage, electrostatic interactions of polar/charged functional groups with the electrode surface compete with these nonpolar interactions, leading to ion rearrangement that increases the inner-layer charge density and results in higher capacitance. After the ion restructuring is complete, the response saturates and capacitance diminishes. The presence of organic solvent significantly changes the composition of the inner layer. For example, strong nonpolar interactions between dichloroethane molecules and the graphene surface substantially block ion/electrode contact at moderate potentials. Overall, our simulations highlight the dynamic nature of the inner region of organic electrolyte double layers and the sensitive dependence on electrolyte composition and applied voltage.

AB  - Zearalenone (ZEA) is a prevalent mycotoxin functions as an endocrine disrupter to the reproductive systems of farm animals, especially in pigs. To evaluate the effect and the underlying molecular changes that occurred when the porcine germline stem cells were exposed to ZEA, prospermatogonia (ProSGs) were enriched and treated with a gradient concentration (0-10 & mu;M) of ZEA for 2-8 days. Our results showed that the ZEA treatment inhibited the proliferation of ProSGs in a dose-dependent manner with a critical concentration at 1 & mu;M. Transcriptome analysis revealed that the differentially expressed genes mainly concentrated on the molecular function of positive regulation of response to stimulus, and the most enriching pathway is cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction. ZEA exposure decreased a buck of cytokine/chemokine expression involved in the inflammatory response and stem cells maintenance/self-renewal, moreover, some energy expenditure and anti-apoptosis genes were also down-regulated, while the up-regulated genes were mainly connected with the innate immunity. These data demonstrate that ZEA induces multiply cellular damage and may eventually do harm to the health and fertility of animals.

AB  - Introduction: In this study estimated genetic and phenotypic correlations between fifteen complete blood count (CBC) traits and thirty-three heritable plasma metabolites in young healthy nursery pigs. In addition, it provided an opportunity to identify candidate genes associated with variation in metabolite concentration and their potential association with immune response, disease resilience, and production traits.
   Methods: The blood samples were collected from healthy young pigs and Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) was used to quantify plasma metabolites. CBC was determined using the ADVIA (R) 2120i Hematology System. Genetic correlations of metabolite with CBC traits and single step genome-wide association study (ssGWAS) were estimated using the BLUPF90 programs.
   Results: Results showed low phenotypic correlation estimates between plasma metabolites and CBC traits. The highest phenotypic correlation was observed between lactic acid and plasma basophil concentration (0.36 +/- 0.04; p < 0.05). Several significant genetic correlations were found between metabolites and CBC traits. The plasma concentration of proline was genetically positively correlated with hemoglobin concentration (0.94 +/- 0.03; p < 0.05) and L-tyrosine was negatively correlated with mean corpuscular hemoglobin (MCH; -0.92 +/- 0.74; p < 0.05). The genomic regions identified in this study only explained a small percentage of the genetic variance of metabolites levels that were genetically correlated with CBC, resilience, and production traits.
   Discussion: The results of this systems approach suggest that several plasma metabolite phenotypes are phenotypically and genetically correlated with CBC traits, suggesting that they may be potential genetic indicators of immune response following disease challenge. Genomic analysis revealed genes and pathways that might interact to modulate CBC, resilience, and production traits.

AB  - Andrena camellia, an effective pollinator of the economically significant crop Camellia oleifera, can withstand the toxic pollen of C. oleifera, making An. camellia crucial for resource conservation and cultivation of C. oleifera. In this study, the whole genome of An. camellia was sequenced on the Oxford Nanopore platform. The assembled genome size was 340.73 Mb including 50 scaffolds (N50 = 47.435 Mb) and 131 contigs (N50 = 17.2 Mb). A total of 11,258 protein-coding genes were annotated; in addition, 1,104 noncoding RNAs were identified. Further analysis shows that some chromosomes of An. camellia have a high level of synteny with those of Apis mellifera, Osmia bicornis, and Andrena minutula. Thus, our reported genome of An. camellia serves as a valuable resource for studying species evolution, behavioral biology, and adaption to toxic pollen of C. oleifera.

AB  - Rapamycin is a lipophilic macrolide antibiotic which is famous for its immunosuppressive and anticancer activity. In recent years, rapamycin showed significant activity against various plant pathogenic fungi. However, the sensitivity of Colletotrichunm fungi to rapamycin is scarcely reported. In this study, we evaluated the sensitivity of 116 Colletotrichum isolates from tea-oil trees to rapamycin. Most isolates exhibited natural resistance with inhibition rates of 50 to 70% at 50 mu g/mL. Three Colletotrichum camelliae isolates were found to be sensitive to rapamycin. No mutations were detected in the direct target FKBP12 and indirect target TOR-FRB domain of resistant and sensitive C. camelliae isolates. Notably, the expression of the TOR homolog (CcTOR) was higher in resistant C. camelliae isolates compared to the sensitive ones and overexpression of CcTOR in the sensitive isolate CcS1 resulted in decreased sensitivity to rapamycin. Moreover, ribosomal protein S6 phosphorylation was abolished in the sensitive isolate CcS1 but not in the resistant isolate CcR1 under rapamycin treatment. In addition, the expression levels of ribosome biogenesis genes and two other components of TORC1 were higher in CcR1 compared to CcS1 under the same treatment, which suggested that the abundance of TORC1 in CcR1 was greater than in CcS1, leading to more active TORC1 signaling in CcR1. These results provided a better understanding about natural resistance of C. camelliae isolates to rapamycin and could help for developing new TORC1 signaling-targeting fungicides.

AB  - Electromagnetic field exposure to the nervous system can cause neurological changes. The effects of extremely low-frequency electromagnetic fields, such as second-generation and third-generation radiation, have been studied in most studies. The current study aimed to explore fourth-generation cellular phone radiation on hippocampal morphology and behavior in mice. Swiss albino male mice (n = 30) were randomly categorized into 3 groups; control, 40 min, and 60 min exposure to 2400 MHz radiofrequency electromagnetic radiation (RF-EMR) daily for 60 days. The control mice were housed in the same environments but were not exposed to anything. Anxiety-like behaviors were tested using the elevated plusmaze. For histological and stereological examination, the brain was dissected from the cranial cavity. On Cresyl violet stained brain slices, the number of pyramidal neurons in the cornu ammonis of the hippocampus were counted. In exposed mice compared to control mice, a significant increase in anxiety-like behavior has been observed. Histological observations have shown many black and dark blue cytoplasmic cells with shrunken morphology degenerative alterations in the neuronal hippocampus in the radiation exposed mice. In the RF-EMR mouse hippocampus, stereological analyses revealed a significant decrease in pyramidal and granule neurons compared to controls. Our findings suggest that 2400-MHz RF-EMR cell phone radiation affects the structural integrity of the hippocampus, which would lead to behavioral changes such as anxiety. However, it alerts us to the possible long-term detrimental effects of exposure to RF-EMR. (c) 2021 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier B.V. on behalf of King Saud University.

AB  - To determine whether trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO) would aggravate cognitive dysfunction from APP/PS1 mice and the potential protective effects of voluntary wheel running (VWR). TMAO impaired learning and memory abilities, and exercise reversed TMAO induced cognitive impairment. Serum TMAO, choline, betaine and TMA were significantly elevated from TMAO group, while exercise group had decreased TMAO, betaine and TMA level. TMAO group has significantly upregulated BACE1 from both hippocampus and cortex, also increased cathepsin B, p-Tau at Ser396&Ser404, GFAP, p-NF-kappa B p65 in cortex, while reduced BDNF, synaptophysin and PSD95 in hippocampus, also reduced occludin and ZO-1 from cortex, and reduced occludin from colon. In contrast, BACE1 from both hippocampus and cortex, also cathepsin B and p-Tauser396 from cortex were reduced, BDNF, snaptophysin, and PSD95 from hippocampus, ZO-1 from cortex, and occludin from colon were elevated post exercise compared to TMAO group. Exercise elevated alpha diversity index of cecal content, and TMAO and exercise affected gut microbiota profiles differentially. In conclusion, TMAO led to gut microbiota dysbiosis, impaired gut-brain integrity, elevated neuroinflammation, A beta pathology and tau phosphorylation, disordered synaptic function; and exercise could reverse TMAO induced cognitive dysfunction via improving the above markers. The potential deleterious effects of TMAO on cognitive function need to be validated in humans, also dosages of exercise for exerting neuroprotective effects against TMAO induced cognitive impairment.

AB  - Epilepsy is the most common chronic disorder in the nervous system, mainly characterized by recurrent, periodic, unpredictable seizures. Post-translational modifications (PTMs) are important protein functional regulators that regulate various physiological and pathological processes. It is significant for cell activity, stability, protein folding, and localization. Phosphoglycerate kinase (PGK) 1 has traditionally been studied as an important adenosine triphosphate (ATP)-generating enzyme of the glycolytic pathway. PGK1 catalyzes the reversible transfer of a phosphoryl group from 1, 3-bisphosphoglycerate (1, 3-BPG) to ADP, producing 3-phosphoglycerate (3-PG) and ATP. In addition to cell metabolism regulation, PGK1 is involved in multiple biological activities, including angiogenesis, autophagy, and DNA repair. However, the exact role of PGK1 succinylation in epilepsy has not been thoroughly investigated. The expression of PGK1 succinylation was analyzed by Immunoprecipitation. Western blots were used to assess the expression of PGK1, angiostatin, and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in a rat model of lithium-pilocarpine-induced acute epilepsy. Behavioral experiments were performed in a rat model of lithiumpilocarpine-induced acute epilepsy. ELISA method was used to measure the level of S100[3 in serum brain biomarkers' integrity of the blood-brain barrier. The expression of the succinylation of PGK1 was decreased in a rat model of lit hium-pilocarpine-induced acute epilepsy compared with the normal rats in the hippocampus. Interestingly, the lysine 15 (K15), and the arginine (R) variants of lentivirus increased the susceptibility in a rat model of lithium-pilocarpine-induced acute epilepsy, and the K15 the glutamate (E) variants, had the opposite effect. In addition, the succinylation of PGK1 at K15 affected the expression of PGK1 succinylation but not the expression of PGK1total protein. Furthermore, the study found that the succinylation of PGK1 at K15 may affect the level of angiostatin and VEGF in the hippocampus, which also affects the level of S100[3 in serum. In conclusion, the mutation of the K15 site of PGK1 may alter the expression of the succinylation of PGK1 and then affect the integrity of the blood-brain barrier through the angiostatin / VEGF pathway altering the activity of epilepsy, which may be one of the new mechanisms of treatment strategies.

AB  - IntroductionElectroacupuncture (EA) is a beneficial physiotherapy approach for addressing neuropsychiatric disorders. Nevertheless, the impact of EA on the gut microbiome in relation to anxiety disorders remains poorly understood.MethodsTo address this gap, we conducted a study using a chronic restraint stress (CRS) mouse model to investigate the anti-anxiety outcome of EA and its influence on gut microbiota. Our research involved behavioral tests and comprehensive sequencing of full-length 16S rRNA microbiomes.ResultsOur findings revealed that CRS led to significant anxiety-like behaviors and an imbalance in the gut microbiota. Specifically, we identified 13 species that exhibited changes associated with anxiety-like behaviors. Furthermore, EA partially alleviated both behaviors related to anxiety and the dysbiosis induced by CRS.DiscussionIn summary, this study sheds light on the alterations in gut microbiota species resulting from CRS treatment and brings new light into the connection between EA's anti-anxiety effects and the gut microbiota.

AB  - Streptococcus suis (S. suis) is an important swine pathogen and an emerging zoonotic agent worldwide. Serotype 9 is the most prevalent serotype in several European countries but it is relatively rare in China. In this study, through the investigation of the serotypes of 279 S. suis strains isolated from China from 2015 to 2017, it was found that serotype 9 is the second most prevalent serotype (43 out of 279), behind serotype 2 (83 out of 279). Next, the 43 serotype 9 isolates were sequenced and compared with those from the Netherland (28) and the U.K. (eight). For the purpose of comparison, the strain D12 (GCA_000231905), which has completed genome sequences, was also incorporated. Phylogenetic tree analysis showed that the strains from China and the U.K. were heterogeneous. In contrast, all but one from the Netherland belonged to the same clade. The dominant clades of Chinese strains (33) and strains from the Netherland (27) were very similar. Both of them may have originated from the same strain about 70 years ago. Then, the distributions of virulence-associated genes and antibiotic resistance genes among different clades and sources were analyzed. By comparison, strains from the Netherland carried more virulence-associated genes and those from the U.K. had more antibiotic resistance genes. Additionally, some virulence-associated genes (salK and salR) and antibiotic resistance genes (lincomycin and spectinomycin) existed only in several Chinese strains. In conclusion, our data displayed the population characteristics and differences of S. suis serotype 9 between China and Europe, suggesting that they have taken different evolutionary paths.

AB  - Current management models for many endangered species focus primarily on demographic recovery, often ignoring their intrinsic ecological requirements. Across the protected area network of southern Africa, most southern white rhinoceros are managed in populations of less than 50 individuals, experiencing restricted dispersal opportunities, and limited breeding male numbers due to their exclusive home range requirements. In the absence of information on the breeding structure of these populations, poor management decisions may require females to either forego a breeding opportunity or select to inbreed with close relatives. Here, we use a combination of social pedigree data together with genetic analyses to reconstruct the parentage of all 28 offspring produced in a 5-year period in a managed free-ranging southern white rhinoceros population. During this period, all breeding females (founders and first-generation daughters) had access to both a founder male (father to most of the daughters) and two recently introduced inexperienced males. We report that while founder females were more likely to breed with the founder male, their daughters, in contrast, were more likely to breed with the introduced males, thus avoiding inbreeding. However, we also found evidence of father-daughter inbreeding in this population, and contend that in the absence of choice, rather than forego a breeding opportunity, female white rhinoceros will inbreed with their fathers. We argue that to effectively conserve the southern white rhinoceros, managers need to understand the breeding structure of these small populations, particularly in terms of parentage and kinship.

AB  - Mastitis poses a huge economic burden, with antibiotics treatment leading to drug residues and the emergence of bacterial resistance. Therefore, there is an urgent need to develop alternatives to antibiotics for the treatment of mastitis. Anthocyanins (ACN) have excellent anti-inflammatory properties. However, the key pathways of mastitis disease progression and the therapeutic effects of ACN on mastitis remain poorly understood. In this study, using cows, goats, and mice as animal models, the efficacy of ACN extracts from crabapple fruit is investigated in alleviating the severity of mastitis and blood milk barrier (BMB) damage. A monomeric component, cyanidin 3-O-galactoside (C3Gal) is identified, that exhibited considerable effect on mastitis. Mechanistically, C3Gal regulated mastitis progression by inhibiting PANoptosis activation, and suppressing gasdermin D N-terminal activity to regulate BMB damage during mastitis. These findings establish PANoptosis as a critical pathway in the rapid progression of mastitis and highlight the potential of ACN extracts as effective alternatives to antibiotic for mastitis treatment. This study provides a promising strategy for the discovery and application of drugs for the treatment of inflammatory diseases, expands the application of ACN in inflammatory diseases, and elucidates the molecular mechanisms underlying its anti-inflammatory effect.

AB  - Perinatal exposure to bisphenol A (BPA) in murine models has been reported to affect social behavior and increase anxiety. However, there is little information about the effects of BPA exposure during puberty, a period in which sex hormones influence the maturation and differentiation of the brain. In this work, we evaluated the effect of BPA administration during the juvenile stage (PND 21-50) on anxiety in male and female rats. Newly weaned Wistar rats were treated with BPA (0, 50, or 500 mu g/kg/day) for 30 days. To compare the intra- and inter-sex behavioral profiles, rats were evaluated using four different anxiety models: the Open field test (OFT), the Elevated plus maze (EPM), the Light-dark box test (LDBT), and the Defensive burying test (DBT). Males exhibited a clear-cut anxious profile at both doses in all four tests, while no clear behavioral effect of BPA exposure was observed in female rats. The latter showed an altered estrous cycle that initiated earlier in life and had a shorter duration, with the estrous phase predominating. Moreover, the expression of ESR1, ESR2, GABRA1, GRIN1, GR, MR, and AR genes increased in the hippocampus and hypothalamus of male rats treated with 50 mu g/kg, but not in females. Our results indicate that BPA consistently induces a higher anxiety profile in male than in female rats, as evidenced predominantly by an increase in passive-coping behaviors and changes in brain gene expression, highlighting the importance of sex in peripubertal behavioral toxicology studies.

AB  - Monitoring of pachyderm movements in the neighbourhood of a forest is an important area of research for mitigation of human-wildlife conflict issues. This paper reports the feasibility study for the detection of elephants using seismic sensors inside a forest environment and further characterisation of the seismic signals. Seismic signals generated during elephant locomotion are analysed for various distances. Frequency analysis of these signals shows an average dominant frequency of 15.80 Hz (+/- 1.03 s.d.) and 16.52 Hz (+/- 1.20 s.d.) in the range of 0 m to similar to 20 m and 20 m to similar to 40 m respectively. Based on frequency information of the seismic signal, different filter bands were incorporated and the highest accuracy of detection was achieved corresponding to the filter band of 10-20 Hz. The paper also illustrates the statistical analysis of three signal detection algorithms; short and long time averaging (STA/LTA), amplitude spectrum of Fourier transform (ASFT) and continuous wavelet transform (CWT) as a function of the distance from the sensor and elephant group size. Comparative analysis of the preliminary dataset was carried out where CWT based detection approach shows F1-score improvement of similar to 28% and similar to 14% in comparison with STA/LTA and ASFT respectively for a radial distance 0-20 m whereas, similar to 2% for a radial distance 20-40 m from the sensor. Furthermore, CWT outperforms with a detection accuracy of similar to 90% on the preliminary dataset.

AB  - The prenatal stress (PNS) model in rodents can induce different abnormal responses that replicate the pathophysiology of depression. We applied this model to evaluate the efficacy of piromelatine (Pir), a novel melatonin analog developed for the treatment of insomnia, in male and female offspring. Adult PNS rats from both sexes showed comparable disturbance associated with high levels of anxiety and depressive responses. Both males and females with PNS demonstrated impaired feedback inhibition of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis compared to the intact offspring and increased glucocorticoid receptors in the hippocampus. However, opposite to female offspring, the male PNS rats showed an increased expression of mineralocorticoid receptors in the hippocampus. Piromelatine (20 mg/kg, i.p., for 21 days injected from postnatal day 60) attenuated the high anxiety level tested in the open field, elevated plus-maze and light-dark test, and depressive-like behavior in the sucrose preference and the forced swimming tests in a sex-specific manner. The drug reversed to control level stress-induced increase of plasma corticosterone 120 min later in both sexes. Piromelatine also corrected to control level the PNS-induced alterations of corticosteroid receptors only in male offspring. Our findings suggest that the piromelatine treatment exerts beneficial effects on impaired behavioral responses and dysregulated HPA axis in both sexes, while it corrects the PNS-induced changes in the hippocampal corticosteroid receptors only in male offspring.

AB  - Adult neurogenesis is a flexible process that depends on the environment and correlates with cognitive functions. Cognitive functions are impaired by various factors including space flight conditions and reduced physical activity. Physically active life significantly improves both cognition and the hippocampal neurogenesis. Here, we analyzed how 3-day simulated microgravity caused by hindlimb unloading (HU) or dynamic foot stimulation (DFS) during HU can affect the hippocampal neurogenesis. Adult Wistar rats were recruited in the experiments. The results demonstrated a decrease in the number of doublecortine (DCX) positive neural progenitors, but proliferation in the subgranular zone of the dentate gyrus was not changed after 3-day HU. Analysis of the effects of DFS showed restoration of neural progenitor population in the subgranular zone of the dentate gyrus. Additionally, we analyzed activity of the cRaf/ERK1/2 pathway, which is one of the major players in the regulation of neuronal differentiation. The results demonstrated inhibition of cRaf/ERK1/2 signaling in the hippocampus of HU rats. In DFS rats, no changes in the activity of cRaf/ERK1/2 were observed. Thus, we demonstrated that the process of neurogenesis fading during HU begins with inhibition of the formation of immature neurons and associated ERK1/2 signaling activity, while DFS prevents the development of mentioned alterations.

AB  - Molting is a key biological process of crustaceans, which is mainly regulated by 20-hydroxyecdyone (20E). The molting cycle could be divided into three main stages including pre-molt, post-molt and inter-molt stages. The mechanism of immune regulation during molting process still requires further exploration. Yorkie (Yki) is a pivotal transcription factor in the Hippo signaling pathway, and it plays an essential role in regulating cell growth and immune response. In the present study, a Yki gene was identified from Eriocheir sinensis (designed as EsYki), and the regulatory role of EsYki in controlling the expression of antimicrobial peptide genes throughout the molting process was investigated. The mRNA expression level of EsYki was higher at the pre-molt stage compared to the post-molt stage and inter-molt stage. Following the injection of 20E, there was a notable and consistent rise in the EsYki mRNA expression in haemocytes. The increase was observed from 3 h to 48 h with the maximum level at 12 h. And the phosphorylation of Yki in the haemocytes was also significantly up-regulated at 3 h post 20E injection. Moreover, the levels of EsYki mRNA expression at three molting stages were significantly increased post Aeromonas hydrophila stimulation. The maximum level was detected at post-molt stage following A. hydrophila stimulation, while the lowest level was observed at inter-molt stage. The expression pattern of EsCrus was in contrast to EsCrus. After EsYki mRNA transcripts were inhibited by Yki inhibitor (CA3), the mRNA expression levels of EsCrus1 and EsCrus2 following A. hydrophila stimulation were significantly elevated. Furthermore, the phosphorylation level of NF-kappa B was also increased following the inhibition of Yki. Collectively, our findings indicated that EsYki could be induced by 20E and has a suppressive effect on the expression of EsCrus via inhibiting NF-kappa B during molting process. This research contributes to the understanding of the immunological regulation mechanism during molting process in crustaceans.

AB  - Presently, customer retention is essential for reducing customer churn in telecommunication industry. Customer churn prediction (CCP) is important to predict the possibility of customer retention in the quality of services. Since risks of customer churn also get essential, the rise of machine learning (ML) models can be employed to investigate the characteristics of customer behavior. Besides, deep learning (DL) models help in prediction of the customer behavior based characteristic data. Since the DL models necessitate hyperparameter modelling and effort, the process is difficult for research communities and business people. In this view, this study designs an optimal deep canonically correlated autoencoder based prediction (ODCCAEP) model for competitive customer dependent application sector. In addition, the O-DCCAEP method purposes for determining the churning nature of the customers. The O-DCCAEP technique encompasses preprocessing, classification, and hyperparameter optimization. Additionally, the DCCAE model is employed to classify the churners or non-churner. Furthermore, the hyperparameter optimization of the DCCAE technique occurs utilizing the deer hunting optimization algorithm (DHOA). The experimental evaluation of the O-DCCAEP technique is carried out against an own dataset and the outcomes highlighted the betterment of the presented O-DCCAEP approach on existing approaches.

AB  - This study aimed to determine the prevalence of gastrointestinal parasites in alpacas on selected farms in Poland. In July and August 2019 and August 2021, 223 samples from six commercial farms were examined using coproscopic techniques. The total percentage of alpacas infected with intestinal parasites was 57.7%. Eggs of Nematodirus sp. were found in 28.9%, Trichostrongylus sp. in 15.5%, Strongyloides sp. in 13.4%, Camelostrongylus sp. in 11.3%, other strongyle-type in 12.4%, Trichuris sp. in 3.1%, Capillaria spp. in 2.1%, Oesophagostomum sp. in 1.0% and eggs of Moniezia sp. in 1.0% of individuals. Oocysts of Eimeria macusaniensis were found in 8.2%, Eimeria sp. in 4.1%, and Cryptosporidium sp. in 3.1% of animals. Redundancy analysis showed that parasites and their number in faeces were related to the individual's country of origin, sex and age. Females had significantly more eggs of parasites than males. More significant parasite infection was recorded in younger individuals. Moreover, the most infected were individuals from Germany. Some of the described parasites in tested alpacas have zoonotic potential. Due to the possibility of introducing parasites native to alpacas and acquiring species parasitising wild and farmed animals in Europe, permanent veterinary monitoring of animals imported from other regions is necessary.

AB  - A spectral library (400-2500 nm) of maize and sorghum is developed to accurately estimate nine leaf properties, and is also effective in predictions for soybean and camelina using extra-weighted spiking.
   Leaf-level hyperspectral reflectance has become an effective tool for high-throughput phenotyping of plant leaf traits due to its rapid, low-cost, multi-sensing, and non-destructive nature. However, collecting samples for model calibration can still be expensive, and models show poor transferability among different datasets. This study had three specific objectives: first, to assemble a large library of leaf hyperspectral data (n=2460) from maize and sorghum; second, to evaluate two machine-learning approaches to estimate nine leaf properties (chlorophyll, thickness, water content, nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, calcium, magnesium, and sulfur); and third, to investigate the usefulness of this spectral library for predicting external datasets (n=445) including soybean and camelina using extra-weighted spiking. Internal cross-validation showed satisfactory performance of the spectral library to estimate all nine traits (mean R-2=0.688), with partial least-squares regression outperforming deep neural network models. Models calibrated solely using the spectral library showed degraded performance on external datasets (mean R-2=0.159 for camelina, 0.337 for soybean). Models improved significantly when a small portion of external samples (n=20) was added to the library via extra-weighted spiking (mean R-2=0.574 for camelina, 0.536 for soybean). The leaf-level spectral library greatly benefits plant physiological and biochemical phenotyping, whilst extra-weight spiking improves model transferability and extends its utility.

AB  - Root lesion nematode of tea (Pratylenchus loosi) is one of the most dangerous and destructive pests in all areas of the world where tea grows. Rhizobacteria with nematicidal properties were screened using the soils of root lesion nematode-infected tea fields located in Guilan province, Iran. Effective bacteria were identified based on molecular and biochemical methods. Protease enzyme production was investigated on skim milk agar (1%) medium. The effects of temperature and pH on the amount of protease production by bacteria were investigated. Three protease inhibitors, namely PMSF, EDTA and 1,10-phenanthroline, were investigated. In total, 150 bacterial strains were isolated from tea rhizosphere using the spread-plating technique and nutrient agar medium, of which four bacterial isolates of Pseudomonas spp. had nematicidal properties in the range of 84.98% to 95.24%. Two of the bacterial isolates, RH25 (Pseudomonas aeruginosa) and RH37 (Pseudomonas fluorescens), had the largest clear zone of proteolysis on skim milk agar and were subjected to various biochemical tests. The influences of time (1 to 120 h), temperature (22 to 37degree celsius) and pH (7.0 to 8.5) were investigated in the production of protease. The highest enzyme production was obtained from growing RH37 and RH25 on mineral medium when incubated at temperatures of 26degree celsius and 30degree celsius for 72 and 96 h and at initial pH values of 7.2 and 7.6, respectively. Proteases obtained from RH37 (P. fluorescens) belonged to the metalloprotease and serine protease families and the one produced by RH25 (P. aeruginosa) was a metalloprotease. According to the results of this research, the most effective control mechanism of these bacteria against nematodes is the production of bacterial protease. This mechanism can be exploited to control nematodes.

AB  - Adult neurogenesis has been described in two canonical regions of the adult central nervous system (CNS) of rodents, the subgranular zone (SGZ) of the hippocampus and the subependymal zone (SEZ) of the lateral ventricles. The stem cell niche of the SEZ provides a privileged environment composed of a specialized extracellular matrix (ECM) that comprises the glycoproteins tenascin-C (Tnc) and laminin-1 (LN1). In the present study, we investigated the function of these ECM glycoproteins in the adult stem cell niche. Adult neural stem/progenitor cells (aNSPCs) of the SEZ were prepared from wild type (Tnc(+/+)) and Tnc knockout (Tnc(-/-)) mice and analyzed using molecular and cell biological approaches. A delayed maturation of aNSPCs in Tnc(-/-) tissue was reflected by a reduced capacity to form neurospheres in response to epidermal growth factor (EGF). To examine a potential influence of the ECM on cell proliferation, aNSPCs of both genotypes were studied by cell tracking using digital video microscopy. aNSPCs were cultivated on three different substrates, namely, poly-d-lysine (PDL) and PDL replenished with either LN1 or Tnc for up to 6 days in vitro. On each of the three substrates aNSPCs displayed lineage trees that could be investigated with regard to cell cycle length. The latter appeared reduced in Tnc(-/-) aNSPCs on PDL and LN1 substrates, less so on Tnc that seemed to compensate the absence of the ECM compound to some extent. Close inspection of the lineage trees revealed a subpopulation of late dividing aNSPCs(late) that engaged into cycling after a notable delay. aNSPCs(late) exhibited a clearly different morphology, with a larger cell body and conspicuous processes. aNSPCs(late) reiterated the reduction in cell cycle length on all substrates tested, which was not rescued on Tnc substrates. When the migratory activity of aNSPC-derived progeny was determined, Tnc(-/-) neuroblasts displayed significantly longer migration tracks. This was traced to an increased rate of migration episodes compared to the wild-type cells that rested for longer time periods. We conclude that Tnc intervenes in the proliferation of aNSPCs and modulates the motility of neuroblasts in the niche of the SEZ.

AB  - Genetic generalized epilepsies (GGE) exhibit widespread morphometric alterations in the subcortical structures. Subcortical structures are essential for understanding GGE pathophysiology, but their fine-grained morphological diversity has yet to be comprehensively investigated. Furthermore, the relationships between macroscale morphological disturbances and microscale molecular chemoarchitectures are unclear. High-resolution structural images were acquired from patients with GGE (n = 97) and sex- and age-matched healthy controls (HCs, n = 184). Individual measurements of surface shape features (thickness and surface area) of seven bilateral subcortical structures were quantified. The patients and HCs were then compared vertex-wise, and shape anomalies were co-located with brain neurotransmitter profiles. We found widespread morphological alterations in GGE and prominent disruptions in the thalamus, putamen, and hippocampus. Shape area dilations were observed in the bilateral ventral, medial, and right dorsal thalamus, as well as the bilateral lateral putamen. We found that the shape area deviation pattern was spatially correlated with the norepinephrine transporter and nicotinic acetylcholine (Ach) receptor (alpha 4 beta 2) profiles, but a distinct association was seen in the muscarinic Ach receptor (M1). The findings provided a comprehensive picture of subcortical morphological disruptions in GGE, and further characterized the associated molecular mechanisms.

AB  - The aim of this study was to characterize the effects of tannins on plant protein during sheep digestion using a digestomic approach combining in vivo (rumen) conditions and an in vitro digestive system (abomasum and small intestine). Ruminal fluid from wethers infused with a tannin solution or water (control) was introduced into the digester, and protein degradation was followed by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). Tannin infusion in the rumen led to a clear decrease in protein degradation-related fermentation end-products, whereas ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (RuBisCo) protein was more abundant than in control wethers. In the simulated abomasum, peptidomic analysis showed more degradation products of RuBisCo in the presence of tannins. The effect of RuBisCo protection by tannins continued to impact Rubisco digestion into early-stage intestinal digestion but was no longer detectable in late-stage intestinal digestion. The peptidomics approach proved a potent tool for identifying and quantifying the type of protein hydrolyzed throughout the gastrointestinal tract.

AB  - Background: Anesthesia and psychotropic drugs in pregnant women may cause long-term effects on the brain development of unborn babies. The authors set out to investigate the neurotoxicity of S-ketamine, which possesses anesthetic and antidepressant effects and may cause attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD)- and depression-like behaviors in offspring mice.Methods: Pregnant mice were administered with low-, medium-, and high-dose S-ketamine (15, 30, and 60 mg/ kg) by intraperitoneal injection for 5 days from gestational day 14-18. At 21 days after birth, an elevated plusmaze test, fear conditioning, open field test, and forced swimming test were used to assess ADHD- and depression-like behaviors. Neuronal amount, glial activation, synaptic function indicated by ki67, and inhibitory presynaptic proteins revealed by GAD2 in the hippocampus, amygdala, habenula nucleus, and lateral hypothalamus (LHA) were determined by immunofluorescence assay.Results: All the pregnant mice exposed to high-dose S-ketamine administration had miscarriage after the first injection. Both low-dose and medium-dose S-ketamine administration significantly increased the open-arm time and attenuated frozen time in the fear conditioning, which indicates impulsivity and memory dysfunction-like behaviors. Medium-dose S-ketamine administration reduced locomotor activity in the open field and increased immobility time in the forced swimming test, indicating depression-like behaviors. Changes in astrocytic activation, synaptic dysfunction, and decreased inhibitory presynaptic proteins were found in the hippocampus, amygdala, and habenula nucleus.Conclusions: These results demonstrate that S-ketamine may lead to detrimental effects, including ADHD-and depression-like behaviors in offspring mice. More studies should be promoted to determine the neurotoxicity of S-ketamine in the developing brain.

AB  - Besides their clinical application, chronic misuse of opioids has often been associated to drug addiction due to their addictive properties, underlying neuroadaptations of AMPA glutamate-receptor-dependent synaptic plasticity. Topiramate (TPM), an AMPAR antagonist, has been used to treat psychostimulants addiction, despite its harmful effects on memory. This study aimed to evaluate the effects of a novel topiramate nanosystem on molecular changes related to morphine reinstatement. Rats were previously exposed to morphine in conditioned place preference (CPP) paradigm and treated with topiramate-chitosan nanoparticles (TPM-CS-NP) or nonencapsulated topiramate in solution (S-TPM) during CPP extinction; following memory performance evaluation, they were re-exposed to morphine reinstatement. While morphine-CPP extinction was comparable among all experimental groups, TPM-CS-NP treatment prevented morphine reinstatement, preserving memory performance, which was impaired by both morphine-conditioning and S-TPM treatment. In the NAc, morphine increased D1R, D2R, D3R, DAT, GluA1 and MOR immunoreactivity. It also increased D1R, DAT, GluA1 and MOR in the dorsal hippocampus. TPM-CS-NP treatment decreased D1R, D3R and GluA1 and increased DAT in the NAc, decreasing GluA1 and increasing D2 and DAT in the dorsal hippocampus. Taken together, we may infer that TPM-CS-NP treatment was able to prevent the morphine reinstatement without memory impairment. Therefore, TPM-CS-NP may be considered an innovative therapeutic tool due to its property to prevent opioid reinstatement because it acts modifying both dopaminergic and glutamatergic neurotransmission, which are commonly related to morphine addiction.

AB  - Chemical synapses are the major sites of communication between neurons in the nervous system and mediate either excitatory or inhibitory signaling. At excitatory synapses, glutamate is the primary neurotransmitter and upon release from presynaptic vesicles, is detected by postsynaptic glutamate receptors, which include ionotropic AMPA and NMDA receptors. Here, we have developed methods to identify glutamatergic synapses in brain tissue slices, label AMPA receptors with small gold nanoparticles (AuNPs), and prepare lamella for cryo-electron tomography studies. The targeted imaging of glutamatergic synapses in the lamella is facilitated by fluorescent pre- and postsynaptic signatures, and the subsequent tomograms allow for the identification of key features of chemical synapses, including synaptic vesicles, the synaptic cleft, and AuNP-labeled AMPA receptors. These methods pave the way for imaging brain regions at high resolution, using unstained, unfixed samples preserved under near-native conditions.

AB  - Cystic Echinococcosis is a parasitic disease caused by the larvae of Echinococcus granulosus. The transmission of E. granulosus is affected by environmental changes and anthropogenic factors, which are in turn influenced by changes in the spatial and population dynamics of animals. The deterministic model can be extended stochastically to address the low prevalence rate, which is often observed in small mammal host populations, and to account for complex processes that reflect the highly widespread disease reservoirs and non-random mixing, such as the heterogeneous contact patterns of susceptible hosts with infectious materials. In this study, a mathematical model based on a set of differential equations that define the continuous transition between different classes was used is not regulated by host. The findings indicate that each protoscolex has an equal chance of developing into a worm and creating a dispersed population. Empirical modeling can be used to represent the frequency distribution of the number of parasites in each host using the negative binomial distribution.

AB  - In this study, broilers were fed with heavy-metal-containing diets (Zn, Cu, Pb, Cr, As, Hg) at three rates (T1: 5 kg premix/ton feed, T2: 10 kg premix/ton feed and T3: 15 kg premix/ton feed) and Doxycycline (DOX) and Gatifloxacin (GAT) at low or high doses (T4: 31.2 mg DOX/bird/day and 78 mg GAT/bird/day, T5: 15.6 mg DOX/bird/day and 48 mg GAT/bird/day) to assess the accumulation of various heavy metals and the fate of two antibiotics in broiler manure after 35 days of aerobic composting. The results indicated that the two antibiotics changed quite differently during aerobic composting. About 14.96-15.84% of Doxycycline still remained at the end of composting, while Gatifloxacin was almost completely removed within 10 days of composting. The half-lives of Doxycycline were 13.75 and 15.86 days, while the half-lives of Gatifloxacin were only 1.32 and 1.38 days. Based on the Redundancy analysis (RDA), the concentration of antibiotics was significantly influenced by physico-chemical properties (mainly temperature and pH) throughout the composting process. Throughout the composting process, all heavy metal elements remained concentrated in organic fertilizer. In this study the Cr content reached 160.16 mg/kg, 223.98 mg/kg and 248.02 mg/kg with increasing premix feed rates, similar to Zn, which reached 258.2 mg/kg, 312.21 mg/kg and 333.68 mg/kg. Zn and Cr concentrations well exceeded the United States and the European soil requirements. This experiment showed that antibiotic residues and the accumulation of heavy metals may lead to soil contamination and pose a risk to the soil ecosystem.

AB  - Mineral licks, sites where animals go to consume soil, are key resources for herbivorous birds and mammals in the Amazon, providing supplemental dietary nutrients and toxin adsorption functions. However, because they are often difficult to find, the properties of mineral licks are poorly understood. Here, we undertake the largest survey of Amazonian mineral licks to date to determine the landscape, physical, and chemical properties of these critical sites. We used a generalized linear mixed-effects modeling framework to assess how soil samples from 83 mineral licks differ from nearby control soils in a series of physical and chemical characteristics, then used Jaccard's index of similarity and a principal component analysis (PCA) to determine how those samples differed among themselves. We found that mineral licks were generally located in specific ranges of landscape variables. Soils from mineral licks had elevated concentrations of almost all minerals measured. There was very little similarity between consumed and control samples, and within each sample type. We suggest that these mineral licks have the potential to provide multiple services to visiting species, demonstrating their ecological importance. The high levels of dissimilarity between samples indicate that a large sample of mineral licks is needed to draw conclusions in studies pertaining to geophagy. We emphasize that studying mammal and bird visitation at these sites could provide critical conservation and physiological information on cryptic and understudied species of Amazonian herbivores.

AB  - African Swine Fever (ASF) is an acute and highly lethal disease in pigs caused by African Swine Fever Virus (ASFV). Viral proteins have been commonly used as antigenic targets for the development of ASF diagnostic methods. However, the prokaryotic expression of viral proteins has deficiencies such as instability, insolubility, and high cost in eukaryotic situations. This study screened and verified ASFV-encoded p72, p54, and p30 protein antigenic epitopes. Subsequently, a novel antigenic epitope-associated recombinant protein was designed based on an ideal structural protein and expressed in Escherichia coli (E. coli). Western blot analysis indicated that the recombinant protein could specifically react with the monoclonal antibody (mAb) of p72 and polyclonal anti-bodies of p54 and p30, respectively. Next, an ASF indirect ELISA (iELISA) method was established based on the recombinant protein, which has no specific reaction with sera of other important pig viral diseases. Meanwhile, it shows a sensitivity to detecting dilutions of ASF-positive reference serum up to 1:6400. The clinical sample detection results showed a high coincidence rate of 98 % with a commercial competition ELISA kit. In conclusion, we established a novel specific, and sensitive ASF serologic detection method that opens new avenues for ASF serodiagnostic method development.

AB  - Simple Summary This study aimed to contribute to the knowledge on the visual system in multiple toothed whales focusing on the neurological parts, the optic nerve and the retina. We hypothesised to find some of the characteristics typical for cetacean species while also seeing differences between different species and in comparison with close relatives: the bovine and common hippopotamus. Results from the optic nerve appeared to be very species specific, showing a general pattern of lower division into nerve bundles in the cetaceans and in the hippopotamus. The total area of the nerve that contained axons ranged from 75.11% in Globicephala melas to 96.18% in Stenella coeruleoalba. All the examined samples showed the typical layered structure of the retina with a mean thickness of 140.2 mu m for Grampus griseus and 263.8 mu m for bovine. The linear retinal ganglion cell density varied between 0 and 12 cells per mm in the odontocetes, while in bovine, it was considerably higher. The study presented here provided clear evidence of anatomical differences within toothed whale species and with reference species. However, multiple patterns observed here do not comply with what is known from the literature (i.e., low retinal thickness and absence of giant ganglion cells).Abstract Throughout evolution, odontocete vision has had to readapt to the aquatic environment, which has had far-reaching effects on ocular anatomy and neurology. The most prominent features include the iris with an operculum, a well-developed choroid, the presence of giant ganglion cells in the retina, and the hemispherical shape of the thick eyecup. In the present study, the optic nerve and the retina were comparatively studied in Odontoceti (Cuvier's beaked whale, common bottlenose dolphin, false killer whale, long-finned pilot whale, Risso's dolphin, striped dolphin), the semi-aquatic common hippopotamus, and the fully terrestrial bovine. Cross-sections of the tissue were treated with histological and immunohistochemical techniques. Substantial differences were seen between the odontocetes and the reference species as well as within the cetaceans. The morphological structure of the optic nerve mainly appeared species specific, while the density of retinal ganglion cells was significantly higher in the terrestrial bovine than in the cetaceans. However, some typical characteristics of the cetacean retina were absent: the giant ganglion cells and the high retinal thickness. Immunohistochemical research showed varying degrees of neurofilament 200 expression in the retinal ganglion cells, while calretinin was only expressed in those of the common bottlenose dolphin and bovine.

AB  - Side effects associated with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) treatment are a serious limitation of their use in anti-inflammatory therapy. The negative effects of taking NSAIDs include abdominal pain, indigestion nausea as well as serious complications such as bleeding and perforation. The enteric nervous system is involved in regulation of gastrointestinal functions through the release of neurotransmitters. The present study was designed to determine, for the first time, the changes in pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide (PACAP), substance P (SP) and galanin (GAL) expression in porcine jejunum after long-term treatment with aspirin, indomethacin and naproxen. The study was performed on 16 immature pigs. The animals were randomly divided into four experimental groups: control, aspirin, indomethacin and naproxen. Control animals were given empty gelatin capsules, while animals in the test groups received selected NSAIDs for 28 days. Next, animals from each group were euthanized. Frozen sections were prepared from collected jejunum and subjected to double immunofluorescence staining. NSAIDs supplementation caused a significant increase in the population of PACAP-, SP- and GAL-containing enteric neurons in the porcine jejunum. Our results suggest the participation of the selected neurotransmitters in regulatory processes of the gastrointestinal function and may indicate the direct toxic effect of NSAIDs on the ENS neurons.

AB  - This study investigated the effect of co-ensiling increasing levels of artichoke bracts (Cynara cardunculus L.) with berseem (Trifolium alexandrinum L.) (100:0, 75:25, 50:50, 25:75, and 0:100, respectively) on silage quality after 0, 30, 60, and 120 days. Moreover, the in vitro rumen fermentation characteristics and methane (CH4) and ammonia (NH3-N) production were evaluated using a buffalo inoculum source. The results showed that pH of the silage and the concentration of acetic, propionic, butyric acid, and NH3-N significantly decreased (L; p < 0.01) with the increasing amounts of artichoke bracts in the mixture. At 30 and 60 days of ensiling, the highest lactic acid concentration was observed at intermediate proportions of artichoke bracts (p < 0.01). Cumulative gas production was higher in artichoke bracts than in the berseem silage. After 24 h of incubation, the highest value (p < 0.05) of truly dry matter, organic matter, natural detergent fiber degradability, and NH3-N concentration was recorded with 500 g/kg of forage mixtures. As the artichoke bract concentration increased, the partitioning factor and ruminal pH declined linearly (p = 0.05). No significant differences were observed for total volatile fatty acids and volatile fatty acids molar proportions. In summary, co-ensiling artichoke bracts with berseem at a ratio of 1:1 might be a promising and easy method for the production of high-quality silage from legume forage with positively manipulating rumen fermentation.

AB  - Gas-permeable membrane (GPM) technology is a possible solution to reduce ammonia (NH3) emissions from livestock housing. This paper presents the results obtained with an NH3-capture prototype based on the use of expanded polytetrafluoroethylene (ePTFE) membranes in real conditions in a gestating sow house and a free-range laying hen house, comparing them with the results obtained in controlled laboratory conditions for the same type of waste. The NH3 present in the air of the livestock housing was captured by reaction with an acidic solution flowing inside the membranes. The periods of continuous operation of the pilot plant were 232 days at the pig farm and 256 days at the poultry farm. The NH3 recovery rate at the end of those periods was 2.3 and 0.4 g TAN & BULL;m(-2)& BULL;d(-1) in the pig and the poultry farms, respectively. The limiting factor for the capture process was the NH3 concentration in the air, with the highest recovery occurring in the most concentrated atmosphere. Differences in NH3 capture were observed between seasons and farms, with capture efficiencies of 1.62 and 0.33 g & BULL;m(-2)& BULL;d(-1) in summer and 3.85 and 1.20 g & BULL;m(-2)& BULL;d(-1) in winter for pig and poultry farms, respectively. The observed differences were mainly due to the higher ventilation frequency in the summer months, which resulted in a lower NH3 concentration inside the houses compared to the winter months. This is especially important when considering the real applicability of this technology. The results obtained suggest that GPM technology holds promise for limiting NH3 emissions from livestock housing with NH3 ambient concentrations close to 20 ppm or as part of manure storage facilities, given that it allows for recovery of nitrogen in a stable and concentrated solution, which can be used as a fertilizer.

AB  - Baicalin (BA), a flavonoid glycoside extracts from Scutellaria baicalensis Georgi, has been reported to exert antidepressant effects. Emerging evidence indicates that neuronal apoptosis plays a crucial role in the pathogenesis of depression. Poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase-1 (PARP1) is established as a key regulator of the cellular apoptosis. In the present study, we explored whether BA exerts antidepressant effects by regulating PARP1 signaling pathway and elucidated the underlying mechanisms. We found that administration of BA (30 mg/kg, 60 mg/kg) alleviated chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS)-induced depressive-like behaviors by increasing sucrose consumption in sucrose preference test (SPT), improving activity status in open field test (OFT) and reducing rest time in tail suspension test (TST). Hematoxylin and eosin (HE) staining and Nissl staining showed that BA ameliorated CUMS-induced neuronal damage in the hippocampus. Moreover, BA significantly upregulated anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2, downregulated pro-apoptotic protein Bax and cleaved-caspase-3 after CUMS in hippocampal of mice. Intriguingly, western blot and immunohistochemistry (IHC) results showed that the protein level of PARP1 was significantly increased in hippocampal tissue after CUMS, which was reversed by BA treatment. In primary hippocampal neurons (PHNs), BA abrogated the neuronal apoptosis caused by PARP1 overexpression. Meanwhile, BA significantly increased the protein level of SIRT1, SIRT1 inhibitor (EX-527) treatment reversed the effect of BA on reducing the protein level of PARP1 and neuronal apoptosis in CUMSinduced mice. Overall, our results indicated that BA attenuated the CUMS-induced hippocampal neuronal apoptosis through regulating the SIRT1/PARP1 signaling pathway.

AB  - Conductive agro-industrial wastes as accelerants in the anaerobic digestion (AD) of organic waste is a good technique for developing a rural circular economy, such as producing bioenergy and biofertilizer. This study disclosed the a role of sugar cane bagasse ash (SCBA) in enhancing the bioenergy (biogas) yield and digestate fertility via anaerobic co-digestion (AcoD) of buffalo dung (BD) and vegetable residue (VR) under mesophilic conditions (37 ᴼC). Firstly, an optimal BD/VR ratio (1:3) was determined based on biogas yield by introducing five different BD/VR ratios (1:0, 3:1, 1:1, 1:3, and 0:1) into AcoD systems. Secondly, the biogas yield was increased further by adding SCBA at five different concentrations (0, 0.5, 1, 1.5, and 2 wt%). Experimental results disclosed that the 1.5 wt% of SCBA gave the highest cumulative biogas yield (153.67 mL/g VS), COD removal rate (31.18%), and fertility (5.08%). Moreover, a framework is suggested to understand the role of SCBA in the enhanced DIET mechanism. This work documents an environmentally friendly and economical technique for developing a rural circular bioeconomy via the AD of organic agro-waste.

The okra was planted and fertilised with organic material (goat dung) at 500 g/plant, NPK fertiliser at 100 g/plant (T1) and 70 g/plant for T2, T3, T4 and T5, respectively. The BRIS soil isolated PGPR, namely UA 1 (Paraburkholderia unamae), UA 6 (Bacillus amyloliquefaciens) and UAA 2 (Enterobacter asburiae) propagated in 6% molasses medium were inoculated with the amount of 40 mL for single strain treatment (T2-T4) and 15 mL of each bacterial inoculum for mixed strains treatment (T5). Results showed that inoculation with PGPR in single or mixed strains has significantly decreased the use of 30% NPK fertiliser and promoted okra growth, physiology, yield and soil chemical properties and bacterial count. Mixed strains (T5) have significantly shown the highest performance with increments of 27.85% of leaf number, 28.56% of okra number, 27.90% of yield per plant and 25.83% of plant total dry biomass. The plant net photosynthesis treated with mixed strains also recorded a 5.27% increment with 26.96% of nitrogen content and 22.79% bacteria count in the soil. The findings of this study suggested that the BRIS soil PGPR inoculants may reduce the amount of chemical fertiliser and have a significant potential to be used as biofertiliser in sustainable agriculture to increase plant growth and yield and soil fertility.

AB  - Background The epidemiology of invasive aspergillosis (IA) in patients with acute lymphoid leukemia (ALL) has not been well characterized. Objectives To identify potential peculiarities in the natural history, treatment response and outcome of IA diagnosed in patients with ALL and AML. Methods This is a retrospective cohort study conducted in seven tertiary-care hospitals between 2009 and 2017 of all consecutive episodes of IA occurring in adult patients with acute leukemia. Demographic characteristics, underlying disease and recent treatment, antifungal prophylaxis, neutropenia, receipt of corticosteroids, clinical and radiological findings, mycological results, antifungal therapy, and 6-week and 12-week survival were recorded. Results We identified 77 cases of IA in 54 patients with AML and 23 patients with ALL. The majority of patients developed IA in the context of induction chemotherapy for newly diagnosed (48.0%) or relapsed (41.6%) leukemia, with no differences between ALL and AML. Lung involvement was more frequent in AML (96.3% vs. 82.6%, p = 0.06) and rhinosinusitis was more common in ALL (43.5% vs. 24.1%, p = 0.09). Galactomannan was the microbiologic documentation of IA in 76.6%, with similar patterns of positivity in AML and ALL. The 6-week survival of IA in patients with AML and ALL was 63.0% and 56.5%, respectively (p = 0.60). Conclusions The epidemiology, clinical presentation, diagnosis and outcome of IA in ALL patients are similar to patients with AML.

AB  - Ethnopharmacological relevance: Cattle bile Arisaema (CBA) and Pig bile Arisaema (PBA) are both processed products fermented from Arisaema erubescens (Wall.) Schott and animal bile, which are recorded in China Pharmacopoeia. Traditionally, bile Arisaema was often used for clearing heat and eliminating phlegm, calming wind and calming panic. Modern pharmacological researches suggest that both two drugs exert an antipyretic effect, while there is lack of the systematical and comparative evidence on underlying mechanism. Aim of the study: To comprehensively clarify the differences and underlying mechanisms of antipyretic effect of the two drugs. Methods: In this study, an accurate and reliable detection method based on ultra-performance liquid chromatography coupled with triple quadrupole mass spectrometry (UPLC-TQ MS) for comparing the content difference of bile acids from the two drugs was successfully established and applied. Besides, a dry yeast-induced fever rat model was established, and rectal temperature and content of pyrogenic cytokines were conducted to evaluate the antipyretic effect of CBA and PBA. Serum and hypothalamus untargeted metabolomics analysis based on ultra-performance liquid chromatography coupled with quadrupole-time of flight-mass spectrometry (UPLC-QTOF-MS/MS) technology were performed for elucidating the changes of metabolic profile. Results: The results indicated that CBA and PBA both exerted a significantly antipyretic effect, but CBA showed the characteristic of quicker onset and longer duration than that of PBA. The ELISA and western blotting analysis exhibited that the underlying antipyretic mechanism of the two drugs was closely associated with inhibiting inflammation through regulating TLR4/NF-kappa B signaling pathway. Moreover, the metabolism pathway analysis revealed that lipid metabolism and amino acid metabolism were greatly disturbed, which showed a certain correlation with antipyretic effect of two drugs.

AB  - Hippocampus and prefrontal cortex of brain have distinct role in encoding and retrieval of memories. Uncontrollable stress may influence the structural alterations of limbic brain regions and atropy of neurons mainly in the regions like the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus. Nardostachys jatamansi (D. Don) DC (NJE) is a perennial herb and is known for its anti-Parkinson's, hepatoprotective, neuroprotective, hypotensive and anti-diabetic activities. Even though, it is an effective therapeutic intervention for memory impairment but, its effect on the neurons of the hippocampus is not clear. In this context, the effect of NJE on chronic restraint stress induced dendritic atropy in rats was studied. Male Wistar rats underwent 21 days of restraint stress in a close fitting rodent restrainer. In combined treatment groups rats were treated with alcoholic extract of NJE at dosage of 200 mg/kg bw for 21 days along with chronic restraint stress. The dendritic morphology of neurons was studied in Golgi-impregnated sections. Stress produced dendritic atropy significantly increased the dendritic branching and intersections in experimental rats. Interestingly, treatment of stressed rats with NJE extract resulted in the reversal of stress induced the dendritic atrophy. These results demonstrate that atrophy of dendritic neurons caused by chronic restraint stress may be responsible for learning and memory impairment. Co-treatment of rats with NJE showed enhancement in the dendritic branching in the hippocampus. Furthermore, NJE treatment significantly increased superoxide dismutase activity and total antioxidant capacity in frontal cortex, hippocampus and striatum regions of brain. Thus, our findings suggest that NJE is a potential neuroprotector, which might be beneficial in the treatment of stress induced memory impairment.

AB  - Introduction: Non-motor symptoms (NMS) have high prevalence in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). These symptoms are mainly the result of increased oxidative stress and neuronal damage. In this study we investigated the possible neuroprotective effects of anethole as a potent antioxidant on rotenone-induced behavioral deficits, hippocampal neuronal death, and oxidative stress profile in rats.Methods: Male Wistar rats were administered with anethole (62.5, 125, and 250 mg/kg, i.g) concomitantly with rotenone (2 mg/kg, s.c) for 35 days. Shuttle box and novel object recognition tests were performed to determine cognitive functions, and tail flick test was used to measure pain sensitivity. The levels of BDNF, MDA, SOD, and GPx were assayed in the hippocampus. Hippocampal neuronal damage was evaluated using cresyl violet staining technique.Results: Chronic administration of rotenone induced cognitive deficit and reduced thermal pain threshold. Rotenone also decreased SOD and GPx activities, increased MDA level, and reduced the expression of BDNF in the hippocampus. In addition, hippocampal neuronal loss was increased in rotenone treated rats. Treatment with high dose of anethole (250 mg/kg) improved cognitive function and increased pain threshold in all three doses (62.5, 125, and 250 mg/kg). Despite the unchanged SOD and GPx activities, hippocampal levels of MDA was significantly decreased after high-dose anethole treatment. Moreover, High dose of anethole increased the number of surviving neurons in the hippocampus, but couldn't increase the BDNF expression. Conclusion: Our findings indicated that anethole has antioxidant and neuroprotective effects against non-motor disorders induced by rotenone toxicity.

AB  - Wildlife researchers must balance the need to safely capture and handle their study animals to sample tissues, collect morphological measurements, and attach dataloggers while ensuring their results are not confounded by stress artifacts caused by handling. To determine the physiological effects of research activities including chemical immobilization, transport, instrumentation with biologgers, and overnight holding on a model marine mammal species, we collected hormone, blood chemistry, hematology, and heart rate data from 19 juvenile northern elephant seals (Mirounga angustirostris) throughout a translocation experiment. Across our six sampling timepoints, cortisol and aldosterone data revealed a moderate hormonal stress response to handling accompanied by minor changes in hematocrit and blood glucose, but not ketone bodies or erythrocyte sedimentation rate. We also examined heart rate as a stress indicator and found that interval heart rate, standard deviation of heart rate, and apnea-eupnea cycles were influenced by handling. However, when seals were recaptured after several days at sea, all hormonal and hematological parameters had returned to baseline levels. Furthermore, 100 % of study animals were resighted in the wild post-translocation, with some individuals observed over four years later. Together, these findings suggest that while northern elephant seals exhibit measurable physiological stress in response to handling, they recover rapidly and show no observable long-term deleterious effects, making them a robust species for ecological and physiological research.

AB  - In the present study, we explored the effects of a novel xylanase from camel rumen metagenome (CrXyn) on wheat bran hydrolysis. CrXyn was heterologously expressed in Escherichia coli and showed maximum activity at 40 degrees C and pH 7.0. Furthermore, CrXyn exhibited preferential hydrolysis of xylan, but no obvious activity toward other substrates, including carboxymethylcellulose and Avicel. Using wheat straw xylan as a substrate, the Km and Vmax values for CrXyn were 5.98 g/L and 179.9 mu mol xylose/min/mg protein, respectively. Mn2+ was a strong accelerator and significantly enhanced CrXyn activity. However, CrXyn activity was inhibited (similar to 50 %) by 1 mM and 5 mM ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) and completely inactivated by 5 mM Cu-2(+). CrXyn tolerated 5 mM sodium dodecyl sulphate (SDS) and 15 % methanol, ethanol, and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), with >50 % residual activity. CrXyn effectively hydrolyzed wheat bran, with xylobiose and xylotetraose accounting for 79.1 % of total sugars produced. A remarkable synergistic effect was found between CrXyn and protease, leading to an obvious increase in amino acids released from wheat bran compared with the control. CrXyn also enhanced the in vitro hydrolysis of wheat bran. Thus, CrXyn exhibits great potential as a feed additive to improve the utilization of wheat bran in monogastric animal production.

AB  - The influences of different plants on herbivores have recently attracted research interest; however, little is known regarding the effects of wild, local and cultivated varieties of the same plant from the same origin on herbivores. This study aimed to examine the effects of different tobacco varieties from the same origin on the oviposition preference and offspring performance of Spodoptera litura. We selected two wild ('Bishan wild tobacco' and 'Badan wild tobacco'), two local ('Liangqiao sun-cured tobacco' and 'Shuangguan sun-cured tobacco') and two cultivated ('Xiangyan No. 5' and 'Cunsanpi') tobacco varieties from Hunan Province, China. We found that female S. litura varied in oviposition preferences across the tobacco varieties. They preferred to lay eggs on the cultivated varieties, followed by the local varieties, with the wild varieties being the least preferred. Furthermore, different tobacco varieties significantly influenced the life history parameters of S. litura. Survival rate, pupal weight, emergence rate and adult dry weight decreased in the following order: cultivated varieties > local varieties > wild varieties. Conversely, the pupal stage and development period decreased in the following order: wild varieties > local varieties > cultivated varieties. Therefore, we conclude that wild tobacco varieties have higher resistance to S. litura than cultivated and local varieties, reflecting the evolutionary advantages of wild tobacco varieties.

AB  - The postnatal environment is challenging for the preterm neonate with exposure to hypoxic and excitotoxic events, amplified by premature loss of placentally derived neurosteroids. Between preterm birth and term equivalent age (TEA), cerebellar development continues despite these challenges. We hypothesize that neurosteroid replacement therapy during this time will support optimal cerebellar development. Guinea pig sows delivered at term (similar to 69 days gestation) or were induced to deliver preterm (similar to 62 days), with preterm pups receiving ganaxolone or vehicle until TEA. Postnatal assessments comprised salivary cortisol (corrected postnatal age [CPA] 0, 7, 38), behavioral analysis (CPA7, 38), and tissue collection (CPA0 and CPA40). Neurodevelopmental markers (MBP, Olig2, and NeuN) were assessed in the cerebellum by immunohistochemistry, whereas RT-PCR was utilized to investigate key inhibitory/excitatory pathways and oligodendrocyte lineage markers. Following preterm birth, there was evidence of a hyperactive phenotype, increased salivary cortisol concentrations, and impaired myelination and oligodendrocyte maturation at the protein level. mRNA expressions of key inhibitory/excitatory pathways and myelin stability were also altered following preterm birth. Importantly, we showed that neurosteroid replacement therapy returns cerebellar development and behavior toward a term-like phenotype. Therefore, ganaxolone may reduce the vulnerability of the cerebellum to postnatal challenges arising from preterm birth.

AB  - Recent phylogenomic analyses of 997 nuclear genes support the long-held view that the genus Entada is congeneric with Elephantorrhiza. Entada is resolved as monophyletic only if the genus Elephantorrhiza is subsumed within it. The two genera were distinguished solely by relatively minor differences in the mode of dehiscence of the fruits (a craspedium separating into one-seeded endocarp segments in Entada versus a craspedium with the whole fruit valve breaking away from the persistent replum in Elephantorrhiza) and the craspedial fruit type itself provides a shared synapomorphy for the re-circumscribed Entada. Here, we provide a synopsis of Entada, including 11 new combinations in total, for the eight species, one subspecies and one variety previously placed in Elephantorrhiza, as well as a new combination for a subspecies of Entada rheedei Spreng. not previously dealt with when Entada pursaetha DC. was placed in synonymy. These new combinations are: Entada burkei (Benth.) S.A. O'Donnell & G.P. Lewis, comb. nov.; Entada elephantina (Burch.) S.A. O'Donnell & G.P. Lewis, comb. nov.; Entada goetzei (Harms) S.A.

Lewis, comb. nov.; Entada woodii (E. Phillips) S.A. O'Donnell & G.P. Lewis, comb. nov.; and Entada woodii var. pubescens (E. Phillips) S.A. O'Donnell & G.P. Lewis, comb. nov. We provide a revised circumscription of the genus Entada which now comprises 40 species distributed pantropically, with the greatest diversity of species in tropical Africa. We present a complete taxonomic synopsis, including a map showing the global distribution of the genus and photographs showing variation amongst species in habit, foliage, flowers and fruits. A short discussion about extrafloral nectaries, mainly observed in the Madagascan species, is presented.

AB  - Buildings consume around 40% of total global primary energy and account for one-third of greenhouses gas emissions. In the context of rising average air temperature and growing reliance on air-conditioning for space cooling, energy efficiency in buildings is becoming increasingly important. This is of particular significance to the tropics where a high rate of construction and development is expected in the coming decades. The present study evaluates the impact of several envelope retrofit materials on indoor air temperatures and energy consumption for space cooling for an educational building at IIT Bombay in Mumbai, India. The parametric study is performed using Rhino/ Grasshopper plugins LadyBug and HonyeBee and validated using measured indoor air temperature data. The energy performance is evaluated by applying thermal insulation with and without reflective coating, green roof and bamboo-based shading systems in the simulation environment. From all the retrofit alternatives, it is found that increasing the envelope's insulation followed by the provision of natural shading system results in largest reductions in cooling loads. The combined system has shown to produce maximum energy savings of up to 25% and reduce number of hours with indoor air temperatures higher than 35 degrees C by up to 60% for an annual time period. The results offer ways to mitigate energy consumption and carbon footprint of similar buildings in the tropics.

AB  - While SSRIs are the current first-line pharmacotherapies against post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), they suffer from delayed onset of efficacy and low remission rates. One solution is to combine SSRIs with other treatments. Neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS) has been shown to play a role in serotonergic signaling, and there is evidence of synergism between nNOS modulation and SSRIs in models of other psychiatric conditions. Therefore, in this study, we combined subchronic fluoxetine (Flx) with 7-nitroindazole (NI), a selective nNOS inhibitor, and evaluated their efficacy against anxiety-related behavior in an animal model of PTSD.We used the underwater trauma model to induce PTSD in rats. Animals underwent the open field (OFT) and elevated plus maze tests on days 14 (baseline) and 21 (post-treatment) after PTSD induction to assess anxiety -related behaviors. Between the two tests, the rats received daily intraperitoneal injections of 10 mg/kg Flx or saline, and were injected intraperitoneally before the second test with either 15 mg/kg NI or saline. The change in behaviors between the two tests was compared between treatment groups.Individual treatment with both Flx and NI had anxiogenic effects in the OFT. These effects were associated with modest increases in cFOS expression in the hippocampus. Combination therapy with Flx + NI did not show any anxiogenic effects, while causing even higher expression levels of cFOS.In conclusion, addition of NI treatment to subchronic Flx therapy accelerated the abrogation of Flx's anxio-genic properties. Furthermore, hippocampal activity, as evidenced by cFOS expression, was biphasically related to anxiety-related behavior.

AB  - Piebaldism, leucism or albinism are different types of pigmentation anomalies related to the excess or deficit of pigmentation in some regions or in the whole body of an animal. It is extremely rare in peccaries and has never been reported for Tayassu, a genus endemic to Neotropical region. Tayassu pecari, known as white-lipped peccaries (WLP's), have behaviors and ecology well documented in literature, but there is no published scientific information about pigmentation anomalies. Here, we report the first records of anomalous individuals (leucism and piebaldism) for WLP's in locations of Central Brazil. During fieldwork for mammal survey (2010-2020) search for individuals with pigmentation anomalies were carried out in ten sites spread across four Brazilian biomes: Atlantic Forest, Cerrado, Amazon Forest, and Pantanal. Thirteen individuals were registered throughout eight locations in the last three biomes. All these individuals were part of a herd in which most individuals occurred with normal pigmentation. The Cerrado was the most representative biome in which individuals with abnormal pigmentation were recorded (46.2%) followed by the Amazon (30.8 %) and the Pantanal (23.0%). Despite the long-term survey by camera traps (70,000 nights of camera traps), only 0.1% of the records were of WLP with anomalous coloration. Our work presents, for the first time, WLP with leucism and piebaldism, and a range of chromatic variations. It was not possible to determine how leucism affects the health and survival of the individuals that have it, therefore, our work encourages future field studies that can monitor the behavior and fitness of those individuals for extended periods.

AB  - Objective: Adolescence is a crucial time for brain maturation. We investigated the protective effects of metformin (Met) on behavioral changes, oxidative stress, tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) and nitrite in adulthood induced by ethanol (Eth) consumption during adolescent to adult period of rats. Materials and Methods: The adolescence male rats (21 days old) were treated as: 1) Control, 2) Eth (Eth in drinking water (20 %)), 3-5) Eth-Met50, 100 and 150 mg/kg (Eth in drinking water and Met (50, 100, or 150 mg/kg). After 5 weeks treatment, Morris water maze (MMW) and passive avoidance (PA) tests were done. Results: The latency in the MWM test was higher and the latency to enter the dark chamber in the PA test was lower in the Eth group than in control. In Eth-Met100 and 150 groups, they were less than the Eth group. Malondialdehyde (MDA) and nitrite concentration in the hippocampus and cortex of the Eth group were higher than the control group. The thiol content and catalase and superoxide dismutase (SOD) activities in hippocampal and cortical tissues of the Eth group reduced compared to the control group. TNF-alpha was higher in hippocampal tissues of Eth group animals. Met reversed all of these effects. Conclusion: Our findings showed that the protective effects of Met against chronic Eth consumption induced learning and memory impairment were accompanied by decreasing of TNF-a, nitrite and oxidative stress in adolescent rats.

AB  - Simple Summary In this study, a Common Objects in Context dataset of ovine pulmonary adenocarcinoma pathological images was constructed based on 7167 annotated typical lesions from 61,063 lung pathological images of ovine pulmonary adenocarcinoma. This study aimed to develop a mask regional convolutional neural network model for the localization and pathological diagnosis of ovine pulmonary adenocarcinoma lesions. The model achieved a mean average specificity of 0.573 and an average sensitivity of 0.745, with consistency rates of 100% for junior pathologists and 96.5% for senior pathologists in the diagnosis of ovine pulmonary adenocarcinoma. The successful development of this model not only facilitates the rapid diagnosis of ovine pulmonary adenocarcinoma by different personnel in practical applications but also lays a foundation for the transition from traditional pathology to digital pathology in the livestock industry.Abstract Ovine pulmonary adenocarcinoma (OPA) is a contagious lung tumour caused by the Jaagsiekte Sheep Retrovirus (JSRV). Histopathological diagnosis is the gold standard for OPA diagnosis. However, interpretation of traditional pathology images is complex and operator dependent. The mask regional convolutional neural network (Mask R-CNN) has emerged as a valuable tool in pathological diagnosis. This study utilized 54 typical OPA whole slide images (WSI) to extract 7167 typical lesion images containing OPA to construct a Common Objects in Context (COCO) dataset for OPA pathological images. The dataset was categorized into training and test sets (8:2 ratio) for model training and validation. Mean average specificity (mASp) and average sensitivity (ASe) were used to evaluate model performance. Six WSI-level pathological images (three OPA and three non-OPA images), not included in the dataset, were used for anti-peeking model validation. A random selection of 500 images, not included in the dataset establishment, was used to compare the performance of the model with assessment by pathologists. Accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and concordance rate were evaluated. The model achieved a mASp of 0.573 and an ASe of 0.745, demonstrating effective lesion detection and alignment with expert annotation. In Anti-Peeking verification, the model showed good performance in locating OPA lesions and distinguished OPA from non-OPA pathological images. In the random 500-image diagnosis, the model achieved 92.8% accuracy, 100% sensitivity, and 88% specificity. The agreement rates between junior and senior pathologists were 100% and 96.5%, respectively. In conclusion, the Mask R-CNN-based OPA diagnostic model developed for OPA facilitates rapid and accurate diagnosis in practical applications.

AB  - The alpha 7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (alpha 7 nAChR) is a potential target for the treatment of cognitive decline in patients with schizophrenia, Alzheimer's disease, and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder.
   Here we examined the promnesic activity of the alpha 7 nAChR agonist (A582941), the type I (CCMI), and the type II (PNU120596) positive allosteric modulators (PAMs) in rats following single and repeated (once daily for seven days) treatment. To determine the neuronal mechanisms underlying the procognitive activity of the tested compounds, levels of the extracellular signal-regulated kinases (Erk1/2) and the activity-regulated cytoskeletonassociated protein (Arc) mRNAs were assessed in the frontal cortical and hippocampal brain regions.
   Using the novel object recognition test, we demonstrate that the lower doses of A582941 (0.1 mg/kg), CCMI (1 mg/kg), and PNU120596 (0.3 mg/kg) improved recognition memory after repeated but not single administration, suggesting a cumulative effect of repeated dosing. In contrast, the higher doses of A582941 (0.3 mg/kg), CCMI (3 mg/kg) and PNU120596 (1 mg/kg) demonstrated promnesic efficacy following both single and repeated administration. Subsequent in situ hybridization revealed that repeated treatment with A582941 and CCMI, but not PNU120596 enhanced mRNA expression of the Erk1/2 and Arc in the frontal cortex and hippocampus.
   Present data suggest that both the alpha 7 nAChR agonist and PAMs exhibit procognitive effects after single and repeated administration. The increased level of the Erk1/2 and Arc genes is likely to be at least partially involved in this effect.

AB  - Background: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common degenerative disease characterized by cognitive impairment, memory decline, and language disorder for which there is no effective treatment. Neurogenesis has been indicated in AD and may play an important role in the pathogenesis of AD. Targeting this pathway is a new idea for the treatment of the disease. A recent study reveals that the cellular prion protein (PrP), a receptor for A beta oligomers, regulates neurogenesis, and its elevated expression is related to cell differentiation. The aim of the present study was to investigate the neuroprotective effects of 6D11 (PrP monoclonal antibody) via neurogenesis promotion in APP/PS1 transgenic mice and A beta-induced cell model of AD.
   Methods: In the present study, 9-month-old male APP/PS1 mice were injected with 6D11. Then, the Morris water maze was used to examine the spatial learning and memory abilities of the mice in both groups, and immunostained was used to assess the level of A beta, neurogenesis, and neural stem cells (NSCs) differentiation.
   Results: 6D11 attenuated cognitive deficits in APP/PS1 transgenic mice, which was accompanied by a decrease of the deposition of A beta. In addition, 6D11 treatment promoted differentiation of the existing hippocampal cells to neurons.
   Conclusions: Our findings confirmed that 6D11 has a therapeutic effect in APP/PS1 transgenic AD mouse model and A beta-induced AD cell model, and the effect exerted via increase of neurogenesis and cell differentiation by transduction of A beta peptide signal.

AB  - Overexpression of the vacuolar sugar transporter TST1 in Arabidopsis leads to higher seed lipid levels and higher total seed yield per plant. However, effects on fruit biomass have not been observed in crop plants like melon, strawberry, cotton, apple, or tomato with increased tonoplast sugar transporter (TST) activity. Thus, it was unclear whether overexpression of TST in selected crops might lead to increased fruit yield, as observed in Arabidopsis. Here, we report that constitutive overexpression of TST1 from sugar beet in the important crop species Camelina sativa (false flax) resembles the seed characteristics observed for Arabidopsis upon increased TST activity. These effects go along with a stimulation of sugar export from source leaves and not only provoke optimised seed properties like higher lipid levels and increased overall seed yield per plant, but also modify the root architecture of BvTST1 overexpressing Camelina lines. Such mutants grew longer primary roots and showed an increased number of lateral roots, especially when developed under conditions of limited water supply. These changes in root properties result in a stabilisation of total seed yield under drought conditions. In summary, we demonstrate that increased vacuolar TST activity may lead to optimised yield of an oil-seed crop species with high levels of healthy omega 3 fatty acids in storage lipids. Moreover, since BvTST1 overexpressing Camelina mutants, in addition, exhibit optimised yield under limited water availability, we might devise a strategy to create crops with improved tolerance against drought, representing one of the most challenging environmental cues today and in future.

AB  - Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental condition characterized by deficient social interaction and communication besides repetitive, stereotyped behaviours. A characteristic feature of ASD is altered dendritic spine density and morphology associated with synaptic plasticity disturbances. Since microtubules (MTs) regulate dendritic spine morphology and play an important role in spine development and plasticity the aim of the present study was to investigate the alterations in the content of neuronal alpha/beta-tubulin and Tau protein level as well as phosphorylation state in the valproic acid (VPA)-induced rat model of autism. Our results indicated that maternal exposure to VPA induces: (1) decrease the level of alpha/beta-tubulin along with Tau accumulation in the hippocampus and cerebral cortex; (2) excessive Tau phosphorylation and activation of Tau-kinases: CDK5, ERK1/2, and p70S6K in the cerebral cortex; (3) up-regulation of mTOR kinase-dependent signalling in the hippocampus and cerebral cortex of adolescent rat offspring. Moreover, immunohistochemical staining showed histopathological changes in neurons (chromatolysis) in both analysed brain structures of rats prenatally exposed to VPA. The observed changes in Tau protein together with an excessive decrease in alpha/beta-tubulin level may suggest destabilization and thus dysfunction of the MT cytoskeleton network, which in consequence may lead to the disturbance in synaptic plasticity and the development of autistic-like behaviours.

AB  - The aim of the present study was to investigate the effect of selenium (Se) deficiency on the relationship between the pyroptosis and MAPK signaling pathway in spleen injury. A total of 10 two-month-old Sus scrofa domesticus specimens were allocated to two groups. The control group was fed a basal diet (0.15-mg/kg Se), and the experimental group was fed a 0.03-mg/kg Se-deficient diet for 2 months. The pig-spleen histopathological changes were observed with hematoxylin-eosin staining. Frozen sections were prepared to detect the content of ROS in pig-spleen cells. The oxidation stress related indexes were determined using a spectrophotometer. The levels of pyroptosis- and MAPK signaling pathway-related factors were detected via quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) and western blotting (WB). The results of sections showed that the lymphocytes decreased in number, the spacing of cells widened, and some cells were necrotic in the spleen tissue of pigs fed a low-selenium diet. The content of ROS, malondialdehyde, nitric oxide, H2O2, and catalase activity in the low-selenium group was significantly higher than that in the control group, and SOD activity was decreased. The protein-ratio-levels of p-Nrf2 to Nrf2 were decreased. The expression levels of nod-like receptor (NLR) family pyrin domain containing 3 (NLRP3), IL-1 beta, IL-18, ASC, gasdermin D, and caspase-1, the protein-ratio-levels of p-AKT serine/threonine kinase (p-AKT) to AKT, p-extracellular regulated protein kinases (ERK) to ERK, p-P38 MAPK to p-P38, and p-c-Jun N-terminal kinase (p-JNK) to JNK were significantly increased in the Se-deficient group compared with the control group. These results suggested that Se deficiency can induce oxidant stress, which increases pyroptosis- and inflammation-related factors of pig-spleen injury.

AB  - Coronaviruses are known to be harmful and heterogeneous viruses, able to infect a large number of hosts. Among them, SADS-CoV (Swine Acute Diarrhea Syndrome Coronavirus), also known as PEAV (Porcine Enteric Alphacoronavirus), or SeA-CoV (Swine Enteric Alphacoronavirus), is the most recent Alphacoronavirus discovered, and caused several outbreaks reported in Chinese swine herds between late 2016 and 2019. We performed an upgraded phylodinamic reconstruction of SADS-CoV based on all whole genomes available on 21 June 2021. Results showed a very close relationship between SADS-CoV and HKU2-like CoV, which may represent the evolutionary intermediate step towards the present SADS-CoV. The direct progenitor of SADS-CoV is so far unknown and, although it is well known that horseshoe bats are reservoirs for Rhinolophus bat coronavirus HKU2-like (HKU2-like CoVs), the transmission path from bats to pigs is still unclear. The discrepancies in the phylogenetic position of rodent CoV, when different molecular markers were considered, corroborate the recombination hypothesis, suggesting that wild rats, which are frequent in farms, may have played a key role. The failure of the attempt at molecular dating, due to the lack of a clock signal, also corroborates the occurrence of a recombination event hypothesis. Zoonotic infections originating in wildlife can easily become a significant threat for human health. In such a context, due to the high recombination and cross-species capabilities of Coronavirus, SADS-CoV represents a possible high-risk pathogen for humans which needs a constant molecular monitoring.

AB  - Fluoride which is widespread in our environment and food due to its geological origin and industrial pollution has been identified as a developmental neurotoxicant. Gut-brain axis provides new insight into brain-derived injury. We previously found the psychoactive effects of a probiotic strain, Lactobacillus johnsonii BS15 against fluoride-induced memory dysfunction in mice by modulating the gut-brain axis. In this study, we aimed to detect the link between the reconstruction of gut microbiota and gut-brain axis through which probiotic alleviate fluoride-induced memory impairment. We also added an hour of water avoidance stress (WAS) before behavioral tests and sampling, aiming to demonstrate the preventive effects of the probiotic on fluoride-induced memory impairment after psychological stress. Mice were given fluoridated drinking water (sodium fluoride 100 ppm, corresponding to 37.8 ? 2.4 ppm F?) for 70 days and administered with PBS or a probiotic strain, Lactobacillus johnsonii BS15 for 28 days prior to and throughout a 70 day exposure to sodium fluoride. Results showed that fluoride increases the hyperactivity of hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis and reduces the exploration ratio in novel object recognition (NOR) test and the spontaneous exploration during the T-maze test in mice following WAS, which were significantly improved by the probiotic. 16S rRNA sequencing showed a significant separation in ileal microbiota between the fluoride-treated mice and control mice. Lactobacillus was the main targeting bacteria and significantly reduced in fluoride-treated mice. BS15 reconstructed the fluoride-post microbiota and increased the relative abundance of Lactobacillus. D-lactate content and diamine oxidase (DAO) activity, two biomarkers of gut permeability were reduced in the serum of probiotic-inoculated mice. ZO1, an intestinal tight junction protein was reduced by fluoride in mRNA, and its protein levels were increased by the probiotic treatment. Moreover, the hippocampus which is essential to learning and memory, down-regulated mRNA level of both the myelin-associated glycoprotein (MAG), and protein levels of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), including the improvement of cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB) by BS15 in fluoride-exposed mice after WAS. Via spearman correlation analysis, Lactobacillus displayed significantly positive associations with the behavioral tests, levels of nerve development related factors, and intestinal tight junction proteins ZO-1, and negative association with TNF-? of the hippocampus, highlighting regulatory effects of gut bacteria on memory potential and gut barrier. These results suggested the psychoactive effects of BS15 on fluoride-induced memory dysfunction after psychological stress. In addition, there may be some correlations between fluoride-induced memory dysfunction and reconstruction of gut microbiota.

AB  - APOE4 encoding apolipoprotein (Apo)E4 is the strongest genetic risk factor for Alzheimer's disease (AD). ApoE is key in intercellular lipid trafficking. Fatty acids are essential for brain integrity and cognitive performance and are implicated in neurodegeneration. We determined the sex- and age-dependent effect of AD and APOE4 on brain free fatty acid (FFA) profiles. FFA profiles were determined by LC-MS/MS in hippocampus, cortex, and cerebellum of female and male, young (<= 3 months) and older (>5 months), transgenic APOE3 and APOE4 mice with and without five familial AD (FAD) mutations (16 groups; n = 7-10 each). In the different brain regions, females had higher levels than males of either saturated or polyunsaturated FFAs or both. In the hippocampus of young males, but not of older males, APOE4 and FAD each induced 1.3-fold higher levels of almost all FFAs. In young and older females, FAD and to a less extent APOE4-induced shifts among saturated, monounsaturated, and polyunsaturated FFAs without affecting total FFA levels. In cortex and cerebellum, APOE4 and FAD had only minor effects on individual FFAs. The effects of APOE4 and FAD on FFA levels and FFA profiles in the three brain regions were strongly dependent of sex and age, particularly in the hippocampus. Here, most FFAs that are affected by FAD are similarly affected by APOE4. Since APOE4 and FAD affected hippocampal FFA profiles already at young age, these APOE4-induced alterations may modulate the pathogenesis of AD.image

AB  - Heat stress (HS) is one of the main factors associated with welfare concerns during animal transport. The use of infrared thermography (IRT) for digitally monitoring HS in weaned piglets during transportation in a semi-arid region was investigated in the present study. A total of 60 focal piglets (25 +/- 2.3 kg) were evaluated across five journeys of standard pigs-weaned loads in Cear & aacute; state, Brazil. Upon arrival at the designated farm, the piglets' respiratory rate (RR, breaths/min), rectal temperature (RT, degrees C), and salivary cortisol concentration (SC, ng/mL) were measured. Furthermore, the piglets' body (BT, degrees C) and ocular (OT, degrees C) temperatures were measured using IRT. The load's thermal assessment was monitored for each journey using Temperature-Humidity Index (THI). The correlation between the variables and the thermal images of BT and OT were evaluated using Pearson's coefficient analysis and agreement using Bland-Altman diagrams (P < 0.05). The study revealed a strong positive correlation between BT and OT with the piglets' RT (BT with r = 0.78; OT with r = 0.968) and THI (BT with r = 0.7378; OT with r = 0.8115). Additionally, OT showed a strong positive correlation (r = 0.749), while BT showed a moderate correlation (r = 0.691) with the animals' RR. On the other hand, BT and OT had a low correlation with salivary cortisol. The Bland-Altman analysis demonstrated that the use of IRT exhibited practically no bias (BT = 0.1249 degrees C and OT = 0.02075 degrees C) and showed reduced limits of agreement with RT measurements. These results provide evidence that infrared thermography technology can aid technicians and pork transport companies in estimating the physiological condition of heat stress in piglets weaned in a semi-arid region, serving as a mechanism to protect animal welfare.

AB  - The lion has experienced a major decline in its habitat and population size in recent years. This is explained by the transformation of its habitat and the reduction of its potential prey. Our study therefore focused on modelling its habitat and its prey and the analysis of its diet to contribute to its conservation in the Niokolo-Koba National Park (NKNP). Elevation, annual precipitation, NDVI, land cover type, distance from large water bodies, prey availability, poaching pressure and livestock pressure were used as variables in modelling the lion habitat with MaxEnt software. The model obtained with the modelling of the lion habitat performs well, with an AUC of 0.96, and indicates that the most favourable habitat for the lion is located in the centre of the park. This distribution is influenced by elevation, annual rainfall, prey availability, poaching pressure and livestock pressure.

AB  - IntroductionThe Taenia solium tapeworm is responsible for cysticercosis, a neglected tropical disease presenting as larvae in the body of a host following taenia egg ingestion. Neurocysticercosis (NCC), the name of the disease when it affects the human central nervous system, is a major cause of epilepsy in developing countries, and can also cause intracranial hypertension, hydrocephalus and death. Simulation models can help identify the most cost-effective interventions before their implementation. Modelling NCC should enable the comparison of a broad range of interventions, from treatment of human taeniasis (presence of an adult taenia worm in the human intestine) to NCC mitigation. It also allows a focus on the actual impact of the disease, rather than using proxies as is the case for other models. MethodsThis agent-based model is the first model that simulates human NCC and associated pathologies. It uses the output of another model, CystiAgent, which simulates the evolution of pig cysticercosis and human taeniasis, adding human and cyst agents, including a model of cyst location and stage, human symptoms, and treatment. CystiHuman also accounts for delays in the appearance of NCC-related symptoms. It comprises three modules detailing cyst development, seizure probability and timing, and intracranial hypertension/hydrocephalus, respectively. It has been implemented in Java MASON and calibrated in three endemic villages in Peru, then applied to another village (Rica Playa) to compare simulation results with field data in that village. Results and discussionDespite limitations in available field data, parameter values found through calibration are plausible and simulated outcomes in Rica Playa are close to actual values for NCC prevalence and the way it increases with age and cases with single lesions. Initial simulations further suggest that short-term interventions followed by a rapid increase in taeniasis prevalence back to original levels may have limited impacts on NCC prevalence.
   Author summaryThis paper presents CystiHuman, the first model of human neurocysticercosis, a parasitic disease that is responsible for a large proportion of epilepsy cases in developing countries and also contributes to intracranial hypertension, hydrocephalus and death. Existing modelling efforts have focused so far on parasite transmission i.e., how the parasite responsible for neurocysticercosis, Taenia solium, persists through interactions between humans and pigs. Such models, however, generally do not simulate neurocysticercosis itself or associated symptoms. CystiHuman complements these efforts by proposing a model of neurocysticercosis, associated symptoms, and likelihood of treatment. Overall, initial model outcomes are coherent with field data regarding neurocysticercosis prevalence and age patterns. The model suggests that short-term interventions that successfully reduce parasite transmission to a small fraction of its original level, but are followed (as has often been the case so far) by a rapid recuperation in transmission levels, will likely fail to produce a substantial reduction in neurocysticercosis prevalence. We view the present model as a first iteration of CystiHuman. Future iterations should use new field data to refine aspects of the model and ensure its full validation. They should also include cost information to inform cost-effectiveness analyses of interventions to address the disease.

AB  - BackgroundEpilepsy, a complex neurological disorder, is closely linked with structural and functional irregularities in the brain. However, the causal relationship between brain imaging-derived phenotypes (IDPs) and epilepsy remains unclear. This study aimed to investigate this relationship by employing a two-sample bidirectional Mendelian randomization (MR) approach.MethodsThe analysis involved 3935 cerebral IDPs from the UK Biobank and all documented cases of epilepsy (all epilepsies) cohorts from the International League Against Epilepsy, with further validation through replication and meta-analyses using epilepsy Genome-Wide Association Studies datasets from the FinnGen database. Additionally, a multivariate MR analysis framework was utilized to assess the direct impact of IDPs on all epilepsies. Furthermore, we performed a bidirectional MR analysis to investigate the relationship between the IDPs identified in all epilepsies and the 15 specific subtypes of epilepsy.ResultsThe study identified significant causal links between four IDPs and epilepsy risk. Decreased fractional anisotropy in the left inferior longitudinal fasciculus was associated with a higher risk of epilepsy (odds ratio [OR]: 0.89, p = 3.31x10-5). Conversely, increased mean L1 in the left posterior thalamic radiation (PTR) was independently associated with a heightened epilepsy risk (OR: 1.14, p = 4.72x10-5). Elevated L3 in the left cingulate gyrus was also linked to an increased risk (OR: 1.09, p = .03), while decreased intracellular volume fraction in the corpus callosum was correlated with higher epilepsy risk (OR: 0.94, p = 1.15x10-4). Subtype analysis revealed that three of these IDPs are primarily associated with focal epilepsy (FE). Notably, increased L1 in the left PTR was linked to an elevated risk of hippocampal sclerosis (HS) and lesion-negative FE, whereas elevated L3 in the left cingulate gyrus was associated with HS-related FE.ConclusionsOur research offers genetic evidence for a causal link between brain IDPs and epilepsy. These results enhance our understanding of the structural brain changes associated with the onset and progression of epilepsy.

AB  - Bisphenol A (BPA) is reported to impair male fertility. The alleviating effect of Astragalus polysaccharide (APS) on sperm oxidative damage caused by BPA exposure was analysed for the first time. In this study, the effect of APS (0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1 mg/mL) on motility of BPA-exposed sperm, energy metabolism indexes, and antioxidant parameters was evaluated. In addition, the effects of APS supplementation on protein tyrosine phosphorylation of BPA-exposed sperm were assessed. The results showed that the addition of APS (0.5 and 0.75 mg/mL) significantly increased motility of BPA-exposed sperm by decreasing the content of malondialdehyde and improving activities of superoxide dismutase and catalase (p < .05). Administration of different doses of APS to BPA-exposed sperm improved mitochondrial membrane potential and energy production (p < .05). Moreover, APS protected and alleviated tyrosine phosphorylation protein on the principal-pieces of BPA-exposed sperm flagella. In conclusion, supplementation with APS enhanced the antioxidant capacity of BPA-exposed sperm and improved in vitro capacitation, thereby improving the reproductive capacity of sperm exposed to environmental hormones.

AB  - Epilepsy designates a group of chronic brain disorders, characterized by the recurrence of hypersynchronous, repetitive activity, of neuronal clusters. Epileptic seizures are the hallmark of epilepsy. The primary goal of epilepsy treatment is to eliminate seizures with minimal side effects. Nevertheless, approximately 30% of patients do not respond to the available drugs. An imbalance between excitatory/inhibitory neurotransmission, that leads to excitotoxicity, seizures, and cell death, has been proposed as an important mechanism regarding epileptogenesis. Recently, it has been shown that microreactors composed of platinum nanoparticles (Pt-NP) and glutamate dehydrogenase possess in vitro and in vivo activity against excitotoxicity. This study investigates the in vivo effects of these microreactors in an animal model of epilepsy induced by the administration of the GABAergic antagonist bicuculline. Male Wistar rats were administered intracerebroventricularly (i.c.v.) with the microreactors or saline and, five days later, injected with bicuculline or saline. Seizure severity was evaluated in an open field. Thirty min after behavioral measurements, animals were euthanized, and their brains processed for neurodegeneration evaluation and for neurogenesis. Treatment with the microreactors significantly increased the time taken for the onset of seizures and for the first tonic-clonic seizure, when compared to the bicuculline group that did not receive the microreactor. The administration of the microreactors also increased the time spent in total exploration and grooming. Treatment with the microreactors decreased bicuculline-induced neurodegeneration and increased neurogenesis in the dorsal and ventral hippocampus. These observations suggest that treatment with Pt-NP-based microreactors attenuates the behavioral and neurobiological consequences of epileptiform seizure activity.

AB  - Intuitively, we assume that we remember episodes better when we actively participated in them and were not mere observers. Independently of this, we can recall episodes from either the first-person perspective (1pp) or the third-person perspective (3pp). In this functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study, we tested whether agency and perspective modulate neural activity during memory retrieval and subsequently enhance memory performance. Subjects encoded a set of different episodes by either imitating or only observing videos that showed short toy stories. A week later, we conducted fMRI and cued episodic retrieval by presenting the original videos, or slightly modified versions thereof, from 1pp or from 3pp. The hippocampal formation was sensitive to self-performed vs. only observed actions only when there was an episodic mismatch. In a post-fMRI memory test a history of self-performance did not improve behavioral memory performance. However, modified videos were often (falsely) accepted as showing truly experienced episodes when: (i) they were already presented in this modified version during fMRI or (ii) they were presented in their original form during fMRI but from 3pp. While the overall effect of modification was strong, the effects of perspective and agency were more subtle. Together, our findings demonstrate that self-performance and self-perspective modulate the strength of a memory trace in different ways. Even when memory performance remains the same for different agentive states, the brain is capable of detecting mismatching information. Re-experiencing the latter impairs memory performance as well as retrieving encoded episodes from 3pp.

AB  - This study investigated the impacts of Camel whey protein hydrolysate (CPH) supplementation on hepatocellular damage in Nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus) under hypoxic stress condition. Specifically, to elucidate the fundamental impacts of chronic hypoxia stress on the expression of key genes, cyp1a, hif-a, pk, cpt-1, pdk, and hsp70 in Oreochromis niloticus. Additionally, we aim to explore the involvement of the Nrf-2-Keap-1 expression as a potential mechanism through which chronic hypoxia stress may induce hepatic tissue damage. Also, other genes that catalyze the oxidative decarboxylation of pyruvate and glucose metabolism (pdk-1, cpt-1, pk, and ldh) reflect liver stress and vitality in hypoxic and normoxic conditions in Nile tilapia. Four groups of fish, each containing 40 fish (17.40 +/- 0.50 g), were included for 4 weeks. The experimental diets embraced basal and 75 g CPH/kg enriched diets. Two fish groups persisted in normoxic conditions, while the others were restrained in hypoxic conditions (DO around 1.7 mg/L). The results revealed that a fortified diet with CPH significantly reversed the hypoxia-induced reduction in the antioxidants (CAT, GSH, and SOD), liver enzymes, and lipid profile changes. However, the hypoxic states caused the downregulation of cyp1a1 but up-regulated the expression of hif-a, and hsp-70 via nrf-2-keap-1 signaling pathways. Moreover, hypoxia stress-induced histopathological alterations in the fish liver tissue were substantially reversed by CPH dietary supplementation. These results concluded that CPH is a beneficial dietary supplement for mitigating the impacts of hypoxia stress on the liver.

AB  - Simple Summary
   Piglets, especially at the weaning stage, are highly susceptible to various diseases due to an incomplete immune system development and stress responses. Post-weaning diarrhea has a significant impact on piglet growth rate and mortality, resulting in economic losses to the swine industry. Zinc oxide (ZnO) is widely used as a weaning diet supplement in the swine industry to prevent diarrheal diseases and promote immune system development. Despite the recently demonstrated beneficial effects of ZnO, many efforts have been made to reduce its excessive use in piglets owing to environmental pollution and toxic effects on tissues; thus, the need for an effective alternative ZnO form, which promotes zinc utilization, has been gaining attention. However, we do not completely understand the mode of action of ZnO alternatives or the amount required to exert positive effects on weaned piglets. Therefore, we conducted this study to evaluate the effects of different forms of ZnO alternatives (ZnO chelate with glycine (chelate-ZnO) and nanoparticle-sized ZnO (nano-ZnO)) on diarrhea score, nutrient digestibility, zinc utilization, intestinal immune profiles, and fecal microflora on piglets, together with a comparison of the standard ZnO treatment. We found that 200 ppm Nano-ZnO had similar positive effects on weaned piglets compared with 2500 ppm ZnO and therefore is a promising alternative to ZnO.
   Twenty weaned piglets with initial body weight of 6.83 +/- 0.33 kg (21 day of age, LYD) were randomly assigned to four treatments for a two-week feeding trial to determine the effects of different dietary zinc on nutrient digestibility, intestinal health, and microbiome of weaned piglets. The dietary treatments included a negative control (CON), standard ZnO (ZnO, 2500 ppm), zinc chelate with glycine (Chelate-ZnO, 200 ppm), and nanoparticle-sized ZnO (Nano-ZnO, 200 ppm). At 0 to 1 week, the diarrhea score was decreased in the CON group compared with the ZnO, Chelate-ZnO, and Nano-ZnO group. In overall period, the ZnO and Nano-ZnO groups exhibited improved diarrhea scores compared to the CON group. The apparent total tract digestibility of dry matter and gross energy was the lowest in the CON group after one week. Compared to the ZnO group, the chelate-ZnO group exhibited higher proportion of T-bet+ and FoxP3+ T cells and the nano-ZnO group had higher numbers of RORgt+ and GATA3+ T cells in the mesenteric lymph nodes. ZnO group increased IL-6 and IL-8 levels in the colon tissues and these positive effects were observed in both chelate ZnO and nano-ZnO groups with lower level. The 16S rRNA gene analysis showed that the relative abundance of Prevotella was higher in the ZnO-treated groups than in the CON group and that of Succinivibrio was the highest in the nano-ZnO group. The relative abundance of Lactobacillus increased in the ZnO group. In conclusion, low nano-ZnO levels have similar effects on nutrient digestibility, fecal microflora, and intestinal immune profiles in weaning pigs; thus, nano-ZnO could be used as a ZnO alternative for promoting ZnO utilization and intestinal immunity.

AB  - Background: Seasonal variation in exacerbations, hospitalisations, and mortality statistics has been reported for some diseases. To our knowledge, however, no published studies exist on the seasonality of health-related quality of life (HRQoL) amongst rhinologic patients. Aims/Objectives: This study, therefore, aimed to investigate the possible seasonal variation in rhinologic patients' HRQoL using the rhinologic disease-specific Sino-Nasal Outcome Test-22 (SNOT-22) and the generic 15D HRQoL instrument. Material and Methods: We enrolled unselected adult rhinologic patients requiring specialist care at the Helsinki University Hospital in this cross-sectional, questionnaire-based prospective study during four seasons: February (winter), May (spring), August (summer), and November (autumn). Patients received SNOT-22 and 15D questionnaires via post. The Finnish Meteorological Institute supplied climate data from these months. Results: SNOT-22 and 15D data were available for 301 and 298 patients, respectively. We found no statistically significant differences (p = 0.948) between the mean monthly 15D scores or mean SNOT-22 scales. Furthermore, the mean SNOT-22 subscales did not differ between the monthly study periods. Conclusions and Significance: Our study shows that seasonality did not impact rhinologic patients' SNOT-22 or 15D HRQoL scores. Thus, these questionnaires can be used for follow-up amongst rhinologic patients regardless of season.

AB  - IntroductionAlzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disease that is characterized by amyloid plaque deposits, neuronal cell loss, and memory impairment. Granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) is a growth factor associated with AD improvement. Stromal cell-derived factor-1 (SDF-1) mediates therapeutic effects of G-CSF. This study investigated the effect of combination treatment of G-CSF and SDF-1 on amyloid plaque deposits, apoptosis, and behavior of AD rats. MethodsIntracerebroventricular amyloid-beta [A beta(1-42)] peptide was used to induce AD in A beta rats. There were six groups including naive control, sham-operated, A beta, A beta + G-CSF, A beta + SDF-1, and A beta + G-CSF + SDF-1. SDF-1 intra-cerebroventricular (ICV), G-CSF Subcutaneous (SC), or a combination of them were administered to A beta rats weekly for 2 months. The cognition and memory were assessed using the novel object recognition, passive avoidance, and Morris water maze tests. Next, rat brains were removed and the amyloid plaque and apoptosis were detected in the brain and hippocampus using immunohistochemistry and TUNEL assay, respectively. ResultsThe amyloid-beta and apoptotic cell levels dropped in groups receiving SDF-1 and G-CSF combination compared to the A beta group. Also, number of microglial cells increased significantly in the combination group compared to other treatment groups. Moreover, learning and memory were significantly improved in the combination group compared to the A beta groups (P < 0.05). ConclusionSDF-1 and G-CSF combination therapy can offer a promising strategy for AD.

AB  - N-Methyl-D-Aspartate (NMDA) receptors are critically involved in the learning and memory formation and dizocilpine (MK-801) is an antagonist of NMDA receptor. Ghrelin plays a crucial role in learning and memory processes. The present study was conducted to the evaluation of ghrelin effect on passive avoidance memory impairment induced by MK801.
   In this experimental study, 24 male wistar rats were randomly distributed into 3 groups of 8 each. Passive avoidance tests of animals were evaluated using Shuttle Box apparatus. One week after the surgery, ghrelin (3 nmol) was injected intra-hippocampally, 5 min before the MK-801administration. MK-801 (0.15 mg/kg) was injected intraperitoneally (i.p.), 10 min before the test session. Pre-test injection of MK-801 significantly decreased STL (step through latency) at 24 h and 48 h (P < 0.001) and 10 days (P < 0.01) and increased TDC (time spent in dark compartment) at 24 h, 48 h and 10 days (P < 0.001) after training in comparison with control group. Pre-test injection of ghrelin + MK-801 significantly increased STL at 24 h (P < 0.01), 48 h and 10 days (P < 0.001) and decreased TDC at 24 h, 48 h and 10 days (P < 0.001) after training in comparison with MK-801 received group.
   It is concluded that pre-test injection of MK-801 impaired passive avoidance memory. Administration of ghrelin before MK-801 ameliorated memory impairment induced by MK-801. It is assumed that this compensative effect of ghrelin was mediated by NMDA receptor.

AB  - Jarosite residue (JR), a hazardous solid waste generated in non-ferrous metallurgy, poses significant environmental challenges due to its large volume and poor storage stability. However, its high content of valuable metals (such as iron, zinc, gallium, indium, silver, & mldr;) makes its efficient recovery and comprehensive utilization highly significant. This study investigates the "oxidative roasting-reductive smelting" process for JR treatment. The reduction thermodynamics of JR-R (roasted JR) were analyzed, and the effects of smelting temperature, time, and slag basicity on the reduction and smelting process were examined. The results indicate that increasing slag basicity and temperature generally decreases slag viscosity. Thermodynamic calculations demonstrate that reductive smelting effectively enriches valuable metals (>1039 degrees C). The optimal conditions for reductive smelting of JR were determined to be as follows: smelting temperature of 1550 degrees C, smelting time of 60 min, and slag basicity of 0.9. Under these conditions, the process achieved an Fe grade of 92.87% in pig iron with a recovery rate of 90.66%, a Ga grade of 377 g/t with a recovery rate of 94.91%, and Zn and In volatilization rates of 99.91% and 83.36%, respectively. This study provides a feasible approach for the comprehensive recovery of valuable metals such as Ga, Fe, Zn, and In from JR, offering promising economic and social benefits.

AB  - Brain states fluctuate between exploratory and consummatory phases of behavior. These state changes affect both internal computation and the organism's responses to sensory inputs. Understanding neuronal mechanisms supporting exploratory and consummatory states and their switching requires experimental control of behavioral shifts and collecting sufficient amounts of brain data. To achieve this goal, we developed the ThermoMaze, which exploits the animal's natural warmth-seeking homeostatic behavior. By decreasing the floor temperature and selectively heating unmarked areas, we observed that mice avoided the aversive state by exploring the maze and finding the warm spot. In its design, the ThermoMaze is analogous to the widely used water maze but without the inconvenience of a wet environment and, therefore, allows the collection of physiological data in many trials. We combined the ThermoMaze with electrophysiology recording, and report that spiking activity of hippocampal CA1 neurons during sharp-wave ripple events encode the position of mice. Thus, place-specific firing is not confined to locomotion and associated theta oscillations but persist during waking immobility and sleep at the same location. The ThermoMaze will allow for detailed studies of brain correlates of immobility, preparatory-consummatory transitions, and open new options for studying behavior-mediated temperature homeostasis.

AB  - ContextLymphatic filariasis, generally called as elephantiasis, is a vector-borne infectious disease caused by the filarial nematodes, mainly Wuchereria bancrofti, Brugia malayi, and Brugia timori, which are transmitted through mosquitoes. The infection affects the normal flow of lymph leading to abnormal enlargement of body parts, severe pain, permanent disability, and social stigma. Due to the development of resistance as well as toxic effects, existing medicines for lymphatic filariasis are becoming ineffective in killing the adult worms. It is essential to search novel filaricidal drugs with new molecular targets. Asparaginyl-tRNA synthetase (PDB ID: 2XGT) belongs to the group of aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases that catalyze specific attachment of amino acids to their tRNA during protein biosynthesis. Plants and their extracts are well-known medicinal practice for the management of several parasitic infectious diseases including filarial infections.MethodsIn this study, asparaginyl-tRNA synthetase of Brugia malayi was used as a target to perform virtual screening of plant phytoconstituents of Vitex negundo from IMPPAT database, which exhibits anti-filarial and anti-helminthic properties. A total of sixty-eight compounds from Vitex negundo were docked against asparaginyl-tRNA synthetase using Autodock module of PyRx tool. Among the 68 compounds screened, 3 compounds, negundoside, myricetin, and nishindaside, exhibited a higher binding affinity compared to standard drugs. The pharmacokinetic and physicochemical prediction, stability of ligand-receptor complexes via molecular dynamics simulation, and density functionality theory were done further for the top-scored ligands with receptor.

AB  - Global warming negatively impacts sow reproduction, leading to health and welfare challenges and economic losses in the swine industry. The present study was a retrospective observational study that examined the effects of season, temperature, and humidity during parturition on farrowing duration and piglet birth intervals in sows housed in a temporarily confined system under a tropical climate. Data from 10039 farrowings of Landrace x Yorkshire sows (January-December 2023) included parity, farrowing date, parturition onset, total number of piglets born per litter (TB), number of piglets born alive per litter (BA), percentage of stillbirths (SB) and mummified fetuses (MF), and farrowing house temperature and humidity. The temperature-humidity index (THI) and averages for the 7 days before and on the day of farrowing were also calculated. The association between these parameters and the farrowing duration of sows was analyzed. Additionally, the proportion of sows experiencing prolonged farrowing (i.e., >300 min) associated with different factors were evaluated. On average, TB, BA, SB, and MF were 13.9 +/- 3.6, 12.4 +/- 3.9, 5.7 %, and 5.8 %, respectively. The average farrowing duration was 228.9 +/- 194.8 min, with 21.1 % of sows experiencing prolonged farrowing (>300 min). Dystocia occurred in 5.1 % of farrowings, and the average birth interval for each piglet was 18.7 +/- 26.7 min. During the 7-day period before parturition, sows were exposed to an average barn temperature of 26.7 +/- 1.9 degrees C, with daily minimum and maximum temperatures of 25.1 +/- 2.2 degrees C and 29.9 +/- 1.0 degrees C, respectively. The average barn humidity during the 7-day period before parturition was 80.2 +/- 5.8 %, with values ranging from 62.1 % to 90.1 %. The farrowing duration of sows was positively correlated with average temperature (r = 0.044, P < 0.001), maximum temperature (r = 0.051, P < 0.001) and minimum temperature (r = 0.057, P < 0.001) during the 7day period before farrowing. Moreover, every 10 % increase in relative humidity during the 7-day period before parturition caused an increase in the farrowing duration of 21 min (farrowing duration = 61.0 + (2.1 x humidity), P < 0.001). Every 1 degrees C increase in the average temperature during the 7-day period before parturition caused an increase in the farrowing duration of 4.3 min (farrowing duration = 113.49 + (4.3 x temperature), P < 0.001). In conclusion, 21.1 % of sows in tropical climates experience prolonged farrowing durations. Elevated temperatures, humidity, and THI during the 7 days prior to farrowing or on the day of farrowing significantly extended farrowing durations and birth intervals in sows. These findings highlight the critical importance of maintaining temperature and humidity levels as close as possible to the optimal range for lactating sows (i.e., 12-22 degrees C), particularly in tropical regions.

AB  - The main limitation of allotransplantation and in particular heart transplantation is the insufficient supply of donor organs. As alternative strategies to heart transplantation, stem cells opened the way of regenerative medicine in early 2000. While new biotechnologies tried to minimize side effects due to hemocompatibility in artificial hearts, progress in xenotransplantation allowed in 2022 to realize the first pig-to-human heart transplant on a compassionate use basis. This xenotransplantation has been successful thanks to genetically modified pigs using the CRISPR-Cas9 technology. Indeed, gene editing allowed modifications of immune responses and thrombotic potential to modulate graft and systemic reaction. Academic research and preclinical studies of xenogeneic tissues already used in clinic such as bioprosthesis valve and of new xenotransplantation options will be necessary to evaluate immune-thrombosis and organ/vascular damages more deeply to make this hope of xenotransplantation a clinical reality. Stem cells, artificial heart and xenotransplantation are all in line to overcome the lack of donor hearts. Combination of stem cell approaches and/or xenogeneic tissue and/or artificial organs are probably part of the research objectives to make these projects real in the short term.

AB  - Trehalase can hydrolyze trehalose and is the first key enzyme in the chitin synthesis pathway of arthropods. However, little is known about the function of trehalase in Haemonchus contortus (HcTre). In this study, the purified recombinant HcTre protein (rHcTre) was obtained by prokaryotic expression technology, and it was proved that rHcTre protein has trehalase activity. Western blot results verified that HcTre protein belongs to the excretory/secretory proteins of H. contortus, and rHcTre protein can be recognized by goat serum infected with H. contortus. Moreover, Western blot results demonstrated the expression of the HcTre gene in various developmental stages of H. contortus, with the highest level observed during the egg stage. Meanwhile, the immunofluorescence results revealed a widespread distribution of HcTre protein in adult worms. Interestingly, we found that rat serum against rHcTre protein inhibited the development of larvae by blocking the activity of trehalase. Furthermore, the results showed that rHcTre protein significantly inhibited the proliferation and promoted the apoptosis of goat PBMCs in a dose-dependent manner. This study is expected to further understand the immune escape mechanism of H. contortus and provide new drug targets and vaccine candidate molecules for the prevention and control of the disease.

AB  - Tozadenant (4-hydroxy-N-(4-methoxy-7-morpholinobenzo[d]thiazol-2-yl)-4-methylpiperidine-1-carboxamide) is a highly selective adenosine A(2A) receptor (A(2A)R) antagonist and a promising lead structure for the development of A(2A)R-selective positron emission tomography (PET) probes. Although several F-18-labelled tozadenant derivatives showed favorable in vitro properties, recent in vivo PET studies observed poor brain penetration and lower specific binding than anticipated from the in vitro data. While these findings might be attributable to the structural modification associated with F-18-labelling, they could also reflect inherent properties of the parent compound. However, PET studies with radioisotopologues of tozadenant to evaluate its cerebral pharmacokinetics and brain distribution are still lacking. In the present work, we applied N-Boc-O-desmethyltozadenant as a suitable precursor for the preparation of [O-methyl-C-11]tozadenant ([C-11]tozadenant) by O-methylation with [C-11]methyl iodide followed by acidic deprotection. This approach afforded [C-11]tozadenant in radiochemical yields of 18 +/- 2%, with molar activities of 50-60 GBq/mu mol (1300-1600 mCi/mu mol) and radiochemical purities of 95 +/- 3%. In addition, in vitro autoradiography in pig and rat brain slices demonstrated the expected striatal accumulation pattern and confirmed the A(2A)R specificity of the radioligand, making it a promising tool for in vivo PET studies on the cerebral pharmacokinetics and brain distribution of tozadenant.

AB  - The early initiation of binge-drinking and biological sex are critical risk factors for the development of affective disturbances and cognitive decline, as well as neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimer's disease. Further, a history of excessive alcohol consumption alters normal age-related changes in the pattern of protein expression in the brain, which may relate to an acceleration of cognitive decline. Here, we aimed to disentangle the interrelation between a history of binge-drinking during adolescence, biological sex and normal aging on the manifestation of negative affect, cognitive decline and associated biochemical pathology. To this end, adolescent male and female C57BL/6J mice (PND 28-29) underwent 30 days of alcohol binge-drinking using a modified drinking-in-the-dark (DID) paradigm. Then, mice were assayed for negative affect, sensorimotor gating and cognition at three developmental stages during adulthood-mature adulthood (6 months), pre-middle age (9 months) and middle age (12 months). Behavioural testing was then followed by immunoblotting to index the protein expression of glutamate receptors, neuropathological markers [Tau, p (Thr217)-Tau, p (Ser396)-Tau, BACE, APP, A beta], as well as ERK activation within the entorhinal cortex, prefrontal cortex and amygdala. Across this age span, we detected only a few age-related changes in our measures of negative affect or spatial learning/memory in the Morris water maze and all of these changes were sex-specific. Prior adolescent binge-drinking impaired behaviour only during reversal learning in 9-month-old females and during radial arm maze testing in 12-month-old females. In contrast to behaviour, we detected a large number of protein changes related to prior binge-drinking history, several of which manifested as early as 6 months of age, with the prefrontal cortex particularly affected at this earlier age. While 6-month-old mice exhibited relatively few alcohol-related protein changes within the entorhinal cortex and amygdala, the number of alcohol-related protein changes within the entorhinal cortex increased with age, while the 12-month-old mice exhibited the largest number of protein changes within the amygdala. Approximately a third of the alcohol-related protein changes were sex-selective. Taken together, the results of our longitudinal study using a murine model of binge-drinking indicate that a prior history of heavy alcohol consumption, beginning in adolescence, is sufficient to induce what we presume to be latent changes in protein indices of cellular activity, glutamate transmission and neuropathology within key brain regions governing cognition, executive function and emotion that appear to precede the onset of robust behavioural signs of dysregulated affect and cognitive impairment.

AB  - N-6-Methyladenosine (m(6)A) regulates oocyte-to-embryo transition and the reprogramming of somatic cells into induced pluripotent stem cells. However, the role of m(6)A methylation in porcine early embryonic development and its reprogramming characteristics in somatic cell nuclear transfer (SCNT) embryos are yet to be known. Here, we showed that m(6)A methylation was essential for normal early embryonic development and its aberrant reprogramming in SCNT embryos. We identified a persistent occurrence of m(6)A methylation in embryos between 1-cell to blastocyst stages and m(6)A levels abruptly increased during the morula-to-blastocyst transition. Cycloleucine (methylation inhibitor, 20 mM) treatment efficiently reduced m(6)A levels, significantly decreased the rates of 4-cell embryos and blastocysts, and disrupted normal lineage allocation. Moreover, cycloleucine treatment also led to higher levels in both apoptosis and autophagy in blastocysts. Furthermore, m(6)A levels in SCNT embryos at the 4-cell and 8-cell stages were significantly lower than that in parthenogenetic activation (PA) embryos, suggesting an abnormal reprogramming of m(6)A methylation in SCNT embryos. Correspondingly, expression levels of m(6)A writers (METTL3 and METTL14) and eraser (FTO) were apparently higher in SCNT 8-cell embryos compared with their PA counterparts. Taken together, these results indicated that aberrant nuclear transfer-mediated reprogramming of m(6)A methylation was involved in regulating porcine early embryonic development.

AB  - Heavy application of nitrogen (N) in tea (Camellia sinensis (L.)) plantations causes various environmental problems. To date, studies on N flows have been limited to the tea plantation level, but the crucial drivers of N flows are consumers, not farmers. Therefore, this study aimed to evaluate changes in N flows concerning green tea production and consumption in Japan from 1965 to 2016 using the N footprint concept. Nitrogen use efficiency (NUE), virtual N factor (VNF), and N footprint were calculated using a Monte Carlo method from data for 17 parameters obtained from the literature review. The VNF for green tea in Japan decreased from 54.5 in 1991 to 30.8 in 2016. The major reasons for this decrease were (i) increased NUE in plantations and (ii) increased consumption of ready-to-drink (RTD) tea, matcha, and powdered tea, indicating an increase in the efficiency of N intake from green tea by consumers. The decrease in VNF resulted in a reduction in N footprint from green tea consumption. However, the decline in N footprint since 2004 is not derived from the decrease in VNF but mainly from reduced green tea consumption. A sensitivity analysis revealed that the parameters associated with the extraction efficiency of tea, powdered tea production, and the amount of tea leaves used for RTD production strongly affected VNF estimation.

AB  - Simple Summary
   Animals with intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) are defined as neonates born at term but with low birth weight and a characteristic shape of the head. A number of structural and functional modifications in the IUGR intestine affecting its digestive and absorptive function and impairing intestinal barrier function have been reported in the past. Far less is known about the immune system in the gut of IUGR pigs. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to evaluate the structures of the immune system of the gut mucosa in IUGR neonates. We found that the immune deficiency in the gut mucosa that results from restricted intrauterine development occurs at postnatal day (PD) 7, but it disappears thereafter within a week. However, all examined IUGR piglets had an increased number of intraepithelial leukocytes in the gut mucosa on PD 14. We have shown that the immune system of the gut of IUGR piglets is able to quickly compensate for the immunological deficiency postnatally and hardly shows any morphological disabilities in later life.
   Intrauterine growth restricted (IUGR) piglets are born at term but have low birth mass and a characteristic shape of the head. Impaired general condition, especially in intestinal function, leads to an increase in the occurrence of diarrhoea and high mortality in the first days of life. So far, the mechanical and immunological gut barrier functions in IUGR are poorly understood. The aim of this study was to microscopically evaluate the early postnatal changes in the gut mucosa occurring in IUGR piglets. Whole-tissue small intestine samples were collected from littermate pairs (IUGR and normal) on postnatal day (PD) 7, 14 and 180 and analysed by light microscopy. We found that in the IUGR piglets, the percentage of intraepithelial leukocytes was reduced in the duodenum on PD 7, but it increased in the proximal and middle jejunum both on PD 7 and PD 14, which suggested the development of an inflammatory process. The number of goblet cells was also reduced on PD 14. The average size of the Peyer's patches in the distal jejunum and ileum showed significant reduction on PD 7 as compared to normal pigs; however, on PD 14, it returned to normal. On PD 180, we did not find any differences in the measured parameters between the IUGR and the normal pigs. In conclusion, we found that in one-week-old IUGR pig neonates, the gut barrier and the immune system structures display signs of retarded development but recover within the second postnatal week of life.

AB  - Oil - Camellia is a major oil-producing tree, known for its high nutritional value and health benefits. Improving seed size and oil content is the key breeding objective, governed by intricate genetic networks. However, the molecular mechanism underlying these traits in oil-Camellia has been rarely reported. In this study, an F-1 population was developed from two parental genotypes, CL4 (hexaploid with high oil content and large seed size) and XG (tetraploid with low oil content and small seed size), which exhibited significant variation in yield-related traits. Ploidy analysis of progenies of F-1 population showed that most individuals were tetraploids and hexaploids, with a smaller number of diploids and octoploids present. Additionally, the analysis identified progeny individuals exhibiting both large seed and high oil content although no clear correlation with ploidy was observed. Comparative RNA sequencing (RNA seq) of developing seeds at four developmental stages revealed dynamic expression patterns, associated with seed size and oil content in the two parents. Co-expression regulatory network and differentially expressed genes of fatty acid biosynthesis pathway indicated that genes, such as Oleosin5 and ACCase alpha-subunit, displayed central roles in controlling seed size and oil content with notable expression peaks in S3 and S4. Additionally, the ABA signaling pathway, along with expansin proteins and transcription factors, showed co-expression with these genes, suggesting a regulatory pathway centered around Oleosin5 and ACCase alpha-subunit. This study identifies essential genes linked to oil seed yield traits, enhancing the understanding of oil-Camellia's molecular breeding targets.

AB  - Simple Summary Spermatozoa (SPZ) viability, morphology and the kinetics of fresh and thawing Portuguese Merino Semen were evaluated at different breeding season months using an owner egg yolk-based semen extender (S-EXT) and two commercial lecithin-based semen extenders. The main significant differences between S-EXT were observed for thawed semen. The viability (30% vs. 15% of alive SPZ; p < 0.001), total motility (74% vs. 34%; p < 0.001), total progressive motility (18% vs. 5%; p < 0.001), straight line velocity (37 vs. 22 mu m/s; p < 0.001) and beat cross frequency (13 vs. 6 Hz; p < 0.05) were higher in the owner egg yolk than in egg yolk-free-based S-EXT. Significant interactions between S-EXT, semen processing and/or months of semen collection were observed on several of the 22 evaluated SPZ parameters and should be elucidated in further studies. The egg yolk-based S-EXT was more consistent across the months in cryopreserving SPZ than commercial egg yolk- free-based S-EXT and still seems, to the present day, the most appropriate S-EXT to be used in (Merino) sheep. This study aimed to evaluate and compare the effect of three semen extenders (S-EXT) on 22 spermatozoa (SPZ) parameters (subjective and computer-assisted sperm analysis evaluations), before and after semen cryopreservation throughout different months of the breeding season in the Portuguese Merino breed. According to the multivariable model, the SPZ viability (alive %), kinetics subjective individual motility, total motility, total progressive motility and its subpopulations, and beat cross frequency) were higher in the egg yolk-based S-EXT improved by Estacao Zootecnica National (Portugal) than in Ovixcell(R) or Andromed(R) extenders. All the differences were only observed in thawed semen, except for total motility and total progressive motility, in which Ovixcell(R) also showed the poorest results on fresh semen. An interaction effect between S-EXT and semen processing was observed on 72.3% (17/22) of the evaluated parameters, evidencing a variable cryoprotective action between S-EXT. The SPZ viability was poorer in the onset of the breeding season (end of April/early May) than in the previous middle breeding season (November/early December), suggesting the influence of a short anoestrous season on ejaculate quality, even though the volume and SPZ concentration of the ejaculates remained stable throughout the experiment. Additionally, S-EXT x semen processing x month interaction effect on 59.1% (13/22) of the evaluated parameters evidenced the importance of SPZ time collection in a natural environment to cryopreserve ram's semen. We concluded that, overall, the egg yolk-based S-EXT provided a greater value to the cryopreservation of Merino rams ' semen. Nevertheless, the causes of the interaction effect between S-EXT, semen processing and/or month on several SPZ parameters should be addressed, including SPZ molecular research in new studies, in order to improve egg yolk-based as well as in egg yolk-free-based S-EXT.

AB  - Animals confined to different dietary conditions often exhibit distinct, sometimes contrasting, nutritional phenotypes and performance outcomes. This is especially true for many oviparous insects whose developmental diets can vary depending on the mother's egg-laying site selection. Much research on the relationship between preference and performance in insects has focused on larval success, which overlooks the complexities of dietary effects on diverse performance parameters across life stages and potential trade-offs between those parameters. Furthermore, the connection between diet-induced nutritional phenotype and performance trade-offs is not well understood. Here, using Drosophila suzukii , we quantify multiple performance indices of larvae and adults reared on five host fruits of different protein-to-sugar ratios (P:S) which have previously been shown to differ in attractiveness to fly foraging and oviposition. Our results demonstrate robust diet-specific performance trade-offs, with fly fecundity, larval development time, pupal size, and adult weight superior in flies reared on the high P:S raspberry diet, in contrast to the low P:S grape diet; but the reverse was found in terms of adult starvation resistance. Notably, the contrasting performance trade-offs are readily explained by the fly nutritional phenotype, reflected in the protein and energy (glucose and lipid) contents of flies reared on the two fruits. Together, our results provide experimental evidence for metabolic plasticity of D. suzukii reared on different fruits and the possibility of using adult nutritional phenotype as a marker for diet and performance outcomes.

AB  - Quartz is classified as a group 1 carcinogen by the International Agency for Research on Cancer. Atmospheric emissions of respirable quartz in particulate matter released from industrial activities are important for evaluating human exposure. Here we quantified the mass concentrations of quartz as a constituent of particulate matter collected from 118 full-scale industrial plants, comprising 13 main source categories, with the aim of identifying primary industrial contributors. The sources with the highest quartz mass concentrations are waste incineration and electric-arc furnace steelmaking, with average values of 16,924 mu g g-1 and 12,005 mu g g-1, respectively. Total atmospheric emissions of quartz from the investigated industrial sources are 24,581.3 t. Cement kiln co-processing solid waste, coking plants, pig-iron blast furnaces, iron-ore sintering and steelmaking electric-arc furnaces were identified as the major industrial sources contributing to quartz emissions in China. Quartz emissions arising from the 13 industrial sources could generate up to 77.2% increment in cancer risk for China owing to the high density of these activities. These results provide important fundamental data to assess exposure risks in the general population and enhance sustainability of industrial development.
   Quartz is a well-known carcinogen of particular concern to industrial workers exposed to particulate quartz. Industrial atmospheric emissions across multiple sectors, however, are found to include respirable quartz, posing a threat to the public health of surrounding populations.

AB  - The fall armyworm (FAW), Spodoptera frugiperda is one of the most destructive polyphagous herbivores. Some detoxification genes have been proved to be involved in the adaptability to host plants in FAW, while the role of its gut microbiota on the responses of host switches, and their ability to adapt to new host plants remain poorly understood. Herein, we isolated five strains of nicotine-degrading bacteria from the gut of S. frugiperda larvae, among which Bacillus atrophaeus B1 exhibited the highest nicotine tolerance. This strain showed a minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) value of 2 g/L and a nicotine degradation rate of 46.36 %. We sequenced the complete genome of B. atrophaeus B1 and 15 candidate genes were identified maybe related to nicotine degradation, among which GE003027, GE002849, GE002602, GE000220 and GE002708 had significantly higher expression when exposed to nicotine. Non-targeted metabolomics revealed 98 differentially accumulated metabolites (DAMs) under nicotine stress, which were 72 metabolites upregulated and 26 metabolites down- regulated, and the pathways most affected involved xenobiotic biodegradation and metabolism, energy metabolism, and amino acid metabolism. B. atrophaeus B1 may accumulate 2-ketoglutaric acid and gamma- amino- butyric acid during degradation of nicotine, which is non-toxic to S. frugiperda, and participated in the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle. Additionally, 2-ketoglutaric acid and gamma- aminobutyric acid were detected both in B. atrophaeus B1 and S. frugiperda treated with nicotine. Antibiotic treatment deprived most of the gut bacteria, followed by a decrease in tolerance of S. frugiperda to nicotine, and the nicotine degradation rate was significantly increased as expected after reinfection with B. atrophaeus B1. These findings provide new insights into the bacterial metabolism of nicotine degradation and offer a theoretical basis for understanding the rapid adaptability of S. frugiperda to various host plants.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to assess the following effects: (1) the inclusion of olive in the animal's diet on the dry-cured shoulder; (2) the effect of curing on three different muscles (infraspinatus, supraspinatus, and subscapular); (3) the effect of different curing times (fresh shoulder, 6 months curing, and 12 months curing). For this purpose, forty shoulders were used, followed by a cold nitrite-free curing process with controlled humidity and temperature, according to the flowchart of a company that implements highly stringent standards in terms of food safety and quality. Samples were evaluated for their physicochemical composition and lipid profile. All the physicochemical composition parameters were significantly different (p < 0.001) in the three muscles studied. As might be expected, the curing times from the fresh product to the final product were also significantly different for all the parameters studied in this work. Regarding the inclusion of olive cake, it was found that treatment with a base diet + 10% exhausted olive cake (T4) showed higher levels for the parameters NaCl, collagen, and total fat. As for the fatty acid profile, in general, the olive did not influence the final product. On the other hand, we found that the type of muscle and the curing time of the cured shoulder had a significant influence on the fatty acid profile. We should also point out that there are significant differences in the interaction between curing time and muscle, particularly in saturated fatty acids (SFAs), monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFAs), and polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), as well as the lipid quality indices. Canonical discriminant analysis is viable for evaluating the evolution of the curing process, discriminating and classifying curing times, and evaluating the muscles of the B & iacute;saro pork shoulder. Also, the introduction of olive cake into the animal diet does not affect the final product obtained.

AB  - Objective: To describe the development of an artificial placenta (AP) system in sheep with learning curve and main bottlenecks to allow survival up to one week. Methods: A total of 28 fetal sheep were transferred to an AP system at 110-115 days of gestation. The survival goal in the AP system was increased progressively in three consecutive study groups: 1-3 h (n = 8), 4-24 h (n = 10) and 48-168 h (n = 10). Duration of cannulation procedure, technical complications, pH, lactate, extracorporeal circulation (EC) circuit flows, fetal heart rate, and outcomes across experiments were compared. Results: There was a progressive reduction in cannulation complications (75%, 50% and 0%, p = 0.004), improvement in initial pH (7.20 +/- 0.06, 7.31 +/- 0.04 and 7.33 +/- 0.02, p = 0.161), and increment in the rate of experiments reaching survival goal (25%, 70% and 80%, p = 0.045). In the first two groups, cannulation accidents, air bubbles in the extracorporeal circuit, and thrombotic complications were the most common cause of AP system failure. Conclusions: Achieving a reproducible experimental setting for an AP system is extremely challenging, time- and effort-consuming, and requires a highly multidisciplinary team. As a result of the learning curve, we achieved reproducible transition and survival up to 7 days. Extended survival requires improving instrumentation with custom-designed devices.

AB  - Shaziling pigs, as a native Chinese breed, have been classified as a fatty liver model. As the core of the whole pig farm, the sow's organism health is especially important, especially in the perinatal period; however, there are few reports on the perinatal intestinal microbiology and bile acid metabolism of Shaziling pig sows. The purpose of this research was to investigate the alterations in bile acids and gut microbiota of sows that occur throughout the perinatal period. Forty-two sows were selected for their uniformity of body conditions and were given the same diet. Fecal samples were collected for 16srDNA sequencing and bile acid targeted metabolome detection in four stages (3 days before delivery, 3 days after delivery, 7 days after delivery and 21 days after delivery). As revealed by the results, there were statistically significant variations in bile acids among the four stages, with the concentration of bile acids identified by SZL-4 being substantially greater than that of the other three groups (p < 0.05). When compared to the other three groups (p < 0.05), SZL-2 had considerably lower Shannon, Simpson and Chao 1 indices, and exhibited a statistically significant difference in beta-diversity. SZL-2 samples included a greater proportion of Proteobacteria than SZL-3 and SZL-4 samples; however, SZL-2 samples contained a smaller proportion of spirochetes than SZL-3 and SZL-4 samples. To a large extent, lactic acid bacteria predominated in the SZL-2 samples. The LEfSe analysis showed that the relative abundances of Lachnospiraceae_XPB1014_group, Christensenellaceae_R_7_group, Clostridium, Collinsella, Turicibacter, and Mollicutes_RF39_unclassified were the main differential bacteria in the SZL-1 swine fecal samples and the Eubacterium__coprostanoligenes_group in sow fecal samples from SZL-2. The relative abundance of Bacteroides, UBA1819, Enterococcus, Erysipelatoclostridium, and Butyricimonas in SZL-3 and SZL-4 Streptococcus, Coriobacteriaceae_unclassified, Prevotellaceae_UCG_001, Streptomyces, and Ochrobactrum in SZL-3. g_Collinsella was significantly and positively correlated with vast majority bile acids, and the g_Lachnospiraceae_XPB1014_group with GCDCA and GHDCA into positive correlations. Simultaneously, g_Streptococcus, g_Bacteroides, and g_UBA1819 inversely correlated with bile acid, accounting for the great bulk of the difference. In conclusion, there is an evident correlation between bile acids and gut microbiota in the perinatal period of Shaziling sows. Additionally, the discovery of distinct bacteria associated to lipid metabolism gives a reference for ameliorating perinatal body lipid metabolism disorder of sows through gut microbiota.

AB  - Expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) mapping is an effective tool for identifying genetic variations that regulate gene expression. An increasing number of studies suggested that SNPs associated with complex traits in farm animals are considered as expression quantitative trait loci. Identifying eQTLs associated with gene expression levels in the endometrium helps to unravel the regulatory mechanisms of genes related to reproductive functions in this tissue and provides molecular markers for the genetic improvement of high-fertility sow breeding. In this study, 218 RNA-seq data from pig endometrial tissue were used for eQTL analysis to identify genetic variants regulating gene expression. Additionally, weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) was performed to identify hub genes involved in reproductive functions. The eQTL analysis identified 34,876 significant cis-eQTLs regulating the expression of 5632 genes (FDR <= 0.05), and 90 hub genes were identified by WGCNA analysis. By integrating eQTL and WGCNA results, 14 candidate genes and 16 fine-mapped cis-eQTLs were identified, including FRK, ARMC3, SLC35F3, TMEM72, FFAR4, SOWAHA, PSPH, FMO5, HPN, FUT2, RAP1GAP, C6orf52, SEL1L3, and CLGN, which were involved in the physiological processes of reproduction in sows through hormone regulation, cell adhesion, and amino acid and lipid metabolism. These eQTLs regulate the high expression of candidate genes in the endometrium, thereby affecting reproductive-related physiological functions. These findings enhance our understanding of the genetic basis of reproductive traits and provide valuable genetic markers for marker-assisted selection (MAS), which can be applied to improve sow fecundity and optimize breeding strategies for high reproductive performance.

AB  - Lipopolysaccharides (LPS) confer resistance against harsh conditions, including antibiotics, in Gram-negative bacteria. The lipopolysaccharide transport (Lpt) complex, consisting of seven proteins (A-G), exports LPS across the cellular envelope. LptB(2)FG forms an ATP-binding cassette transporter that transfers LPS to LptC. How LptB(2)FG couples ATP binding and hydrolysis with LPS transport to LptC remains unclear. We observed the conformational heterogeneity of LptB(2)FG and LptB(2)FGC in micelles and/or proteoliposomes using pulsed dipolar electron spin resonance spectroscopy. Additionally, we monitored LPS binding and release using laser-induced liquid bead ion desorption mass spectrometry. The beta-jellyroll domain of LptF stably interacts with the LptG and LptC beta-jellyrolls in both the apo and vanadate-trapped states. ATP binding at the cytoplasmic side is allosterically coupled to the selective opening of the periplasmic LptF beta-jellyroll domain. In LptB(2)FG, ATP binding closes the nucleotide binding domains, causing a collapse of the first lateral gate as observed in structures. However, the second lateral gate, which forms the putative entry site for LPS, exhibits a heterogeneous conformation. LptC binding limits the flexibility of this gate to two conformations, likely representing the helix of LptC as either released from or inserted into the transmembrane domains. Our results reveal the regulation of the LPS entry gate through the dynamic behavior of the LptC transmembrane helix, while its beta-jellyroll domain is anchored in the periplasm. This, combined with long-range ATP-dependent allosteric gating of the LptF beta-jellyroll domain, may ensure efficient and unidirectional transport of LPS across the periplasm.

With the emergence of large language models (LLM) there are possibilities to use this data for a wide range of applications requiring little specialized knowledge. To do this, it is necessary to organize and prepare this data to be used by these models. Therefore, in this work, an approach is presented for using data from health insurance in LLMs with the objective of predict hospitalizations. As a result, pre-trained models were generated in Portuguese and English with health insurance data that can be used in several applications. To prove the effectiveness of the models, tests were carried out to predict hospitalizations in general and due to stroke. For hospitalizations in general, F1-Score = 87.8 and AUC = 0.955 were achieved, and for hospitalizations due to stroke, the best model achieved F1-Score = 88.7 and AUC of 0.964. Considering the potential for use, the models were made available to the scientific community.

AB  - Melatonin regulates reproductive seasonality in sheep, and its concentration in the blood plasma is influenced by day length and age. It can act directly or by modulating antioxidant defense enzymes. The RsaI polymorphism (g.17355458 C > T) of the melatonin receptor MT1 gene (MTNR1A) has been associated with changes in ram semen and reproductive behavior. But it remains unknown how age and this polymorphism affect melatonin concentration and the activities of antioxidant defense enzymes in ram seminal plasma. The aim of this study was therefore to analyze the effect of the RsaI polymorphism on melatonin levels and the activities of catalase (CAT), glutathione reductase (GRD), and glutathione peroxidase (GPx) in the seminal plasma of young and adult rams carrying different MTNR1A genotypes. For this purpose, seminal plasma was obtained from 15 young (16-month-old) and 9 adult (5-year-old) genotyped rams, and melatonin levels and CAT, GRD, and GPx activities were assessed for a year. Adult rams had higher melatonin concentrations in their seminal plasma than young rams. Adult CC and CT rams had the highest melatonin levels during the reproductive season, whereas young rams showed no differences between seasons. Adult rams also showed higher levels of GRD and GPx activity during the reproductive season; however, young rams showed higher levels of GPx activity during the non-reproductive season than during the reproductive season. These findings highlight the importance of considering the animal age when analyzing ram seminal plasma and its components.

AB  - Coral reef and their ecological services of food production and shoreline protection are threatened by unsustainable use. To better understand their status, multiple approaches to estimating fisheries sustainability were compared, namely fisheries-independent stock biomass and recovery rates, fisheries-dependent landed catches, balanced harvest and gear use metrics, and fish length measurements. A community biomass recovery was established over a 45-year no-fishing stock recovery time series from seven fisheries reserves and compared to catch- and length-based estimates of sustainability. The logistic production rates (r = 0.09 +/- 0.06 95% confidence interval (CI)) and maximum equilibrium total biomass (similar to 150 +/- 30 tons/km(2)) indicated a broad range of potential maximum sustainable yields, with a likely range of 1.1 to 3.9 (95% CI; mean = 3.8) tons/km(2)/year. In contrast, the mean annual linear biomass growth rates in reserves were lower but less variable than logistic surplus production estimates, ranging from 2.1 to 3.5 (mean = 2.8 tons/km(2)/year). Realized catches at landing sites were lower still, ranging from 1.43 to 1.52 (mean = 1.48 +/- 0.2 tons/km(2)/y). Differences between production estimates and capture were largely attributable to changes in taxonomic composition and an imbalance in the estimated proportionality of production potential versus actual capture rates. Lost potential capture was likely due to differences in the vulnerability of taxa to fishing and a lack of compensatory increased production among fishing-resistant taxa. Large proportional losses of catch were measured among snappers, unicorn fish, sweetlips, goatfish, and soldierfish, while smaller proportional gains in the catch samples were found among resident herbivorous rabbitfish, parrotfish, and groupers. Many of these declining taxa have vulnerable schooling life histories that are likely to require special habitat and reserve characteristics. Evaluations of sustainability from length measurements found 17 or 7% of total and 12% of caught species had sample sizes minimally sufficient for evaluation (>30 individuals from 413 catches, 2284 captured individuals composed of 144 species) of length and spawning metrics of sustainability. Seven of these species met length-based and three met spawning potential ratio thresholds for sustainability. Consequently, length-based evaluations had poor species coverage and therefore we were unable to evaluate the sustainability of the larger fish community. Recommendations for future research include a better understanding of the consequences of variability in spillover and proportionality of production potential for sustainability. Management recommendations are to focus management on the recovery of species abundant in unfished locations but not contributing to fisheries yield.

AB  - Background Our previous analyses of cardiomyocyte single-nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNAseq) data from the hearts of fetal pigs and pigs that underwent apical resection surgery on postnatal day (P) 1 (ARP1), myocardial infarction (MI) surgery on P28 (MIP28), both ARP1 and MIP28 (ARP1MIP28), or controls (no surgical procedure or CTL) identified 10 cardiomyocyte subpopulations (clusters), one of which appeared to be primed to proliferate in response to MI. However, the clusters composed of primarily proliferating cardiomyocytes still contained noncycling cells, and we were unable to distinguish between cardiomyocytes in different phases of the cell cycle. Here, we improved the precision of our assessments by conducting similar analyses with snRNAseq data for only the 1646 genes included under the Gene Ontology term "cell cycle."Methods Two cardiac snRNAseq datasets, one from mice (GEO dataset number GSE130699) and one from pigs (GEO dataset number GSE185289), were evaluated via our cell-cycle-specific analytical pipeline. Cycling cells were identified via the co-expression of 5 proliferation markers (AURKB, MKI67, INCENP, CDCA8, and BIRC5).Results The cell-cycle-specific autoencoder (CSA) algorithm identified 7 cardiomyocyte clusters in mouse hearts (mCM1 and mCM3-mCM8), including one prominent cluster of cycling cardiomyocytes in animals that underwent MI or Sham surgery on P1. Five cardiomyocyte clusters (pCM1, pCM3-pCM6) were identified in pig hearts, 2 of which (pCM1 and pCM4) displayed evidence of cell cycle activity; pCM4 was found primarily in hearts from fetal pigs, while pCM1 comprised a small proportion of cardiomyocytes in both fetal hearts and hearts from ARP1MIP28 pigs during the 2 weeks after MI induction, but was nearly undetectable in all other experimental groups and at all other time points. Furthermore, pseudotime trajectory analysis of snRNAseq data from fetal pig cardiomyocytes identified a pathway that began at pCM3, passed through pCM2, and ended at pCM1, whereas pCM3 was enriched for the expression of a cell cycle activator that regulates the G1/S phase transition (cyclin D2), pCM2 was enriched for an S-phase regulator (CCNE2), and pCM1 was enriched for the expression of a gene that regulates the G2M phase transition and mitosis (cyclin B2). We also identified 4 transcription factors (E2F8, FOXM1, GLI3, and RAD51) that were more abundantly expressed in cardiomyocytes from regenerative mouse hearts than from nonregenerative mouse hearts, from the hearts of fetal pigs than from CTL pig hearts, and from ARP1MIP28 pig hearts than from MIP28 pig hearts during the 2 weeks after MI induction.Conclusions The CSA algorithm improved the precision of our assessments of cell cycle activity in cardiomyocyte subpopulations and enabled us to identify a trajectory across 3 clusters that appeared to track the onset and progression of cell cycle activity in cardiomyocytes from fetal pigs.

AB  - Intrauterine growth retardation (IUGR) causes oxidative stress in the skeletal muscle. Serine and selenoproteins are involved in anti-oxidative processes; however, whether IUGR affects selenium status and whether serine has beneficial effects remain elusive. Here, we investigated the effects of serine administration on selenium nutritional status and oxidative stress in the longissimus dorsi muscle of piglets with IUGR. Six newborn Min piglets having normal birth weight were administered saline, and 12 IUGR piglets were either administered saline or 0.8% serine. The results showed a lower selenium content in skeletal muscle in IUGR piglets, which was restored after serine administration. IUGR piglets showed a disturbed expression of genes encoding selenoproteins, with decreased expression of GPX2, GPX4, TXNRD1, and TXNRD3 and increased expression of DIO1, DIO2, SELF, SELM, SELP, and SELW. Notably, serine administration restored the expression levels of these genes. In accordance with the changes in gene expression, the activity of GPX, TXNRD, and DIO and the content of GSH and SELP were also altered, whereas serine administration restored their contents and activities. Moreover, we observed severe oxidative stress in the skeletal muscle of IUGR piglets, as indicated by decreased GSH content and increased MDA and PC content, whereas serine administration alleviated these changes. In conclusion, our results indicate that IUGR piglets showed a disturbed expression of genes encoding selenoproteins, accompanied by severe oxidative stress. Serine administration can improve selenium status, oxidative stress, and mitochondrial function in the longissimus dorsi muscle of piglets with IUGR. These results suggest that serine could potentially be used in the treatment of IUGR in piglets.

AB  - Post-stroke depression (PSD) is a common neuropsychiatric complication of stroke, which seriously affects the quality of life and prognosis of patients. Nevertheless, the pathogenesis of PSD remains unclear. In our study, a PSD rat model was established by chronic restraint stress (CRS) combined with middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO). Depressive and anxiety-like behaviors were tested, as well as Neuronal loss and Apoptosis. The expression of synapse and p38 MAPK signaling pathway-relevant proteins was detected. Our data indicated that CRS combined with MCAO could induce depression-like and anxiety-like behaviors, which led to neuronal damage, apoptosis, and cellular loss in the left parietal cortex and left hippocampus. Furthermore, CRS combined with MCAO decreased synaptic plasticity in the parietal cortex and left hippocampus. We found that CRS combined with MCAO had activated the p38 MAPK signaling pathway, and decreased the expression of pathway -related proteins MKK6 and MKK3. These results suggested that CRS combined with MCAO could lead to depression-like behavior via neuronal damage, apoptosis and reduced synaptic plasticity, which might be related to the activation of the p38 MAPK pathway. Therefore, it provides novel ideas for the research on the inter-vention and prevention mechanisms of PSD.

AB  - Rhinoncomimus latipes Korotyaev is a specialist biocontrol agent of mile-a-minute weed, Persicaria perfoliata (L.) H. Gross (Caryophyllales: Polygonaceae). Currently, R. latipes is released by hand where the presence of the weed is readily detected. However, the hand-release method is not applicable to weed patches spread in hard-to-access areas.This study was conducted to develop a spatially targeted biocontrol strategy by using an unmanned aircraft system (UAS, a.k.a. drone) for the detection of P perfoliata and aerial release of R. latipes. A ground survey was performed to locate P perfoliata patches and then a rotary-wing UAS was flown at 15 different altitudes to determine the detectability of R perfoliata patches. We developed an insect-release system including a pod that housed R. latipes for aerial release. The pod was 3D printed with biodegradable polyvinyl alcohol (PVA), and field tests were conducted to determine the ability of R. latipes to escape the pod and assess their post-release mortality and feeding ability. The results of this study showed that R perfoliata patches were readily detectable on the aerial images taken at <= 15 m above the ground. More than 98% of R. latipes (n = 118) successfully escaped from the pod within 24 h after aerial deployment.There were no significant (P> 0.05) effects of PVA exposure on the mortality and feeding ability of R. latipes. These results indicate that aerial detection of R perfoliata and deployment of R. latipes for spatially targeted biological control in hard-to-access areas can be accomplished using a rotary-wing UAS.

AB  - Understanding the damage mechanisms of typical ship structures under fatal underwater explosion loads is crucial for developing effective defensive measures. To provide references for enhancing the survivability of ships, this paper conducts analyses of the damage mechanisms of simplified hull girders (SHGs) using a combination of experimental and simulation methods, and proposes targeted structural improvements. Initially, two types of thin -walled rectangular closed -section SHGs are subjected to near -field underwater explosion experiments. Corresponding simulation models are established, and the validity of the computational results is verified. The progressive damage processes of SHGs in hogging and sagging are examined from a structural perspective. Furthermore, the thin -walled plate deformation transfer processes are analyzed. Finally, based on the analyzed damage mechanisms, targeted defensive structures for overall damage are designed. The study results show that enhancing the anti -deformation capability of the upper and lower edges of the side plates can effectively improve the overall bending resistance of the SHG.

AB  - In Colombia, the agricultural sector is a strategic point to generate development in the territories; but few governmental actions are implemented to achieve it, therefore, the objective of this research is to explain how the rural development of Vereda Vergel in Palmor-Ci & eacute;naga Magdalena, Colombia, has taken place based on the productive activities developed by its inhabitants under the criterion of governance of the community itself focused on its welfare. Methodologically, it is classified as a descriptive-explanatory field study with a qualitative approach, following the theoretical postulates of Alburquerque (2007) and Martinez de Anguita (2006). As a data collection technique, an interview script was applied to a focus group formed by farmers of the village. The main finding shows that there is no planning in the territory to promote the rural development generated within the community; however, the community diversifies its productive activity in fruit and bread crops such as lemon, mango, strawberry, coffee, yucca, yams; on the other hand, animal husbandry: chickens, ducks, pigs and cows, as well as beekeeping activities. In this sense, all the primary production and handcrafted processed products are only commercialized within the locality through ancestral barter systems, without giving space to commercialize to other territories of the department, because the mobility to the outskirts of the village is difficult to access due to the lack of paved roads, limiting or making null other forms of commercialization that would generate development in the territory. In this sense, it is concluded that there is leadership on the part of the communities to generate endogenous rural development, however, this does not transcend for lack of real commitment materialized by the municipal governance, but in spite of this, the community is food sovereign because they do not apply agro-extractivism, they only focus on the common food welfare of the community.

AB  - The two-spotted spider mite (TSSM), Tetranychus urticae Koch, and the Western flower thrips (WFT), Frankliniella occidentalis (Pergande), are pests commonly found in strawberry crops and pose significant challenges to production. However, the specific dynamics of their interactions with both healthy and infested plants remain poorly understood. In this study, we aimed to investigate the attraction of TSSM and WFT to volatile compounds emitted by healthy plants versus those of plants damaged by either or both species. Plant choice bioassays were conducted under varying conditions, including both healthy and those previously damaged by both TSSM and WFT. Additionally, behavioral tests were carried out using a Y-tube olfactometer, with extracts obtained via dynamic aeration from the plants in different states. The results revealed distinct preferences: TSSM exhibited a strong attraction to both healthy plants and those previously infested by their own specifics, whereas WFT showed a higher preference for healthy plants and those damaged by TSSM. Consistent behaviors were observed in the bioassays conducted with plant extracts. This research sheds light on the intricate interactions between strawberry plants and these pests and offers insights into the probable sequence of attack when both pests are present concurrently. The findings are valuable when implementing management strategies for these two pests in strawberry cultivation, considering the order in which they appear in the crop to help mitigate the damage caused by infestation in a more precise manner and order.

AB  - Perioperative neurocognitive disorder (PND) is a prevalent postoperative complication of the central nervous system (CNS) in elderly patients. Advanced age is an independent risk factor for developing PND. Microglia are essential immune cells in the CNS and play a critical role in neuroinflammation. The activation of microglia is closely linked to PND, although the precise mechanism remains unclear. Gamma oscillations (30-100 Hz) are associated with higher cognitive functions, including attention. The aim of this study was to investigate the mechanism by which microglial activation in PND disrupts gamma oscillations. The study utilized 18-month-old male C57BL/6 J mice and established a PND model through exploratory laparotomy. The results of both Contextual Fear Conditioning (CFC) and Morris Water Maze (MWM) experiments demonstrated that exploratory laparotomy could lead to hippocampus-dependent neurocognitive dysfunction in aged mice. We observed that exploratory laparotomy induced the transformation of microglia in the hippocampus of aged mice into an activated phenotype characterized by enlarged cell bodies and shortened processes. This transformation was accompanied by a significant increase in the expression levels of pro-inflammatory factors in hippocampal tissue, including tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), interleukin-1 beta (IL-1 beta) and interleukin-6 (IL-6). Specific depletion of microglia in aged mice, achieved by drinking water supplemented with the colony-stimulating factor 1 receptor (CSF1R)/c-Kit kinase inhibitor PLX3397 for seven consecutive days, resulted in a reduction of postoperative hippocampal neuroinflammation and a significant improvement in cognitive dysfunction. Similarly, perioperative inhibition of microglial activation with minocycline resulted in cognitive improvement. Additionally, we found that the expression levels of hippocampal parvalbumin (PV) and glutamate decarboxylase 67 (GAD67) were significantly reduced following exploratory laparotomy, which was accompanied by disturbed gamma oscillations. Depletion of microglia restored the expression levels of PV and GAD67 and significantly improved the disturbances in gamma oscillations. These findings suggest that the activation of hippocampal microglia and the associated neuroinflammatory response following surgery play a crucial role in PND. The underlying mechanism may be related to disturbed gamma oscillations and a reduction in the inhibitory function of PV interneurons.

AB  - Radiation-induced salivary gland injury (RISGI) is a common complication of radiotherapy in patients with head and neck cancer. Intragland expression of the Sonic Hedgehog (Shh) gene may partially rescue irradiation (IR)-induced hyposalivation by preserving salivary stem/progenitor cells and parasympathetic innervation, maintaining resident macrophages, and maintaining microvascular density. Previous studies have revealed that Ad-Rat Shh transduction through the salivary glands of miniature pigs can ameliorate oxidative stress-induced microvascular dysfunction after radiotherapy. Changes in the parotid salivary flow rate were analyzed, and the parotid tissue was collected at 5 and 20 weeks after IR. Changes in the Hedgehog pathway and vascular function-related markers (vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and CD31) and oxidative stress-related markers were detected via immunohistochemistry, immunofluorescence, and Western blotting. A stable Shh-overexpressing cell line was generated from human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) and exposed to 10 Gy X-ray irradiation, after which endothelial cell proliferation, senescence, apoptosis, and vascular function were evaluated. We found that intragland expression of the Shh gene efficiently alleviated IR-induced parotid gland injury in a miniature pig model. Our results indicate that the antioxidative stress and microvascular-protective effects of the Hh pathway are regulated by nuclear factor-erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2).

AB  - Sentiment analysis or Opinion Mining (OM) has gained signifi-cant interest among research communities and entrepreneurs in the recent years. Likewise, Machine Learning (ML) approaches is one of the interesting research domains that are highly helpful and are increasingly applied in several business domains. In this background, the current research paper focuses on the design of automated opinion mining model using Deer Hunting Opti-mization Algorithm (DHOA) with Fuzzy Neural Network (FNN) abbreviated as DHOA-FNN model. The proposed DHOA-FNN technique involves four different stages namely, preprocessing, feature extraction, classification, and parameter tuning. In addition to the above, the proposed DHOA-FNN model has two stages of feature extraction namely, Glove and N-gram approach. Moreover, FNN model is utilized as a classification model whereas GTOA is used for the optimization of parameters. The novelty of current work is that the GTOA is designed to tune the parameters of FNN model. An extensive range of simulations was carried out on the benchmark dataset and the results were examined under diverse measures. The experimental results highlighted the promising performance of DHOA-FNN model over recent state-of-the-art techniques with a maximum accuracy of 0.9928.

AB  - Salicylic acid (SA), a phytohormone, has been considered to be a key regulator mediating plant defence against pathogens. It is still vague how SA activates plant defence against herbivores such as chewing and sucking pests. Here, we used an aphid-susceptible wheat variety to investigate Sitobion avenae response to SA-induced wheat plants, and the effects of exogenous SA on some defence enzymes and phenolics in the plant immune system. In SA-treated wheat seedlings, intrinsic rate of natural increase (r(m)), fecundity and apterous rate of S. avenae were 0.25, 31.4 nymphs/female and 64.4%, respectively, and significantly lower than that in the controls (P < 0.05). Moreover, the increased activities of phenylalanine-ammonia-lyase, polyphenol oxidase (PPO) and peroxidase in the SA-induced seedlings obviously depended on the sampling time, whereas activities of catalase and 4-coumarate:CoA ligase were suppressed significantly at 24, 48 and 72 h in comparison with the control. Dynamic levels of p-coumaric acid at 96 h, caffeic acid at 24 and 72 h and chlorogenic acid at 24, 48 and 96 h in wheat plants were significantly upregulated by exogenous SA application. Nevertheless, only caffeic acid content was positively correlated with PPO activity in SA-treated wheat seedlings (P = 0.031). These findings indicate that exogenous SA significantly enhanced the defence of aphid-susceptible wheat variety against aphids by regulating the plant immune system, and may prove a potential application of SA in aphid control.

AB  - With the development of urbanization, more and more commercial buildings are built in cities, which is resulting in a large amount of building energy consumption that threatens the ecological environment of the earth. Lighting energy in commercial buildings occupies a large proportion of consumption, and improving the quality of natural daylight in commercial atriums is of great significance for building energy efficiency as well as improving indoor comfort. This paper proposes a method for optimizing the daylight quality of commercial atriums. Starting from the perspective of parametric design, this paper investigates the current status and theoretical research on the natural daylight of commercial atriums in cold regions, taking Jinan, China, as an example. Dynamic daylight and glare simulations were performed using Rhino + Grasshopper and Ladybug + Honeybee for every design parameter in the system, followed by correlation analysis and multiple linear regression analysis using SPSS to determine the degree of influence of each design parameter on the daylight quality of the atrium. Based on the results of the above analysis, the multi-objective optimization plug-in Octopus is used to find the combination of design parameters that can achieve the best indoor daylight. The results show that among a total of fourteen atrium design parameters, seven of them are significantly correlated with atrium daylight, and after regression analysis, it is found that the atrium design parameters affect the atrium daylight and glare in the following order: Skylight VT, Skylight ratio, Atrium inclination, Fabric coverage, Fabric VT, Wall reflectivity, Roof reflectivity. The optimal design parameters for commercial atrium daylight quality are obtained according to the Pareto front solution set, which provides some reference and ideas for improving the optimization of commercial atrium daylight in cold regions of China.

AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD) is associated with amyloid-beta (A beta) accumulation that might be hindered by autophagy. There are two ways to induce autophagy: through mTOR-dependent and mTOR-independent pathways (here, by means of rapamycin and trehalose, respectively). The aim of this study was to evaluate the contribution of these pathways and their combination to the treatment of experimental AD. Mice were injected bilaterally intracerebroventricularly with an A beta fragment (25-35) to set up an AD model. Treatment with rapamycin (10 mg/kg, every other day), trehalose consumption with drinking water (2 mg/mL, ad libitum), or their combination started 2 days after the surgery and lasted for 2 weeks. Open-field, plus-maze, and passive avoidance tests were used for behavioral phenotyping. Neuronal density, A beta accumulation, and the expression of autophagy marker LC3-II and neuroinflammatory marker IBA1 were measured in the frontal cortex and hippocampus. mRNA levels of autophagy genes (Atg8, Becn1, and Park2) were assessed in the hippocampus. Trehalose but not rapamycin caused pronounced prolonged autophagy induction and transcriptional activation of autophagy genes. Both drugs effectively prevented A beta deposition and microglia activation. Autophagy inhibitor 3-methyladenine significantly attenuated autophagy activation and disturbed the effect of the inducers on A beta load. The inducers substantially reversed behavioral and neuronal deficits in A beta-injected mice. In many cases, the best outcomes were achieved with the combined treatment. Thus, trehalose alone or combined autophagy activation by the two inducers may be a promising treatment approach to AD-like neurodegeneration. Some aspects of interaction between mTORdependent and mTOR-independent pathways of autophagy are discussed.

AB  - Feral swine (FS) (Sus scrofa) are an invasive species that has spread widely across the southern United States, including the West Gulf region. With their rapidly increasing population, they have caused severe damage to landowners. To better understand private landowners' knowledge and attitudes toward FS, we conducted a mail survey in the West Gulf region including Arkansas, Louisiana, and East Texas in 2021. The results indicated that the majority of landowners are familiar with, have overall negative opinions of, and are concerned about the presence and future population growth of FS in this region. Nearly 70% of the private landowners surveyed supported stricter FS control regulations. Logistic regression results further revealed that landowners' supportiveness for FS control regulations is associated with their perceived FS-induced economic damage and ownership characteristics (i.e., age and tenure). These findings shed new light on private landowners' perspectives on FS invasions and control regulations, aiding in developing and implementing FS control/management policies and programs in the West Gulf region and beyond.

AB  - Hoffmann's two-toed sloths (Choloepus hoffmanni) are unique animals popular in zoological settings. The role of vitamin D in the maintenance of calcium homeostasis in this species is unexplored, although disorders of calcium homeostasis have been reported in managed sloths, including urolithiasis and soft tissue mineralization. This study assessed cutaneous concentrations of 7-dehydrocholesterol (7-DHC) in nine indoor-housed Hoffmann's two-toed sloths, as a means of evaluating the potential for cutaneous photobiosynthesis of vitamin D-3. Samples were obtained from both abdominal and lumbar regions of the skin to assess for regional variation in 7-DHC concentration. The average concentration of 7-DHC in the sloth skin was low (0.197 +/- 0.02 nmol/cm(2)). Location had a significant effect on 7-DHC level only when concentrations were expressed based on the wet weight of the sample (ng/g), but levels were similar when values were normalized to biopsy surface area (nmol/cm(2)).

   Growth is an important factor that drives animal production, and it can be manipulated through maternal nutrition. In ruminants, previous studies suggested that maternal nutrition during late gestation with polyunsaturated fatty acids altered growth, energy metabolism, muscle development, and body composition of the offspring. This study investigates the effect of supplementing different sources of fatty acids during late gestation on offspring energy metabolism and growth during the finishing period. Maternal fatty acid supplementation during late gestation modified growth, insulin sensitivity, and hot carcass weight in lambs; these changes depended on the unsaturation degree of the fatty acid supplement and lamb sex. Hence, fatty acid supplementation of the gestating ewe can potentially have a lifelong impact on offspring's growth performance and metabolism, and could be used as a possible management alternative to enhanced offspring productivity.
   Lambs born from dams supplemented with different sources of fatty acids (FA) during late gestation have a different growth rate and plasma glucose concentration. The main objectives of this experiment were to evaluate the effect of supplementing different sources of FA during late gestation on offspring plasma metabolite concentrations, growth, and on a glucose tolerance test (GTT) during the finishing phase. Fifty-four lambs (18 pens, 3 lambs/pen) were born from ewes supplemented during late gestation with one of three treatments: (1) no FA (NF); (2) a source of monounsaturated FA (PDS, 1.01% of Ca salts); or (3) a source of eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) (EDS, 1.01% of Ca salts containing). At birth (day 0), supplementation ceased, and all ewes and lambs were placed in a common pen. On day 60, lambs were weaned, grouped by sex, blocked by body weight (BW), and placed on a common finishing diet for 54 days (FP). One lamb per pen was used for the GTT after the FP. There was a tendency for FA x Sex x Day interaction (p = 0.08) on lamb growth during the finishing period, with PDS females being heavier than PDS males, while EDS males were heavier than EDS females at day 60. There was a tendency for FA x Sex interaction (p = 0.06) for plasma insulin concentration for the GTT. Plasma insulin concentration of wethers increased as FA unsaturation degree increased during the GTT; the opposite happened with the plasma insulin concentration of female lambs. In conclusion, FA supplementation during late gestation tended to modified growth and insulin response to a GTT; these changes differed with the degree of FA unsaturation of the supplement and lamb sex.

AB  - Granulosa cell apoptosis induced by oxidative stress is an important cause of follicular atresia. Our previous studies found that Periplaneta americana peptide (PAP) decreased H2O2-induced apoptosis of pig-ovary granulosa cells (PGCs) through FoxO1. The aim of this study is to investigate the signaling pathways involved in PAP resistance against H2O2-induced apoptosis of PGCs. PGCs obtained from the follicles of non-estrous Duroc x Landrace x Yorkshire gilts (5 months old, 50-55 kg) were treated with H2O2 and PAP, or together with inhibitors against PI3K and JNK, and then collected for ROS levels and SOD activities detection, TUNEL staining, qRT-PCR, western blotting, immunofluorescence or coimmunoprecipitation. Results showed that the increased ROS levels and decreased activities of SOD caused by H2O2 stimulation were reversed by PAP. Additionally, PAP downregulated the differential abundance of mRNA of Bax and FasL, thus inhibiting H2O2-induced apoptosis of PGCs. PAP significantly reduces p-JNK expression and increases the p-FoxO1/FoxO1 expression ratio, thereby decreasing caspase-3 expression and cell apoptosis in H2O2-induced PGCs. PAP promotes the combination of FoxO1 with the 14-3-3 protein, increases FoxO1 translocation to the cytoplasm, and decreases FoxO1 acetylation. Therefore, PAP regulates FoxO1 expression through the JNK/FoxO1 signaling pathway and effects the translocation of FoxO1 to the cytoplasm by the FoxO1 interaction with 14-3-3, enabling reversal of the H2O2-induced apoptosis of PGCs. Acetylation of FoxO1 is also involved in the antiapoptotic effect of PAP. (c) 2022 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Pig production through crossbreeding methods is a pillar of the swine industry; however, research on the fertilization ability of male pigs in crossbreeds is lacking. Therefore, this study investigated the effects of Duroc sperm (DS) and Landrace sperm (LS) on fertility in Yorkshire x Landrace x Duroc (YLD) oocytes. Sperm were collected from the Duroc and Landrace species, and sperm characteristics, viability, and acrosome reactions were analyzed using flow cytometry. Oocytes were collected from YLD ovaries, and the fertility of DS and LS was determined using in vitro fertilization (IVF). Reactive oxygen species (ROS) and antioxidative abilities were analyzed using H2DCFDA and a Cell Tracker Red assay. Pluripotency (OCT4, SOX2, and NANOG), antioxidative (SOD1, SOD2, CAT, and GPx1), apoptotic (Bax and Bcl-2), and cell cycle-related (Cdc2 and CCNB1) genes were detected using quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) in oocytes fertilized with sperm. The results showed no significant difference in viability or acrosome reaction between DS and LS. ROS levels were significantly lower in the LS group than in the DS group, whereas glutathione (GSH) levels in the embryo did not significantly differ between the DS and LS groups. The OCT4, GPx1, and Cdc2 mRNA expression levels were significantly higher in the LS than DS groups. Blastocyst formation was significantly higher in the LS than DS groups. ROS levels were reduced, and blastocyte formation was increased in LS-obtained embryos. In conclusion, these results provide a fundamental understanding of using Landrace semen in the three-way crossbreeding of YLD pigs.

AB  - This research investigated the development patterns, reproduction and predatory potential of Apertochrysa astur Banks (Neuroptera: Chrysopidae) fed on nymphs of Aphis gossypii raised on Gossypium hirsutum L. (cotton) and Hibiscus sabdariffa L. (mesta). The predator exhibited higher survival rates and shorter developmental durations when fed aphids reared on cotton rather than those reared on mesta. The population growth parameters, including the intrinsic rate of increase (r), finite rate of increase (lambda) and net reproductive rate (R0), were also greater when fed on cotton aphids (lambda = 1.1028 day-1; R0 = 134.94 offsprings; r = 0.0978 day-1), demonstrating the better suitability of cotton as a host plant. Compared with mesta aphids (C0 = 432 aphids/individual), A. astur reared on cotton aphids (C0 = 475.51 aphids/individual) had higher predation rates. Population and predation projections showed faster growth and higher consumption efficiency for A. astur fed on cotton aphids compared to mesta aphids. These findings emphasize the critical role of prey quality and host plant suitability in enhancing the biological control potential of the generalist predator A. astur. This study underscores the importance of understanding plant-prey-predator interactions to develop effective and sustainable pest management strategies in agroecosystems.

   The amount and fatty acid composition of intramuscular fat are important features for the qualitative characteristics of processed and fresh meat products, but the knowledge of the key molecular drivers controlling these traits is still scant. To this aim, the present study investigated the co-expression networks of genes related to variations in the major fatty acids deposited in pig Semimembranosus muscle. Palmitic and palmitoleic acid contents were associated with a downregulation of genes involved in autophagy, mitochondrial fusion, and mitochondrial activity, suggesting that the deposition of these fatty acids may be enhanced in muscles with a reduced mitochondrial function. A higher proportion of oleic acid and a reduction in the percentages of n-6 and n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids were related to changes in the mRNA levels of genes involved in Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase (MAPK) signaling. The obtained results indicated gene expression networks and new candidate genes associated with the studied traits. Further studies are needed to confirm our results and identify in the discussed genes molecular markers for future selection schemes aimed at improving pork nutritional and technological quality. Furthermore, as pigs are considered reliable animal models for several human conditions, the obtained results may also be of interest for improving the knowledge of the molecular pathways associated with obesity and diabetes.
   To date, high-throughput technology such as RNA-sequencing has been successfully applied in livestock sciences to investigate molecular networks involved in complex traits, such as meat quality. Pork quality depends on several organoleptic, technological, and nutritional characteristics, and it is also influenced by the fatty acid (FA) composition of intramuscular fat (IMF). To explore the molecular networks associated with different IMF FA compositions, the Semimembranosus muscle (SM) from two groups of Italian Large White (ILW) heavy pigs divergent for SM IMF content was investigated using transcriptome analysis. After alignment and normalization, the obtained gene counts were used to perform the Weighted Correlation Network Analysis (WGCNA package in R environment). Palmitic and palmitoleic contents showed association with the same gene modules, comprising genes significantly enriched in autophagy, mitochondrial fusion, and mitochondrial activity. Among the key genes related to these FAs, we found TEAD4, a gene regulating mitochondrial activity that seems to be a promising candidate for further studies. On the other hand, the genes comprised in the modules associated with the IMF contents of oleic, n-6, and n-3 polyunsaturated FAs (PUFAs) were significantly enriched in Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase (MAPK) signaling, in agreement with previous studies suggesting that several MAPK players may have a primary role in regulating lipid deposition. These results give an insight into the molecular cascade associated with different IMF FA composition in ILW heavy pigs. Further studies are needed to validate the results and confirm whether some of the identified key genes may be effective candidates for pork quality.

AB  - Using homegrown forage instead of imported alfalfa hay (AH) improves animal productivity and reduces feed costs, but the benefits of feeding high-quality common vetch hay (CVH) to lambs are not clear. This study aimed to determine the effect of replacing alfalfa hay with common vetch hay on growth performance, rumen fermentation, and rumen microbiota of fattening lambs. The results showed that substitution of AH by CVH in ruminant diets result in improvements in fattening performance and economic efficiency and a reduction in the methane produced per unit of ADG, thereby resulting in advantageous in decreasing reliance on imported AH. The aim of this study was to determine whether the inclusion of 40% of common vetch (CV) hay as a feed ingredient in place of alfalfa hay (AH) would improve performance and ruminal fermentation and microbiota in fattening lambs. Twenty lambs were equally divided into two groups: control group (fed 40% AH with 20% rice straw) and CV group (fed 40% CV hay with 20% rice straw). Concerning hay quality, CV hay had greater in vitro digestibility of dry matter and neutral detergent fiber (p < 0.05) than AH. Lambs fed the CV diet had a higher average daily gain (ADG) and efficiency of feed and economy than lambs fed the control group. The NH3-N content and estimated methane produced per unit of ADG of the CV diet group were significantly lower (p < 0.05) than control group. Multiple differential microbial genera were identified, with Prevotella being the most dominant genus and a tendency towards higher (p = 0.095) in lambs offered CV diet. The higher Ruminococcus abundance (p < 0.05) was found in animals of the CV group compared to the control group. In summary, CV can be incorporated into lamb diets as a low-cost forage alternative to AH to improve feed efficiency and animal performance and to reduce methane produced per unit of ADG.

AB  - Gaseous nitrous acid (HONO) is a critical contributor to daytime hydroxyl radical in the troposphere. Livestock farming has been recognized as an overlooked HONO source, but the lack of detailed flux measurements from livestock and poultry wastes would cause uncertainties in modeling its environmental impacts. Here, based on field flux measurements and laboratory experiments, we observed substantial HONO emissions from the composting of swine feces and chicken manure in the warm season, which might be mainly attributed to nitrification process in livestock and poultry wastes. The HONO emission from chicken manure was found to be much higher than that from swine feces, and the higher NH3 emission but lower N2 O and NO emissions from chicken manure were also observed. Considering that the interaction among these nitrogen species during nitrification process, the obviously lower HONO emission from swine feces was likely to be explained by the lack of the total ammonia nitrogen and H+ donors in swine feces. Temperature is also a key factor that influences the HONO emission from livestock wastes. In addition, the total HONO emission

AB  - Hepatitis E is a liver disease caused by the hepatitis E virus (HEV), primarily transmitted through contaminated water or food. There are four different HEV genotypes in humans, with genotypes 1 and 2 being the most widespread. Genotypes 3 and 4 are found in animals and can also infect humans. Genotype 4 is prevalent in Asia, mainly in China. In Italy, only one outbreak of HEV-4 has been documented, which occurred in 2011, involving five patients. In 2013, HEV G4 was also detected in a pig farm. Since then, no further evidence of HEV genotype 4 has been found in the country. This study describes the first detection of HEV genotype 4, subtype d, in wastewater in central Italy, despite a lack of any clinical case reported in the area. By using a multiplex PCR protocol and two sequencing strategies, Illumina and ONT, the virus's complete genome was sequenced and characterized as subtype 4d. These findings shed light on the potential of environmental surveillance for in-fectious agents to improve our understanding of epidemiology and support public health efforts.

AB  - Rapid and accurate measurements of eye muscle area and backfat thickness in breeding pigs is crucial for improving breeding traits. Within reasonable ranges, these traits significantly influence the number of piglets born, their birth weights, and survival rates. Traditional detection methods are time-consuming and heavily reliant on operational expertise. While B-mode ultrasound is widely used as a non-invasive tool for measuring backfat thickness and eye muscle area, its efficiency and precision are limited by dependence on the operator. To address these issues, this study introduces the BEGV2-UNet model, an innovative UNet network based on reconstructing down-sampling and up-sampling paths, incorporating GhostModuleV2, and incorporating a large kernel attention mechanism to better capture the boundaries and positions of backfat and eye muscle regions. The model can be used to segment these regions in breeding pigs and improve the loss function for accelerate convergence while remedying the low precision caused by class imbalance. Using a dataset of ultrasound images, the BEGV2-UNet model achieved an MIoU of 96.18 % and MPA of 98.12 %, with model size reduced to 18.69 MB and strong inference accuracy. We calculated the backfat thickness and eye muscle area using the model to achieve R2 values of 0.98 and 0.96, respectively. This study highlights the significant advantages of BEGV2-UNet in terms of image segmentation accuracy and lightweight design.

AB  - Recently, as is evident with the COVID-19 pandemic, virus-containing aerosols can rapidly spread worldwide. As a consequence, filtering facepieces (FFP) are essential tools to protect against airborne viral particles. Incorrect donning and doffing of masks and a lack of hand-hygiene cause contagion by the wearers' own hands. This study aimed to prove that hypertonic saline effectively reduces the infectious viral load on treated masks. Therefore, a hypertonic salt solution ' s protective effect on surgical masks was investigated, specifically analyzing the infectivity of aerosolized Alphacoronavirus 1 in pigs (Transmissible Gastroenteritis Virus (TGEV)). Uncoated and hypertonic salt pre-coated FFPs were sprayed with TGEV. After drying, a defined part of the mask was rinsed with the medium, and the eluent was used for the infection of a porcine testicular cell line. Additionally, airborne microorganisms ' long-term infectivity of sodium-chloride in phosphate-buffered saline comprising 5% saccharose was investigated. In the results from an initial Median Tissue Culture Infectious Dose, infection rate of TGEV was minimally reduced by untreated FFP. In contrast, this could be reduced by a factor of 10(4) if FFPs were treated with hypertonic salt solutions. Airborne pathogens did not contaminate the growth medium if salt concentrations exceeded 5%. We conclude that hypertonic saline is a vital tool for anti-virus protection, exponentially improving the impact of FFPs.

AB  - In Slovakia, maize silage is preferred as the input material for biogas production whereas it should be used primarily as feed for cattle. The purpose of this paper is to point out the possibilities of using the fast-growing giant reed Arundo donax L. that is not used as fodder and can be grown on low-quality agricultural land. The experimental stand of A. donax L. used in the study provided a yield of 60.8 t ha(-1) of fresh biomass in the third year of cultivation. Part of the biomass produced was ensiled as maize and later the silage was co-fermented with cattle excrements and pig slurry. The resulting biogas can be used as fuel for internal combustion engines. The average content of CH4 and CO2 is 52% and 44%, respectively. These values are very similar to the composition of maize silage biogas. The average hydrogen sulphide content in the biogas from A. donax L. was 730 ppm. The disadvantage is that the biogas production is 46% lower compared to maize silage.

AB  - Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a common psychiatric disorder characterized by significant mood disturbances and cognitive impairments. Chronic stress, particularly social defeat stress, plays a crucial role in the etiology of depression, with oxidative stress being a pivotal factor in its pathophysiology. Consequently, identifying effective strategies to mitigate oxidative stress and prevent the progression of depression is of paramount importance. Agomelatine, an atypical antidepressant with melatonergic and serotonergic properties, has shown promise in treating MDD due to its unique mechanisms of action. In this study, we aimed to investigate whether agomelatine could ameliorate behavioral deficits in a chronic social defeat stress (CSDS) mouse model. CSDS mice were administered agomelatine (50 mg/kg, intraperitoneally) and exhibited significant reductions in both anxiety-like and depressive-like behaviors in behavioral tests. Further analysis revealed that agomelatine treatment effectively reduced oxidative damage in the hippocampus of CSDS mice. Additionally, agomelatine attenuated mitochondrial dysfunction and restored synaptic plasticity, as evidenced by an increased density of excitatory synapses and enhanced neuronal activity. These findings suggest that agomelatine may exert therapeutic effects by reducing oxidative stress, preserving mitochondrial function, and enhancing synaptic plasticity, providing new insights into its potential as a treatment for chronic social defeat stress-induced depression.

AB  - Here, we aimed to determine the protective effects of tea leaf extract (TLE) (Camellia sinensis) against cypermethrin (CMN)-induced toxicity in gill and liver of rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss). CMN exposure led to increase in aspartate aminotransferase (AST), serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and malondialdehyde (MDA) levels, and reduction in superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT) activities, glutathione (GSH), total immunoglobulin (T. Ig), and white blood cell (WBC) levels. Moreover, CMN exposure led to degeneration, steatosis, and necrosis in liver hepatocytes as well as hyperemia and inflammation in the liver and caused degeneration, desquamation, necrosis and adhesion in the gill epithelium. Additionally, expression levels of 8-hydroxy-2-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG) and Caspase 3 were severe in the liver and gill tissues. However, both 50 and 100 mg doses of TLE had protective effects against CMN-induced toxicity in all the above parameters. As a result, we have shown that 100 mg of tea leaf extract is more effective in preventing harmful effects on blood biochemistry (AST and ALT), oxidative stress, immunity, apoptosis, histopathology and DNA damage caused by CMN.

Thirty animals were randomly divided into five groups of six animals, each receiving a physiological solution, clenbuterol and the infusion extract at doses of 0.01 (MVI 1%), 0.1 (MVI 10%) and 0.2 (MVI 20%) mg kg-1 for 28 days. Biochemical parameters and the liquid chromatographic-electrospray ionization-mass spectrometric (LC-ESI-MS) chemical profiles of the infusion extract and animal serum were studied. RESULTS: The doses MVI 1 and 10% led to weight gain higher than the controls. No significant changes were noted in the biochemical parameters including erythrocytes, hemoglobin, hematocrit, mean corpuscular volume and others. Evaluation of enzymatic levels in blood revealed no significant changes. LC-ESI-MS data of MVI showed the presence of 34 secondary metabolites, and successive chromatographic purification of MVI yielded marrubiin and apigenin as major components. LC-ESI-MS data of animal serum showed the presence of a diterpene, a flavonoid and diverse cholic acid derivatives. CONCLUSION: Results indicated the doses MVI 1 and 10% promote weight gain with no significant alterations in blood biochemicals, and liver and kidney function. (c) 2024 Society of Chemical Industry.

AB  - Considerable advancements have recently been achieved in porcine somatic cell nuclear transfer (SCNT), but the efficiency remains low. Donor cell size might play an important role in SCNT, but its effects in pigs remain unclear. This study aimed to evaluate the efficiency of porcine SCNT by selecting donor cells of suitable size. Porcine fetal fibroblasts (PFFs) were divided into three groups, group S (small, d <= 13 mu m), group M (medium, 13 mu m<d <= 18 mu m), and group L (large, d > 18 mu m), and their biological characteristics were analyzed. Next, SCNT was performed using PFFs of different sizes to evaluate the developmental potential of reconstructed embryos. The data showed that PFFs in groups S, M and L accounted for 17.5%, 47.7% and 34.8% of cells, respectively. Morphologically, cells in group S exhibited clear and regular cell membranes and nuclei, whereas cells in groups M and L displayed varying degrees of cell membrane protuberance, karyo-pyknosis, autophagy and mitochondrial abnormalities. In addition, the growth status and proliferation capabilities of cells in group S were significantly better than those of group M and group L. The percentage of cells at G0/G1 in group S and M were significantly greater than group L. The senescence rate of group S was lower than group M and group L. The apoptosis rate of group S was significantly lower than that of group L but comparable to that of group M . The cleavage rate of group S was also significantly greater than that of group M but comparable to that of group L . The blastocyst rate of group S was significantly greater than that of group M and group L. The blastocyst cell numbers of group S were also significantly greater than those of group M and group L. These findings suggested that small PFFs with a diameter of less than 13 mu m are more suitable donor cells for SCNT in pigs.

AB  - Animal-borne aversive geofencing devices (AGDs, or satellite-linked shock collars) are commercially available and used on livestock to restrict their movement within a virtual boundary. This technology has potential application as a human-wildlife conflict mitigation tool, where problem animals might be conditioned to avoid human-dominated habitats by associating an audio warning with a subsequent electric shock, which is delivered if the audio warning is ignored. Ensuring that high standards of animal welfare are maintained when imple-menting such tools is important for acquiring manager and community acceptance of such approaches. We conducted two pilot experiments with eight captive Asian elephants using mild electric shocks from a modified dog-training collar fitted around the neck, as part of an ongoing effort to develop AGDs suitable for mitigating human-elephant conflict. As part of these experiments, we assessed elephants' behavioural and physiological stress before, during and after the experiments. During the experiments elephants wore collars for up to nine consecutive days and received a small number of electric shocks on 1-3 consecutive days. Bootstrapped principal component analysis showed that daily activity budgets of individual elephants on experiment days were not different from the pre-experiment days. Generalised linear mixed-effects model (GLMM) showed that anxiety/ stress behaviours increased on the first day of acclimatising to the collar and on testing days (i.e. days they received shocks) of the first experiment, but not during the second experiment relative to pre-experiment days. Analysis of faecal cortisol metabolite (FCM) concentrations using GLMM showed that FCM concentrations were higher in samples collected-24 hrs and-48 hrs after testing days compared to baseline levels as expected given the lag time for excretion of cortisol metabolites. These elevated anxiety/stress behaviours and FCM concen-trations returned to baseline levels shortly after the experiment. Therefore, we conclude that AGDs did not produce lasting behavioural or physiological stress effects in elephants during this short-term study but recommend further studies with a larger sample of elephants to confirm the transferability of these findings.

AB  - The study investigates the influence of drying methods on the quality of Andropogon tectorum (Gamba grass) and Pennisetum puerperium (Elephant grass) forage grasses used for hay making in Africa. The aim is to estab-lish the best drying conditions for the grasses for forage conservation in Africa and the possible scaling up of the drying process for large-scale bale drying applications. Traditional sun drying, hot air oven and microwave drying methods were used. The average moisture diffusivity considering shrinkage for the two grasses varied from 5.71 x 10- 09 to 2.67 x 10 - 08 m 2 /s at 40-70 degrees C while for microwave drying varied from 9.06 x 10- 6 to 1.08 x 10 - 05 W/g at 180 -720 W. The activation energy ranged from 31.068 to 44.06 kJ/mol. Drying methods adopted significantly affected the nutrient content, colour, and rehydration ratio of the leaves. The optimization of crude fibre (%) yielded, a dry matter of 92.4%, drying temperature of 70 degrees C and crude fibre of 51.7%. In con-trast optimization of drying in microwave gave drying power level of 360 W, 47.6% of crude fibre and 93.13% dry matter. Optimization of crude protein yielded a drying temperature, of 28.5 degrees C, dry matter of 39.8%, and crude protein of 10.8%. Similarly, crude protein of 11.03% was obtained at a drying power level of 59.5 W, with the dry matter of 49.50% value. All the optimization constraints set for maximizing nutrient content showed that crude fibre has the highest value.

AB  - Background: While calcium is known to play a crucial role in mammalian sperm physiology, how it flows in and out of the male gamete is not completely understood. Herein, we investigated the involvement of Na+/Ca2+ exchangers (NCX) in mammalian sperm capacitation. Using the pig as an animal model, we first confirmed the presence of NCX1 and NCX2 isoforms in the sperm midpiece. Next, we partially or totally blocked Ca2+ outflux (forward transport) via NCX1/NCX2 with different concentrations of SEA0400 (2-[4-[(2,5-difluorophenyl)methoxy]phenoxy]-5-ethoxyaniline; 0, 0.5, 5 and 50 mu M) and Ca2+ influx (reverse transport) with SN6 (ethyl 2-[[4-[(4-nitrophenyl)methoxy]phenyl]methyl]-1,3-thiazolidine-4-carboxylate; 0, 0.3, 3 or 30 mu M). Sperm were incubated under capacitating conditions for 180 min; after 120 min, progesterone was added to induce the acrosome reaction. At 0, 60, 120, 130, and 180 min, sperm motility, membrane lipid disorder, acrosome integrity, mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP), tyrosine phosphorylation of sperm proteins, and intracellular levels of Ca2+, reactive oxygen species (ROS) and superoxides were evaluated. Results: Partial and complete blockage of Ca2+ outflux and influx via NCX induced a significant reduction of sperm motility after progesterone addition. Early alterations on sperm kinematics were also observed, the effects being more obvious in totally blocked than in partially blocked samples. Decreased sperm motility and kinematics were related to both defective tyrosine phosphorylation and mitochondrial activity, the latter being associated to diminished MMP and ROS levels. As NCX blockage did not affect the lipid disorder of plasma membrane, the impaired acrosome integrity could result from reduced tyrosine phosphorylation. Conclusions: Inhibition of outflux and influx of Ca2+ triggered similar effects, thus indicating that both forward and reverse Ca2+ transport through NCX exchangers are essential for sperm capacitation.

AB  - Phoenixin is a neuropeptide with a well-established role in the central regulation of reproductive processes; however, knowledge regarding its role in the ovary is limited. One of the main active phoenixin isoforms is phoenixin-14, which acts through G protein-coupled receptor 173. Our research hypothesis was that phoenixin-14 is expressed in porcine corpus luteum and exerts luteotropic action by affecting the endocrine function of luteal cells through G protein-coupled receptor 173 and protein kinase signaling. Luteal cells were cultured to investigate the effect of phoenixin-14 (1-1000 nM) on endocrine function. We showed that phoenixin-14 and G protein-coupled receptor 173 are produced locally in porcine corpus luteum and their levels change during the estrous cycle. We detected phoenixin-14 immunostaining in the cytoplasm and G protein-coupled receptor 173 in the cell membrane. Plasma phoenixin levels were highest during the early luteal phase. Interestingly, insulin, luteinizing hormone, progesterone, and prostaglandins decreased phoenixin-14 levels in luteal cells. Phoenixin-14 increased progesterone, estradiol, and prostaglandin E2 secretion, but decreased prostaglandin F2 alpha, upregulated the expression of steroidogenic enzymes, and downregulated receptors for luteinizing hormone and prostaglandin. Also, phoenixin-14 increased the expression of G protein-coupled receptor 173 and the phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2, protein kinase B, inhibited the phosphorylation of protein kinase A, and had mixed effect on AMP-activated protein kinase alpha and protein kinase C. G protein-coupled receptor 173 and extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 mediated the effect of phoenixin-14 on endocrine function of luteal cells. Our results suggest that phoenixin is produced by porcine luteal cells and can be a new regulator of their function.

AB  - Snakebites are a problem due to the increasing number of deaths and permanent disabilities. There is currently a shortage of antidotes for snakebite. The existing antibody antidote, produced from horse/sheep plasma/sera is expensive, species-dependent, and causes fatal side effects. Therefore, it is of interest use of natural flavonoid named gedunin from the Azadirachta indica (Neem) plant species to combat snakebites. Thus, we show the molecular docking analysis of gedunin (C26H31N2O6F) with enzymes (common in snake species) such as 5-nucleotidase, acetyl cholinesterase, L-aao, metalloproteinase, serine, thrombin and phospholipase A2. The modified gedunin in the enzyme pocket showed improved pharmacological properties for further consideration in combating snakebites.

AB  - Obesity has become a global epidemic with major implications for fertility. In particular, obesity can trigger follicular atresia by initiating the apoptosis of granulosa cells (GCs). Emerging evidence suggests that this process may be closely linked to the dysregulation of cellular autophagy. Metformin has been shown to restore autophagic flux and mitigate obesity-related cellular dysfunction in mice; however, the ability of metformin to alleviate lipid overload-induced damage in goat granulosa cells has yet to be investigated. Analyses showed that 400 mu M palmitic acid (PA) significantly increased lipid accumulation and reduced cell viability (P < 0.05) in goat granulosa cells. Furthermore, PA impaired mitochondrial function, associated with a significant increase in the populations of both early and late apoptotic cells (P < 0.05). However, treatment with 5 mu M metformin (MET) under PA exposure significantly enhanced the viability of GCs and reduced the expression levels of pro-apoptotic BAX (P < 0.05). Next, we evaluated the effect of MET on cellular autophagy and found that MET treatment significantly downregulated the expression levels of phosphorylated mTORC1 (Ser2448), LC3B, and P62 while upregulating the expression levels of ULK1 in PA-treated GCs (P < 0.05). Our findings indicate that metformin improved palmitate-induced granulosa cell dysfunction by activating ULK1-mediated autophagy. Our findings will advance our understanding of reproductive dysfunction in obese ruminants, and provide a theoretical foundation for improving fertility in obese mammals.

AB  - Ethnopharmacological relevance: Chromolaena odorata (L.) R.M. King & H. Rob, a perennial herb, has been traditionally utilized as a herbal remedy for treating leech bites, soft tissue wounds, burn wounds, skin infections, and dento-alveolitis in tropical and subtropical regions. Aim of the study: The present study was to analyze the active fraction of C. odorata ethanol extract and investigate its hemostatic, anti-inflammatory, wound healing, and antimicrobial properties. Additionally, the safety of the active fraction as an external preparation was assessed through skin irritation and allergy tests. Materials and methods: The leaves and stems of C. odorata were initially extracted with ethanol, followed by purification through AB-8 macroporous adsorption resin column chromatography to yield different fractions. These fractions were then screened for hemostatic activity in mice and rabbits to identify the active fraction. Subsequently, the hemostatic effect of the active fraction was assessed through the bleeding time of the rabbit ear artery in vivo and the coagulant time of rabbit blood in vitro. The anti-inflammatory activity of the active fraction was tested on mice ear edema induced by xylene and rat paw edema induced by carrageenin. Furthermore, the active fraction's promotion effect on wound healing was evaluated using a rat skin injury model, and skin safety tests were conducted on rabbits and guinea pigs. Lastly, antimicrobial activities against two Gram-positive bacteria (G+, Staphylococcus aureus and S. epidermidis) and three Gram-negative bacteria (G-, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa) were determined using the plate dilution method. Results: The ethanol extract of C. odorata leaves and stems was fractionated into 30%, 60%, and 90% ethanol eluate fractions. These fractions demonstrated hemostatic activity, with the 30% ethanol eluate fraction (30% EEF) showing the strongest effect, significantly reducing bleeding time (P < 0.05). A concentration of 1.0 g/mL of the 30% EEF accelerated cutaneous wound healing in rats on the 3rd, 6th, and 9th day post-operation, with the healing effect increasing over time. No irritation or allergy reactions were observed in rabbits and guinea pigs exposed to the 30% EEF. Additionally, the 30% EEF exhibited mild inhibitory effect on mice ear and rat paw edema, as well as antimicrobial activity against tested bacteria, with varying minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) values. Conclusions: The 30% EEF demonstrated a clear hemostatic effect on rabbit bleeding time, a slight inhibitory effect on mice ear edema and rat paw edema, significant wound healing activity in rats, and no observed

AB  - Foamed cleaning agents mainly consist of synthetic surfactants. However, the widespread use of petroleum-based surfactants not only consumes non-renewable resources but also causes harm to the environment. It is necessary to develop surfactants with higher biodegradability and lower toxicity to obtain a recipe for an environment friendly foamed cleaning agent. Camellia oleifera saponins (TS) was prepared and mixed with a zwitterionic surfactant (dodecyl dimethyl sulfopropyl betaine, SB12-3). The equilibrium surface tension of single surfactants and their binary mixtures in the air/water system was measured using Wilhelmy method. The interaction and thermodynamic parameters of different mixtures were calculated via the regular solution model. The parameters showed that the mixtures displayed a synergistic effect, and the optimum molar ratio of TS/SB12-3 was deter-mined to be 5/95. The mixture had the shortest wetting time (13 s), the smallest contact angle (32.4 degrees), and the lowest surface tension (32.2 mN/m). Furthermore, the addition of TS significantly improved the emulsifying and foam properties. Cleaning experiments were completed by applying foamed surfactant solutions with different liquid fractions (epsilon) prepared by the double syringe technique on oil-contaminated glass substrates. The foamed surfactant solutions of the mixture were cleaner than those of TS or SB12-3 at all epsilon. The maximum oil area removal efficiency of the mixture was 94.9% at epsilon = 15%. The mixture exhibits a better cleaning efficiency than that of single surfactants. This study provides a new way for the utilization of Camellia oleifera cake.

AB  - During early pregnancy, porcine conceptuses (the embryos with associated membranes) secrete estradiol-17 beta (E-2)-their major signal for maternal recognition of pregnancy-and prostaglandin E-2 (PGE(2)). Both hormones induce prominent changes of the endometrial transcriptome in vivo. Studies on endometrial pathologies have shown that E-2 affects gene expression by epigenetic mechanisms related to DNA methylation. Herein, we determined the effects of E-2 and PGE(2) alone, and a combined E-2 + PGE(2) treatment administered into the uterine lumen in vivo on the expression and activity of DNA-methyltransferases (DNMTs) and on CpG methylation patterns of selected genes in porcine endometrium. To compare the effect of treatment with the physiological effect of pregnancy, endometria from day 12 pregnant/cyclic gilts were included. Both E-2 and PGE(2) significantly reduced the expression of DNMTs. Likewise, the expressions of DNMT1 and DNMT3A were decreased on day 12 of pregnancy compared to the estrous cycle. DNMT activity increased in endometrial samples following E-2 treatment and in gilts on day 12 of pregnancy. Treatment with E-2 alone and/or simultaneously with PGE(2) altered endometrial DNA methylation of CpG sites of ADAMTS20, ADH1C, BGN, PSAT1, and WNT5A. Different CpG methylation patterns of ADAMTS20, BGN, DMBT1, RASSF1, and WNT5A were found in the endometrium on day 12 of pregnancy compared to day 12 of the estrous cycle. Significant correlations were detected between CpG methylation and gene expression for ADAMTS20, ADH1C, BGN, DMBT1, PSAT1, and WNT5A. Our results indicate that CpG methylation induced by embryonic signals may contribute to regulating endometrial gene expression during pregnancy establishment.

AB  - Cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA) is characterized by cerebrovascular amyloid beta (A beta) deposits and causes dementia and cerebral hemorrhage. Although alpha-enolase (ENO1) was shown to possess multifunctional roles, its exact functions in CAA pathogenesis have not been determined. In this study, we focused on ENO1, a well-known glycolytic enzyme, which was previously identified via a proteomic approach as an upregulated protein in brain samples from patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD). We utilized the thioflavin T fluorescence assay and transmission electron microscopy to monitor the effects of ENO1 on amyloid formation by A beta peptides. We also cultured murine primary cerebrovascular smooth muscle cells to determine the effects of ENO1 on A beta cytotoxicity. To investigate the effects of ENO1 in vivo, we infused ENO1 or a vehicle control into the brains of APP23 mice, a transgenic model of AD/CAA, using a continuous infusion system, followed by a cognitive test and pathological and biochemical analyses. We found that novel functions of ENO1 included interacting with A beta and inhibiting its fibril formation, disrupting A beta fibrils, and weakening the cytotoxic effects of these fibrils via proteolytic degradation of A beta peptide. We also demonstrated that infusion of ENO1 into APP23 mouse brains reduced cerebrovascular A beta deposits and improved cognitive impairment. In addition, we found that enzymatically inactivated ENO1 failed to inhibit A beta fibril formation and fibril disruption. The proteolytic activity of ENO1 may thus underlie the enzyme's cytoprotective effect and clearance of A beta from the brain, and ENO1 may be a therapeutic target in CAA.

AB  - Porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV2) has caused huge economic losses to the pig industry across the world. Matrine is a natural compound that has been shown to regulate intestinal flora and has anti-PCV2 activity in mouse models. PCV2 infection can lead to changes in intestinal flora. The intestinal flora has proved to be one of the important pharmacological targets of the active components of Traditional Chinese Medicine. This study aimed to determine whether matrine exerts anti-PCV2 effects by regulating intestinal flora. In this study, fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) was used to evaluate the effect of matrine on the intestinal flora of PCV2-infected Kunming (KM) mice. The expression of the Cap gene in the liver and the ileum, the relative expression of IL-1 beta mRNA, and the Lactobacillus acidophilus (L. acidophilus) gene in the ileum of mice were determined by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). ELISA was used to analyze the content of secretory immunoglobulin A (SIgA) in small intestinal fluid. L. acidophilus was isolated and identified from the feces of KM mice in order to study its anti-PCV2 effect in vivo. The expression of the Cap gene in the liver and the ileum and the relative expression of L. acidophilus and IL-1 beta mRNA in the ileum were determined by qPCR. The results showed that matrine could reduce the relative expression of IL-1 beta mRNA by regulating intestinal flora, and that its pharmacological anti-PCV2 and effect may be related to L. acidophilus. L. acidophilus was successfully isolated and identified from the feces of KM mice. The in vivo experiment revealed that administration of L. acidophilus also reduced the relative expression of IL-1 beta mRNA, and that it had anti-PCV2 effects in PCV2-infected mice. It was found that matrine could regulate the abundance of L. acidophilus in the gut of mice to exert an anti-PCV2 effect and inhibit PCV2-induced inflammatory response.

AB  - Prolonged daily intake of Western-type diet rich in saturated fats and sugars, and exposure to early life stress have been independently linked to impaired neurodevelopment and behaviour in animal models. However, sex -specific effects of both environmental factors combined on spatial learning and memory, behavioural flexibility, and brain oxidative capacity have still not been addressed. The current study aimed to evaluate the impact of maternal and postnatal exposure to a high-fat and high-sugar diet (HFS), and exposure to early life stress by maternal separation in adult male and female Wistar rats. For this purpose, spatial learning and memory and behavioural flexibility were evaluated in the Morris water maze, and regional brain oxidative capacity and oxidative stress levels were measured in the hippocampus and medial prefrontal cortex. Spatial memory, regional brain oxidative metabolism, and levels of oxidative stress differed between females and males, suggesting sexual dimorphism in the effects of a HFS diet and early life stress. Males fed the HFS diet performed better than all other experimental groups independently of early life stress exposure. However, behavioural flexibility evaluated in the spatial reversal leaning task was impaired in males fed the HFS diet. In addition, exposure to maternal separation or the HFS diet increased the metabolic capacity of the prefrontal cortex and dorsal hippocampus in males and females. Levels of oxidative stress measured in the latter brain regions were also increased in groups fed the HFS diet, but maternal separation seemed to dampen regional brain oxidative stress levels. Therefore, these results suggest a compensatory effect resulting from the interaction between prolonged exposure to a HFS diet and early life stress.

AB  - Amoxicillin, a widely used antibiotic in human and veterinary pharmaceuticals, is now considered as an "emerging contaminant" because it exists widespreadly in the environment and brings a series of adverse outcomes. Currently, systematic studies about the developmental toxicity of amoxicillin are still lacking. We explored the potential effects of amoxicillin exposure on pregnancy outcomes, maternal/fetal serum phenotypes, and fetal multiple organ development in mice, at different doses (75, 150, 300 mg/(kg center dot day)) during late-pregnancy, or at a dose of 300 mg/(kg center dot day) during different stages (mid-/latepregnancy) and courses (single-/multi-course). Results showed that prenatal amoxicillin exposure (PAmE) had no significant influence on the body weights of dams, but it could inhibit the physical development and reduce the survival rate of fetuses, especially during the midpregnancy. Meanwhile, PAmE altered multiple matemal/fetal serum phenotypes, especially in fetuses. Fetal multi-organ function results showed that PAmE inhibited testicular/adrenal steroid synthesis, long bone/cartilage and hippocampal development, and enhanced ovarian steroid synthesis and hepatic glycogenesis/lipogenesis, and the order of severity might be gonad (testis, ovary) > liver > others. Further analysis found that PAmE-induced multiorgan developmental and functional alterations had differences in stages, courses and fetal gender, and the most obvious changes might be in high-dose, late-pregnancy and multicourse, but there was no typical rule of a dose-response relationship. In conclusion, this study confirmed that PAmE could cause abnormal development and multi-organ function alterations, which deepens our understanding of the risk of PAmE and provides an experimental basis for further exploration of the long-term harm.(c) 2023 The Research Center for Eco-Environmental Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciences.

AB  - In this study, we investigated the biological aspects and predation efficiency of 3 aphidophagous ladybird beetles, Coccinella novemnotata, Hippodamia variegata, and Coccinella septempunctata, on the cotton aphid, Aphis gossypii, reared on cucumber plants (Cucumis sativus L. cultivar barracuda) under laboratory conditions. The developmental periods of C. novemnotata, H. variegata, and C. septempunctata were observed to be 16.00 +/- 0.25, 16.00 +/- 0.25, and 20.58 +/- 0.40 days, respectively. The larvae of these ladybird beetles consumed an average of 218.93 +/- 8.86, 254.77 +/- 8.86, and 537.36 +/- 10.49 aphids, respectively. Fourth-instar larvae were particularly efficient, consuming 53.68%, 52.68%, and 52.64% of total aphids for C. novemnotata, H. variegata, and C. septempunctata, respectively. Adult emergence rates were promising, with 91.67%, 100.00%, and 92.86%, accompanied by sex ratios of 63.64%, 53.84%, and 61.54%, respectively. Notably, a single female of C. novemnotata, H. variegata, and C. septempunctata consumed an average of 2,215.30, 2,232.00, and 3,364.50 aphids, respectively, over its lifespan. Coccinella septempunctata demonstrated the highest predation efficiency among the 3 species, suggesting its potential for biological control of A. gossypii in both open fields and greenhouses, promoting sustainable agricultural practices.

AB  - Twenty-four Merino lambs were allocated to three dietary treatment groups to determine the effects of a dietary starch and protein binding agent and heat stress on methane (CH4) emissions and rumen parameters. The diets were a wheat-based diet (WD), a 2% Bioprotect (TM) (Bioprotect (TM), RealisticAgri, Rutland, UK) treated wheat-based diet (BD), and a maize-based diet (MD) for 3 periods of 1-week duration. During Period 1 (P1) the lambs were maintained under thermoneutral conditions and at a 1.7 x Maintenance (M) level. During P2 and P3, the lambs were maintained under cyclic heat stress conditions and fed at 1.7 x M and 2.0 x M, respectively. Total CH4 production was lower for the BD diet than the WD diet, which in turn was lower than the MD diet (p < 0.001). Total CH4 production was lower during P2 than P1 with P3 intermediate (p = 0.04). Rumen total volatile fatty acid (TVFA) concentrations were higher for the WD diet than the MD diet with the BD diet intermediate (p = 0.01). Rumen TVFA concentrations were lower during heat stress than under thermoneutral conditions (p < 0.001). Whole tract starch digestibility was higher for the BD and WD diets than the MD diet (p < 0.001). In conclusion, feeding Merino lambs the BD diet reduces CH4 emissions without reducing starch digestibility.

AB  - In recent years, childhood overweight and obesity have become a universal public health problem. Obesity may lead to cognitive disorders, depression and anxiety by affecting neuronal processes. Spirulina platensis (SP), a species of microalgae from the Chlorophyceae green algae class, has neuroprotective effects and may reduce body weight. In this study, we aimed to investigate the effects of SP on behavior alongside the role of leptin and Sirtuin-1 in fed with high-fat diet (HFD) adolescent rats. Four-week-old Sprague Dawley male rats were divided into four groups: control, HFD, HFD + SP150 (150 mg/kg/day SP, orally), HFD + SP450 (450 mg/kg/day SP, orally). Rats except for the control group exposed to 60% HFD along 12 weeks. Last 6 weeks SP or vehicle administered. After the behavioral tests, leptin and Sirtuin-1 levels in prefrontal cortex and hippocampus regions were evaluated. SP150 significantly reduced body weight compared with HFD group. The time spent in the center of open field increased significantly in SP150-treated rats compared with HFD. SP150 and SP450 significantly decreased immobility time in forced swim test compared with HFD. Leptin levels in HFD group were significantly lower in prefrontal cortex compared to control group. Leptin levels of the HFD + SP450 group were significantly higher than HFD group in the hippocampus. There was no significant difference between groups in Sirtuin-1 levels. In conclusion, SP supplementation in adolescence period might positively affect chronic high fat-induced anxiety-like and depressive-like behavior by partially affecting brain leptin levels and without affecting Sirtuin-1 levels.

AB  - Simple Summary
   Swine inflammation and necrosis syndrome (SINS) is a newly identified syndrome associated with inflammatory and necrotic signs in different body parts of suckling piglets, weaners, and fatteners. While the proven inflammatory basis of the disease and the development of signs in even newborns indicate a primarily endogenous etiology, the mechanisms underlying SINS development are largely unknown. In this study, the hypothesis was tested that SINS is indirectly triggered by the translocation of gut-derived microbial components into the liver, thereby causing derangements of liver metabolism, by comparing the hepatic transcriptome and plasma metabolome of SINS-affected and unaffected piglets. Apart from demonstrating that hepatic inflammation occurs in SINS-affected piglets, the study clearly shows for the first time that several metabolic derangements are induced in SINS-affected piglets that may contribute to the clinical and histopathological signs of SINS.
   Swine Inflammation and Necrosis Syndrome can lead to severe clinical signs, especially in tails, ears, teats, and claws in pigs. Clinical and histopathological findings in newborn piglets with intact epidermis indicate a primarily endogenous etiology, and microbial-associated molecular patterns (MAMPs), such as lipopolysaccharide (LPS) are assumed to play a central role in the development of the syndrome. We hypothesized that swine inflammation and necrosis syndrome (SINS) is indirectly triggered by gut-derived MAMPs entering the circulatory system via the liver and thereby causing derangements on liver metabolism. To test this hypothesis, metabolomes, candidate genes of the liver and liver transcriptomes of 6 piglets with high-grade clinical signs of SINS (SINS high) were examined and compared with 6 piglets without significant signs of SINS (SINS low). Several hepatic pro-inflammatory genes and genes involved in stress response were induced in piglets of the SINS high group. The most striking finding from hepatic transcript profiling and bioinformatic enrichment was that the most enriched biological processes associated with the approximately 220 genes induced in the liver of the SINS high group were exclusively related to metabolic pathways, such as fatty acid metabolic process. Within the genes (approximate to 390) repressed in the liver of the SINS high group, enriched pathways were ribosome biogenesis, RNA processing, RNA splicing, spliceosome, and RNA transport. The transcriptomic findings were supported by the results of the metabolome analyses. These results provide the first evidence for the induction of an inflammatory process in the liver of piglets suffering from SINS, accompanied by lipid metabolic derangement.

AB  - Simple Summary The extensive field work study between 2020 and 2023 led to the discovery of three new species of wood-inhabiting fungi; Tropicoporus pannaensis, Tropicoporus subindicus, and Tropicoporus xerophyticus from the southern part of India. The detailed descriptions and illustrations along with molecular support are presented. These discoveries may contribute to our understanding of species diversity and ecology, ultimately benefiting the society by informing the conservation efforts and exploring the potential biomolecules.Abstract This study aimed to investigate the morphological characteristics and phylogenetic relationships of three new species of Tropicoporus from the southern parts of India. The analyses of the ITS and nLSU regions revealed the novelty of these species, which have been named T. pannaensis, T. subindicus, and T. xerophyticus. All three species possess pileate basidiomes, a monomitic hyphal system in the context, and the presence of cystidioles and setae. However, they differ significantly in their phylogenetic placements and other morpho-taxonomic features. Tropicoporus pannaensis is characterized by a meagrely ungulate basidiome, indistinct zones, and an obtuse margin. Tropicoporus subindicus has a triquetrous basidiome and a radially cracked, crusted pileal surface with an acute margin, while T. xerophyticus is distinguished by an imbricate, perennial basidiome with an abundantly warted pileal surface. A phylogenetic tree is provided to show the placement of the three new species, along with detailed descriptions and illustrations. Additionally, a key for the identification of the Asian species of Tropicoporus is presented.

AB  - Background: [F-18]FDG and [C-11]methionine accumulate in lymph nodes draining S. aureus -infected foci. The lymph nodes were characterized by weight, [C-11]methionine- and [F-18]FDG-positron emissions tomography (PET)/computed tomography (CT), and immunohistochemical (IHC)-staining. Methods: 20 pigs inoculated with S. aureus into the right femoral artery were PET/CT-scanned with [F-18]FDG, and nine of the pigs were additionally scanned with [C-11]methionine. Mammary, medial iliac, and popliteal lymph nodes from the left and right hind limbs were weighed. IHC-staining for calculations of area fractions of Ki-67, L1, and IL-8 positive cells was done in mammary and popliteal lymph nodes from the nine pigs. Results: The pigs developed one to six osteomyelitis foci. Some pigs developed contiguous infections of peri-osseous tissue and inoculation-site abscesses. Weights of mammary and medial iliac lymph nodes and their [F-18]FDG maximum Standardized Uptake Values (SUVFDGmax) showed a significant increase in the inoculated limb compared to the left limb. Popliteal lymph node weight and their FDG uptake did not differ significantly between hind limbs. Area fractions of Ki-67 and IL-8 in the right mammary lymph nodes and SUVMetmax in the right popliteal lymph nodes were significantly increased compared with the left side. Conclusion: The PET-tracers [F-18]FDG and [C-11]methionine, and the IHC- markers Ki-67 and IL-8, but not L1, showed increased values in lymph nodes draining soft tissues infected with S. aureus. The increase in [C-11]methionine may indicate a more acute lymph node response, whereas an increase in [F-18]FDG may indicate a more chronic response.

AB  - Trophic resource partitioning is one of the main drivers of adaptive radiation. The evolutionary diversification of large African barbs, the genus Labeobarbus, seems to be related to mouth polymorphism. The chisel-mouthed or scraping phenotype has repeatedly evolved within Labeobarbus. At least five ecomorphs with a scraping mouth morphology were detected in the waters of the Ethiopian Highlands and can be provisionally classified into two groups: (i) "Varicorhinus"-like, and (ii) "Smiling"-like. Previously, all Labeobarbus with a scraping-mouth morphology were considered to be periphyton feeders. Using data on morphology, diet and stable isotope ratios (C and N), we addressed the question: does a scraping-mouth morphology predict feeding on periphyton? Our study revealed that five scraper ecomorphs exhibited three main feeding modes: (i) periphyton-eating, (ii) herbivory-detritivory, and (iii) insectivory. Two cases of the parallel divergence of sympatric ecomorphs with distinct feeding modes (herbivory-detritivory vs. insectivory) were revealed in two geographically isolated basins. A significant difference in delta 15N values was detected among sympatric scraper ecomorphs. A periphytonophagous scraper was rich in delta 15N values that are comparable with those in sympatric piscivorous fish. This data sheds light on the possibility of the utilization of periphyton as a protein-rich food by fishes.

Fly species recovered from the trials were identified by cytochrome oxidase gene barcode sequencing. Several species of veterinary and medically significant flies were identified. They were all deemed to be susceptible to treatments with PHP1601 and constituted part of the strain's host range. The study demonstrated the effectiveness of B. velezensis PHP1601 as a promising biocontrol agent for controlling fly infestations under conditions similar to its intended use.Fly infestations threaten farming and livestock operations, contributing to animal irritation and the spread of serious diseases. In this study, the application of Bacillus velezensis PHP1601 (Bacillales: Bacillaceae) treatments (10(5) and 10(10) endospore g(-1)) to pig manure slurries was evaluated as a means of controlling fly reproductive cycles. Two cycles of fly emergence were evaluated over a 33 days period for each replicated trial. For both treatments, the first emergence event resulted in a significant reduction in the percentage of flies emerging compared to an untreated control. Extended monitoring of the biocontrol containers revealed that fly emergence was completely eliminated by the time that a second round of fly emergence was observed for the control. A B. velezensis-specific real-time PCR method was developed and used to assess the population dynamics of the applied biocontrol agent over the course of the experiment. Strain PHP1601 remained viable in the manure and cell numbers increased by several orders of magnitude. REP-PCR fingerprinting was used to confirm the clonality of endospores recovered from the manure. Fly species recovered from the trials were identified by cytochrome oxidase gene barcode sequencing. Several species of veterinary and medically significant flies were identified. They were all deemed to be susceptible to treatments with PHP1601 and constituted part of the strain's host range.

AB  - Spittlebugs cause large production losses that affect agribusiness worldwide. Understanding plant-herbivore interactions at the molecular level may be the key to developing resistant cultivars. After a nymph survival experiment, root transcriptomes were assembled from two Paspalum regnellii genotypes (BGP 248 and 344) with different first-line defense strategies, with no infestation and at two times after the initial attack of the spittlebug (Mahanarva spectabilis) nymph, thus integrating differential expression analysis and biological network modeling supplemented by root anatomical analysis. Gene Ontology terms related to different stress responses, such as salicylic acid catabolic process, were enriched in BGP 248, while some specific to spittlebugs, such as response to herbivores, were enriched in BGP 344. Enriched pathways were related to structural differences between genotypes, such as those related to cutin, suberin, and wax biosynthesis. BGP 344 also presented pathways related to induced defense, such as glutathione metabolism. Metabolic networks highlighted kinases, and coexpression networks demonstrated a complex cascade response that included lncRNAs. This study provides the first molecular insights into the defense mechanisms of P. regnellii against M. spectabilis. The genotype with the fastest response to insect attack and highest nymph mortality (BGP 344) presented kinases and an enriched glutathione pathway, in addition to constitutive barriers, such as lignin, which can make it difficult for the insect to colonize the plant.

AB  - Simple Summary Despite our common connotations with the term "greeting", such behaviours in non-human societies are not exclusively employed in the context of reunion. For example, these multimodal signals can function to test bonds, promote cooperation, or facilitate further positive interactions between individuals, as well as to ease tension and update uncertain relationships at reunion events. A common behaviour in male elephants is for a male to direct his trunk to a same-sex conspecific's mouth, temporal gland, or genitals. Such behaviours are often labelled as greetings, and in addition to being gestural and tactile signals, may simultaneously enable olfactory assessment of aspects of the target male's phenotype. We analysed trunk-mediated greetings performed by different aged male elephants at aggregations in an all-male area. Despite considerable mixing of new potential interactors, in a system with high fission-fusion dynamics, we found no evidence that males preferentially targeted elephants met new at aggregations with greetings. Adolescents greeted at higher rates than adults. All males, apart from older adolescents preferably greeted age-matched males. In male-male elephant communication, these behaviours likely function to facilitate further positive interaction, or assess aspects of phenotype between similar aged males occupying the same ecological space, rather than as a reunion display. A common behavioural interaction between male African elephants is for an actor to direct his trunk to contact a same sex conspecific's mouth, temporal gland, or genital region. Such behaviours are often referred to as "greetings". Along with its inherent tactile element, these behaviours also likely provide olfactory information to actors concerning aspects of the target's phenotype, including sexual status, feeding history, individual identity, and emotional state. Here, we explore whether the age and novelty of potential interactors affect the choice of individuals targeted by male African elephants for these trunks to scent emitting organ (SEO) behaviours at social hotspots in a male-dominated area. Male elephants of all ages, except older adolescents aged 16-20 years, preferentially targeted elephants of the same age class for trunk-to-SEO behaviours. Elephants younger than 26 years did not direct trunk-to-SEO behaviours to mature bulls (26+ years) more than expected by chance, suggesting these behaviours are not primarily used for younger males to establish contact with, or obtain information from or about older, more experienced individuals. We also found no evidence that males directed these behaviours preferentially to new individuals they encountered at male aggregations (compared to those they arrived in groups with), suggesting these behaviours are not primarily employed by males as a reunion display to establish relationships between new individuals or update relationships between familiar individuals separated over time. Age-mates may be preferentially targeted with these behaviours as a means to facilitate further interaction with partners (e.g., for sparring activity), or as a safe way to assess relative dominance rank in similarly aged and hence, size and strength, matched dyads. Our results suggest male African elephants use close contact trunk-to-SEO behaviours continuously over time, to facilitate positive relationships, test willingness to interact, and assess aspects of phenotype, between males occupying the same ecological space.

AB  - Ethnopharmacological relevance: Minthostachys verticillata (Griseb.) Epling (Lamiaceae) is a plant used in folk medicine for digestive or respiratory disorders. In addition, it is incorporated as condiment, in foods, as beverage flavoring or mate. The ethnopharmacological interest of M. verticillata resides in its essential oil (EO). Part of group has demonstrated the immunomodulatory ability of EO giving this oil a biological potential not known until that moment and conducted studies to evaluate their possible application in diseases of veterinary interest. However, the immunomodulatory effects of EO administered orally have not been fully characterized. Aim of the study: This study evaluated the impact of EO oral administration on gastrointestinal and immune health through measurement of immunological and oxidative parameters in mice. Material and methods: The EO was extracted from the leaves, slender stems and flowers of M. verticillata by hydrodistillation and chemical analyzed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). Prior to in vivo study, the cytotoxic effect of EO was determined using the human colon carcinoma Caco-2 cell line. For in vivo study, three groups of male Balb/c mice (n = 3) were orally administered with saline solution (control group) and EO (5 or 10 mg/kg/day) during 10 consecutive days. Subsequently, histological and hematological parameters, cytokines production, oxidative markers and CD4+ and CD8+ T cells were evaluated. Results: The chemical analysis of EO revealed the presence of a high content of monoterpenes, being the main pulegone (76.12%) and menthone (14.28%). The EO oral administration improved mice growth performance and modulated systemic adaptive immune response by increasing in the total leukocyte number. A high percentage of CD4(+) T cells were observed whereas the number of CD8(+) T cells was not altered. EO did not alter the morpho-physiology of intestine and improved total antioxidant capacity by decreasing MDA concentrations. In addition, EO decreased the IL-6 levels and increased in the IL-4 and IL-10 concentrations. Conclusion: Results indicate that M. verticillata EO modulate inflammatory and oxidative parameters constituting a natural alternative which could be applied to improve gastrointestinal and immune functionality in animals.

AB  - Dietary supplementation under high ambient temperatures can be considered crucial for supporting immune responses in livestock. In the present paper, Rosmarinus officinalis essential oil (REO) alone and in combination with dried sugar beet pulp (REO + B) was included in the diet of lambs during the fattening period under heat stress conditions. Environmental conditions and physiological and growth parameters of lambs were monitored throughout the trial. Plasma samples were collected to evaluate cytokine secretion (IL-1 beta, IL-6, and IL-10). Notably, REO inclusion reduced rectal temperature and respiration rate while increasing pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-1 beta and IL-6) at the same time, suggesting an enhanced immune response without compromising growth performance.

AB  - Quantifying the conductive heat loss of sows is important in establishing the heat balance equation of sows to evaluate the heat stress because sows spend a significant amount of time lying on the floor. However, previous studies did not offer explicate relationships between the floor heat transfer coefficient (FHTC) and the potential influential factors, making it difficult to estimate the conductive heat loss from sows in commercial productions. This study employed steady-state CFD-CHT simulations to investigate the conductive heat transfer from sows to three typical types of floor system in sow houses, considering the sizes of sows, contact ratios, air distribution strategies, and ambient temperatures. A co-simulation approach was proposed in order to involve the thermoregulation effect of sows under different ambient thermal conditions. The results indicated that the FHTC increased with the air movements and contact ratios, and decreased with the sizes of sows. The proportion of the conductive heat loss decreased with increased ambient temperature and contact ratio. The energy partition suggested that the conductive heat loss accounted for 6-19% of the total heat loss from sows at 20 degrees C ambient temperature and reduced to 5%-11% at 30 degrees C ambient temperature. The established relationships between the FHTC and convective heat transfer coefficient, and between the FHTC and interface temperature enabled the calculation of conductive heat loss from sows under various circumstances.

AB  - Clostridioides difficile currently constitutes a major pathogen of the gastrointestinal tract, which poses a significant growing burden on medicine and veterinary medicine in many regions. A farm was assessed (feed table, silage pit, and feces (healthy animals, emaciated animals, and animals with mastitis)) for the presence of C. difficile toxins using the PCR method and for the microbiome in cow feed and feces using NGS technology, one month apart. C. difficile toxin A and binary toxin were detected in feed samples. C. difficile toxin genes were found in the feces of sick animals two to three times more often than in healthy animals. Analysis of the microbial community of cow feces revealed that, during the month, the animals experienced major changes in the community structure associated with the accumulation of pathogenic bacteria, in particular Paeniclostridium sp., as well as with the development of methanogenic archaea of the Methanobacteriaceae and associated microorganisms (Lachnospiraceae and Anaerovoracaceae), which may speak of a decrease in feed efficiency and, subsequently, animal productivity. Thus, it seems likely that C. difficile enters the gastrointestinal tract of animals through feed, while animals weakened by diseases are more sensitive to the reproduction of pathogens in the GIT due to a weakened organism.

AB  - Clinical studies provide evidence that ketamine and psilocybin could be used as fast-acting antidepressants, though their mechanisms and toxicity are still not fully understood. To address this issue, we have examined the effect of a single administration of ketamine and psilocybin on the extracellular levels of neurotransmitters in the rat frontal cortex and reticular nucleus of the thalamus using microdialysis. The genotoxic effect and density of glutamate receptor proteins was measured with comet assay and Western blot, respectively. An open field test, light-dark box test and forced swim test were conducted to examine rat behavior 24 h after drug administration. Ketamine (10 mg/kg) and psilocybin (2 and 10 mg/kg) increased dopamine, serotonin, glutamate and GABA extracellular levels in the frontal cortex, while psilocybin also increased GABA in the reticular nucleus of the thalamus. Oxidative DNA damage due to psilocybin was observed in the frontal cortex and from both drugs in the hippocampus. NR2A subunit levels were increased after psilocybin (10 mg/kg). Behavioral tests showed no antidepressant or anxiolytic effects, and only ketamine suppressed rat locomotor activity. The observed changes in neurotransmission might lead to genotoxicity and increased NR2A levels, while not markedly affecting animal behavior.

AB  - Eosinophilic airway inflammation, complicated by bronchial asthma and eosinophilic chronic rhinosinusitis (ECRS), is difficult to treat. The disease may become refractory when eosinophilic mucin associated with eosinophil peroxidase (EPX) and autoantibodies fills in the paranasal sinus and small airway. This study investigated the functional role of an anti-EPX antibody in eosinophilic mucin of ECRS in eosinophilic airway inflammation. Eosinophilic mucin was obtained from patients with ECRS. The effects of the anti-EPX antibody on dsDNA release from eosinophils and eosinophilic mucin decomposition were evaluated. Immunofluorescence or enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays were performed to detect the anti-EPX antibody and its supernatant and serum levels in eosinophilic mucin, respectively. The serum levels of the anti-EPX antibody were positively correlated with sinus computed tomography score and fractionated exhaled nitrogen oxide. Patients with refractory ECRS had higher serum levels of the anti-EPX antibody than those without. However, dupilumab treatment decreased the serum levels of the anti-EPX antibody. Immunoglobulins (Igs) in the immunoprecipitate of mucin supernatants enhanced dsDNA release from eosinophils, whereas the neutralization of Igs against EPX stopped dsDNA release. Furthermore, EPX antibody neutralization accelerated mucin decomposition and restored corticosteroid sensitivity. Taken together, the anti-EPX antibody may be involved in the formulation of eosinophilic mucin and be used as a clinical marker and therapeutic target for intractable eosinophilic airway inflammation.

AB  - Here, we examined the effects of the BMP signaling pathway inhibitor LDN-193189 on the pluripotency of porcine embryonic stem cells (ESCs) in the absence of feeder cells using molecular and transcriptomic techniques. Additionally, the effects of some extracellular matrix components on porcine ESC pluripotency were evaluated to develop an optimized and sustainable feeder-free culture system for porcine ESCs. Feeder cells were found to play an important role in supporting the pluripotency of porcine ESCs by blocking trophoblast and mesodermal differentiation through the inhibition of the BMP pathway. Additionally, treatment with LDN193189, an inhibitor of the BMP pathway, maintained the pluripotency and homogeneity of porcine ESCs for an extended period in the absence of feeder cells by stimulating the secretion of chemokines and suppressing differentiation, based on transcriptome analysis. Conclusively, these results suggest that LDN-193189 could be a suitable replacement for feeder cells in the maintenance of porcine ESC pluripotency during culture. Additionally, these findings contribute to the understanding of pluripotency gene networks and comparative embryogenesis.

   The increase in health-conscious consumers and awareness in the prevention of diseases through diet opens a new market opportunity to improve meat products with functional ingredients such as Moringa oleifera leaves powder (MOLP). Meat products can be developed by enhancing their nutritional value either by decreasing fat content and/or incorporating new and functional ingredients such as MOLP. However, the meat industry encounters a serious challenge in maintaining traditional quality and reasonable cost of the formulated meat products. This study evaluated the influence of MOLP on the nutritional and technological properties, lipid oxidation, microbial growth, and sensory analysis of ground beef during cold storage. Moringa oleifera leaves powder improved the nutritional and technological properties and inhibited lipid oxidation in ground beef. Therefore, MOLP could be utilised by meat processors as a functional ingredient to enhance the quality attributes of ground beef.
   The utilisation of Moringa oleifera leaves powder (MOLP) to improve the nutritional properties and inhibit lipid oxidation and the proliferation of microorganisms in ground beef during cold storage was examined. The effects of 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, and 0.8% MOLP on the nutritional properties (proximate composition, total phenolic and total flavonoid content), thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS), microbial composition, physicochemical characteristics (pH value, colour attributes, and cooking properties), and sensory analysis of ground beef were investigated. The findings showed that ash, protein, polyphenolic compounds, pH, colour, and microbial growth increased significantly, while moisture, fat content, and TBARS decreased significantly, with an increase in the concentration of MOLP during cold storage. Moderate levels (0.2 and 0.4%) of MOLP did not affect the sensory attributes of stored ground beef. Evidently, MOLP can be utilised as a natural preservative in ground beef to improve the nutritional value and inhibit lipid oxidation.

AB  - Rutin and its aglycone quercetin occur in the fruits, leaves, seeds, and grains of many plant species and are involved in plant herbivore interactions. We studied the effect of the exogenous application of rutin and quercetin on the probing behavior (= stylet penetration activities in plant tissues) of Acyrthosiphon pisum on Pisum sativum, Myzus persicae on Brassica rapa ssp. pekinensis, and Rhopalosiphum padi on Avena sativa using the electrical penetration graph technique (EPG = electropenetrography). The reaction of aphids to quercetin and rutin and the potency of the effect depended on aphid species, the flavonol, and flavonol concentration. Quercetin promoted probing activities of A. pisum within non-phloem and phloem tissues, which was demonstrated in the longer duration of probes and a trend toward longer duration of sap ingestion, respectively. M. persicae reached phloem in a shorter time on quercetin-treated B. rapa than on the control. Rutin caused a delay in reaching sieve elements by A. pisum and deterred probing activities of M. persicae within non-phloem tissues. Probing of R. padi was not affected by quercetin or rutin. The potency of behavioral effects increased as the applied concentrations of flavonols increased. The prospects of using quercetin and rutin in plant protection are discussed.

AB  - Camellia sinensis (L.) O. Kuntze var. assamica cv. Duntsa (herein C.duntsa) has been used since ancient times in Hunan, China. To understand the genetic background information of C.duntsa and clarify the relationship between C.duntsa and other tea cultivars and varieties (taxa), the complete chloroplast genome of C.duntsa was sequenced using the Illumina NovaSeq platform, which was then compared with other published chloroplast genomes from tea plants. The C.duntsa chloroplast genome is 157,025 bp in length with a guanine-cytosine content of 37.30%. It consists of a short single-copy region (18,277 bp), a large single-copy region (86,586 bp), and two inverted repeat regions (26,081 bp). A total of 135 genes were identified, comprising 87 protein-coding genes, eight ribosomal RNA genes, 37 transfer RNA genes, and three pseudogene genes (two ycf15 and one ycf1). In addition, 968 long repetitive sequences were detected by comparative analysis with other tea plant chloroplast genes, of which 409 were forward, 557 were palindromic, and two were reverse. A total of 241-249 simple sequence-repeat loci were analyzed for comparison; most of these were single nucleic acid loci composed of A/T. In addition, six mutation hotspots (rpoC1, ycf1, petB, ndhD, rpl16, and rpoC2) were identified. Phylogenetic analysis showed that C.duntsa has a relatively close evolutionary relationship with C.sinensis var. sinensis cultivars anhua and fudingdabaicha and with Camellia ptilophylla Hung T. Chang. These results can provide valuable information for a better understanding of chloroplast evolution in Camellia species.

AB  - A physiological culture system to electro-mechanically stimulate pig heart slices to assess the drug effects on the functionality, metabolic activity, and structural integrity of the heart tissue under physiological and hypertrophic condition.
   There is need for a reliable in vitro system that can accurately replicate the cardiac physiological environment for drug testing. The limited availability of human heart tissue culture systems has led to inaccurate interpretations of cardiac-related drug effects. Here, we developed a cardiac tissue culture model (CTCM) that can electro-mechanically stimulate heart slices with physiological stretches in systole and diastole during the cardiac cycle. After 12 days in culture, this approach partially improved the viability of heart slices but did not completely maintain their structural integrity. Therefore, following small molecule screening, we found that the incorporation of 100 nM tri-iodothyronine (T3) and 1 mu M dexamethasone (Dex) into our culture media preserved the microscopic structure of the slices for 12 days. When combined with T3/Dex treatment, the CTCM system maintained the transcriptional profile, viability, metabolic activity, and structural integrity for 12 days at the same levels as the fresh heart tissue. Furthermore, overstretching the cardiac tissue induced cardiac hypertrophic signaling in culture, which provides a proof of concept for the ability of the CTCM to emulate cardiac stretch-induced hypertrophic conditions. In conclusion, CTCM can emulate cardiac physiology and pathophysiology in culture for an extended time, thereby enabling reliable drug screening.

AB  - Within the Brassicaceae, wild as well as crop species are challenged by specialist herbivores including cabbage white butterflies (Pieris spp.). The wild crucifer Brassica nigra responds to oviposition by Pieris butterflies by the synergistic expression of two egg-killing traits. Genotypes that express a hypersensitive response (HR)-like necrosis (direct egg-killing) also emit oviposition-induced plant volatiles (OIPVs) attracting Trichogramma egg parasitoids (indirect egg-killing). This so-called double defense line can result in high butterfly egg mortalities. It remains unknown whether this strategy is unique to B. nigra or more common in Brassica species. To test this, we examined the response of different Trichogramma evanescens lines to OIPVs emitted by B. nigra and three close relatives (Brassica napus, Brassica rapa, and Brassica oleracea). Furthermore, we evaluated whether HR-like necrosis played a role in the attraction toward plant volatiles. Our results show a specificity in wasp attraction to different plant species. Three out of four plant species attracted a specific T. evanescens strain, including the crops B. rapa and B. napus. Parasitoid attraction was positively affected by presence of HR-like necrosis in one plant species. Our findings imply that, despite being a true generalist in terms of host range, T. evanescens shows intraspecific variation during host searching, which should be taken into account when selecting parasitoid lines for biocontrol of certain crops. Finally, we conclude that also crop plants within the Brassicaceae family possess egg-killing traits and can exert the double-defense line which may enable effective selection of egg-killing defense traits by cabbage breeders.

AB  - Background: Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is characterized by limited airflow due to pulmonary and alveolar abnormalities from exposure to cigarette smoke (CS). Current therapeutic drugs are limited and the development of novel treatments to prevent disease progression is challenging. Isoforskolin (ISOF) from the plant Coleus forskohlii is an effective activator of adenylyl cyclase (AC) isoforms. Previously we found ISOF could attenuate acute lung injury in animal models, while the effect of ISOF on COPD has not been elucidated. Purpose: In this study, we aimed to evaluate the efficacy of ISOF on COPD and reveal its potential mechanisms.
   Methods: A rat model of COPD was established by long-term exposure to CS, then the rats were orally administered with ISOF (0.5, 1 and 2 mg/kg). The pulmonary function, lung morphology, inflammatory cells and cytokines in serum or bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) were evaluated. Transcriptomics, proteomics and network pharmacology analysis were utilized to identify potential mechanisms of ISOF. Droplet digital PCR was used to detect the mRNA expression of AC1-10 in donor lung tissues. AC activation was determined in recombinant human embryonic kidney 293 (HEK293) cells stably expressing human AC isoforms. In addition, ISOF caused trachea relaxation ex vivo were assessed in isolated trachea rings from guinea pigs.
   Results: ISOF significantly ameliorated pathological damage of lung tissue and improved pulmonary function in COPD rats. ISOF treatment decreased the number of inflammatory cells in peripheral blood, and also the levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines in serum and BALF. Consistent with omics-based analyses, ISOF markedly down-regulated the mTOR level in lung tissue. Flow cytometry analysis revealed that ISOF treatment reduced the ratio of Th17/Treg cells in peripheral blood. Furthermore, the expression levels of AC1 and AC2 are relatively higher than other AC isoforms in normal lung tissues, and ISOF could potently activate AC1 and AC2 in vitro and significantly relax isolated guinea pig trachea.
   Conclusion: Collectively, our studies suggest that ISOF exerts its anti-COPD effect by improving lung function, anti-inflammation and trachea relaxation, which may be related to AC activation, mTOR signaling and Th17/ Treg balance.

AB  - Simple Summary With the increase in the geriatric population worldwide, the promotion of healthy aging arose as a key issue and, hence, the scientific community dedicates huge effort to counteract age-related impairments. Brain aging is a crucial risk factor for several neurodegenerative disorders and dementia. One of the most affected cognitive functions is recognition memory. Inflammation and oxidative stress play a key role in pathogenesis of cognitive impairments, and a link exists between frailty, oxidative stress, and inflammaging. Medicinal mushrooms represent a source to develop new therapeutic strategy, and among them Hericium erinaceus (He) displays several actions ranging from boosting immune system to fighting senescence, due to its active ingredients/metabolites. Among these, Ergothioneine (ERGO) is known as the longevity vitamin. Currently, when monitoring physiological aging in mice, we demonstrated the selective, preventive and neuroprotective effect of an ERGO-rich He primordium extract in hippocampus, preventing recognition memory decline during aging, decreasing key markers of inflammation and oxidative stress, and increasing the expression of glutamate receptors, which are crucially involved in glutamatergic neurotransmission. Brain aging is a crucial risk factor for several neurodegenerative disorders and dementia. The most affected cognitive function is memory, worsening early during aging. Inflammation and oxidative stress are known to have a role in pathogenesis of cognitive impairments, and a link exists between aging/frailty and immunosenescence/inflammaging. Based on anti-aging properties, medicinal mushrooms represent a source to develop medicines and functional foods. In particular, Hericium erinaceus (He) displays several actions ranging from boosting the immune system to fighting senescence, due to its active ingredients/metabolites. Among these, Ergothioneine (ERGO) is known as the longevity vitamin. Currently, we demonstrated the efficacy of an ERGO-rich He primordium extract (He2) in preventing cognitive decline in a murine model of aging. We focused on recognition memory deterioration during aging, monitored through spontaneous behavioral tests assessing both memory components and frailty index. A parallel significant decrease in key markers of inflammation and oxidative stress, i.e., IL6, TGF beta 1, GFAP, Nrf2, SOD1, COX2, NOS2, was revealed in the hippocampus by immunohistochemistry, accompanied by an enhancement of NMDAR1and mGluR2, crucially involved in glutamatergic neurotransmission. In summary, we disclosed a selective, preventive and neuroprotective effect of He2 on aged hippocampus, both on recognition memory as well on inflammation/oxidative stress/glutamate receptors expression.

AB  - Six undescribed triterpenoid saponins, namely aescuchinosides A -F, along with seven known triterpenoid saponins, were isolated from the seeds of Aesculus chinensis. Barrigenol-like triterpenoids (BATs) constitute these saponins. Protoaescigenin serves as their aglycone, with various oxygen -containing groups, including acetyl, isobutyryl, tigloyl, and angeloyl groups situated at C-21, C-22, and C-28. Various techniques, including 1D and 2D-NMR spectroscopy, high -resolution mass spectrometry, and acid hydrolysis, were employed to determine the structures of these compounds. The antihyperglycemic effects of the isolated compounds were examined in insulin -resistant HepG2 cells induced by palmitic acid treatment. At a concentration of 6 mu M, aesculinoside F exhibited a significant increase in glucose consumption. In addition, aesculinoside F demonstrated the potential to improve insulin resistant by upregulating the PI3K/AKT pathway. These results indicate that the seeds of A.chinensis hold promising potential for preventing insulin resistant related disease.

AB  - Based on specimens collected during recent field surveys and re-examination of museum specimens, we critically reviewed the taxonomic status of several bat species occurring in the Western Himalayan states of Himachal Pradesh and Uttarakhand in India. The present review incorporates both morphological and molecular data and additionally illustrates new echolocation call characters of some little-known species from the region. A new species, Myotis himalaicus sp. nov., belonging to the My. frater complex is described based on multiple evidence of unique characters. We revised putative records of Tadarida teniotis as Ta. insignis and report this species for the first time from India. We also detail the first occurrence of Rhinolophus nippon, Hypsugo savii and My. sicarius from the Western Himalayas. We conclusively delineate Pipistrellus babu occurring in the Western Himalayas as a species distinct from Pi. javanicus in Southeast Asia and draw attention to several species-complexes (i.e. Rhinolophus macrotis, Eptesicus pachyomus, Murina cyclotis or Mu. huttonii) where further material and analyses are needed to clarify the species boundaries.

AB  - Given the implications of increased transmissibility, virulence, host range, and immune escapes of emerging variants of SARS-CoV-2, developing in vitro models that allow for detection of variants and differences in infection dynamics is important. The objective of this study, was to evaluate the PrimeFlow RNA in-situ assay as a method of detection for multiple strains of SARS-CoV-2. Evaluation of detection and infection statuses included single infections with an Alpha, Delta, or Omicron variants and dual infections with Alpha/Omicron or Delta/Omicron. RNA probes specific for the Spike protein coding region, were designed (omicron or non-omicron specific). SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected in greater frequency in the Vero E6 and minimally in the fetal deer testicle cell lines by flow cytometry using this approach for viral detection of multiple variants. Most evident in the Vero E6 cells, 24 h post infection both Alpha and Delta predominated over Omicron in dual infections. This is the first report using the PrimeFlow assay for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 at the single-cell level and as a potential model for competition of variants utilizing infection dynamics in cell culture.

AB  - Cognitive impairment (CI) and memory deficit are prevalent manifestations of multiple sclerosis (MS). This study explores the therapeutic potential of arbutin on memory deficits using a rat hippocampal demyelination model induced by lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC). Demyelination was induced by bilateral injection of 1% LPC into the CA1 area of the hippocampus, and the treated group received daily arbutin injections (50 mg/kg, i.p) for two weeks. Arbutin significantly improved memory impairment 14 days post-demyelination as assessed by Morris water maze test. Histological and immunohistochemical analyses demonstrated that arbutin reduced demyelination suppressed pro -inflammatory markers (IL-1 beta, TNF- alpha) and increased anti-inflammatory cytokine IL -10. Arbutin also diminished astrocyte activation, decreased iNOS, enhanced anti -oxidative factors (Nrf2, HO -1), and exhibited neuroprotective effects by elevating myelin markers (MBP) and brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF). These findings propose arbutin as a potential therapeutic candidate for multiple sclerosis -associated memory deficits, warranting further clinical exploration.

AB  - Introduction Social rank has a profound influence on the behavior and health of humans and animals. Methods To explore the effect of a combination of living Bifidobacterium, Lactobacillus and Streptococcus (CLB) on anxiety- and depression-like behaviors and social rank, mice were subjected to a social dominance tube test (SDTT). The behaviors, rank, gut microbiota, and expression of inflammatory cytokines and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) in the hippocampus were measured. Results The results indicated that CLB improved the SDTT ranking score of the losers and alleviated anxiety-like behaviors of the winners. CLB decreased the level of Desulfovibrio and augmented the level of Mollicutes in the feces, increased BDNF content, and reduced the level of tumor necrosis factor-alpha in the hippocampus. Conclusion These findings indicated that CLB may be used for the treatment of anxiety and improvement of the rank score via regulation of gut microbiota and anti-inflammatory effects.

AB  - Neurotransmitters in the brain are important for cognition and memory. As bioactive substrates, whether increased soy protein levels in pigs can promote hypothalamic neurotransmitter synthesis remains unclear. The effect of increased soy protein hydrolysate (SPH) levels in the small intestine of pigs on neurotransmitter precursor supply, hypothalamic neurotransmitter synthesis and underlying molecular processes was investigated by using sixteen pigs (35.2 +/- 0.3 kg) infused either with SPH (70 g day(-1)) or sterile saline (control) twice daily for 15 days via a duodenal fistula. It demonstrated that SPH infusion increased the expression of the neutral amino acid transporter B0AT1 in the jejunal mucosa, the serum tyrosine/large neutral amino acid ratio, the concentrations of serum tyrosine, hypothalamic tyrosine, dopamine and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) (P < 0.05). It also increased the jejunal and serum choline, hypothalamic choline and acetylcholine levels (P < 0.05). Hypothalamic transcriptome revealed that differential genes were significantly enriched in the cholinergic synapse, dopaminergic synapse and cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) signalling pathways, and that the expression of key enzyme genes in the synthesis of acetylcholine and dopamine and dopamine receptors 1 (DRD1) was upregulated by SPH (P < 0.05). Western blotting showed that SPH infusion activated the hypothalamic cAMP signalling pathways. Overall, SPH infusion promoted the synthesis of hypothalamic dopamine and acetylcholine, and the synthesised dopamine promoted BDNF production most likely through the activation of the cAMP signalling pathways by the DRD1.

AB  - IntroductionVascular dementia (VaD) is a common type of dementia. The aim of this study was to investigate the cellular and molecular mechanism of conditioned medium (CM) in VaD.Material and methodsThe rats were divided into four groups of control (n = 9), sham-operation (n = 10), VaD with vehicle (n = 9), and VaD with CM (n = 12) that received CM on days 4, 14, and 24 after 2VO. Before sacrificing the rats, cognitive performance was assessed through the open-field (OP), passive-avoidance, and Morris-water maze. The field-potential recording was used to investigate basal synaptic transmission (BST) and long-term potentiation (LTP). Subsequently, the hippocampus was dissected, and real-time PCR was used to quantify the expression levels of beta 1-catenin, insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1), transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta), glycogen synthase kinase-3 beta (GSK-3 beta), postsynaptic density protein 95 (PSD-95), and NR2B genes.ResultsThe results indicated impaired performance in behavioral tests in 2VO rats, coupled with reductions in BST and LTP induction. The expression levels of beta 1-catenin, IGF-1, PSD-95, and TGF-beta genes decreased, whereas NR2B and GSK-3 beta expression increased. Treatment with CM restores the expression of PSD-95 and GSK-3 beta as well as fear-memory, spatial learning, and grooming number without a positive effect on memory retrieval, time spent on the periphery and center of OP. The BST recovered upon administration of CM but, the LTP induction was still impaired.ConclusionThe recovery of BST in VaD rats appears to be the most important outcome of this study which is caused by the improvement of gene expression and leads to the restoration of fear memory.
   Vascular dementia (VaD) is a common type of dementia that occurs when there is damage to the blood vessels in the brain. While there is no cure for VaD, treatment focuses on managing underlying conditions and controlling risk factors. In recent years, there has been an increasing interest in the use of conditioned medium (CM) for the treatment of degenerative diseases. Thus, this study aimed to investigate the cellular and molecular mechanism of CM administration in VaD Our data indicated that treatment with CM led to the recovery of basal synaptic transmission and cognitive performance in VaD rats which is probably caused by the improvement of gene expression. image

AB  - Valine (Val) alone or in combination with isoleucine (Ile) improves the growth under severe protein restriction; however, the underlying mechanisms remain unknown. In this study, we assessed whether Val/Ile-induced growth in protein-restricted pigs is associated with changes in gut development, hepatic insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) production, and blood metabolomics. Forty piglets were assigned to five dietary groups: positive control (PC) with standard protein content; low protein (LP) with very low protein content; and LP supplemented with Val (LPV), Ile (LPI), and Val and Ile (LPVI). LPVI reversed the negative effects of VLP diets on growth and gut morphology. Both LPV and LPVI restored the reduced transcript of IGF-1 while decreasing the transcript of insulin-like growth factor binding protein 1 (IGFBP1) in the liver. LPV and LPVI recovered the reduced plasma Val, glycine, and leucine concentrations, which were positively correlated with improved gut morphology and the hepatic IGF-1 gene expression and negatively correlated with hepatic IGFBP1 mRNA abundance. In conclusion, supplementation with a combination of Val and Ile into the VLP diets restored the decreased growth performance of pigs fed with these diets likely through improved gut development, hepatic IGF-1 expression and bioavailability, and plasma metabolomics profile.

AB  - Rising environmental consciousness has prompted increased scrutiny of the environmental impact of everyday activities, such as barbecuing-a popular summertime activity in Germany. This study aimed to explore the environmental impacts of three grilling techniques, charcoal (including reusable types such as swivel, round, and kettle grills, as well as disposable charcoal grills), gas, and electric grills, utilizing a life cycle assessment (LCA) approach including the manufacturing of grills, consumption of energy sources and grilling ingredients, as well as the end-of-life of the grills. Five impact categories were considered: global warming potential (GWP), acidification potential (AP), eutrophication potential (EP), abiotic depletion potential fossil (ADP), and land use (LU) according to the CML2016 and ReCiPe 2016 methodology. This study found that a barbeque event for four people results in GWP, AP, EP, ADP, and LU values ranging from 18 to 20 kg CO2-eq., 174 to 179 g SO2-eq., 166 to 167 g PO4-eq., 102 to 138 MJ, and 36 to 38 m2 annual crop-eq., respectively, across different types of grills. Furthermore, the ingredients proved to be the most significant contributor, surpassing 70% in all impact categories. Among the three types of grills, the electric grill emerged as the most environmentally friendly, while the disposable grill had the greatest environmental impact across the majority of categories. Lastly, the environmental impacts of varying consumer behaviors were evaluated to potentially assist consumers in adopting more sustainable grilling practices.

AB  - The thorny protrusions or spines increase the neuronal surface area, facilitate synaptic interconnections among neurons, and play an essential role in the hippocampus. Increasing evidence suggests that testosterone, the gonadal hormone, plays an important role in neurogenesis and synaptic plasticity. The role of testosterone on microtubule-associated proteins on dendritic neurite stability in the hippocampus and its impact on learning disability is not elucidated. Adult male Wistar albino rats were randomly selected for the control, castrated, castrated + testosterone, and control + testosterone groups. Bilateral orchidectomy was done, and the testosterone propionate was administered during the entire trial period, i.e., 14 days. The learning assessments were done using working/reference memory versions of the 8-arm radial maze and hippocampal tissues processed for histological and protein expressions. There were reduced expressions of microtubule-associated protein 2 (MAP2), postsynaptic density protein 95 (PSD95), and androgen receptor (AR) and increased expression of pTau in the castrated group. Conversely, the expression of MAP2, PSD95, and AR was increased, and the pTau expression was reduced in the hippocampus of the castrated rat administrated with testosterone. Androgen-depleted rats showed impaired synaptic plasticity in the hippocampus associated with contracted microtubule dynamics. Along with learning disability, there was an increased number of reference memory errors and working memory errors in castrated rats. Observations suggest that androgen regulates expression of neural tissue-specific MAPs and plays a vital role in hippocampus synaptic plasticity and that a similar mechanism may underlie neurological disorders in aging and hypogonadal men.

AB  - Introduction: After calving, dairy cows are commonly affected by negative energy balance (NEB), indicated by high beta-Hydroxybutyrate (BHBA) blood levels. These are associated with subfertility frequently related to uterine inflammation. Since this could compromise functionality of endometrial glands that are essential for proper embryo implantation in sheep, we investigated effects of BHBA on bovine endometrial gland cells (BEGC) in vitro.Material and methods: BEGC were stimulated with different concentrations of BHBA over different periods. Cell metabolism and motility were examined by MTT-assay and Live-cell-imaging. The mRNA expression of the receptors for estrogen (ESR1, ESR2), progesterone (PR) and IFNr (IFNAR1, IFNAR2), and the inflammatory cytokines TNF alpha and IL-6 was determined by RT-qPCR. Protein expression for PR and ESR1 was analyzed by semiquantitative Western Blot.Results: BEGC metabolism was significantly decreased after stimulation with 1.2, 1.8 and 2.4 mM BHBA over 24 and 36 h. Cell motility was significantly reduced by 1.8 and 2.4 mM BHBA already after 11 h. After 24 h stimulation, the ESR1 mRNA expression was significantly increased in BEGC stimulated with 0.6 mM BHBA. PR and TNF alpha mRNA expressions were increased in cells stimulated with 2.4 mM BHBA. Protein expression of ESR1 and PR was not altered. Discussion: Treatment with BHBA leads to restriction of BEGC metabolism and motility, and increased expression of TNF alpha, ESR1 and PR in vitro. This could explain how increased BHBA blood levels might compromise functionality of uterine glands in vivo and thus could contribute to compromised reproductive success of cows suffering from NEB.

AB  - Camellia petelotii (Merr.) Sealy and Camellia impressinervis Chang & Liang belong to the golden subgroup of Camellia (Theaceae). This subgroup contains the yellow-flowering species of the genus, which have high medicinal and ornamental value and a narrow geographical distribution. These species differ in their tolerance to high light intensity. This study aimed to explore the differences in their light-stress responses and light damage repair processes, and the effect of these networks on secondary metabolite synthesis. Two-year-old plants of both species grown at 300 mu mol center dot m(-2)center dot s(-1) photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) were shifted to 700 mu mol center dot m(-2)center dot s(-1) PAR for 5 days shifting back to 300 mu mol center dot m(-2)center dot s(-1) PAR for recovery for 5 days. Leaf samples were collected at the start of the experiment and 2 days after each shift. Data analysis included measuring photosynthetic indicators, differential transcriptome expression, and quantifying plant hormones, pigments, and flavonoids. Camellia impressinervis showed a weak ability to recover from photodamage that occurred at 700 mu mol center dot m(-2)center dot s(-1) compared with C. petelotii. Photodamage led to decreased photosynthesis, as shown by repressed transcript abundance for photosystem II genes psbA, B, C, O, and Q, photosystem I genes psaB, D, E, H, and N, electron transfer genes petE and F, and ATP synthesis genes ATPF1A and ATPF1B. High-light stress caused more severe damage to C. impressinervis, which showed a stronger response to reactive oxygen species than C. petelotii. In addition, high-light stress promoted the growth and development of high zeatin signalling and increased transcript abundance of adenylate dimethylallyl transferase (IPT) and histidine-containing phosphotransferase (AHP). The identification of transcriptional differences in the regulatory networks that respond to high-light stress and activate recovery of light damage in these two rare species adds to the resources available to conserve them and improve their value through molecular breeding.

AB  - Hypertension is accompanied by the over-activation of macrophages. Diuretics administered alone or in combination with hypotensive drugs may have immunomodulatory effects. Thus, the influence of tested drugs on mouse macrophage-mediated humoral immunity was investigated. Mice were treated intraperitoneally with captopril (5 mg/kg) with or without hydrochlorothiazide (10 mg/kg) or furosemide (5 mg/kg) by 8 days. Mineral oil-induced peritoneal macrophages were harvested to assess the generation of cytokines in ELISA, and the expression of surface markers was analyzed cytometrically. Macrophages were also pulsed with sheep red blood cells (SRBC) and transferred to naive mice for evaluation of their ability to induce a humoral immune response. Tested drugs increase the expression of surface markers important for the antigen phagocytosis and presentation. SRBC-pulsed macrophages from mice treated with captopril combined with diuretics increased the secretion of antigen-specific antibodies by recipient B cells, while macrophages of mice treated with hydrochlorothiazide or furosemide with captopril increased the number of antigen-specific B cells. Tested drugs alter the macrophage secretory profile in favor of anti-inflammatory cytokines. Our results showed that diuretics with or without captopril modulate the humoral response by affecting the function of macrophages, which has significant translational potential in assessing the safety of antihypertensive therapy.

AB  - The great majority of infant formula (FM) for neonate's nutrition are produced using ingredients from cow milk. Recently, some countries, such as China and New Zealand, are turning their attention to the use of ovine milk ingredients for FM production. In this study, a pilot plant process has been set up to produce infant formula ingredients from Sarda sheep milk. To meet the nutritional needs of neonates (0-6 and 6-12 months of age) two different liquid milk-derived formulations (IF1 and IF2, respectively) obtained mixing whole milk, skimmed milk, and whey milk ultrafiltration concentrate (retentate) were produced. Compositional analysis of milk, retentate, and the final IFs showed that the two formulations contain elements of nutritional interest, such as well-balanced content of high biological value proteins (casein:whey proteins ratio of 30:70 and 60:40 for IF1 and IF2, respectively), vitamin A, E and B5, cholesterol, minerals, nucleotides, free amino acids and essential fatty acids (n-6:n-3 similar to 1), compatible with the growth and development needs of neonates. Therefore, the obtained IF1 and IF2 can be proposed as valuable ovine dairy ingredients for FM manufacturing. Further studies will be necessary to verify the adaptability of the developed process from laboratory to industrial scale application.

AB  - Simple Summary Early-weaning in piglets has negative effects on growth performance and gut health, which may cause economic losses in the swine production worldwide. Therefore, this study aimed to examine the effects of a highly digestible protein ingredient from hydrolyzed yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) on growth performance, nutrient digestibility, gut health, and microbial fermentation in early-weaned piglets. Our study found that supplementing hydrolyzed yeast increased growth performance, crude protein digestibility, villus height, villus height-to-crypt ratio, and immunity and decreased inflammation and fecal pathogen count compared with those fed a diet with no addition of hydrolyzed yeast. These research outcomes indicate that supplementation of hydrolyzed yeast has the potential to enhance the growth performance and gut health of early-weaned piglets. Hydrolyzed yeast (HY)-derived protein from Saccharomyces cerevisiae has a high digestible protein content and nucleotides and is a sweetener immunostimulatory substance. This could be used in nursery diets to minimize diarrhea and improve the growth rate and gut health of early-weaned piglets. This research was conducted with the objective of examining the effect of the inclusion level of HY as a potential protein ingredient for early-weaned piglets. A total of 72 crossbred weaned piglets [(Landrace x Large White) x Duroc] were assigned to three dietary treatments in six replicates with four pigs per pen. Dietary treatments were: (i) control (CON), piglets weaned at 18 days; (ii) CON diet with 5% HY inclusion (HY5); and (iii) CON diet with 10% HY inclusion (HY10) in a corn-soybean meal-based basal diet. Increasing HY levels positively improved body weight, average daily gain, and average daily feed intake (linear effect, p < 0.05). Furthermore, there was a linear increase in N-retention, albumin, jejunal villus height, villus height-to-crypt depth ratio, immunoglobulin A, acetate and propionate production, and Lactobacillus spp. count proportional to the dose of the HY-supplemented diet (p < 0.05). It also observed a decrease in diarrheal rate, jejunal crypt depth, blood urea nitrogen, pro-inflammatory cytokines, branched amino acids, and E. coli corresponding to the HY-supplemented levels (p < 0.05). However, the changes in the apparent total tract digestibility (dry matter, crude ash, and crude fat), blood glucose, butyrate, and Salmonella spp. were unaffected by the dietary HY level. Therefore, the supplementation of HY in the diet for early-weaned pigs not only supported the growth rate and immune function but also activated the beneficial bacterial growth of the early-weaned piglets.

AB  - The master clock, suprachiasmatic nucleus, is believed to control peripheral circadian oscillators throughout the brain and body. However, recent data suggest there is a circadian clock involved in learning and memory, potentially housed in the hippocampus, which is capable of acting independently of the master clock. Curiously, the hippocampal clock appears to be influenced by the master clock and by hippocampal dependent learning, while under certain conditions it may also revert to its endogenous circadian rhythm. Here we propose a mechanism by which the hippocampal clock could locally determine the nature of its entrainment. We introduce a novel theoretical framework, inspired by but extending beyond the hippocampal memory clock, which provides a new perspective on how circadian clocks throughout the brain coordinate their rhythms. Importantly, a local clock for memory would suggest that hippocampal-dependent learning at the same time every day should improve memory, opening up a range of possibilities for non-invasive therapies to alleviate the detrimental effects of circadian rhythm disruption on human health.

AB  - Our brains constantly generate predictions about the environment based on prior knowledge. Many of the events we experience are consistent with these predictions, while others might be inconsistent with prior knowledge and thus violate our predictions. To guide future behavior, the memory system must be able to strengthen, transform, or add to existing knowledge based on the accuracy of our predictions. We synthesize recent evidence suggesting that when an event is consistent with our predictions, it leads to neural integration between related memories, which is associated with enhanced associative memory, as well as memory biases. Prediction errors, in turn, can promote both neural integration and separation, and lead to multiple mnemonic outcomes. We review these findings and how they interact with factors such as memory reactivation, prediction error strength, and task goals, to offer insight into what determines memory for events that violate our predictions. In doing so, this review brings together recent neural and behavioral research to advance our understanding of how predictions shape memory, and why.

AB  - Context contributes to multiple aspects of human episodic memory including segmentation and retrieval. The present studies tested if, in adult male and female mice, context influences the encoding of odors encountered in a single unsupervised sampling session of the type used for the routine acquisition of episodic memories. The three paradigms used differed in complexity (single vs. multiple odor cues) and period from sampling to testing. Results show that males consistently encode odors in a context-dependent manner: the mice discriminated novel from previously sampled cues when tested in the chamber of initial cue sampling but not in a distinct yet familiar chamber. This was independent of the interval between cue encounters or the latency from initial sampling to testing. In contrast, female mice acquired both single cues and the elements of multi-cue episodes, but recall of that information was dependent upon the surrounding context only when the cues were presented serially. These results extend the list of episodic memory features expressed by rodents and also introduce a striking and unexpected sex difference in context effects.

AB  - BackgroundWe have shown that Hippo-YAP signaling pathway plays an important role in endothelial cell differentiation. Vestigial-like family member 4 (VGLL4) has been identified as a YAP inhibitor. However, the exact function of VGLL4 in vascular endothelial cell development remains unclear. In this study, we investigated the role of VGLL4, in human endothelial lineage specification both in 3D vascular organoid and 2D endothelial cell differentiation.Methods and resultsIn this study, we found that VGLL4 was increased during 3D vascular organoids generation and directed differentiation of human embryonic stem cells H1 towards the endothelial lineage. Using inducible ectopic expression of VGLL4 based on the piggyBac system, we proved that overexpression of VGLL4 in H1 promoted vascular organoids generation and endothelial cells differentiation. In contrast, VGLL4 knockdown (heterozygous knockout) of H1 exhibited inhibitory effects. Using bioinformatics analysis and protein immunoprecipitation, we further found that VGLL4 binds to TEAD1 and facilitates the expression of endothelial master transcription factors, including FLI1, to promote endothelial lineage specification. Moreover, TEAD1 overexpression rescued VGLL4 knockdown-mediated negative effects.ConclusionsIn summary, VGLL4 promotes EC lineage specification both in 3D vascular organoid and 2D EC differentiation from pluripotent stem cell, VGLL4 interacts with TEAD1 and facilitates EC key transcription factor, including FLI1, to enhance EC lineage specification.

AB  - Survey stakes and in-ground (IG) stations have failed to intercept underground tunnels of the Asian subterranean termite, Coptotermes gestroi (Wasmann), in southeastern Florida, rendering nearly useless the IG bait station that is the main tool of commercial baiting systems. When placed over an active infestation, above-ground (AG) bait stations were readily fed on by C. gestroi, resulting in colony elimination. A new experimental type of AG bait application being studied is an injectable caulk bait. In this study, we compared the efficacy of AG bait stations and an experimental AG caulk bait against field colonies of C. gestroi. Following the applications of AG bait stations at 3 sites with infested houses and trees, C. gestroi colonies were eliminated 7.1-28.1 wk later. The experimental AG caulk bait was applied at 7 sites including 4 houses, 2 office buildings, and 1 docked sailboat. Colony elimination times at caulk bait sites ranged from 3.1 to 13.6 wk, but there was no statistical difference in mean colony elimination time between AG station bait sites (17.4 & PLUSMN; 10.5 wk) and AG caulk bait sites (8.4 & PLUSMN; 3.8 wk). This study showed that AG caulk bait applications were equally efficacious in eliminating existing C. gestroi in structures as AG bait stations and will offer another tool for termite control professionals to better manage subterranean termites including C. gestroi.

AB  - The selection of sleeping sites of animals provide valuable insights into their adaptations to a changing environment. We collected data on the sleeping sites used by a group of Fran & ccedil;ois' langurs (Trachypithecus francoisi) from September 2005 to August 2006 at the Nonggang National Nature Reserve in southwest China. Our results showed that the langurs utilized four sleeping sites on cliffs throughout the year. They foraged in the feeding patches close to their sleeping sites, showing a multiple central place foraging strategy. Notably, two sleeping sites were predominantly used during the dry season with least available young leaves and fruits, suggesting food seasonality may have a significant impact on the sleeping sites utilization. Moreover, the langurs used the sleeping sites in the peripheral area less than expected. They repeatedly and continuously slept at the Site 1, with a frequency of 79.8% of all recorded sleeping nights, and a maximum of eight consecutive nights. In conclusion, the sleeping site choices of Fran & ccedil;ois' langurs are mainly influenced by dietary factors, rather than range and resource defense, predator avoidance, thermoregulation, or parasite avoidance. This study highlights the significance of food resource and foraging efficiency to karst-dwelling Fran & ccedil;ois' langurs when selecting sleeping sites.

AB  - Skatole (3-methylindole) is a heterocyclic compound naturally found in the feces of vertebrates and is produced by certain flowers. Skatole has been used in specific products of the perfume industry or as a flavor additive in ice cream. Additionally, skatole is formed by tryptophan pyrolysis of tobacco and has been demonstrated to be a mutagen. Skatole-induced pulmonotoxicity was reliably described in rumi-nants and rodents, but no studies have been conducted in humans. Initially, we provide basic knowledge and a historical overview of skatole. Then, skatole bacterial formation in the intestine is described, and the importance of the microbiome during this process is evaluated. Increased skatole concentrations could serve as a marker for intestinal disease development. Therefore, the human molecular targets of skatole that may have significant effects on various processes in the human body are described. Ulti-mately, we suggest a link between skatole intestinal formation in humans and skatole-induced pul-monotoxicity, which should be explored further in the future.(c) 2022 Elsevier B.V. and Societe Francaise de Biochimie et Biologie Moleculaire (SFBBM).

AB  - Featured Application The research presented by the authors in this article points to the need for changes in the construction of agricultural biogas plants to optimise electricity production.Abstract Energy from biogas is widely available, inexpensive, and often contributes to waste management, making it one of the most promising renewable energy sources. The main factors influencing this process' efficiency include the substrates' chemical composition, temperature, and digester load. This paper presents the possibilities offered by a biogas plant built at a farm specialising in dairy cows. The dependence of the power generated in the micro biogas plant on its technical parameters was analysed in detail. Studies carried out by the authors in an agricultural microgas plant (with an electrical output of 40 kW) have shown that they are designed to maintain continuous energy production, despite changing process parameters such as digester mass level, biogas height, temperature or slurry flow into the digester. However, from the point of view of the amount of electricity generated, changes would have to be made to the design of the biogas plant. Firstly, a more powerful generator would have to be installed to cover the electricity requirements of the equipment installed in the biogas plant so that power close to the rated capacity of the biogas plant is still sent to the grid. Secondly, replacing the two existing agitators of the digestion mass (9 kW each) with more agitators of lower power (e.g., four agitators of 4.5 kW each) would be necessary. These should be programmed so that one of the agitators operates at any given time (the operating time of a given agitator should depend on the composition of the digestate).

AB  - Arecoline, a biologically active alkaloid extracted from the areca nut, serves as the primary psychoactive ingredient in betel quid, one of the most widely consumed psychoactive substances worldwide. Despite its extensive use, the central nervous system (CNS) effects of arecoline remain inadequately understood. This study aims to investigate the central actions of arecoline through a comprehensive, multi-dimensional approach that integrates behavioral assays, neuroimaging techniques, calcium signaling analysis, and transcriptomic profiling. Our findings demonstrate dose-dependent addictive properties of arecoline, alongside distinct behavioral alterations that highlight its potential for addiction. Neuroimaging and calcium signaling data revealed region-specific alterations in neural activity, particularly in areas associated with learning, memory, and reward processing. Furthermore, transcriptomic analysis identified significant changes in gene expression, particularly in pathways related to synaptic plasticity, calcium signaling, and metal ion transport. These results provide valuable insights into the addictive potential of arecoline and its underlying neurobiological mechanisms, offering crucial information for understanding its broader impact on CNS function. The study's findings hold significant implications for informing public health strategies aimed at addressing arecoline misuse and its potential role in addiction-related disorders.

AB  - Forty-five male non-castrated crossbred Dorper lambs (40.17 +/- 0.35 kg body weight, BW) were employed in a completely randomized design with five treatments to investigate the effects of the duration of calcium propionate (CaPr) supplementation (10 g CaPr/lamb/d for 0, 14, 28, or 42 d before slaughter) on lambs finished with zilpaterol hydrochloride (ZH, 7.2 mg/lamb/d for a fixed period of 28 d before slaughter) regarding their productive performance, carcass characteristics, and meat quality. Treatments consisted of the following: (1) No additives (CTL), (2) 0 days on CaPr plus 28 d on ZH, (3) 14 days on CaPr plus 28 d on ZH, (4) 28 days on CaPr plus 28 d on ZH, and (5) 42 days on CaPr plus 28 d on ZH. When compared with CTL, ZH lambs exhibited a similar average daily gain (ADG) but had lower dry matter intake (DMI), leading to increased feed efficiency. Supplementing with ZH alone did not affect carcass traits, visceral mass, whole cuts, or meat quality. Lambs that received both CaPr 28 d and ZH exhibited quadratic increases (p < 0.05) in final body weight (FBW), ADG, and dressing percentage (D%). These increases were optimal at estimated inclusion durations of 26 d for FBW, 30 for ADG, and 39 d for D%. The ADG:DMI ratio and the longissimus muscle area (LMA) both exhibited quadratic increases (p < 0.05). The optimal duration of CaPr supplementation for ADG:DMI ratio was found to be 28 d, while for LMA, it was 14 d. As the period of CaPr supplementation increased, there was a linear increase (p < 0.05) in hot carcass weight, leg circumference, and whole cuts of breast IMPS209 and shoulder IMPS207. Cook loss percent increased quadratically (p < 0.05), and was higher when CaPr was included for an estimated duration of 26 d. As the duration of CaPr supplementation increased, the purge loss percentage (PRL) also increased linearly (p < 0.05). In conclusion, including CaPr in the diet for a duration of 28 d in lambs improved the response to ZH supplementation on the productive performance, carcass weight, and some whole cuts. However, it can also have a negative effect on PRL%.

AB  - Hippocampal CA1 neurons show intense firing at specific spatial locations, modulated by isolated landmarks. However, the impact of real-world scene transitions on neuronal activity remains unclear. Moreover, long-term neural recording during movement challenges device stability. Conventional rigid-based electrodes cause inflammatory responses, restricting recording durations. Inspired by the jellyfish tentacles, the multi-conductive layer ultra-flexible microelectrode arrays (MEAs) are developed. The tentacle MEAs ensure stable recordings during movement, thereby enabling the discovery of soft boundary neurons. The soft boundary neurons demonstrate high-frequency firing that aligns with the boundaries of scene transitions. Furthermore, the localization ability of soft boundary neurons improves with more scene transition boundaries, and their activity decreases when these boundaries are removed. The innovation of ultra-flexible, high-biocompatible tentacle MEAs improves the understanding of neural encoding in spatial cognition. They offer the potential for long-term in vivo recording of neural information, facilitating breakthroughs in the understanding and application of brain spatial navigation mehanisms.
   How spatial cognition neurons encode scene transitions natural environments is an unknown field. Targeting this key scientific issue, an ultra-flexible tentacle neural interface is developed. The high biocompatibility of tentacle microelectrode arrays ensures the long-term stable detection. Using these electrodes, hippocampus neurons that fire intensely at the scene transitions are reported. This discovery will promote future brain-controlled intelligent spatial navigation. image

AB  - Cystic fibrosis-related diabetes (CFRD) is one the most common comorbidities in cystic fibrosis (CF). Pancreatic oxidative stress has been postulated in the pathogenesis of CFRD, but no studies have been done to show an association. The main obstacle is the lack of suitable animal models and no immediate availability of pancreas tissue in humans. In the CF porcine model, we found increased pancreatic total glutathione (GSH), glutathione disulfide (GSSG), 3-nitrotyrosine- and 4-hydroxynonenal-modified proteins, and decreased copper zinc superoxide dismutase (CuZnSOD) activity, all indicative of oxidative stress. CF pig pancreas demonstrated increased DHE oxidation (as a surrogate marker of superoxide) in situ compared to non-CF and this was inhibited by a SOD- mimetic (GC4401). Catalase and glutathione peroxidase activities were not different between CF and non-CF pancreas. Isolated CF pig islets had significantly increased DHE oxidation, peroxide production, reduced insulin secretion in response to high glucose and diminished secretory index compared to non-CF islets. Acute treatment with apocynin or an SOD mimetic failed to restore insulin secretion. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that CF pig pancreas is under significant oxidative stress as a result of increased O-2(center dot-) and peroxides combined with reduced antioxidant defenses against reactive oxygen species (ROS). We speculate that insulin secretory defects in CF may be due to oxidative stress.

AB  - Ferroptosis is a new type of programmed cell death caused by excessive accumulation of iron-dependent lipid peroxidation products. Animal reproduction is a complex process affected by multiple genes, hormones, proteins, minerals, and the environmental factor. In order to better understand the potential regulatory mechanism of ferroptosis in animal reproduction, we collated multiple ferroptosis-related genes, which are expressed in sperms, oocytes, follicles, embryos, the placenta, and/or the uterus, Furthermore, the prospective role of ferroptosis in animal reproduction was discussed. Since some reproductive diseases were found to be correlated with ferroptosis, we suggest that ferroptosis will be a novel therapeutic target in the treatment of these diseases to help solve the problems that affect reproduction. At present, numerous scientific researches about ferroptosis are studied in human and rat models. Eventually, further ferroptosis research in common livestock, such as pigs and cattle, will provide theoretical guidance for improving livestock production. (C) 2022 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Munc13-1 plays a central role in neurotransmitter release through its conserved C-terminal region, which includes a diacyglycerol (DAG)-binding C-1 domain, a Ca2+/PIP2-binding C2B domain, a MUN domain and a C2C domain. Munc13-1 was proposed to bridge synaptic vesicles to the plasma membrane through distinct interactions of the C1C2B region with the plasma membrane: (i) one involving a polybasic face that is expected to yield a perpendicular orientation of Munc13-1 and hinder release; and (ii) another involving the DAG-Ca2+-PIP2-binding face that is predicted to result in a slanted orientation and facilitate release. Here, we have tested this model and investigated the role of the C1C2B region in neurotransmitter release. We find that K603E or R769E point mutations in the polybasic face severely impair Ca2+-independent liposome bridging and fusion in in vitro reconstitution assays, and synaptic vesicle priming in primary murine hippocampal cultures. A K720E mutation in the polybasic face and a K706E mutation in the C2B domain Ca2+-binding loops have milder effects in reconstitution assays and do not affect vesicle priming, but enhance or impair Ca2+-evoked release, respectively. The phenotypes caused by combining these mutations are dominated by the K603E and R769E mutations. Our results show that the C-1-C2B region of Munc13-1 plays a central role in vesicle priming and support the notion that two distinct faces of this region control neurotransmitter release and short-term presynaptic plasticity.

AB  - Few individuals who experience trauma develop posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Therefore, the identification of individual differences that signal increased risk for PTSD is important. Lissek et al. (2006) proposed using a weak rather than a strong situation to identify individual differences. A weak situation involves less-salient cues as well as some degree of uncertainty, which reveal individual differences. A strong situation involves salient cues with little uncertainty, which produce consistently strong responses. Results from fear conditioning studies that support this hypothesis are discussed briefly. This review focuses on recent findings from three learning tasks: classical eyeblink conditioning, avoidance learning, and a computer-based task. These tasks are interpreted as weaker learning situations in that they involve some degree of uncertainty. Individual differences in learning based on behavioral inhibition, which is a risk factor for PTSD, are explored. Specifically, behaviorally inhibited individuals and rodents (i.e., Wistar Kyoto rats), as well as individuals expressing PTSD symptoms, exhibit enhanced eyeblink conditioning. Behaviorally inhibited rodents also demonstrate enhanced avoidance responding (i.e., lever pressing). Both enhanced eyeblink conditioning and avoidance are most evident with schedules of partial reinforcement. Behaviorally inhibited individuals also performed better on reward and punishment trials than noninhibited controls in a probabilistic category learning task. Overall, the use of weaker situations with uncertain relationships may be more ecologically valid than learning tasks in which the aversive event occurs on every trial and may provide more sensitivity for identifying individual differences in learning for those at risk for, or expressing, PTSD symptoms.

AB  - Temperate plants show a rapid seasonal turnover in various leaf traits and defenses. Such trends in plant defenses can potentially drive seasonal shifts in the specialization of insect herbivores. We quantified how non-volatile leaf metabolites, inducible volatile organic compounds (VOCs), C:N ratio and leaf toughness changed between the early, middle, and late seasons in five Salicaceae species and one Salix hybrid. We also explored seasonal trends in overall trait variation among the studied plants. We tested whether seasonal changes in dietary specialization of leaf-chewing larvae and adult beetles related to changes in the studied host-plant traits. Trait turnover occurred mainly through changes in VOCs and seasonal increase in traits that directly lower herbivore feeding efficiency. The overall variation in leaf traits was highest in the early season, with seasonal intraspecific variation being 33% smaller than the variation among species sampled at one time point. Although less frequently than we expected, the two groups of insect herbivores showed seasonal changes in specialization. The significant trends in herbivore specialization included peaks in the middle season for larval specialization based on VOCs and host phylogenetic relatedness and for adult beetle specialization based on C:N ratio plus leaf toughness. The detected species-specific trends in host-plant traits, their intraspecific variability, and differential trends among insect herbivores highlight the importance of considering seasonal variation when predicting trends in plant-herbivore interactions.

AB  - Green synthesis of metal and metal oxide nanoparticles has been widely studied recently. The cost-effectiveness, as well as the environment-friendly green approach to synthesizing nanoparticles, is a true achievement for the scientific community. In this study, tea (camellia sinensis) leaf extract was used to synthesize pure copper oxide nanoparticles (CuO NPs) and nickel doped copper oxide nanoparticles (Ni/CuO NPs). Synthesized nanoparticles were characterized with UV-visible spectroscopy, PL spectroscopy, PXRD, and FESEM. The optical study of the sample revealed a narrow band gap of 1.60 eV in CuO NPs and 1.98 eV in Ni/CuO NPs. The incorporation of nickel into copper oxide has increased its band gap significantly. FESEM images show a clear picture of spherical shaped CuO and Ni/CuO NPs. PXRD shows that both samples have fine crystalline structure. The photocatalytic degradation effects were tested using methylene blue (MB) dye in the presence of sunlight. Moreover, the antibacterial activities of the samples showed remarkable results against Gram-positive Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) bacteria. It is found that the nickel-doped CuO NPs are more effective in photocatalytic degradation and antibacterial activities than pure CuO NPs.<br />

AB  - Fluoride pollution is widely present in the living environment. As a critical period of brain development, the perinatal period is extremely vulnerable to fluoride. Studies have found that choline can protect the brain's memory and enhance the ability to focus. However, the effect of choline on perinatal fluoride-induced nerve damage remains unclear. Therefore, 32 Kunming newly conceived female mice and their off-spring mice were randomly divided into control, NaF, LC + NaF, and HC + NaF groups, and the HE staining, Y-maze test, RT-PCR, western blotting, immunohistochemistry, etc. were used in this study. The results showed that fluoride decreased the brain organ coefficients and brain protein content (p < 0.05, p < 0.01), and caused histomorphological damage in the hippocampus and cortex, which suggested that fluoride affected the development of the brain and damaged the brain. Moreover, the results of the Y-maze test showed that fluoride increased the number of learning days, error reaction time, and total reaction time, and decreased the AchE activity in the brain (p < 0.05, p < 0.01), which indicated that fluoride reduced the learning and memory ability of the mice. Besides, the results showed that fluoride decreased the mRNA and protein expression levels of alpha 4 beta 2 nAChRs and alpha 7 nAChRs in the hippocampus and cortex (p < 0.05, p < 0.01). However, perinatal choline supplementation reversed the aforementioned fluoride-induced changes. In short, these results demonstrated that choline alleviated perinatal fluoride-induced learning and memory impairment, which will provide a rationale for the mitigation and prevention of fluoride-induced brain damage.

AB  - Simple Summary Selenium (Se) plays an important role in many biological functions, especially in the immune system. We studied the effects of injectable Se supplementation on the immune status, blood parameters, body weights and average daily gain of lambs. The results of the study indicate that the Se preparation induced an increase in the values of the parameters of both non-specific and specific immunity. Lambs from the experimental group achieved higher body weights and daily gains. The present findings can contribute to a better understanding of the biological functions of Se and improve the efficacy of this mineral in livestock production. The aim of this study was to determine the effects of long-acting selenium (Se) preparation in sheep. The experimental material comprised Skudda ewes and their lambs. The animals were divided into two equal groups: C-control, and E-experimental. Between days 70 and 80 of pregnancy, group E ewes were injected with Se preparation (Barium Selenate Injection, BVP Animal Care, Ireland) at f 1 mL/50 kg body weight. Hematological, biochemical and immunological blood parameters as well as Se levels were analyzed in ewes. The growth rate of lambs, the dimensions of the musculus longissimus dorsi (MLD) cross-section, and fat thickness over the loin-eye area were also determined. It was found that barium selenate stimulated the mechanisms of humoral and cellular immunity. The injection was an effective form of Se supply, which was confirmed by its increased concentration in the blood serum of lactating ewes. The offspring of the experimental ewes were characterized by a faster growth rate, and they achieved significantly higher body weight (p <= 0.05) at 100 days of age. The lambs also had significantly higher parameters of MLD (p <= 0.05) at similar carcass fat content.

AB  - There is a sex difference in vulnerability to PTSD and in response to therapeutic interventions. Since relation between gonadal hormones and PTSD has been revealed, this study aimed to understand the severity of PTSDinduced impairments after ovarian hormone deficiency and the influence of exercise on PTSD accompanied by ovarian hormone deficiency. Female adult Wistar rats were subjected to ovariectomy, PTSD, or combination ovariectomy plus PTSD. Twenty days after ovariectomy, PTSD was induced by single prolonged stress (SPS) model. The exercise started 14 days after SPS and continued for 4 weeks. Thirty minutes moderate treadmill exercise was planned for 5 days per week. On day 65, after assessing rats using the elevated plus-maze (EPM) test, corticosterone, BDNF, and apoptotic markers were tested. p < 0.05 was considered as significant level. The results showed that ovariectomy worsened the effect of SPS on hippocampal BDNF and led to greater increase in serum corticosterone and hippocampal caspase 3 and BAX in SPS rats. Also, ovariectomy exacerbated anxiety like behavior in SPS rats. Exercise improved the alterations of hippocampal BDNF, corticosterone, caspase 3, and BAX in SPS ovariectomized rats. However, exercise had no statistically significant effect on anxiety-like behavior in this group. According to the results, exercise is effective to attenuate SPS-induced impairments in molecular and cellular responses even when the condition becomes more complicated due to ovarian hormone deficiency. However, exercise alone cannot help to improve behavior impairments in PTSD combined with an ovarian hormone deficiency. Therefore, exercise could likely be considered as a complementary intervention to strengthen other treatments.

AB  - Exposures to a hypomagnetic field can affect biological processes. Recently, it has been observed that hypomagnetic field exposure can adversely affect adult hippocampal neurogenesis and hippocampus-dependent cognition in mice. In the same study, the role of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in hypomagnetic field effects has been demonstrated. However, the mechanistic reasons behind this effect are not clear. This study proposes a radical pair mechanism based on a flavin-superoxide radical pair to explain the modulation of ROS production and the attenuation of adult hippocampal neurogenesis in a hypomagnetic field. The results of our calculations favor a singlet-born radical pair over a triplet-born radical pair. Our model predicts hypomagnetic field effects on the triplet/singlet yield of comparable strength as the effects observed in experimental studies on adult hippocampal neurogenesis. Our predictions are in qualitative agreement with experimental results on superoxide concentration and other observed ROS effects. We also predict the effects of applied magnetic fields and oxygen isotopic substitution on adult hippocampal neurogenesis.
   Author summary Exposure to magnetic fields influences many neurobiological processes. The formation of new neurons (neurogenesis) in the hippocampal region of the adult brain plays a crucial role in learning and memory. It can be adversely affected by shielding the earth's magnetic field, and this effect is intimately related to ROS concentration. In this study, we have developed a quantum mechanical model to explain this magnetic field dependence of adult hippocampal neurogenesis. Our model is also consistent with the observed ROS effects.

AB  - Harmonizing cell types across the single-cell community and assembling them into a common framework is central to building a standardized Human Cell Atlas. Here, we present CellHint, a predictive clustering tree -based tool to resolve cell-type differences in annotation resolution and technical biases across datasets. CellHint accurately quantifies cell-cell transcriptomic similarities and places cell types into a relationship graph that hierarchically defines shared and unique cell subtypes. Application to multiple immune datasets recapitulates expert-curated annotations. CellHint also reveals underexplored relationships between healthy and diseased lung cell states in eight diseases. Furthermore, we present a workflow for fast cross-dataset integration guided by harmonized cell types and cell hierarchy, which uncovers underappreciated cell types in adult human hippocampus. Finally, we apply CellHint to 12 tissues from 38 datasets, providing a deeply curated cross-tissue database with -3.7 million cells and various machine learning models for automatic cell annotation across human tissues.

AB  - Different nanoparticles (NPs) are currently being investigated for their potential role as cryoprotectant during semen cryopreservation in several mammalian species. It may be possible to improve semen quality following cryopreservation by supplementation of NPs in the freezing extenders. The present study was carried out in semen collected from four (4) Assam Hill Goat bucks (10 ejaculates per buck) to investigate the effect of supplementing zinc oxide (ZnO) and selenium (Se) NPs in Tris-citric acid-fructose yolk (TCFY) extender on in vitro sperm quality and in vivo fertility rate after freeze-thawing. The size morphology and zeta potential of ZnO and Se NPs were evaluated prior to its incorporation in the freezing extender. Qualified semen samples (> 70% progressive motility) were divided into five (5) aliquots and then diluted in TCFY extender containing ZnO and Se NP supplementation at different concentrations (T-0, control; T-1, 0.1 mg/mL ZnO NPs; T-2, 0.5 mg/mL ZnO NPs; T-3, 0.5 mu g/mL Se NPs; and T-4, 1 mu g/mL Se NPs). Diluted semen was packed in 0.25 mL straws and then stored in liquid nitrogen. After thawing, post-thaw in vitro sperm attributes were evaluated. Finally, the effect of NPs on in vivo fertility rate was checked in heat-synched does (n = 70) by artificial insemination (AI) using straws that showed superior results during the in vitro study. Results showed that ZnO and Se NPs were poly-crystalline in nature with particle size below 100 nm (nm). The evaluated post-thaw sperm in vitro attributes were significantly (p < 0.001) higher in T-1 in comparison to T-0. The antioxidant enzyme activities were significantly (p < 0.001) higher in T-1. Lipid peroxidation (LPO) profile was significantly (p < 0.001) lower in T-1. Sperm motility and mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) had a highly significant (r = 0.580, p < 0.05) association in T-1. No significant (p > 0.05) differences in pregnancy rates were recorded after AI in the different treatments. In conclusion, extender supplemented with 0.1 mg/mL ZnO NPs improved post-thaw semen quality of goat spermatozoa consequently by increasing activities of endogenous antioxidant enzymes thereby lowering LPO levels. However, improved in vitro outcomes might not correspond to improved field fertility outcomes.

AB  - The benefits of physical exercise (PE) on memory consolidation have been well -documented in both healthy and memory -impaired animals. However, the underlying mechanisms through which PE exerts these effects are still unclear. In this study, we aimed to investigate the role of hippocampal protein synthesis in memory modulation by acute PE in rats. After novel object recognition (NOR) training, rats were subjected to a 30 -min moderateintensity acute PE on the treadmill, while control animals did not undergo any procedures. Using anisomycin (ANI) and rapamycin (RAPA), compounds that inhibit protein synthesis through different mechanisms, we manipulated protein synthesis in the CA1 region of the hippocampus to examine its contribution to memory consolidation. Memory was assessed on days 1, 7, and 14 post -training. Our results showed that inhibiting protein synthesis by ANI or RAPA impaired NOR memory consolidation in control animals. However, acute PE prevented this impairment without affecting memory persistence. We also evaluated brain -derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) levels after acute PE at 0.5h, 2h, and 12h afterward and found no differences in levels compared to animals that did not engage in acute PE or were only habituated to the treadmill. Therefore, our findings suggest that acute PE could serve as a non -pharmacological intervention to enhance memory consolidation and prevent memory loss in conditions associated with hippocampal protein synthesis inhibition. This mechanism appears not to depend on BDNF synthesis in the early hours after exercise.

AB  - Serotonergic neurotransmission is crucial for emotion processing and is dysregulated in mood disorders. To analyze the pathophysiology of disease and develop effective pharmacological treatments, the suitability of the rat as a model for translational research must be continuously validated. In vitro receptor autoradiography was used to characterize (dis)similarities of regional and laminar serotonergic 5-HT1A and 5-HT2 receptor distributions between components of the human emotion regulation network and homologous rat areas, including areas of the lateral prefrontal, orbitofrontal anterior and midcingulate cortices, hippocampal cornu Ammonis (CA) and dentate gyrus (DG), and the accumbens, central amygdaloid, and mediodorsal thalamic nuclei. In both species, mean 5-HT1A densities were highest in cingulate area 25/infralimbic cortex and the hippocampus, and lowest in the accumbens. Whereas human CA presented significantly higher 5-HT1A density than DG, the opposite was found in rats. Across the cortical depth, in humans, layers I-III and V contained the highest and lowest 5-HT1A densities, respectively. In rats, layers I-II contained the lowest and layers V-VI the highest 5-HT1A values. Mean 5-HT2 densities were lower than 5-HT1A densities in all areas of both species, whereby layers III and VI contained the highest and lowest 5-HT2 densities, respectively. Rats presented a more widespread range of significant differences concerning the ratio between 5-HT1A and 5-HT2 receptors across examined areas than did humans. Concluding, this comparative study reveals species differences in 5-HT1A and 5-HT2 receptor densities in components of the emotion regulation network, which should be considered when using the rat as a model in the translational research of mood disorders.

AB  - Exposure to fine particulate matter (PM) is associated with the neurodegenerative diseases. Coke oven emissions (COEs) in occupational environment are important sources of PM. However, its neurotoxicity is still unclear. Therefore, evaluating the toxicological effects of COE on the nervous system is necessary. In the present study, we constructed mouse models of COE exposure by tracheal instillation. Mice exposed to COE showed signs of cognitive impairment. This was accompanied by a decrease in miR-145a-5p and an increase in SIK1 expression in the hippocampus, along with synaptic structural damage. Our results demonstrated that COE-induced miR-145a5p downregulation could increase the expression of SIK1 and phosphorylated SIK1, inhibiting the cAMP/PKA/ CREB pathway by activating PDE4D, which was associated with reduced synaptic structural plasticity. Furthermore, restoring of miR-145a-5p expression based on COE exposure in HT22 cells could partially reversed the negative effects of COE exposure through the SIK1/PDE4D/cAMP axis. Collectively, our findings link epigenetic regulation with COE-induced neurotoxicity and imply that miR-145a-5p could be an early diagnostic marker for neurological diseases in patients with COE occupational exposure.

AB  - Harderian gland (HG) plays an important role in the physiological adaptation to terrestrial life, however, the mechanisms underlying the changes in the structure and function of the HG during aging remain unclear. This study investigated autophagy and apoptosis in the HG of striped dwarf hamsters (Cricetulus barabensis) of different ages (sub-adult, adult and aged groups) in both males and females. The results showed that LC3II/LC3I and puncta of LC3 were significantly higher in adult and aged individuals than sub-adults, whereas P62 decreased with age. Bax/bcl2was the highest in sub-adults of male and female individuals. Caspase3 activity was the highest in sub-adults of male and female individuals, and the citrate synthase activity was highest in subadults of females. ATP synthase, citrate synthase, dynamin-related protein 1 and mitochondrial fission factor (Mff) were the highest in sub-adults of females. Peptidylglycine alpha-amidating monooxygenase were the highest in the aged group, and those of gonadotropin-releasing hormone was the highest in the adult group. LC3II/LC3I, P62, Drp1, Fis, and bax/bcl2 were higher in males than that in females. These results suggest that apoptosis mainly affects growth and development in the HG, whereas autophagy affects aging. The difference of the HG weight and mitochondrial function between sexes is mainly related to the apoptosis.

AB  - Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE, EC 3.4.15.1) plays a significant role in blood pressure regulation and inhibition of this enzyme is one of the significant drug targets for the treatment of hypertension. In this work, ACE was purified from sheep kidneys with the affinity chromatography method in one step. The purity and molecular weight of ACE were designated using the SDS-PAGE method and observed two bands at around 60 kDa and 70 kDa on the gel. The effects of nicotinamide (vitamin B-3) and reduced glutathione (GSH) peptide on purified ACE were researched. Nicotinamide and GSH peptide on purified ACE showed an inhibition effect. IC50 values for nicotinamide and GSH were calculated as 14.3 mu M and 7.3 mu M, respectively. Type of inhibition and K-i values for nicotinamide and GSH from the Lineweaver-Burk graph were determined. The type of inhibition for nicotinamide and GSH was determined as non-competitive inhibition. Ki value was calculated as 15.4 mu M for nicotinamide and 6.7 mu M for GSH. Also, GSH peptide showed higher inhibitory activity on ACE activity than nicotinamide. In this study, it was concluded that nicotinamide and GSH peptide compounds, which show an inhibition effect on ACE activity, may have both protective and therapeutic effects against hypertension.

AB  - Endothelial cells (ECs), the primary component of the vasculature, play a crucial role in neovascularization. However, the number of endogenous ECs is inadequate for both experimental purposes and clinical applications. Porcine ovarian putative stem cells (poPSCs), although not pluripotent, are characterized by great plasticity. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate whether poPSCs have the potential to differentiate into cells of endothelial lineage. poPSCs were immunomagnetically isolated from postnatal pig ovaries based on the presence of SSEA-4 protein. Expression of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) markers after pre-culture, both at the level of mRNA: ITGB1, THY, and ENG and corresponding protein: CD29, CD90, and CD105 were significantly higher compared to the control ovarian cortex cells. To differentiate poPSCs into ECs, inducing medium containing vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF), insulin-like growth factor (IGF), epidermal growth factor (EGF), ascorbic acid, and heparin was applied. After 14 days, poPSC differentiation into ECs was confirmed by immunofluorescence staining for vascular endothelial cadherin (VECad) and vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-2 (VEGFR-2). Semi-quantitative WB analysis of these proteins confirmed their high abundance. Additionally, qRT-PCR showed that mRNA expression of corresponding marker genes: CDH5, KDR was significantly higher compared with undifferentiated poPSCs. Finally, EC functional status was confirmed by the migration test that revealed that they were capable of positive chemotaxis, while tube formation assay demonstrated their ability to develop capillary networks. In conclusion, our results provided evidence that poPSCs may constitute the MSC population in the ovary and confirmed that they might be a potential source of ECs for tissue engineering.

AB  - In order to achieve the long-term management of endometriosis, a more economical and environmentally friendly material, ethylene vinyl acetate (EVA), was used to prepare a intravaginal ring with anastrozole (ATZ). This paper has compared the pharmacokinetic parameters with oral tablets (Aida (R)) in mini pigs and evaluated the uterine targeted effect and mucosal irritation of the ring. A bioassay method was developed and validated for the determination of ATZ in mini pigs. The determination of ATZ was achieved by LC-MS/MS using terfenadine as the internal standard. Separation was achieved on a Kinetex-C-18 110A chromatographic column (3 x 30 mm, 2.6 mu m; Phenomenex) with a gradient mobile phase consisting of methanol (0.1% formic acid) and water (0.1% formic acid). The method has been proved to be scientific and sensitive through methodological validation and can be easily and quickly applied to the determination of the content of anastrozole in mini pigs. The pharmacokinetic test results show that there was no significant difference in pharmacokinetic parameters between the two formulations. The intravaginal ring has a passive targeting effect on the uterus, and its mucosal irritation is acceptable. The intravaginal ring provides a new method for long-term management of endometriosis.

AB  - The periaqueductal gray matter (PAG) is an essential structure involved in the elaboration of defensive responses, such as when facing predators and conspecific aggressors. Using a prey vs predator paradigm, we aimed to evaluate the PAG activation pattern evoked by unconditioned and conditioned fear situations. Adult male guinea pigs were confronted either by a Boa constrictor constrictor wild snake or by the aversive experimental context. After the behavioral test, the rodents were euthanized and the brain prepared for immunohistochemistry for Fos protein identification in different PAG columns. Although Fos-protein-labeled neurons were found in different PAG columns after both unconditioned and conditioned fear situations at the caudal level of the PAG, we found greater activation of the lateral column compared to the ventrolateral and dorsomedial columns after predator exposure. Moreover, the lateral column of the PAG showed higher Fos-labeled cells at the caudal level compared to the same area at the rostral level. The present results suggested that there are different activation patterns of PAG columns during unconditioned and conditioned fear in guinea pigs. It is possible to hypothesize that the recruitment of specific PAG columns depended on the nature of the threatening stimulus.

AB  - Many specialized herbivorous insects sequester single classes of toxic secondary metabolites from their host plants as protection against natural enemies. If and how herbivores can use multiple classes of plant toxins across the large chemical diversity of plants for self-protection is unknown. We show that the polyphagous adults of the beetle Diabrotica virgifera are capable of selectively accumulating benzoxazinoids, cucurbitacins, and glucosinolates but not cyanogenic glycosides. Female beetles transfer the sequestered defense metabolites into their eggs, protecting them against generalist predators. Eggs containing a mixture of toxins are better protected than eggs with individual toxins. This work shows how herbivores can exploit plant chemical diversity to their own benefit as a novel adaptive mechanism that contributes to the structuring of multitrophic interaction networks.

AB  - There is a body of evidence to suggest that chronic stress modulates neurochemical homeostasis, alters neuronal structure, inhibits neurogenesis and contributes to development of mental disorders. Chronic stress-associated mental disorders present common symptoms of cognitive impairment and depression with complex disease mechanisms. P-coumaric acid (p-CA), a natural phenolic compound, is widely distributed in vegetables, cereals and fruits. p-CA exhibits a wide range of health-related effects, including anti-oxidative-stress, anti-mutagenesis, anti-inflammation and anti-cancer activities. The current study aims to evaluate the therapeutic potential of p-CA against stress-associated mental disorders. We assessed the effect of p-CA on cognitive deficits and depressionlike behavior in mice exposed to chronic restraint stress (CRS); we used network pharmacology, biochemical and molecular biological approaches to elucidate the underlying molecular mechanisms. CRS exposure caused memory impairments and depression-like behavior in mice; p-CA administration attenuated these CRS-induced memory deficits and depression-like behavior. Network pharmacology analysis demonstrated that p-CA was possibly involved in multiple targets and a variety of signaling pathways. Among them, the protein kinase A (PKA) - cAo-response element binding protein (CREB) - brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) signaling pathway was predominant and further characterized. The levels of PKA, phosphorylated CREB (pCREB) and BDNF were significantly lowered in the hippocampus of CRS mice, suggesting disruption of the PKA-CREB-BDNF signaling pathway; p-CA treatment restored the signaling pathway. Furthermore, CRS upregulated expression of proinflammatory cytokines in hippocampus, while p-CA reversed the CRS-induced effects. Our findings suggest that p-CA will offer therapeutic benefit to patients with stress-associated mental disorders.

AB  - Maintaining proper interior thermal condition during transportation is vital for animal welfare and sustainability of livestock supply chain. This study investigated the air temperatures inside a multi-deck naturally ventilated vehicle when transporting weaner pigs under warmer weather condition by using computational fluid dynamics (CFD). Predictive models of interior air temperatures were developed by using response surface methodology (RSM) and gradient boosting machine (GBM) with the inputs of exterior air temperature, vehicle speed, wind speed, incident wind angle and opening height of shutter based on the dataset generated from CFD simulations and validated as well. The results showed that predictive models developed by RSM were sufficient for predicting the interior air temperatures of moving naturally ventilated livestock vehicle, and GMB could improve the prediction accuracy moderately. RSM models indicated that the interior temperatures increased linearly with the increase in exterior air temperature, opening height and wind speed while insensitive to vehicle speed. GMB model indicated that the plane-average air temperature of front compartments was 2.2 degrees C higher than those of the other two compartments at the same deck, and the air temperature increased slightly from the bottom to the upper deck. High spatial variations in air temperature were observed inside the moving livestock vehicle, which poses a challenge on monitoring interior air temperatures. The developed models are expected to predict the interior air temperatures and provide suggestion on regulating ventilation systems in advance. Further study could be conducted to investigate the optimum control of opening for improving the natural ventilation potential.

AB  - Anthonomus eugenii Cano (Coleoptera: Curculionidae) is a key pest of cultivated peppers (Capsicum species) in tropical and subtropical America. Here we evaluated the effect of five pepper varieties on the susceptibility of A. eugenii to the parasitoids Bracon sp. (Hymenoptera: Braconidae), Eupelmus cushmani (Crawford) (Hymenoptera: Eupelmidae), and Jaliscoa hunteri Crawford (Hymenoptera: Pteromalidae). Potential parasitism was estimated by comparative analysis of parasitoid ovipositor size and the depth to which host larvae develop inside the fruit. Highest potential parasitism rates were achieved by Bracon sp. and E. cushmani on arbol and habanero peppers (84-99%) while the lowest rates were achieved by J. hunteri on serrano, bell, and jalapeno (7-18%). To validate potential parasitism rates, the actual parasitism rate by Bracon sp. and J. hunteri on three varieties of peppers was assessed. Actual parasitism rates of A. eugenii larvae in arbol were similar for Bracon sp. and J. hunteri (33%), while on bell and jalapeno Bracon sp. achieved 24% and 13% parasitism and J. hunteri achieved 14% and 8%, respectively. In most cases, actual parasitism was lower than estimated potential parasitism, although the latter had a notable predictive power (predicted R-2 = 0.84). Results showed that the host was more vulnerable on small-fruited varieties because larvae were closer to the pericarp and could be reached by parasitoid ovipositors; likewise, in varieties with little placenta and seed, some larvae fed in the pericarp, where they were more vulnerable.

AB  - Antimicrobial resistance is one of the biggest health challenges nowadays. Probiotics are promising candidates as feed additives contributing to the health of the gastrointestinal tract. The beneficial effect of probiotics is species/strain specific; the potential benefits need to be individually assessed for each probiotic strain or species. We established a co-culture model, in which gastrointestinal infection was modeled using Escherichia coli (E. coli) and Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium (S. enterica serovar Typhimurium). Using intestinal porcine epithelial cells (IPEC-J2), the effects of pre-, co-, and post-treatment with Lactobacillus (L.) rhamnosus on the barrier function, intracellular (IC) reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, proinflammatory cytokine (IL-6 and IL-8) response, and adhesion inhibition were tested. E. coli- and S. Typhimurium-induced barrier impairment and increased ROS production could be counteracted using L. rhamnosus (p < 0.01). S. Typhimurium-induced IL-6 production was reduced via pre-treatment (p < 0.05) and post-treatment (p < 0.01); increased IL-8 secretion was decreased via pre-, co-, and post-treatment (p < 0.01) with L. rhamnosus. L. rhamnosus demonstrated significant inhibition of adhesion for both S. Typhimurium (p < 0.001) and E. coli (p < 0.001 in both pre-treatment and post-treatment; p < 0.05 in co-treatment). This study makes a substantial contribution to the understanding of the specific benefits of L. rhamnosus. Our findings can serve as a basis for further in vivo studies carried out in pigs and humans.

AB  - Circular RNA (circRNA) is a class of non-coding RNA (ncRNA) that plays an important regulatory role in various biological processes of the organisms and has a major function in muscle growth and development. However, its molecular mechanisms of how it regulates pork quality remain unclear at present. In this study, we compared the longissimus dorsi (LD) muscle expression profiles of Queshan Black (QS) and Large White (LW) pigs to explore the role of circRNAs in meat quality using transcriptome sequencing. A total of 62 differentially expressed circRNAs (DECs), including 46 up- and 16 down-regulated, 39 differentially expressed miRNAs (DEmiRNAs), including 21 up- and 18 down-regulated and 404 differentially expressed mRNAs (DEMs), including 174 up- and 230 down-regulated were identified, and most circRNAs were composed of exons. Our results indicated that the DEC parent genes and DEMs were enriched in the positive regulation of fast-twitch skeletal muscle fiber contraction, relaxation of skeletal muscle, regulation of myoblast proliferation, AMPK signaling pathway, Wnt and Jak-STAT signaling pathway. Furthermore, circSETBP1/ssc-miR-149/PIK3CD and circGUCY2C/ssc-miR-425-3p/CFL1 were selected by constructing the competitive endogenous RNA (ceRNA) regulatory network, circSETBP1, circGUCY2C, PIK3CD and CFL1 had low expression level in QS, while ssc-miR-149 and ssc-miR-425-3p had higher expression level than LW, our analysis revealed that circSETBP1, circGUCY2C, ssc-miR-149, ssc-miR-425-3p, PIK3CD and CFL1 were associated with lipid regulation, cell proliferation and differentiation, so the two ceRNAs regulatory networks may play an important role in regulating intramuscular fat (IMF) deposition, thereby affecting pork quality. In conclusion, we described the gene regulation by the circRNA-miRNA-mRNA ceRNA networks by comparing QS and LW pigs LD muscle transcriptome, and the two new circRNA-associated ceRNA regulatory networks that could help to elucidate the formation mechanism of pork quality. The results provide a theoretical basis for further understanding the genetic mechanism of meat quality formation.

AB  - A new and uniquely structured matrix of mammalian phenotypes, MaTrics (Mammalian Tains for Comparative Genomics) in a digital form is presented. By focussing on mammalian species for which genome assemblies are available, MaTrics provides an interface between mammalogy and comparative genomics.
   MaTrics was developed within a project aimed to find genetic causes of phenotypic traits of mammals using Forward Genomics. This approach requires genomes and comprehensive and recorded information on homologous phenotypes that are coded as discrete categories in a matrix. MaTrics is an evolving online resource providing information on phenotypic traits in numeric code; traits are coded either as absent/present or with several states as multistate. The state record for each species is linked to at least one reference (e.g., literature, photographs, histological sections, CT scans, or museum specimens) and so MaTrics contributes to digitalization of museum collections. Currently, MaTrics covers 147 mammalian species and includes 231 characters related to structure, morphology, physiology, ecology, and ethology and available in a machine actionable NEXUS-format*. Filling MaTrics revealed substantial knowledge gaps, highlighting the need for phenotyping efforts. Studies based on selected data from MaTrics and using Forward Genomics identified associations between genes and certain phenotypes ranging from lifestyles (e.g., aquatic) to dietary specializations (e.g., herbivory, carnivory). These findings motivate the expansion of phenotyping in MaTrics by filling research gaps and by adding taxa and traits. Only databases like MaTrics will provide machine actionable information on phenotypic traits, an important limitation to genomics. MaTrics is available within the data repository Morph.D.Base (www.morphdbase.de).

AB  - Microgreens are a new, rapidly growing group of foodstuffs. The decorative function of these is often accompanied by their use in traditional dishes. As microgreens are eaten at very early stages, when the development of the epidermis is at its minimum, the bioavailability of minerals will be found to be higher in microgreens then in mature vegetables. So, microgreens can be an excellent functional food, especially for mineral-deficient populations, although they can also be a source of contaminants such as heavy metals or nitrates and nitrites. The purpose of this study was to measure the levels of selected heavy metals (i.e., cadmium, arsenic, lead, chromium, aluminium, zinc, copper, cobalt, molybdenum, manganese, vanadium, boron, antimony, thallium, titanium and strontium), as well as nitrates and nitrites, in microgreens at various stage of vegetation, using uncommon oilseed plants like nigella-Nigella sativa L., safflower-Carthamus tinctorius L., and camelina-Camelina sativa L. The examined microgreens of rare oilseed plants may be a source of contaminants and nitrates. The mineral profile of these plants is mainly determined by their genotype. Microgreens' cultivation involves compliance with safety standards and replicable conditions to guarantee that the highest nutritional value is reached at the lowest possible contaminant level.

AB  - Niedenzuella (Tetrapterys) multiglandulosa, a vine plant found in Brazil, has been correlated to outbreaks of poisoning in cattle and buffaloes, generating economic losses related to the death due to heart failure, miscarriage, abortion, stillbirth, and neonatal mortality. The aim of this study was to examine the embryotoxic potential of the aqueous plant extract on in vitro bovine embryos. In vitro study was performed in five replicates of bovine embryo culture assigned in two groups: control, in vitro embryo culture medium without the aqueous plant extract; treated group, with addition of 2.7mg/mL of aqueous plant extract (10%) to the embryo culture on the sixth day of culture. Cleavage rate was evaluated at day 2 of the cell culture. Viability, hatchability and underdevelopment of blastocysts on the seventh, eighth, and ninth days (D7, D8, and D9, respectively) of culture were assessed under stereoscopic microscope. On day 7, blastocysts were submitted to TUNEL assay to determine apoptotic index. In vitro exposure of bovine embryos to of N. multiglandulosa resulted in reduced embryo development and survival, evaluated by dark cytoplasm indicating poor morphology and poor quality with marked reduction of hatchability. We observed a significant reduction of blastocyst production/number of cleaved embryos (60.6% vs 41.5%); reduction of blastocysts production/total number of matured bovine oocytes (35.1% vs 21.3%); and embryonic hatching rates (38.0% vs 10.0%). However, no effects were observed on the apoptotic rate. In conclusion, aqueous extract of N. multiglandulosa leaves reduces bovine embryo viability in vitro, suggesting possible detrimental effects on embryo development.

AB  - "Latxa" sheep wool is rough, and it is not used in the textile industry because the fiber diameter is high compared with other wool fibers. Nowadays, this wool is considered as disposal and, with the aim to give it value, new uses must be explored. In the current work, the "Latxa" sheep wool fiber was evaluated as poly(lactic acid) (PLA) polymer reinforcement. With the objective to optimize fiber/matrix adhesion, fibers were surface modified with peroxide. Oxidation treatment with peroxide led to chemical modifications of the wool fibers that improved the fiber/PLA adhesion, but the strength values achieved for the composites were lower compared to the neat PLA ones. The mechanical properties obtained in the current work were compared with the literature data of the PLA composites reinforced with vegetable fibers. The wool fibers showed inferior mechanical properties compared to the vegetable fiber counterparts. However, the preliminary results indicated that the incorporation of wool fibers to PLA reduced the flammability of composites.

AB  - In the myocardium, the TPM1 gene expresses two isoforms of tropomyosin (Tpm), alpha (aTpm; Tpm 1.1) and kappa (?Tpm; Tpm 1.2). ?Tpm is the result of alternative splicing of the TPM1 gene. We studied the structural features of ?Tpm and its regulatory function in the atrial and ventricular myocardium using an in vitro motility assay. We tested the possibility of Tpm heterodimer formation from a- and ?-chains. Our result shows that the formation of a?Tpm heterodimer is thermodynamically favorable, and in the myocardium, ?Tpm most likely exists as a?Tpm heterodimer. Using circular dichroism, we compared the thermal unfolding of aaTpm, a?Tpm, and ??Tpm. ??Tpm had the lowest stability, while the a?Tpm was more stable than aaTpm. The differential scanning calorimetry results indicated that the thermal stability of the N-terminal part of ??Tpm is much lower than that of aaTpm. The affinity of aaTpm and ??Tpm to F-actin did not differ, and a?Tpm interacted with F-actin significantly worse. The troponin T1 fragment enhanced the ??Tpm and a?Tpm affinity to F-actin. ??Tpm differently affected the calcium regulation of the interaction of pig and rat ventricular myosin with the thin filament. With rat myosin, calcium sensitivity of thin filaments containing ??Tpm was significantly lower than that with aaTpm and with pig myosin, and the sensitivity did not differ. Thin filaments containing ??Tpm and a?Tpm were better activated by pig atrial myosin than those containing aaTpm.

AB  - The present study was designed to evaluate the effect of plant bioactive compound methyl jasmonate on learning and memory, anxiety-like behaviors, and brain oxidative stress in rats. It has been indicated that methyl jasmonate stimulates calcium-binding protein expression and increases intracellular calcium (Ca2+). Therefore, we investigated the potential role of L-type calcium channel on methyl jasmonate effects. The animals were intracerebroventriculary (i.c.v.) injected with different doses of methyl jasmonate (0.5, 2.5, and 5 mu g/rat). L-type calcium channel blocker (nifedipine 5 mu g/rat, i.c.v.) was injected 30 min before methyl jasmonate (5 mu g/rat). Shuttle box apparatus was used to evaluate passive avoidance memory. Anxiety-like behaviors were assessed by open field and elevated plus maze tests. Lastly, oxidative stress-related indices were assessed in hippocampus and prefrontal cortex. The data showed that methyl jasmonate dose-dependently could improve passive avoidance learning and memory and reduce anxiogenic behaviors. The methyl jasmonate effects were significantly prevented by nifedipine. Furthermore, central microinjection of methyl jasmonate significantly decreased hydrogen peroxide concentration, and increased reactive oxygen species scavenger activity (catalase and peroxide enzymes) in rats' hippocampus as well as prefrontal cortex. Indeed, the results indicated that the beneficial effects of methyl jasmonate on learning and memory and anxiety might be partly associated with L-type calcium channel and partly on the inhibition of oxidant indices.

AB  - The quality of pre-implantation embryos could affect developmental efficiency after embryo transfer. However, the assessment of pre-implantation embryos was unsatisfactory, especially in pig embryos to date. Therefore, this study was designed to investigate available and applicable parameters that indicate developmental potential and quality of porcine pre-implantation embryos produced by handmade cloning (HMC), and parthenogenetic activation without zona pellucida (PAZF) and with zona pellucida (PAZI). Firstly, a common division behaviour was detected, that is the formation of uneven division with two unequal size blastomeres (UD 2-cell), especially in HMC embryos; then, the proportion of UD 2-cell was found to be significantly higher than that of even division with equal size blastomeres (ED 2-cell) (72.56 +/- 4.56 vs. 24.57 +/- 1.92). The formation of UD 2-cell might be due to the spindle migration along the long axis in 1-cell stage, and the cleavage furrow was not formed in the centre of cytoplasm. In the two sister blastomeres of UD 2-cell, uneven distribution of organelles (mitochondria and lipid droplet) was observed with lower proportion in the smaller one (p < .05). Although no difference in blastocyst rate was observed between UD and ED 2-cell embryos, the cell number per blastocyst from UD 2-cell embryos was lower than that from ED 2-cell embryos (44.15 +/- 2.05 vs. 51.55 +/- 1.83). Besides, because of non-synchronized division of each blastomere, the following three cleavage routes were observed in all HMC/PAZF/PAZI embryos: T1 (2-cell -> 3-cell -> 4-cell -> >= 5-cell -> morula -> blastocyst), T2 (2-cell -> 3-cell -> 4-cell -> morula -> blastocyst) and T3 (2-cell -> 3-cell/4-cell -> morula -> blastocyst). Therefore, in pig in vitro-produced embryos, division behaviours of uneven volume of cytoplasm and non-synchronized cell cycles were observed at the early embryonic developmental stage, which might be another potential factor to evaluate embryonic development.

AB  - Milk adulteration is a serious problem that threatens public safety in today's world. Various chemical reactions can be used to detect adulterants on a qualitative level but they are often tedious and expensive. The quantitative overview of milk adulterants can, on the other hand, be easily effected using surface plasmon resonance (SPR), a very sensitive optical tool used for investigating surface interactions. Economic and chemical adulterants (water, urea, and H2O2) in milk specimens can be detected using the SPR optical sensor at even parts per million levels. The optical and dielectric properties of milk samples are also knownd for various adulterants. For sensing different concentrations of H2O2 the sensitivity of an SPR-based optical sensor is 0.145 degrees/(mg ml(-1)). The obtained results in the present work clearly show the possible application of the SPR technique as a sensor for the detection of adulterants in milk using prism/Au/sample system.

AB  - Background: Post-stroke depression (PSD) affects approximately one-third of stroke survivors, leading to adverse outcomes in rehabilitation, reduced quality of life, and increased mortality rates. Despite these implications, the underlying causes of PSD remain unclear, posing challenges for prevention and treatment. Echinacoside (ECH), a natural compound with known neuroprotective and antidepressant properties, holds significant therapeutic potential for PSD. However, the precise mechanism of its action remains unknown. Purpose: To unravel the specific mechanism through which ECH alleviates PSD by exploring the intricate interplay between ECH and Nrf2, as well as its impact on the BDNF/TrkB signaling axis. Study design and methods: A rat PSD model was established though middle cerebral artery occlusion coupled with chronic unpredictable mild stress, followed by ECH treatment. The rats ' depressive state was evaluated using the sucrose preference test and force swimming test. Brain damage was assessed through TTC staining, Nissl staining, and TUNEL assay. The multifaceted mechanism of ECH in PSD was investigated using immunofluorescence, immunohistochemistry, RT-qPCR, dual-luciferase assay, and western blotting. Additionally, the interaction between ECH and Nrf2 was explored through molecular docking and microscale thermophoresis. Results: Our findings unveiled a novel facet of ECH action, demonstrating its unique ability to upregulate Nrf2 through acetylation within the hippocampus of PSD-affected rats ( p < 0.05). Moreover, ECH showcased its distinctive potential by enhancing BDNF transcriptional activity, activating the BDNF/TrkB signaling axis, and orchestrating a comprehensive response against oxidative stress and apoptosis, thereby alleviating PSD symptoms in rats ( p < 0.05). Conclusions: This study not only provides insights into the pivotal role of Nrf2 in mediating the BDNF/TrkB axis activation by ECH but also highlights the novelty of ECH 's mechanism in addressing PSD. The elucidation of these unique aspects positions ECH as a groundbreaking candidate for further exploration and development in the realm of PSD intervention.

AB  - The paraventricular thalamic nucleus (PVT) is a small but highly connected nucleus of the dorsal midline thalamus. The PVT has garnered recent attention as a context-sensitive node within the thalamocortical arousal system that modulates state-dependent motivated behaviors. Once considered related to generalized arousal responses with non-specific impacts on behavior, accumulating evidence bolsters the contemporary view that discrete midline thalamic subnuclei belong to specialized corticolimbic and corticostriatal circuits related to attention, emotions, and cognition. However, the functional connectivity patterns of the human PVT have yet to be mapped. Here, we combined high-quality, high-resolution 7T and 3T resting state MRI data from 121 young adult participants from the Human Connectome Project (HCP) and thalamic subnuclei atlas masks to investigate resting state functional connectivity of the human PVT. The 7T results demonstrated extensive positive functional connectivity with the brainstem, midbrain, ventral and dorsal medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), anterior and posterior cingulate, ventral striatum, hippocampus, and amygdala. These connections persist upon controlling for functional connectivity of the rest of the thalamus. Whole-brain contrasts provided further evidence that, compared to three nearby midline thalamic subnuclei, functional connectivity of the PVT is strong with the hippocampus, amygdala, ventral and dorsal mPFC, and middle temporal gyrus. These findings suggest that, even during rest, the human PVT is functionally coupled with many regions known to be structurally connected to rodent and non-human primate PVT. Further, cosine similarity analysis results suggested the PVT is integrated into the default mode network (DMN), an intrinsic connectivity network associated with episodic memory and self-referential thought. The current work provides a much-needed foundation for ongoing and future work examining the functional roles of the PVT in humans.

AB  - Neuroadaptive changes in the hippocampus underlie addictive -like behaviors in humans or animals chronically exposed to cocaine. miR-181a, which is widely expressed in the hippocampus, acts as a regulator for synaptic plasticity, while its role in drug reinstatement is unclear. In this study, we found that miR-181a regulates the reinstatement of cocaine conditioned place preference(CPP), and altered miR-181a expression changes the complexity of hippocampal neurons and the density and morphology of dendritic spines. By using a luciferase gene reporter, we found that miR-181a targets PRKAA1, an upstream molecule in the mTOR pathway. High miR181a expression reduced the expression of the PRKAA1 mRNA and promoted mTOR activity and the reinstatement of cocaine CPP. These results indicate that miR-181a is involved in neuronal structural plasticity induced by reinstatement of cocaine CPP, possibly through the activation of the mTOR signaling pathway. This study provides new microRNA targets and a theoretical foundation for the prevention of cocaine -induced reinstatement.

AB  - Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a devastating clinical condition characterized by an abrupt loss of renal function. The pathophysiology of AKI involves diverse processes and elements, of which survival and regeneration have been established to be significant hallmarks. And early studies have confirmed the fundamental role of FGFs in the regulation of AKI pathology, although the association between FGF18 and AKI still remains elusive. Our study demonstrates a substantial up-regulation of FGF18 in the renal tubules of mice subjected to ischemia. Notably, targeted overexpression of FGF18 effectively mitigates the impairment of kidney function induced by AKI. Mechanistically, FGF18 facilitates cell proliferation and anti-apoptosis in RTECs by enhancing the expression of YAP and facilitating its translocation to the nucleus. Aside from that, we also discovered that the substantial expression of FGF18 under ischemic conditions is HIF-1 alpha dependent.

AB  - To create an ornamental plant that repels pests, transgenic torenia (Torenia fournieri Lind.) plants were generated expressing the 1,8-cineole synthase (CINS) from lavandin (Lavandula x intermedia Emeric ex Loisel.) under the control of the petal-specific MYB1 promoter of morning glory (Ipomoea nil L.). All the regenerated transgenic plants showed CINS expression in petals but did not show morphological differences compared with non-transgenic plants. In regenerated transgenic CINS6 and CINS8 plants, which exhibited higher expression of CINS than the other transgenic plants, 1,8-cineole was detected in the head space above whole plants. Furthermore, in a two-choice assay using florets, CINS6 petals demonstrated significant repellent effects against western flower thrips (Frankliniella occidentalis (Pergrande)) compared with the non-transgenic control petals. These results suggest another way to prevent pest damage by herbivores in ornamental plants by releasing transgenic volatile compounds from florets.

AB  - Exposure to fine particulate matter (PM2.5) is implicated in neurodevelopmental disorders including cognitive decline, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, and autism spectrum disorder. However, the specific molecular mechanisms by which PM2.5 impacts neurodevelopment are poorly understood. Accordingly, in the present study, the role of protein kinase A (PKA)/cAMP response element binding protein (CREB)/brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) signaling in PM2.5-induced neurodevelopmental damage was investigated using primary cultured hippocampal neurons. When hippocampal neurons cultured for 3 days in vitro (DIV3) were exposed to PM2.5 for 24 h and 96 h, neuronal viability decreased by 18.8% and 32.7% respectively, percentage of TUNEL-positive neurons increased by 78.5% and 64.0% separately, caspase-9 expression increased, lower postsynaptic density and shorter active zones were observed by transmission electron microscopy, expression of synapse-related proteins including postsynaptic density-95 (PSD95), growth associated protein-43 (GAP43), and synaptophysin (SYP) were decreased, and the phosphorylation levels of PKA, CREB, and BDNF expression also decreased. However, the PM2.5-induced neuronal damage could be ameliorated or aggravated to varying degrees by up- or downregulation of the PKA/CREB/BDNF signaling pathway, respectively.
   Our results indicate that PM2.5 exposure exerts neurodevelopmental toxicity as indicated by lower viability, apoptosis, and synaptic damage in primary cultured hippocampal neurons, and that the PKA/CREB/BDNF pathways could play a vital role in PM2.5-mediated neurodevelopmental toxicity.

Cardiac acclimatization at high altitude in two different ethnicity groups. High Alt Med Biol. 22:58-69, 2021.
   Introduction: High altitude (HA) exposure causes substantial increase in pulmonary artery pressure (PAP) and resistance. However, the effects of HA hypoxia exposure on cardiac function remain incompletely understood. Studies evaluating interethnic differences in cardiac functions in response to HA exposure are lacking. We aimed to compare the cardiac performance in Indian versus Kyrgyz healthy lowland subjects over the course of a 3-week HA exposure at 4,111 m.
   Methodology: Ten Indians and 20 Kyrgyz subjects were studied to assess cardiac acclimatization noninvasively by echocardiography in two different ethnic groups for 3 weeks of stay at HA. Pulmonary hemodynamics, right and left ventricular functions were evaluated at basal and on days 3, 7, 14, and 21 of HA exposure and on day 3 of deinduction.
   Results: HA exposure significantly increased PAP, pulmonary vascular resistance, cardiac output (CO), and heart rates (HRs) in both groups. Tricuspid regurgitant gradient increased significantly in both the group at day 3 versus basal; 38.9 mmHg (31.8, 42.9) versus 21.9 mmHg (19.5, 22.6) in Kyrgyz; and 34.1 mmHg (30.2, 38.5) versus 20.4 mmHg (19.7, 21.3) in Indians. HR increased significantly in Indians at day 3 and 7, whereas in Kyrgyz throughout exposure. CO increased significantly in both groups at day 3 versus basal with 5.9 L/min (5.5, 6.4) versus 5.1 L/min (4.4, 5.9) in Kyrgyz, and 5.7 L/min (5.56, 5.98) versus 4.9 L/min (4.1, 5.3) in Indians. Both groups exhibited preserved right ventricular diastolic and systolic functions at HAs. HA exposure changed the left ventricular diastolic parameters only in Kyrgyz subjects with impaired mitral inflow E/A, but not in Indian subjects. All cardiac changes induced at HAs have been recovered fully upon deinduction in both, except lateral-septal A ', which remained low in Indians.
   Conclusion: Although pulmonary hemodynamics responses were similar in both groups, there were differences in cardiac functional parameters between the two in response to HA exposure that may be accounted to ethnic variation.

AB  - Brain disturbances during development can have a lasting impact on neural function and behavior. Seizures during this critical period are linked to significant long-term consequences such as neurodevelopmental disorders, cognitive impairments, and psychiatric symptoms, resulting in a complex spectrum of multimorbidity. The hippocampus-prefrontal cortex (HPC-PFC) circuit emerges as a potential common link between such disorders. However, the mechanisms underlying these outcomes and how they relate to specific behavioral alterations are unclear. We hypothesized that specific dysfunctions of hippocampal-cortical communication due to early-life seizure would be associated with distinct behavioral alterations observed in adulthood. Here, we performed a multilevel study to investigate behavioral, electrophysiological, histopathological, and neurochemical long-term consequences of early-life Status epilepticus in male rats. We show that adult animals submitted to early-life seizure (ELS) present working memory impairments and sensorimotor disturbances, such as hyperlocomotion, poor sensorimotor gating, and sensitivity to psychostimulants despite not exhibiting neuronal loss. Surprisingly, cognitive deficits were linked to an aberrant increase in the HPC-PFC long-term potentiation (LTP) in a U-shaped manner, while sensorimotor alterations were associated with heightened neuroinflammation, as verified by glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) expression, and altered dopamine neurotransmission. Furthermore, ELS rats displayed impaired HPC-PFC theta-gamma coordination and an abnormal brain state during active behavior resembling rapid eye movement (REM) sleep oscillatory dynamics. Our results point to impaired HPC-PFC functional connectivity as a possible pathophysiological mechanism by which ELS can cause cognitive deficits and psychiatric-like manifestations even without neuronal loss, bearing translational implications for understanding the spectrum of multidimensional developmental disorders linked to early-life seizures.

AB  - Hemipenial characteristics have historically provided a wealth of comparative morphological characters for the systematic classification of snakes. However, the organs remain poorly known in many groups, particularly tropical and burrowing lineages. Here, we report on hemipenial morphology for 12 species from five genera from the family Uropeltidae: Melanophidium punctatum, M. cf. wynaudense, Plectrurus perrotetii, Rhinophis karinthandani, R. melanoleucus, R. saffragamus, R. sanguineus, Teretrurus cf. hewstoni, Uropeltis bhupathyi, U. cf. ceylanica, U. macrolepis, and U. rajendrani. Many are photographed or illustrated here for the first time. In Melanophidium, the organ is bulbous and mushroomshaped, with the sulcus spermaticus winding through numerous convoluted folds. In Plectrurus and Teretrurus, it is simple, smooth, and conical. In Sri Lankan Rhinophis and some Uropeltis, the organ generally resembles previously described hemipenes from other species in those genera in being simple, subcylindrical, and covered in fine spines. However, a median lobular process is observed in the Indian species R. karinthandani, R. melanoleucus, and R. sanguineus, seemingly representing a novel bilobate morphology. One species, U. bhupathyi, exhibits a novel, bulbous morphology, but this may be an artifact of preservation. The hemipenes of the Uropeltidae and their sister group Cylindrophiidae resemble some typhlopoid blindsnakes more than their henophidian relatives such as pythons and boas. Whether this is due to convergence related to microhabitat, a form of sexual selection unrelated to ecomorphology, or symplesiomorphy from an ancestral snake morphology is unclear. Gross hemipenial morphology can now serve to diagnose uropeltids to the genus level or species group, though more data and comparative series are needed to determine whether other characters, such as the number and location of spines, can potentially differentiate taxa at finer scales.

AB  - Simple Summary The ladybird Stethorus gilvifrons is an important natural enemy of herbivorous two-spotted spider mites, Tetranychus urticae. Here, we modeled the effect of temperature, which is the most significant abiotic environmental factor, on the development and thermal thresholds of S. gilvifrons. Thermal parameters and developmental trajectories were estimated by fitting two linear and 20 non-linear models to experimental data measured at seven temperature regimes ranging from 15 to 38 degrees C. Our findings demonstrate that S. gilvifrons is able to complete development at a broad range of temperatures and is well-adapted to temperatures occurring in temperate, Mediterranean, and subtropical climates. The thermal development models presented here represent a significant step towards an in-depth evaluation of S. gilvifrons as a biological control agent of T. urticae under different temperature regimes. The models can be used to predict the phenology of this predator, to forecast its population dynamics in the field, and to optimize mass-rearing efforts. The development rate of the predatory ladybird, Stethorus gilvifrons (Mulsant), fed on Tetranychus urticae Koch, was determined at 15, 20, 25, 27, 30, 34, and 38 degrees C. The total development time from egg to adult emergence for females was estimated to be 61.4, 31.6, 14.4, 13.3, 12.5, and 11.7 days, respectively. The development time decreased with increasing temperature from 15 to 34 degrees C, but all eggs failed to hatch at 38 degrees C. The lower temperature threshold (T-0) for the entire development period and the thermal constant (K) for female S. gilvifrons were estimated to be 11.64 degrees C and 194.50 degree-days (DD) using the common linear model, and 11.96 degrees C and 187.87 DD using the Ikemoto and Takai model, respectively. Data were fitted to 20 non-linear development rate models and the thermal thresholds (T-min and T-max) and optimal temperature (T-opt) were estimated. Among non-linear models, the Briere-2 and Ikemoto and Takai linear model provided adequate descriptions of the temperature-dependent development of S. gilvifrons. The upper-temperature threshold was estimated to be about 44 degrees C using the Logan-10 non-linear model. The estimated thermal development characteristics can be used to predict the occurrence and the population dynamics, as well as to improve the mass rearing and release, of S. gilvifrons for the biological control of T. urticae.

AB  - Free amino acids (FAAs) positively determine the tea quality, notably theanine (Thea), endowing umami taste of tea infusion, which is the profoundly prevalent research in albino tea genetic resources. Therefore, 339 tea accessions were collected to study FAAs level for deciphering its variation and accumulation mechanism. Interestingly, alanine (Ala) and Thea which had the highest diversity index (H ') value among three varieties of Camellia sinensis (L.) O. Kuntze were significantly higher than wild relatives (P < 0.05). The intraspecific arginine (Arg) and glutamine (Gln) contents in C. sinensis var. assamica were significantly lower than sinensis and pubilimba varieties. Moreover, the importance of interdependencies operating across FAAs and chlorophyll levels were highlighted via the cell ultrastructure, metabolomics, and transcriptome analysis. We then determined that the association between phytochrome interacting factor 1 (CsPIF1) identified by weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) and Thea content. Intriguingly, transient knock-down CsPIF1 expression increased Thea content in tea plant, and the function verification of CsPIF1 in Arabidopsis also indicated that CsPIF1 acts as a negative regulator of Thea content by mainly effecting the genes expression related to Thea biosynthesis, transport, and hydrolysis, especially glutamate synthase (CsGOGAT), which was validated to be associated with Thea content with a nonsynonymous SNP by Kompetitive Allele-Specific PCR (KASP). We also investigated the interspecific and geographical distribution of this SNP. Taken together, these results help us to understand and clarify the variation and profile of major FAAs in tea germplasms and promote efficient utilization in tea genetic improvement and breeding.

AB  - Previously, we demonstrated that renal denervation in pigs reduces renal glucose release during a hypoglycemic episode. In this study we set out to examine changes in side-dependent renal net glucose release (SGN) through unilateral low-frequency stimulation (LFS) of the renal plexus with a pulse generator (2-5 Hz) during normoglycemia (60 min) and insulin-induced hypoglycemia <= 3.5 mmol/L (75 min) in seven pigs. The jugular vein, carotid artery, renal artery and vein, and both ureters were catheterized for measurement purposes, blood pressure management, and drug and fluid infusions. Para-aminohippurate (PAH) and inulin infusions were used to determine side-dependent renal plasma flow (SRP) and glomerular filtration rate (GFR). In a linear mixed model, LFS caused no change in SRP but decreased sodium excretion (p < 0.0001), as well as decreasing GFR during hypoglycemia (p = 0.0176). In a linear mixed model, only hypoglycemic conditions exerted significant effects on SGN (p = 0.001), whereas LFS did not. In a Wilcoxon signed rank exact test, LFS significantly increased SGN (p = 0.03125) and decreased sodium excretion (p = 0.0017) and urinary flow rate (p = 0.0129) when only considering the first instance LFS followed a preceding period of non-stimulation during normoglycemia. To conclude, this study represents, to our knowledge, the first description of an induction of renal gluconeogenesis by LFS.

AB  - The level of spatial accessibility is directly related to how street networks are connected. Connected or so-called "permeable" network systems encourage walking, cycling, and riding public transit. Fast urbanization during the recent decades in the world metropolises has created separated urban areas. Gated-style apartment complexes have led this segregation more obviously with their inaccessible internal networks. Opening the internal network of apartment complexes and redesigning the pedestrian paths among apartment buildings will significantly mitigate these networks' adverse effects on network permeability and increase spatial accessibility. This paper analyzes how such an opening design proposal for apartment complexes can change spatial accessibility using the case study of Mapo-gu, Seoul, Korea. It simulates three types of street networks and compares the results of accessibility in three conditions: (1) the internal networks of apartment complexes are not used by outsiders; (2) the internal networks of apartment complexes are open to outsiders with its existing entrances and path; and (3) the internal networks of sites are opened and redesigned by the Voronoi diagram method, which generates the optimal shortest path. An urban network analysis tool, Rhinoceros three-dimensional software, and Grashopper3D visual programming language have been used for the study results, which shows that a policy change in opening the intra-network of apartment complexes is likely to make the city more permeable. In addition, this study suggests extra modification on the pedestrian path for a higher level of accessibility in neighborhoods.

AB  - Alzheimer's disease affects thousands of people worldwide. Alternatives aiming to prevent the disease or reduce its symptoms include different physical exercise configurations. Here we investigate the potential of concurrent exercise to prevent recognition memory deficits in an Alzheimer's disease-like model induced by the hippocampal beta-amyloid (A beta) injection in Wistar rats. We demonstrate that the concurrent exercise, which included running and strength exercises performed in the same exercise session, is ineffective in preventing recognition memory deficits in the A beta rats. Besides, higher levels of reactive oxygen species were found in the concurrent exercise group's hippocampus. The running exercise administrated alone prevented recognition memory impairments.

AB  - We show here that evaporative water loss (EWL) is constant over a wide range of ambient relative humidity for two species of small, mesic habitat dasyurid marsupials (Antechinus agilis and Antechinus swainsonii) below thermoneutrality (20 degrees C) and within thermoneutrality (30 degrees C). This independence of EWL from the water vapor pressure deficit between the animal and its environment indicates that EWL is physiologically controlled by both species. The magnitude of this control of EWL was similar to that of two other small marsupials from more arid habitats, which combined with the observation that there were no effects of relative humidity on body temperature or metabolic rate, suggests that control of EWL is a consequence of precise thermoregulation to maintain heat balance rather than a water-conserving strategy at low relative humidities. The antechinus appear to manipulate cutaneous EWL rather than respiratory EWL to control their total EWL by modifying their cutaneous resistance and/or skin temperature. We propose that there is a continuum between enhanced thermoregulatory EWL at high ambient temperature and so-called insensible EWL at and below thermoneutrality.

AB  - Tissue engineering is a set of techniques for producing or reconstructing tissue that primarily aims to restore or improve the function of tissues in the human body. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the mechanical and histological characteristics of decellularized tracheal scaffolds prepared in comparison with fresh trachea for use in tracheal repair. In order to prepare the scaffold, sheep's trachea was prepared and after cleaning the waste tissues, they were decellularized. Then decellularized scaffolds were evaluated histologically and laboratory and numerical study of the nonlinear mechanical behavior of tracheal tissue and scaffold and their comparison. Examining the results of histological evaluations showed that the decellularization of the scaffolds was completely done. These results were confirmed by hematoxylin-eosin staining. Also, the exact hyperelastic properties of tracheal tissue and scaffold were used in biomechanical models, and according to the presented results, the five-term Mooney-Rivlin strain energy density function became a suitable behavioral model for modeling the hyperelastic behavior of trachea and scaffold. In total, the results of this research showed that the scaffolds obtained from decellularization by preserving the main compositions of the desired tissue can be a suitable platform for investigating cell behaviors.

AB  - Cultivation of Zanzibar Napier grass (Pennisetum purpereum) needs proper care and management because this species mines a lot of nutrients. The common practice of Napier grass fertilization technique enriched with other fertilizers was evaluated to gain higher yield and better nutrition forage. All Napier grass clumps were basal fertilized with goat's dung and NPK compound fertilizer at 20kg and 80g per clump respectively and enriched with Calcinit, Seasol and Powerfeet, Keical and Dolomite fertilizers (80g, 30mL/10L, 40g and 50g per clump respectively) at two weeks after sowing and 1 week after subsequent harvesting before being harvest after 45 days. The results showed that fertilizer enrichment significantly increases the number and size of stems and leaves, leaf chlorophyll content index, leaf to stem ratio and dry weight of leaves, stems and biomass. Proximate analysis of Napier leaves showed that fertilizer enrichment significantly increases the total crude protein, energy and minerals composition (N, Ca, Zn, Mn, and Cu) of Napier grass. Overall, enrichment with Calcinit fertilizer is the best treatment to extrapolated increase 52% of DM yield/ha/year with a better nutrition content of 119% protein and 8% energy which are important to reduce dependency and uptake of concentrate fodder thus reducing the food and production cost.

AB  - The discovery of rhythmicity in host and pathogen activities dates back to the Hippocratic era, but the causes and consequences of these biological rhythms have remained poorly understood. Rhythms in infection phenotypes or traits are observed across taxonomically diverse hosts and pathogens, suggesting general evolutionary principles. Understanding these principles may enable rhythms to be leveraged in manners that improve drug and vaccine efficacy or disrupt pathogen timekeeping to reduce virulence and transmission. Explaining and exploiting rhythms in infections require an integrative and multidisciplinary approach, which is a hallmark of research within chronobiology. Many researchers are welcomed into chronobiology from other fields after observing an unexpected rhythm or time-of-day effect in their data. Such findings can launch a rich new research topic, but engaging with the concepts, approaches and dogma in a new discipline can be daunting. Fortunately, chronobiology has well-developed frameworks for interrogating rhythms that can be readily applied in novel contexts. Here, we provide a 'how to' guide for exploring unexpected daily rhythms in infectious disease research. We outline how to establish: whether the rhythm is circadian, to what extent the host and pathogen are responsible, the relevance for host-pathogen interactions, and how to explore therapeutic potential. This article is part of the Theo Murphy meeting issue 'Circadian rhythms in infection and immunity'.

AB  - The accumulation of butyrate is a recurrent phenomenon in anaerobic digesters utilizing animal manure as the primary feedstock. Despite its prevalence, the factors governing the anaerobic degradation of butyrate remain inadequately explored. In this study, a series of experiments were carried out under different total ammonia concentrations (TAN, 0.18-20 g N/L) and pH conditions (7.0-8.0) to investigate the inhibition of butyrate anaerobic degradation by different ammonia species (NH4+ and NH3) and to assess the recoverability following severe ammonia inhibition. The findings indicate that at pH 7.5, butyrate degradation experienced remarkable inhibition when TAN exceeded 8.0 g N/L, while no discernible impact was observed at pH 7.0-8.0 and 4.0 g TAN/L. Additionally, the lag phase for butyrate degradation extended with increasing TAN concentration. Notably, the activity of butyrate-degrading bacteria exhibited full recovery from severe ammonia inhibition (TAN 20 g N/L or NH3 779.2 mg N/L), provided prolonged adaption time was allowed. The analysis using a modified Monod inhibition model highlighted that NH4+ contributed more to inhibition than NH3 at TAN concentrations of 2.0-20.0 g N/L. Therefore, simply reducing pH levels would not adequately counteract ammonia inhibition. Implementing an extended hydraulic retention time emerges as an effective measure to reduce butyrate accumulation in anaerobic digestion systems, particularly the feedstock being nitrogen-rich materials (e.g., animal manure).

AB  - The helminth parasites of Macropus fuliginosus and Macropus giganteus are reported based on examination of a total of 285 animals extending, for the first time, across the entire geographical range of both species and including, where possible, data from previous regional studies. A total of 64 species of helminths was found including 42 species of strongyloid nematodes in the stomach, seven species of trichostrongyloid nematodes in the pylorus and small intestine and seven species of nematodes in the terminal ileum and large intestine, one species of spirurid nematode in the stomach and six species of cestodes and one species of trematode. Forty-three species were encountered in both M. fuliginosus and M. giganteus. The helminth communities of the two kangaroo species exhibited a similarity of 85.4% based on all helminth species encountered or 91.4% if only the species specific to grey kangaroos were considered. Interchange of helminths between the two species of kangaroos revealed several different patterns with instances both of transfer and lack of transfer in areas of host sympatry as well as transfers beyond the zone of sympatry. The findings are discussed in relationship to the phylogeography of the host species.

AB  - Accumulating evidence indicates the significant role of lncRNAs in multiple biological processes and cancer progression. However, most lncRNAs in CRC remain to be excavated. In this study, we investigated SNHG14 in CRC. SNHG14 which was generally under-expressed in normal colon specimens revealed by UCSC was uncovered as markedly highly expressed in CRC cell lines. Besides, SNHG14 was a contributor to CRC cell proliferation. Additionally, we demonstrated that SNHG14 facilitated CRC cell proliferation in a KRAS-de-pendent manner. Moreover, the mechanistic investigations indicated that SNHG14 interacted with YAP and therefore inactivated the Hippo pathway, so as to enhance YAP-targeted KRAS expression in CRC. Further-more, SNHG14 was explained as transcriptionally activated by FOS, a previously identified common effector molecule of KRAS and YAP. All in all, our findings elucidated a feedback loop of SNHG14/YAP/KRAS/FOS in facilitating CRC tumorigenesis, which may help develop novel effective targets for CRC patients.

AB  - Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a heterogeneous neurodevelopment disorder resulting from different etiological factors, both genetic and/or environmental. These factors can lead to abnormal neuronal development on dendrite and synaptic function at the central nervous system. Recent studies have shown that a subset of ASD patients display increased circulation levels of the tyrosine metabolite, p-cresol, related to chronic intestinal disorders because of dysbiosis of the intestinal microbiota. In particular, abnormal presence of intestinal Clostridium sp. has been linked to high levels of p-cresol in ASD children younger than 8 years. However, the role of p-cresol during development of the central nervous system is unknown. Here, we evaluated in vitro the effect of p-cresol on neurite outgrowth in N2a and PC12 cell lines and dendritic morphology, synaptic density, neuronal activity, and calcium responses in primary rat hippocampal neurons. p-cresol inhibits neural differentiation and neurites outgrowth in N2a and PC12 neuronal cell lines. In hippocampal neuronal cultures, Sholl's analysis shows a decrease in the dendritic arborization of neurons treated with p-cresol. Synaptic density analyzed with the synaptic markers Piccolo and Shank2 is diminished in hippocampal neurons treated with p-cresol. Electrically evoked intracellular calcium rise was drastically, but reversely, blocked by p-cresol, whereas that spontaneous neuronal activity was severely affected by early addition of the metabolite. These findings show that p-cresol alters dendrite development, synaptogenesis, and synapse function of neurons in culture, therefore, neuronal alterations occurring in ASD children may be related to this metabolite and dysbiosis of the intestinal microbiota.

TI  - Aminated Lignin/Cellulose-Based Hydrogel with High Adhesion for Wearable Sensors
T2  - LANGMUIR
LA  - English
AB  - Hydrogels play a significant role in the flexibility, stretchability, and conductivity of wearable sensors. However, it is still a challenge to achieve multifunctional hydrogel sensors with excellent mechanical strength, outstanding self-adhesion, and high stimulus responsiveness for meeting various demands of practical applications. Here, this work presents a one-pot method to prepare a conductive hydrogel with multifunction by introducing aminated lignosulfonate (A-LS) and aminated cellulose nanocrystals (A-CNC) into the hydrogel matrix. Benefiting from the synergistic effect of dynamic reversible noncovalent bond network with the introduction of nanoparticles in the system, the resultant hydrogel showed excellent mechanical properties. In addition, the prepared hydrogels exhibited remarkable adhesion strength (pig skin: 24 kPa) with sustainable adhesion, which still maintained an adhesion strength above 18 kPa after 20 cycles of adhesion/separation. The resultant hydrogel sensor showed a wide operating range (0-200%), high sensitivity (GF = 0.71 at 0-100% strain; GF = 3.15 at 100-200% strain), and fast response time (320 ms). The high-value utilization of renewable forest biomass resources is conducive to the sustainable development of green chemistry.

AB  - Hippodamia variegata (Goeze), the variegated ladybug, is a predator of many insect pests, especially aphids. Sulfoxaflor is a chemical insecticide that can be used to control many sap-feeding insect pests, for instance, plant bugs and aphids, as an alternative to neonicotinoids in different crops. To improve the combination of the H. variegata and sulfoxaflor in an IPM (integrated pest management) program, we studied the ecological toxicity of the insecticide to the coccinellid predator at sublethal and lethal doses. We examined the influence of sulfoxaflor on larvae of H. variegata using exposure doses of 3, 6, 12, 24, 48 (maximum recommended field rate (MRFR)), and 96 ng a.i. per insect. In a 15-day toxicity test, we observed decreased adult emergence percentage and survival, as well as an increased hazard quotient. The LD50 (dose causing 50% mortality) of H. variegata due to sulfoxaflor decreased from 97.03 to 35.97 ng a.i. per insect. The total effect assessment indicated that sulfoxaflor could be grouped as slightly harmful for H. variegata. Additionally, most of the life table parameters were significantly decreased after exposure to sulfoxaflor. Overall, the results present a negative influence of sulfoxaflor on H. variegata when applied at the recommended field dose for controlling aphids in Greece, which demonstrates that this insecticide may only be employed with care when used in IPM programs.

AB  - Tapeworms are trophically-transmitted and multi-host parasites with a complex indirect life cycle, strictly depending on predator-prey interactions. Their presence in a free-living population, mainly definitive hosts, is arduous to study due to the complexity of collecting fecal samples. However, epidemiological studies on their frequency are crucial from a public health perspective, providing information on food habits and prey selection of predators. The present study aims to update the frequency of tapeworms detected in stool samples by molecular analysis in Italian wolf populations of Umbria and Marche regions collected from 2014 to 2022. Tapeworm's total frequency was 43.2%. In detail, Taenia serialis was detected in 27 samples (21.6%), T. hydatigena in 22 (17.6%), and Mesocestoides corti (syn. M. vogae) in 2 (1.6%). Three samples were identified as M. litteratus and E. granulosus s.s. (G3) and T. pisiformis, with a proportion of 0.8%, respectively. The low frequency of E. granulosus in a hyperendemic area is discussed. The results show for the first time a high frequency of Taenia serialis not comparable to other Italian studies conducted on wild Carnivora; thus, a new ecological niche is conceivable. These findings suggest a plausible wolf-roe deer cycle for T. serialisin the investigated area.

AB  - BackgroundMaternal lipid levels, which are crucial for both foetal development and maternal health, exhibit significant physiological changes during pregnancy. Current reference ranges for lipids that are based on common adults may inadequately assess the appropriate lipid levels during pregnancy and fail to predict potential risks. Therefore, it is necessary to establish trimester-specific reference intervals (TSRIs) for pregnant women during pregnancy.ObjectiveTo establish TSRIs for total cholesterol (TC), triglyceride (TG), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-c, and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-c) levels during pregnancy and to explore potential factors influencing lipid levels.MethodsFollowing PRISMA/MOOSE guidelines, 13 observational studies (54,517 healthy women with singleton pregnancies) were included and analyzed. The pooled means and associated 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) were calculated using a random effects model, and the TSRIs for women with singleton pregnancies were calculated using a frequentist approach. The quality of the included studies was appraised by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) scale.ResultsThe established TSRIs for the women with singleton pregnancies during the first, second, and third trimesters were 3.00-5.83, 3.79-7.87, and 4.39-8.98 mmol/L for TC; 0.08-2.27, 0.39-3.90, and 0.82-5.00 mmol/L for TG; 0.86-2.34, 0.80-2.69, and 0.83-2.58 mmol/L for HDL-c; and 1.16-3.56, 1.51-5.04, and 1.90-5.74 mmol/L for LDL-c, respectively. The TSRIs applicable to Chinese women with singleton pregnancies were 2.96-5.66, 3.79-7.63 and 4.36-8.69 mmol/L for TC; 0.22-2.05, 0.56-4.08 and 1.10-5.15 mmol/L for TG; 1.01-2.35, 0.84-2.66 and 0.67-2.72 mmol/L for HDL-c; and 1.12-3.38, 1.39-4.94 and 1.79-5.60 mmol/L for LDL-c for the first, second, and third trimesters. Compared with pregnant women from Asia, European and South American pregnant women showed higher serum third-trimester TC level and lower second-trimester TG and third-trimester TG and LDL-c levels. Studies using enzyme colorimetry method reported higher second-trimester TG and third-trimester TG and HDL-c levels than those using enzyme methods. In addition, the third-trimester TC, HDL-c, LDL-c and three-trimesters TG levels were significantly higher as reported by the studies conducted before 2015 than by the ones conducted after 2015.ConclusionThe appropriate establishment of TSRIs is essential for accurate diagnosis of dyslipidaemia during pregnancy, which may be affected by the inhabited regions where pregnant women lived, the assay methods and the years when study conducted. Further region-specific and method-specific TSRIs for women with singleton pregnancies using the latest data are needed in order to enhance the diagnostic capability of dyslipidaemia in pregnant women during three trimesters.

AB  - Simple Summary Larvae of the larder beetle Dermestes maculatus (Coleoptera: Dermestidae, De Geer, 1774) resemble caterpillars but actually feed on dry tissues of dead animals, and sometimes on human corpses. To hide and metamorphose into adult beetles, these larvae dig deep tunnels called pupation chambers. These holes and pits are usually observed in skins, horns, furs, or surrounding materials such as wood. They have also been reported on archaeological bones and experimentally observed on fresh pig bones, but never on humans. In this context, we investigated whether larder beetle larvae could also dig pupation chambers in human bones, and under which conditions this could occur. For this purpose, we placed medieval dry human bones as well as fresh calf and beef bones (control) with Dermestes maculatus larvae. After 1 month, we observed tunnels corresponding to pupation chambers only on dry human bones, and under conditions of high larval density. Despite these results being preliminary, they are, nonetheless, of particular interest in a forensic context, as they could help to understand taphonomic bone modifications or even the chronology of mass grave deposals. Dermestid beetles (Coleoptera: Dermestidae) are necrophagous insects feeding on mummified carcasses. After six to seven molts, the larvae stop feeding and dig pupation chambers to hide and safely evolve into adults. Such pupation chambers have already been observed on archaeological mammals' bones, but the attribution and interpretation of these osteological lesions lack experimental evidence in a forensic context. To observe whether dermestid larvae dig pupation chambers in human bones, 20 or 40 Dermestes maculatus (De Geer, 1774) larvae were placed in a dermestarium with different types of bones varying in species (Bos taurus or human), age (adult or immature), and preservation method (fresh or dry). Our results show that dermestid larvae caused multiple lesions, including larval mandible traces on cortical bone, cortical perforations, drilling of pupation chambers, destruction of the trabecular network, and the perforation of cartilage. Bone destruction was mainly observed on aged dry bones, while fresh bones only exhibited soft tissue and superficial cartilage lesions. According to these results, pupation chambers could indicate the simultaneous presence of several corpses at different decomposition stages, or the addition of new corpses while others were already skeletonized. These conclusions are particularly important in the case of mass graves, where chronology is sometimes difficult to establish.

AB  - The ability to remember conspecifics is critical for adaptive cognitive functioning and social communication, and impairments of this ability are hallmarks of autism spectrum disorders (ASDs). Although hippocampal ventral CA1 (vCA1) neurons are known to store social memories, how their activities are coordinated remains unclear. Here we show that vCA1 social memory neurons, characterized by enhanced activity in response to memorized individuals, were preferentially reactivated during sharp-wave ripples (SPW-Rs). Spike sequences of these social replays reflected the temporal orders of neuronal activities within theta cycles during social experiences. In ASD model Shank3 knockout mice, the proportion of social memory neurons was reduced, and neuronal ensemble spike sequences during SPW-Rs were disrupted, which correlated with impaired discriminatory social behavior. These results suggest that SPW-R-mediated sequential reactivation of neuronal ensembles is a canonical mechanism for coordinating hippocampus-dependent social memories and its disruption underlie the pathophysiology of social memory defects associated with ASD.

AB  - Mercury (Hg) pollution in the ocean is an issue of global concern, however bioaccumulation regimes of this ubiquitous pollutant in marine apex predators have important knowledge gaps. Our fish length and stable isotope (delta N-15 and delta C-13) normalized data of Greenland halibut (GH) (Reinhardtius hippoglossoides) showed that Hg bioaccumulation in fillet tissue decreased by similar to 35-50 %, over a ten-year period from 2006 to 2015 (n = 7 individual sampling years). Hg was predominantly in the methylmercury form (>77 %). Results from a Bayesian information theoretic model showed that GH Hg concentrations decreased with time and its associated declines in Hg air emissions, estimated trophic position, and a potentially lower degree of demersal prey use as indicated by temporal trend shifts in nitrogen (delta N-15) and carbon (delta C-13) stable isotope values. GH trophic shifts accounted for about one third of the observed temporal reduction in Hg. Our study demonstrates the importance of simultaneously considering Hg emissions, food web dynamics and trophic shifts as important drivers of Hg bioaccumulation in a marine, deep water fish species and highlights the effectiveness of Hg regulations on ocean apex predator Hg concentrations and overall seafood safety.

AB  - The Early Pleistocene mammal communities of Europe are characterised by a great diversity of large carnivorans. Among them, the largest ever hyaenid, Pachycrocuta brevirostris, a fierce predator with great bone-cracking adaptations that has left its taphonomic signature on several fossiliferous sites. Here, we perform a rigorous taphonomic analysis focusing on bone surface modifications and damage patterns on large-sized ungulate bones from the site Tsiotra Vryssi (1.78 to similar to 1.5 Ma; Mygdonia Basin, Greece), aiming to identify the main biotic agent responsible for the modifications. Results reveal significant carnivore ravaging of the assemblage, and selective consumption of bones/bone portions related to nutrient value. Comparisons with modifications on similar-sized ungulate carcasses produced by extant and extinct predators, and similarities with Pachycrocuta-modified assemblages, indicate that Pachycrocuta was the principal agent of modification. Overall, this study not only provides taphonomic evidence for the interpretation of Tsiotra Vryssi, but also offers insights into the palaeobiology, and particularly carcass consumption behaviour of the giant hyaena. Hence, it advances our knowledge on carnivoran guild dynamics and prey-predator relationships during this epoch and has important implications for the investigations of the subsistence behaviour of the meat-eating hominins, who entered Eurasia at similar to 1.8 Ma, roughly synchronously with Pachycrocuta.

AB  - Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, such as fluoxetine (Prozac), are commonly prescribed pharmacotherapies for anxiety. Fluoxetine may be a useful adjunct because it can reduce the expression of learned fear in adult rodents. This effect is associated with altered expression of perineuronal nets (PNNs) in the amygdala and hippocampus, two brain regions that regulate fear. However, it is unknown whether fluoxetine has similar effects in adolescents. Here, we investigated the effect of fluoxetine exposure during adolescence or adulthood on context fear memory and PNNs in the basolateral amygdala (BLA), the CA1 subregion of the hippocampus, and the medial prefrontal cortex in rats. Fluoxetine impaired context fear memory in adults but not in adolescents. Further, fluoxetine increased the number of parvalbumin (PV)-expressing neurons surrounded by a PNN in the BLA and CA1, but not in the medial prefrontal cortex, at both ages. Contrary to previous reports, fluoxetine did not shift the percentage of PNNs toward non-PV cells in either the BLA or CA1 in the adults, or adolescents. These findings demonstrate that fluoxetine differentially affects fear memory in adolescent and adult rats but does not appear to have age-specific effects on PNNs.

AB  - Reports of the underlying mechanisms of dietary grape extract (GE) in overcoming weaning challenges in piglets have been partly inconsistent. Furthermore, evaluations of the effects of GE at weaning in comparison to those of widely used therapeutic antibiotics have been scarce. To explore the mode of action of GE in selected tissues and plasma, we evaluated gut morphology, antioxidant and inflammation indices. Accordingly, 180 weaning piglets were allocated to three treatment groups: negative control (NC), NC and antibiotic treatment for the first 5 days of the trial (positive control, PC), and NC and GE (entire trial). The villus surface was positively affected by GE and PC on day 27/28 of the trial in the jejunum and on day 55/56 of the trial in the ileum. In the colon, NC tended (p < 0.10) to increase crypt parameters compared to PC on day 55/56. The PC group tended (p < 0.10) to increase catalase activity in the ileum and decrease Cu/Zn-SOD activity in the jejunum, both compared to NC. There were no additional effects on antioxidant measurements of tissue and plasma, tissue gene expression, or plasma acute-phase proteins. In conclusion, GE supplementation beneficially affected the villus surface of the small intestine. However, these changes were not linked to the antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties of GE.

AB  - Phenazines are ubiquitously produced by Pseudomonas spp. in the environment and are widely used in agriculture and clinical therapies, making their accumulation through the food chain cause potential risks to human health. Here, we utilized pyocyanin (PYO) as a representative to study the effects of phenazines on digestive tracts. Pharmacokinetic analysis showed that PYO exhibited low systemic exposure, slow elimination, and low accumulation in both rat and pig models. PYO was subsequently found to induce intestinal microbiota dysbiosis, destroy the mucus layer and physical barrier, and even promote gut vascular barrier (GVB) impairment, consequently increasing the gut permeability. Additionally, integral and metabolomic analyses of the liver demonstrated that PYO induced liver inflammation and metabolic disorders. The metabolic analysis further confirmed that all of the metabolites of PYO retain the nitrogen-containing tricyclic structural skeleton of phenazines, which was the core bioactivity of phenazine compounds. These findings elucidated that PYO could be metabolized by animals. Meanwhile, high levels of PYO could induce intestinal barrier impairment and liver damage, suggesting that we should be alert to the accumulation of phenazines.

AB  - Introduction Parkinson's disease (PD) is associated with higher risk of cognitive impairment. Until now, little is known about the effect of anesthetics on cognitive function in PD patients. The imbalance of hippocampal N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors NR2A/NR2B subunit ratio is reported to be associated with memory dysfunction in PD rats. The current study investigated the effects of propofol on the cognitive function and hippocampal NR2A/NR2B ratio in a 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-induced PD rat model.Methods MPTP was stereotaxically injected into the substantia nigra pars compacta of male Wistar rats. Next day (day 2), the rats in the chronic intervention groups were injected daily with either propofol (80 mg/kg/day, i.p.) or fat emulsion for 7 days (day 2-8). The rats in the acute intervention groups received propofol or fat emulsion only on day 8. Then, all the rats underwent an open field test and an inhibitory avoidance (IA) test. At last, the rats were killed for histological analysis and hippocampal NR2A and NR2B proteins and mRNA level quantification.Results Neither acute nor chronic treatment with propofol can significantly change the impairment of locomotor activity and dopaminergic denervation of the striatum in MPTP-lesioned rats. MPTP lesioning caused IA memory impairment, which was aggravated by chronic treatment with propofol. Furthermore, chronic treatment with propofol also aggravated the imbalance of hippocampal NR2A/NR2B ratio in MPTP-lesioned rats.Discussion The current findings indicate that chronic propofol treatment exacerbated MPTP-induced inhibitory avoidance (IA) memory impairment and aggravated the imbalance of hippocampal NR2A/NR2B ratio in MPTP-lesioned rats. Our current data demonstrate a correlation, not direct causation, between NR2A/NR2B dysregulation and cognitive impairment. Future studies should probe whether this imbalance is a driver or consequence of synaptic dysfunction.

AB  - Adult hippocampal neurogenesis is stimulated acutely following traumatic brain injury (TBI). However, many hippocampal neurons born after injury develop abnormally and the number that survive long-term is debated. In experimental TBI, insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF1) promotes hippocampal neuronal differentiation, improves immature neuron dendritic arbor morphology, increases long-term survival of neurons born after TBI, and improves cognitive function. One potential downstream mediator of the neurogenic effects of IGF1 is mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), which regulates proliferation as well as axonal and dendritic growth in the CNS. Excessive mTOR activation is posited to contribute to aberrant plasticity related to posttraumatic epilepsy, spurring preclinical studies of mTOR inhibitors as therapeutics for TBI. The degree to which pro-neurogenic effects of IGF1 depend upon upregulation of mTOR activity is currently unknown. Using immunostaining for phosphorylated ribosomal protein S6, a commonly used surrogate for mTOR activation, we show that controlled cortical impact TBI triggers mTOR activation in the dentate gyrus in a time-, region-, and injury severity-dependent manner. Posttraumatic mTOR activation in the granule cell layer (GCL) and dentate hilus was amplified in mice with conditional overexpression of IGF1. In contrast, delayed astrocytic activation of mTOR signaling within the dentate gyrus molecular layer, closely associated with proliferation, was not affected by IGF1 overexpression. To determine whether mTOR activation is necessary for IGF1-mediated stimulation of posttraumatic hippocampal neurogenesis, wildtype and IGF1 transgenic mice received the mTOR inhibitor rapamycin daily beginning at 3 days after TBI, following pulse labeling with bromodeoxyuridine. Compared to wildtype mice, IGF1 overexpressing mice exhibited increased posttraumatic neurogenesis, with a higher density of posttrauma-born GCL neurons at 10 days after injury. Inhibition of mTOR did not abrogate IGF1-stimulated enhancement of posttraumatic neurogenesis. Rather, rapamycin treatment in IGF1 transgenic mice, but not in WT mice, increased numbers of cells labeled with BrdU at 3 days after injury that survived to 10 days, and enhanced the proportion of posttrauma-born cells that differentiated into neurons. Because beneficial effects of IGF1 on hippocampal neurogenesis were maintained or even enhanced with delayed inhibition of mTOR, combination therapy approaches may hold promise for TBI.

AB  - Intellectual disability affects 1-3% of the global population, with many unidentified genetic causes. This study investigates the role of CAPZA2, an actin cytoskeleton regulator, in neurodevelopmental disorders using CAPZA2 heterozygous knockout (CAPZA2+/-) and heterozygous point mutant (CAPZA2c.G776T/+) mice. CAPZA2+/- and CAPZA2c.G776T/+ mice demonstrate notable decreases in CAPZA2 expression within the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex (PFC), crucial for learning and memory. Interestingly, the reduction of CAPZA2 in CAPZA2c.G776T/+ mice is less than 50%. Behavioral assays revealed that CAPZA2+/- mice exhibited motor dysfunction and anxiety-like behaviors, along with impairments in both spatial and non-spatial memory, accompanied by deficits in social interactions. These phenotypic manifestations are also mirrored in the CAPZA2c.G776T/+ mice, thus validating the genotype-phenotype correlation. Morphological analyses of these gene-edited mice indicate structural synaptic impairments, with increased dendritic spine density, altered spine morphology in the hippocampus, and decreased dendritic complexity in the PFC. Single-cell RNA-seq analysis of hippocampal tissue in CAPZA2+/- mice shows widespread transcriptional dysregulation, affecting neurodevelopment and synaptic function genes. The altered PSD95 and glutamate receptor levels support these findings. These insights highlight the gene's essential role in brain development and function, with potential implications for understanding and treating neurodevelopmental disorders.

AB  - Traumatic brain injury (TBI) results in the generation of tau. As hyperphosphorylated tau (p-tau) is one of the major consequences of TBI, targeting p-tau in TBI may lead to the development of new therapy. Twenty-five pigs underwent a controlled cortical impact. One hour after TBI, pigs were administered either vehicle (n = 13) or PNT001 (n = 12), a monoclonal antibody for the cis conformer of tau phosphorylated at threonine 231. Plasma biomarkers of neural injury were assessed for 14 days. Diffusion tensor imaging was performed at day 1 and 14 after injury, and these were compared to historical control animals (n = 4). The fractional anisotropy data showed significant white matter injury for groups at 1 day after injury in the corona radiata. At 14 days, the vehicle-treated pigs, but not the PNT001-treated animals, exhibited significant white matter injury compared to sham pigs in the ipsilateral corona radiata. The PNT001-treated pigs had significantly lower levels of plasma glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) at day 2 and day 4. These findings demonstrate a subtle reduction in the areas of white matter injury and biomarkers of neurological injury after treatment with PNT001 following TBI. These findings support additional studies for PNT001 as well as the potential use of this agent in clinical trials in the near future.

AB  - The Ammonia Gas Emission Model for Swine (AGEM-S), a nitrogen flow model, was created with the objective of assisting in the reduction of ammonia emissions in the Hungarian pig sector. Regarding the applied technological processes and considering the factors that influence ammonia emissions, the model quantifies the amount of ammonia emissions of pig farming in all stages (feeding, housing technology, manure storage, and application in the field). The aim of the project was to create a system that performs general calculations using the input data used by practicing farmers, without compromising the information content of the output data. Using this system, the input parameters can be entered as simply as possible and in the shortest possible time. In addition to demonstrating the impact of ammonia emission reduction measures to farmers from an integrated N management approach, AGEM-S has the potential to support the transfer of emission reduction technologies and practices at the farm level as a knowledge transfer tool primarily, but also as a decision support tool for technological change.

AB  - This study investigated the impact of glycerol supplementation on the expression of markers associated with follicular proliferation, maturation and apoptosis in Pelibuey ewes synchronised with long (11 days) and short (5 days) protocols using intravaginal fluorogestone acetate (FGA). Forty-five adult Pelibuey ewes were divided into five groups: control, short protocol with or without glycerol and long protocol with or without glycerol. Follicular dynamics were monitored by ultrasonography, and granulosa cells were collected 15 h after the onset of oestrus to analyse gene expression using RT-qPCR of genes associated with proliferation, maturation, and apoptosis. Results indicated that glycerol supplementation or the duration of the synchronisation protocol influenced the expression of genes related to apoptosis, proliferation and maturation. Specifically, glycerol-treated groups exhibited decreased BCL2 expression, and the ratio BCL2/BAX was lower in all treatment groups compared to the control, particularly in the short protocol plus glycerol. We conclude that the use of glycerol as an ultrashort supplementation during different synchronisation protocols leads to a delay in maturation and induces apoptotic-related pathways in granulosa cells to granulosa cell likely reducing the oocyte viability. Finally, glycerol treatment does not increase the abundance of PCNA associated with granulosa cell proliferation. However, it is observed that short-term treatments promote proliferation compared to the control group.

AB  - Sudden cardiac death (SCD) from ventricular tachycardia/fibrillation (VT/VF) is a leading cause of death, but current therapies are limited. Despite extensive research on drugs targeting sarcolemmal ion channels, none have proven sufficiently effective for preventing SCD. Sarcoplasmic ryanodine receptor 2 (RyR2) Ca2+ release channels, the downstream effectors of sarcolemmal ion channels, are underexplored in this context. Recent evidence implicates reactive oxygen species (ROS)-mediated oxidation and hyperactivity of RyR2s in the pathophysiology of SCD. We tested the hypothesis that RyR2 inhibition of failing arrhythmogenic hearts reduces sarcoplasmic Ca2+ leak and repolarization lability, mitigates VT/VF/SCD and improves contractile function. We used a guinea pig model that replicates key clinical aspects of human nonischemic HF, such as a prolonged QT interval, a high prevalence of spontaneous arrhythmic SCD, and profound Ca2+ leak via a hyperactive RyR2. HF animals were randomized to receive dantrolene (DS) or placebo in early or chronic HF. We assessed the incidence of VT/VF and SCD (primary outcome), ECG heart rate and QT variability, echocardiographic left ventricular (LV) structure and function, immunohistochemical LV fibrosis, and sarcoplasmic RyR2 oxidation. DS treatment prevented VT/VF and SCD by decreasing dispersion of repolarization and ventricular arrhythmias. Compared to placebo, DS lowered resting heart rate, preserved chronotropic competency during transient beta-adrenergic challenge, and improved heart rate variability and cardiac function. Inhibition of RyR2 hyperactivity with dantrolene mitigates the vicious cycle of sarcoplasmic Ca2+ leak-induced increases in diastolic Ca2+ and ROS-mediated RyR2 oxidation, thereby reducing repolarization lability and protecting against VT/VF/SCD. Moreover, the consequent increase in sarcoplasmic Ca2+ load improves contractile function. These potentially life-saving effects of RyR2 inhibition warrant further investigation, such as clinical studies of repurposing dantrolene as a potential new therapy for heart failure and/or SCD.
   eLife assessment
   This important study examined the use of dantrolene, a Ryanodine Receptor stabilizer, in slowing pathological progression of pressure-overload heart failure in a guinea pig model and reducing arrhythmias. Convincing data were collected and analyzed using validated methodology and can be used as a starting point for future studies of dantrolene in Ca2+ handling in ROS production and further deterioration of cardiac function in chronic heart failure.

AB  - Behavioral state modulates neural activity throughout the visual system.1-3 This is largely due to changes in arousal that alter internal brain states.4-10 Much is known about how these internal factors influence visual processing,7-11 but comparatively less is known about the role of external environmental contexts.12 Environmental contexts can promote or prevent certain actions,13 and it remains unclear if and how this affects visual processing. Here, we addressed this question in the thalamus of awake, head-fixed mice while they viewed stimuli but remained stationary in two different environmental contexts: either a cylindrical tube or a circular running wheel that enabled locomotion. We made silicon probe recordings in the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus (dLGN) while simultaneously measuring multiple metrics of arousal changes so that we could control for these across contexts. We found surprising differences in spatial and temporal processing in dLGN across contexts. The wheel context (versus tube) showed elevated baseline activity and faster but less spatially selective visual responses; however, these visual processing differences disappeared if the wheel no longer enabled locomotion. Our results reveal an unexpected influence of the physical environmental context on fundamental aspects of early visual processing, even in otherwise identical states of alertness and stillness.

AB  - PH-20 is a specific type of hyaluronidase that plays a critical role in the fertilization process by facilitating the initial binding of sperm to the glycoprotein layer surrounding the oocyte and subsequently breaking down hyaluronic acid polymers in the cumulus cell layer. PH-20 contains an epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like domain, which may be involved in the recognition of the glycoprotein layer in addition to the catalytic domain. Herein, we report the structure of human PH-20 determined by cryogenic electron microscopy. Comparative analyses of the PH-20 structure with two other available hyaluronidase structures reveal a general similarity in the central catalytic domains, including the conservation of catalytically essential residues at the equivalent spatial positions. However, unique difference is found in the EGF-like domain, characterized by a longer sequence that is likely to form a flexibly anchored beta-hairpin containing a disulfide bond.

AB  - Aim RhoA/Rho kinase pathway is essential for regulating cytoskeletal structure. Although its effect on normal neurite outgrowth has been demonstrated, the role of this pathway in seizure-induced neurite injury has not been revealed. The research examined the phosphorylation level of RhoA/Rho kinase signaling pathway and to clarify the effect of fasudil on RhoA/Rho kinase signaling pathway and neurite outgrowth in kainic acid (KA)-treated Neuro-2A cells and hippocampal neurons. Method Western blotting analysis was used to investigate the expression of key proteins of RhoA/Rho kinase signaling pathway and the depolymerization of actin. After incubated without serum to induce neurite outgrowth, Neuro-2A cells were fixed, and immunofluorescent assay of rhodamine-phalloidin was applied to detect the cellular morphology and neurite length. The influence of KA on neurons was detected in primary hippocampal neurons. Whole-cell patch clamp was conducted in cultured neurons or hippocampal slices to record action potentials. Result KA at the dose of 100-200 mu mol/L induced the increase in phosphorylation of Rho-associated coiled-coil-containing protein kinase and decrease in phosphorylation of Lin11, Isl-1 and Mec-3 kinase and cofilin. The effect of 200 mu mol/L KA was peaked at 1-2 hours, and then gradually returned to baseline after 8 hours. Pretreatment with Rho kinase inhibitor fasudil reversed KA-induced activation of RhoA/Rho kinase pathway and increase in phosphorylation of slingshot and 14-3-3, which consequently reduced the ratio of G/F-actin. KA treatment induced inhibition of neurite outgrowth and decrease in spines both in Neuro-2a cells and in cultured hippocampal neurons, and pretreatment with fasudil alleviated KA-induced neurite outgrowth inhibition and spine loss. Conclusion These data indicate that inhibiting RhoA/Rho kinase pathway might be a potential treatment for seizure-induced injury.

AB  - Sheep farming is the backbone of Pakistan's rural economy and haemonchosis is a major impediment in its way. The objective was to evaluate the efficacy of three medicinal plants Azadirachta indica (Neem), Fumaria parviflora (Shahtra) leaves and Nigella sativa (Kalonji) seeds against Haemonchus contortus (H. contortus) infection in locally bred Rambouillet sheep. One hundred and ten naturally infected female sheep diagnosed on the basis of identification of the parasite and faecal egg count, were selected. The animals were assigned to 11 treatments in a completely randomized (CR) design with 10 animals per treatment. The treatments were Albendazole 7.5 mg/kg BW ( positive control), Neem leaves extract (NLE) 50 mg/kg BW, NLE 100 mg/ kg BW, NLE 150 mg/kg BW, Shahtra leaves extract (SLE) 50 mg/kg BW, SLE 100 mg/kg BW, SLE 150 mg/kg BW, Kalonji seeds extract (KSE) 50 mg/ kg BW, KSE 100 mg/kg BW, KSE 150 mg/kg BW and un-treated infected (Negative control). All the extracts were prepared in aqueous solution. Treatments were administered as single dose orally. Faecal egg count was recorded on zero, 7(th), 14(th), 21(st) and 28(th)-day post-treatment for analysis. Faecal egg count reduction percentage (FECR%) was recorded to assess the efficacy of the drugs. None of the treatments could fully eliminate faecal egg production by the 28th-day post-treatment. Albendazole showed significantly higher FECR% as compared to Shahtra and Kalonji treated groups (p=0.01). FECR% on day 28 showed no significant difference between Albendazole, NLE 100 and NLE 150 (p>0.05). The three medicinal plant extracts showed a limited efficacy against H. contortus indicated by FECR% when compared with untreated animals. However, the efficacy of NLE 100 was closest to Albendazole showing its potential as an anthelmintic (p> 0.05).

AB  - BACKGROUND Plant growth-promoting rhizobacteria (PGPR) has a significant role in plant-insect interaction. However, the extent of their impact on insects is still not well understood. This investigation was designed to evaluate the role of inoculation with Bacillus amyloliquefaciens GB03 on sweet basil (Ocimum basilucum L.) in the development and nutritional parameters of Spodoptera frugiperda. In addition, the feeding preferences on inoculated and non-inoculated plants were assessed. RESULTS Spodoptera frugiperda larvae reared with inoculated sweet basil leaves had a strong negative effect on the development of the insect, resulting in lower larval and pupal weights, and a longer period for larval-adult development. Moreover, adult emergence was reduced, but the relative consumption rate (RCR) value was unaffected, thereby revealing no alteration of the palatability. Growth rate and nutritional indicators, such as the efficiency of conversion of ingested food (ECI) and the efficiency of conversion of digested food (ECD), were reduced in larvae reared from treated plants. In the choice test, larvae avoided feeding on inoculated leaves. CONCLUSION The higher occurrence of secondary metabolites in inoculated plants could have been the reason for the reduction of the plant nutritional rate and also for the food selection, since it has been previously reported that GB03 inoculated sweet basil increased the essential oil yield. Therefore, PGPR inoculation could be used as a growth promoter, making it a promising candidate for plant protection programs against insects in aromatic plant production.

AB  - Congenital hypothyroidism (CH) will cause cognitive impairment in the condition of delayed treatment. The hippocampus is one of the most affected tissues by CH, in which the functional structures of hippocampal neurons manifest deficiency due to aberrant expression of effector molecules. The Ca2+/Calmodulin-dependent protein kinase, CaMKIV, is downregulated in the hippocampal neurons, influencing the growth of dendritic spines in response to CH. However, the underlying mechanism is not fully elucidated. In the present study, the early growth response factor 3 (EGR3) was regulated by CaMKIV in the hippocampal neurons of CH rat pups, as was analyzed by transcriptome sequencing and in vitro cell experiments. EGR3 localized within hippocampal neurons in CA1, CA3, and dentate gyrus regions. Deficient EGR3 in the primary hippocampal neurons significantly reduced the density of dendritic spines by downregulating the expression of BDNF, and such effects could be rescued by supplementing recombinant BDNF protein. Taken together, CH mediates cognitive impairment of pups through the inactivation of CaMKIV in the hippocampal neurons, which decreases the expression of EGR3 and further reduces the production of BDNF, thereby impairing the growth of dendritic spines. Identifying CaMKIV/EGR3/BDNF pathway in the hippocampal neurons in the context of CH will benefit the drug development of intellectual disability caused by CH.

AB  - This study aimed to evaluate minimally invasive protocols for estrus synchronization in the brown brocket deer (Subulo gouazoubira). Females were submitted to Latin square design, in different treatments. All females received 0.25 mg of estradiol benzoate on the first day of treatment, concomitant with one of the following sources of progesterone: (1) DIP: an intravaginal progesterone releasing device for eight days, (2) MGA1x: once a day (in the morning) oral dose of 1 mg melengestrol acetate for eight days, (3) MGA2x: twice a day (morning and afternoon) oral doses of 0.5 mg of MGA for eight days, (4) P4LA: a single i.m. administration of 75 mg of long-acting progesterone (P4LA). Eight days after the beginning of each treatment, females received an i.m. administration of 265 & mu;g of prostaglandin (PGF2 & alpha;; cloprostenol). Treatment efficacy was evaluated by manifestation of behavioral estrus after treatment and concentration of fecal progesterone metabolites (FPM). The time to onset of estrus in treatment P4LA was significantly longer (180 & PLUSMN; 38.9 h) compared to DIP (63 & PLUSMN; 6.6 h), MGA1x (53 & PLUSMN; 14.4 h) and MGA2x (41 & PLUSMN; 10.1 h) (P = 0.008). According to individual baseline FPM and FPM concentration during the days after estrus, the corpus luteum formation was suggested in all females which responded to the treatments (93.75 %). Low synchrony, longer interval between PGF2 & alpha; administration and onset of estrus suggest that the P4LA dose (75 mg) is too high and not effective for S. gouazoubira. DIP, MGA 1x and MGA 2x, were effective in estrus synchronization.

AB  - Simple Summary Different herbivores feeding on the same plant can interact through plant-mediated effects. Cotton whitefly and diamondback moth are two of the most destructive pests in the world, and they often occur together in cruciferous plants. However, how the performance and fitness of them are affected when co-occurring in the same host plant remains unclear. The present study demonstrates that cotton whitefly has become a dominant competitor by gaining increased fitness benefits when it is mixed with DBM on the same host plant irrespective of sequences of their arrival, which may be one of the reasons for the rapid expansion and outbreak of the whitefly population worldwide. Bemisia tabaci and the diamondback moth (DBM), Plutella xylostella, are two major cosmopolitan pests that often occur together and cause severe economic losses to cruciferous crops. However, little is known about how they interact with each other. To determine the effects of defense responses induced by the two pests on the biology and population dynamics of the herbivores, we studied the performance and fitness of B. tabaci and DBM when they damaged Chinese kale simultaneously and in different orders. The results showed that DBM pre-infestation shortened the developmental duration, increased longevity, oviposition days, and fecundity of B. tabaci. Meanwhile, the intrinsic rate of increase (r), net reproductive rate (R-0) and finite rate of increase (lambda) of B. tabaci increased significantly with dual infection as compared with only B. tabaci infestation. In contrast, B. tabaci pre-infestation reduced the longevity and oviposition days of DBM, but the population parameters r, R-0, and lambda did not vary significantly compared with only DBM infestation. Thus, co-infestation of B. tabaci and DBM was beneficial to the performance of the B. tabaci population. The present findings highlight that B. tabaci has become a dominant competitor when mixing with DBM on the same host plant.

AB  - Electronic skin (e-skin) is considered as a highly promising interface for human-computer interaction systems and wearable electronic devices. Through elaborate design and assembly of various materials, it possesses multiple characteristics similar to human skin, including remarkable flexibility, stretchability, sensitivity to temperature and humidity, biocompatibility, and efficient interfacial ion/electron transport capabilities. Here, we innovatively integrate multifunctional carbon quantum dots (CQDs), which exhibit conductivity, antibacterial properties, ultraviolet absorption, and fluorescence emission, with poly(acrylic acid) and glycerin (Gly) into a three-dimensional network structure of natural goatskin collagen fibers. Through a top-down design strategy enhanced by hydrogen bond reconstruction, we successfully fabricated a novel transparent e-skin (PAC-eSkin). This e-skin exhibited significant tensile properties (4.94 MPa of tensile strength and 263.42% of a maximum breaking elongation), while also possessing Young's modulus similar to human skin (2.32 MPa). It is noteworthy that the functionalized CQDs used was derived from discarded goat hair, and the addition of Gly gave PAC-eSkin excellent antifreezing and moisturizing properties. Due to the presence of ultrasmall CQDs, which creates efficient ion/electron transport channels within PAC-eSkin, it could rapidly sense human motion and physiological signals (with a gauge factor (GF) of 1.88). Furthermore, PAC-eSkin had the potential to replace traditional electrode patches for real-time monitoring of electrocardiogram, electromyogram, and electrooculogram signals, with a higher SNR (signal-to-noise ratio) of 25.1 dB. Additionally, the customizable size and shape of PAC-eSkin offer vast possibilities for the construction of single-electrode triboelectric nanogenerator systems. We have reason to believe that the design and development of this transparent e-skin based on CQDs-functionalized dermal collagen matrices can pave a new way for innovations in human-computer interaction interfaces and their sensing application in diverse scenarios.

AB  - In the current work, the performance properties of natural-fibre-based thermal insulation materials were examined. For this purpose, three different compositions of natural fibres were prepared: pure sheep wool (SW), wool and industrial hemp (SW/HF) fibres, and pure industrial hemp (HF) fibres. Low-melt bicomponent polylactide (PLA) fibres were used as a binding material. For specimens prepared from natural fibres, the dependence of the thermal conductivity, the tensile strength along and across the direction of product formation, and the short-term water absorption on the density of the specimens and the flammability parameters were determined. In addition, to reduce the water absorption and flammability, the specimens were coated with hydrophobic agents and flame retardants. The obtained research results were also statistically processed. The analysis of the results showed that the thermal conductivity of natural-fibre-based thermal insulation materials varied within the range of 0.0333 divided by 0.0438 W/(m<middle dot>K), the tensile strength varied from 2.5 to 130 kPa, the short-term water absorption varied from 0.5 to 8.5 kg/m2, and the water vapour diffusion resistance factor varied from 2.537 to 2.667. It was additionally determined that all the studied products were flammable. The water absorption and flammability values were significantly reduced by the use of hydrophobic agents and flame retardants.

AB  - Esketamine, the right-handed optical isomer of racemic ketamine, is a rapidly acting antidepressant approved by the FDA for treatment-resistant depression in 2019. However, few studies have investigated esketamine's role in learning and memory, particularly in the context of memory reconsolidation. Herein, we evaluated esketamine's role in memory reconsolidation in 7-week-old male Institute of Cancer Research mice subjected to the novel object recognition (NOR) memory task. The NOR reconsolidation procedure comprised three phases: sampling, reactivation, and testing. Esketamine-enhanced NOR memory performance when injected into mice 0 h after reactivation rather than following a 6 h delay. Conversely, administering esketamine 24 h after sampling without reactivation did not enhance NOR memory performance. Notably, esketamine exhibited no discernible effects on nonspecific responses, such as locomotor activity and exploratory behavior. Furthermore, the alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA)-type receptor antagonist NBQX effectively blocked the esketamine-induced enhancement of memory reconsolidation. In conclusion, esketamine treatment markedly improves memory reconsolidation in NOR tasks, and this effect is linked to AMPA receptor activity.

AB  - Kangaroo Island is a large island off the coast of South Australia, Australia. It is attached to the continental land mass but glacial retreat in the Permian is thought to have carved a channel between the main continental land mass and the island itself allowing the ocean to interpose itself between the two. Rises and falls in the ocean levels have led to periods of separation and continuity in the land pieces (Bourman et al. 2016). Therefore, there have been opportunities for species to become isolated on Kangaroo Island and evolve to suit the environments found therein.
   Abantiades penneshawensis Moore & Beaver sp. nov. and Abantiades rubrus Moore & Beaver sp. nov. are described as new. Both species are endemic to Kangaroo Island, and although both are related to species that occur on the Australian mainland and other islands, they are distinguished from those sister and phenotypically similar species by morphology and mtDNA (COI) barcodes. These two new species raise the number of Abantiades species on Kangaroo Island to six, three being endemic, and 45 species in the genus for the whole of Australia. There are now 13 species of Hepialidae (one undescribed) known from Kangaroo Island and we discuss the potential effects of recent catastrophic fire on some distributions.

AB  - This study aimed to evaluate the digestible energy (DE), metabolizable energy (ME), and standardized ileal digestibility (SID) of amino acids (AA) in fermented soybean meal (FSBM) fed to growing pigs. In experiment 1, twenty-two growing pigs (Duroc x Landrace x Yorkshire; 32.0 +/- 4.2 kg BW) were fed one of 11 diets in a replicated 11 x 3 incomplete Latin square design to determine the DE and ME of FSBM. The diets included a corn-based diet and 10 experimental diets formulated by replacing the corn with 29.10% FSBM. In experiment 2, eleven growing pigs (Duroc x Landrace x Yorkshire; 24.3 +/- 2.3 kg BW) were surgically equipped with a T-cannula and arranged in an 11 x 6 incomplete Latin square design with 11 diets and six periods. The diets included an N-free diet and 10 experimental diets containing 40% FSBM as the sole source of AA. The results showed that the contents of dry matter (DM), gross energy, crude protein, crude fiber, neutral detergent fiber, acid detergent fiber, calcium, and phosphorus averaged 91.83% (ranging from 89.24 to 94.55%), 18.44 MJ/kg (ranging from 18.00 to 18.95 MJ/kg), 50.63% (ranging from 50.00 to 51.81%), 4.51% (ranging from 3.41 to 5.40%), 9.17% (ranging from 7.02 to 10.30%), 6.38% (ranging from 4.97 to 7.45%), 0.32% (ranging from 0.29 to 0.34%), and 0.67% (ranging from 0.61 to 0.84%), respectively. The average DE and ME were 17.55 and 16.33 MJ/kg DM, respectively, with ranges of 15.72 to 18.80 MJ/kg DM and 14.30 to 17.72 MJ/kg DM, respectively. Significant differences were observed in the SID of essential AA (p < 0.05), except for Thr and Arg. The SID of Lys, Met, Trp, and Thr ranged from 68.13 to 83.27% (mean = 76.62%), 62.23 to 89.30% (mean = 75.25%), 72.30 to 90.29% (mean = 80.96%), and 74.17 to 84.41% (mean = 77.90%), respectively. These results indicate significant variability in chemical composition, energy content, and the SID of AA among the selected FSBM samples. The chemical composition of FSBM can be used to predict DE and ME values.

AB  - Our previous study shows that Coptotermes formosanus (Blattodea: Rhinotermitidae) preferred to stay on filter paper treated with ethyl 2,4-dioxovalerate, a metabolite in the soil fungus Trichoderma virens. Here, we hypothesized that adding ethyl 2,4-dioxovalerate in sand could trigger aggregation and tunneling preferences of C. formosanus and improve the effectiveness of liquid termiticide. In aggregation-choice tests, significantly more termites were found on/in sand blocks containing ethyl 2,4-dioxovalerate (250 mu g/g) than untreated blocks throughout the 24-h experiments. In the tunneling-choice tests, termites also excavated significantly more tunnels in the sand treated with ethyl 2,4-dioxovalerate (2.5, 25, or 250 mu g/g) than untreated sand. However, in no-choice tests, ethyl 2,4-dioxovalerate (2.5, 25, or 250 mu g/g) did not significantly affect tunneling activities, termite survival, wood consumption, or activities of detoxification enzymes (peroxidase, superoxide dismutase, and catalase) compared to controls. Interestingly, in aggregation- and tunneling-choice tests, termites preferred to stay and made more tunnels in sand treated with both ethyl 2,4-dioxovalerate (250 mu g/g) and fipronil (1 mu g/g) than untreated sand. In addition, in choice tests, sand treated with the combination of ethyl 2,4-dioxovalerate (250 mu g/g) and fipronil (1 mu g/g) caused significantly higher termite mortality than the sand treated with only fipronil (1 mu g/g). Our study showed that ethyl 2,4-dioxovalerate may enhance the effectiveness of fipronil (1 mu g/g in sand) by triggering aggregation and tunneling preferences of termites, thereby increasing the contact between termites and fipronil.

AB  - Alzheimer's disease is a chronic complex neurodegenerative disease characterized with amyloid plaques and loss of neurons. TGF-beta 1 is important growth factor, plays critical roles in cell metabolism, tissue homeostasis, neuronal development, and synaptic plasticity. In this study, we aimed to examine the effect of TGF-beta 1 on the regulation of alpha, beta, and gamma-secretase enzymes, A beta-40 accumulation, apoptosis, and neuronal damage in an experimental Scopolamine-induced AD-like model. The subjects were divided into 5 groups such as control, sham, TGF-beta 1 control, Scopolamin group, TGF-beta 1 treatment groups.Then all groups were divided into 2 subgroups according to 28th-56th days. Except for Morris water maze (MWM) test, hippocampus and prefrontal cortex tissues were taken for light-electron microscopic, immunohistochemical, and biochemical examinations. It was observed that learning and memory abilities, which decreased in the MWM test of the Scopolamine group, increased in the treatment groups. In addition, alpha-secretase expression decreased in the Scopolamin group, while it increased in the TGF-beta 1 treatment group. It was determined that A beta-40 and caspase-3 immunoreactivity, beta and gamma-secretase enzyme levels increased in the Scopolamin group and decreased in TGF-beta 1 treatment group. Cellular degenerations were relatively decreased in TGF-beta 1 treatment group. It was thought that TGF-beta 1 might have a therapeutic effect on Alzheimer's disease by increasing memory performance and preventing A beta-40 accumulation in the AD-like model induced by Scopolamine and also, may be effective preventing neuronal damage by down-regulating caspase-3 expression. When all the findings evaluated together, it was concluded that TGF-beta 1 could be evaluated as a therapeutic agent in Alzheimer's disease.

AB  - Neuroinflammation has been implicated in cognitive dysfunction and the occurrence of depression in neurodegenerative diseases. Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) is believed to be involved with the benefits of exercise training in boosting memory and learning processes and antidepressant therapies. This study aimed to investigate the effect of forced treadmill exercise on hippocampal BDNF expression levels, depression symptoms, tactile memory and working memory in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-treated rats. For this purpose, 40 male Wistar rats received 0.25 mg/kg of LPS or saline intraperitoneally for 9 consecutive days before exercise. They again received a single injection of 0.5 mg/kg of LPS or saline on days 20 and 41 after exercise. Exercise groups had to run on a motorized treadmill 5 days a week for 8 weeks. Following the last exercise training session, forced swim test (FST), Y maze and novel object recognition (NOR) task were performed. Finally, the hippocampus of rats was removed and used for determination of BDNF expression levels by real-time polymerase chain reaction (real-time PCR). The data showed that LPS decreased BDNF expression levels, Y maze score, and recognition index in NOR and increased immobility time in FST (p < 0.05). In contrast, forced treadmill exercise increased BDNF expression levels and improved the percentage of spontaneous alternation, recognition index, and immobility time in LPS-treated rats (p < 0.05). There was a significant correlation between BDNF expression levels with immobility time and recognition index (p 0.05) but not with the percentage of spontaneous alternation (p 0.05). The findings suggest that forced treadmill exercise may protect the brain of LPS-treated rats by improving the symptoms of depression and cognitive function through its effect on BDNF expression levels.

AB  - A real-scale application experience Natural Treatment Systems for Wastewater ( NTSW) operating in continues with livestock farms for one year. These systems are based on digesters, subsurface vertical flow constructed wetlands (SVFCW) and facultative ponds. Chemical Oxygen Demand removal efficiency (CODRE) has obtained between 70 and 90%. Likewise, it have been possible to compare the operation of cascade flow digesters (CFD) (<76% CODRE) versus complete mixing digesters (CMD) (<50% CODRE). Facultative ponds (FP) when combined with (SSFCW), removed a higher percentage of CODRE compared with ponds (92%). Correlations of interest have been found between the variables evaluated in each plant. Finally, different elements are alternated in the same system, this system is capable of supporting variations in changes in flow rate and organic load coming from the farm, maintaining an adequate elimination of COD and other parameters of interest.

AB  - Key message We show that in rice, the amino acid-conjugates of JA precursor, OPDA, may function as a non-canonical signal for the production of phytoalexins in coordination with the innate chitin signaling. The core oxylipins, jasmonic acid (JA) and JA-Ile, are well-known as potent regulators of plant defense against necrotrophic pathogens and/or herbivores. However, recent studies also suggest that other oxylipins, including 12-oxo-phytodienoic acid (OPDA), may contribute to plant defense. Here, we used a previously characterized metabolic defense marker, p-coumaroylputrescine (CoP), and fungal elicitor, chitooligosaccharide, to specifically test defense role of various oxylipins in rice (Oryza sativa). While fungal elicitor triggered a rapid production of JA, JA-Ile, and their precursor OPDA, rice cells exogenously treated with the compounds revealed that OPDA, rather than JA-Ile, can stimulate the CoP production. Next, reverse genetic approach and oxylipin-deficient rice mutant (hebiba) were used to uncouple oxylipins from other elicitor-triggered signals. It appeared that, without oxylipins, residual elicitor signaling had only a minimal effect but, in synergy with OPDA, exerted a strong stimulatory activity towards CoP production. Furthermore, as CoP levels were compromised in the OPDA-treated Osjar1 mutant cells impaired in the oxylipin-amino acid conjugation, putative OPDA-amino acid conjugates emerged as hypothetical regulators of CoP biosynthesis. Accordingly, we found several OPDA-amino acid conjugates in rice cells treated with exogenous OPDA, and OPDA-Asp was detected, although in small amounts, in the chitooligosaccharide-treated rice. However, as synthetic OPDA-Asp and OPDA-Ile, so far, failed to induce CoP in cells, it suggests that yet another presumed OPDA-amino acid form(s) could be acting as novel regulator(s) of phytoalexins in rice.

AB  - Human microbiota-associated murine models, using fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) from human donors, help explore the microbiome's role in diseases like Alzheimer's disease (AD). This study examines how gut bacteria from donors with protective factors against AD influence behavior and brain pathology in an AD mouse model. Female 3xTgAD mice received weekly FMT for 2 months from (i) an 80-year-old AD patient (AD-FMT), (ii) a cognitively healthy 73-year-old with the protective APOEe2 allele (APOEe2-FMT), (iii) a 22-year-old healthy donor (Young-FMT), and (iv) untreated mice (Mice-FMT). Behavioral assessments included novel object recognition (NOR), Y-maze, open-field, and elevated plus maze tests; brain pathology (amyloid and tau), neuroinflammation (in situ autoradiography of the 18 kDa translocator protein in the hippocampus); and gut microbiota were analyzed. APOEe2-FMT improved short-term memory in the NOR test compared to AD-FMT, without significant changes in other behavioral tests. This was associated with increased neuroinflammation in the hippocampus, but no effect was detected on brain amyloidosis and tauopathy. Specific genera, such as Parabacteroides and Prevotellaceae_UGC001, were enriched in the APOEe2-FMT group and associated with neuroinflammation, while genera like Desulfovibrio were reduced and linked to decreased neuroinflammation. Gut microbiota from a donor with a protective factor against AD improved short-term memory and induced neuroinflammation in regions strategic to AD. The association of several genera with neuroinflammation in the APOEe2-FMT group suggests a collegial effect of the transplanted microbiome rather than a single-microbe driver effect. These data support an association between gut bacteria, glial cell activation, and cognitive function in AD.

AB  - Much of our understanding of navigation comes from the study of individual species, often with specific tasks tailored to those species. Here, we provide a novel experimental and analytic framework integrating across humans, rats, and simulated reinforcement learning (RL) agents to interrogate the dynamics of behavior during spatial navigation. We developed a novel open-field navigation task ("Tartarus maze") requiring dynamic adaptation (shortcuts and detours) to frequently changing obstructions on the path to a hidden goal. Humans and rats were remarkably similar in their trajectories. Both species showed the greatest similarity to RL agents utilizing a "successor representation," which creates a predictive map. Humans also displayed trajectory features similar to model-based RL agents, which implemented an optimal tree-search planning procedure. Our results help refine models seeking to explain mammalian navigation in dynamic environments and highlight the utility of modeling the behavior of different species to uncover the shared mechanisms that support behavior.

AB  - Background: Epidemiological data regarding thyroid diseases are lacking, in particular for occupationally exposed populations. Objectives: To compare the risk of hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism between farming activities within the complete population of French farm managers (FMs). Methods: Digital health data from retrospective administrative databases, including insurance claims and electronic health/medical records, was employed. This cohort data spanned the entirety of French farm managers (FMs) who had undertaken work at least once from 2002 to 2016. Survival analysis with the time to initial medication reimbursement as timescale was used to examine the association (hazard ratio, HR) between 26 specific farming activities and both treated hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism. A distinct model was developed for each farming activity, comparing FMs who had never engaged in the specific farming activity between 2002 and 2016 with those who had. All analyses were adjusted for potential confounders (e.g., age), and sensitivity analyses were conducted. Results: Among 1088561 FMs (mean age 46.6 [SD 14.1]; 31% females), there were 31834 hypothyroidism cases (75% females) and 620 hyperthyroidism cases (67% females), respectively. The highest risks were observed for cattle activities for both hyperthyroidism (HR ranging from 1.75 to 2.42) and hypothyroidism (HR ranging from 1.41 to 1.44). For hypothyroidism, higher risks were also observed for several animal farming activities (pig, poultry, and rabbit), as well as fruit arboriculture (HR = 1.22 [1.14-1.31]). The lowest risks were observed for activities involving horses. Sex differences in the risk of hypothyroidism were observed for eight activities, with the risk being higher for males (HR = 1.09 [1.01-1.20]) than females in viticulture (HR = 0.97 [0.93-1.00]). The risk of hyperthyroidism was two times higher for male dairy farmers than females. Discussion: Our findings offer a comprehensive overview of thyroid disease risks within the FM community. Thyroid ailments might not stem from a single cause but likely arise from the combined effects of various causal agents and triggering factors (agricultural exposome). Further investigation into distinct farming activities-especially those involving cattle-is essential to pinpoint potential risk factors that could enhance thyroid disease monitoring in agriculture.

AB  - Monitoring and quantification of nutrient movement in soils could help farmers and policy makers to formulate effective nutrient loss reduction strategies and waste management. The study was conducted to monitor and quantify vertical and lateral movements of nitrate-nitrogen (NO3-N), phosphate (PO4) and sulphate-sulphur (SO4-S) in soils around manure dumpsites in Abeokuta, southwest Nigeria. The dumpsites investigated include a flush-type poultry litter, poultry litter mixed with beddings of wood shavings and cattle and pig waste open dumpsites. Soils were sampled at depths of 0-20, 20-40, 40-60 and 60-80 cm and at distances 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 20, 40, 60 and 80 m away from the dumpsites. Soil samples were analysed for some physical and chemical properties and NO3-N, PO4 and SO4-S contents. Results indicated that there were more nutrients in the soil around the poultry manure slurry dumpsite compared with others while the soil pH increased with increase in soil depth, across dump sites. There was evidence of leaching of salts, and this correlated positively with the soil organic matter content (r = 0.41, p < 0.01). The soils were polluted with NO3-N, PO4 and SO4-S as deep as 80-cm depth; these nutrient amounts were higher than the maximum allowable (40, 15 and 7 mg kg(-1), respectively) for southwest Nigerian soils. Due to high soil organic matter and for agronomic considerations, the soils are only suitable for cultivation at depths below 40 cm and 8 m away from the dump sites. There was significant pollution of the soils with nitrate, phosphate and sulphate, within 80 m distance from the dump site. This has serious implications for ground water recharges and shallow well sunk around these areas. There is potential risk of NO3-N, PO4 and SO4-S consumption through such water sources.

AB  - Inhibiting the activity of the intestinal enzyme alpha-amylase that catalyzes the degradation of starch into glucose can control blood glucose and provide an essential way for the treatment of Type-II diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Here, we compared the structural information of chondroitin sulfate (CS) from different origins and the effects on activity of alpha-amylase and blood glucose have been investigated. The inhibitory effects of shark and porcine CSs against alpha-amylase activity is obvious with IC50 values of 11.97 and 14.42 mg/ml, respectively, but the bovine CS almost no effect. From the data of fluorescence spectroscopic analyses, CSs from shark and pig quench Try fluorescence intensity of the enzyme, whereas bovine CS induces an increase. In vivo, oral administration of shark and porcine CSs efficiently suppresses postprandial blood glucose levels in normal and diabetic mice. Our study found that CSs from different sources showed different biological functions even if both molecular weight and disaccharide subunit composition are almost the same, and demonstrated that the CSs from shark and pig as alpha-amylase inhibitors could be regarded as a novel functional food ingredient in T2DM management.

AB  - Apolygus lucorum (Hemiptera, Insecta), cosmopolitan true bug, is a major pest of the Chinese jujube (Ziziphus jujuba). To propose control measures of A. lucorum, we investigated the molecular mechanisms of resistance in two varieties of jujube (wild jujube and winter jujube) with different sensitivities to this pest. We monitored changes of two species of jujube in the transcriptome, jasmonic acid (JA) and salicylic acid (SA) content, and the expression of genes involved in signaling pathways. The preference of A. lucorum for jujube with exogenous SA and methyl jasmonate (MeJA) were also examined. The results showed that wild jujube leaves infested by A. lucorum showed stronger resistance and non-selectivity to A. lucorum than winter jujube. By comparing data from the A. lucorum infested plants with the control, A total of 438 and 796 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were found in winter and wild jujube leaves, respectively. GO analysis revealed that biological process termed "plant-pathogen interactions", "plant hormone transduction" and "phenylpropanoid biosynthesis". Most of DEGs enriched in JA pathways were upregulated, while most DEGs of SA pathways were downregulated. A. lucorum increased the JA content but decreased the SA content in jujube. Consistently, the JA and SA contents in winter jujube were lower than those in wild jujube leaves. The key genes ZjFAD3, ZjLOX, ZjAOS, ZjAOC3 and ZjAOC4 involved in JA synthesis of jujube leaves were significantly up-regulated after A. lucorum infestation, especially the expression and up-regulation ratio of ZjFAD3, ZjLOX and ZjAOS in wild jujube were significantly higher than those in winter jujube. MeJA-treated jujube showed an obvious repellent effect on A. lucorum. Based on these findings, we conclude that A. lucorum infestation of jujube induced the JA pathway and suppressed the SA pathway. In jujube leaves the ZjFAD3, ZjLOX and ZjAOS played important roles in increasing of JA content in jujube leaves. Thus, JA played an important role in repelling and resisting against A. lucorum in jujube.

AB  - Lipid is a crucial energy resource for mammalian oocyte. Melatonin could benefit the maturation of porcine oocyte in vitro, but the related mechanism is not elucidated yet. In the current study, methods to monitor lipid metabolism in single live oocytes were firstly established using probes (Lipi-Blue and Lipi-Green). It was observed that both lipid biogenesis and lipolysis occurred in maturing oocyte, but the general level of lipids dropped. Then maturing oocytes stained with probes were treated with melatonin or lipid metabolic-related inhibitors (triacsin C, rotenone, or etomoxir). The results showed that the lipid metabolism and maturation of porcine oocytes were all disrupted and that melatonin rescued the oocytes treated with triacsin C or rotenone, but not those treated with etomoxir. Further investigation demonstrated that cumulus cells are able to transfer lipids to oocytes via gap junctions. It was also observed that melatonin receptors exist in cumulus cells and are required for oocytes to maintain lipid metabolism. Meanwhile, the global gene expressing in cumulus cells was also modulated by melatonin, especially the genes related to antioxidants (SOD1, GPX1, GPX3, GPX4, PRDX2, and PRDX5), lipid metabolism (FABP3, FABP5, ACACB, TECR, etc.), and mitochondrial respiration (GPD1, ETFB, CYC1, and the genes of ATP synthase). Altogether the current research demonstrates that melatonin modulates lipid metabolism in maturing oocytes through its receptors in cumulus cells and benefits the developmental competence of oocytes.

AB  - Spatial tasks are often goal-directed or reward-facilitated confounding the assessment of "pure" recent and remote spatial memories. The current work re-exposed preadolescent and postadolescent male rats to a non- reinforced, free exploration task to investigate cFos patterns within the hippocampus and anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) associated with recent and remote periods. Male rats were exposed to an open field task for one, 30 min session on postnatal day (P) 20, 25, or 50 and re-exposed for 30 min at either a recent (24 hours) or remote (3 weeks) timepoint. Distance traveled in the open field was measured as well as cFos labeling. In the P20 age group, there was elevated exploration at the 24-hour and 3-week tests compared to training and compared to the other age groups. In the hippocampus CA1, cFos levels were higher after the remote test than the recent test in the P20 group but higher after the recent test than remote test in the P25 and P50 groups. cFos labeling in the ACC was higher in all remote-tested groups compared to the recent-tested groups across all ages. In the P20, the 24-hour test was associated with less CA1 activity than the other age groups supporting the hypothesis that the hippocampus is not fully developed at this time point. In the P20 group, the remote representation of this task did not seem to be complete as there continued to be CA1 activity along with ACC activity following the remote test associated with elevated exploration. These results indicate the utility of unreinforced spatial navigation tasks for exploring systems consolidation processes over the lifespan and show that a fully developed hippocampus is required for optimal systems consolidation.

AB  - Neuron-derived orphan receptor 1, NR4A3 (Nor1)/NR4A3 is an orphan nuclear receptor involved in the transcriptional control of developmental and neurological functions. Oxidative stress-induced conditions are primarily associated with neurological defects in humans, yet the impact on Nor1-mediated transcription of neuronal genes remains with unknown mechanism. Here, we demonstrate that Nor1 is a non-conventional target of SUMO2/3 conjugation at Lys-137 contained in an atypic psi KxSP motif referred to as the pSuM. Nor1 pSuM SUMOylation differs from the canonical process with the obligate phosphorylation of Ser-139 by Ras signaling to create the required negatively charged interface for SUMOylation. Additional phosphorylation at sites flanking the pSuM is also mediated by the coordinated action of protein kinase casein kinase 2 to function as a small ubiquitin-like modifier enhancer, regulating Nor1-mediated transcription and proteasomal degradation. Nor1 responsive genes involved in cell proliferation and metabolism, such as activating transcription factor 3, cyclin D1, CASP8 and FADD-like apoptosis regulator, and enolase 3 were upregulated in response to pSuM disruption in mouse HT-22 hippocampal neuronal cells and human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells. We also identified critical antioxidant genes, such as catalase, superoxide dismutase 1, and microsomal glutathione S-transferase 2, as responsive targets of Nor1 under pSuM regulation. Nor1 SUMOylation impaired gene transcription through less effective Nor1 chromatin binding and reduced enrichment of histone H3K27ac marks to gene promoters. These effects resulted in decreased neuronal cell growth, increased apoptosis, and reduced survival to oxidative stress damage, underlying the role of pSuM-modified Nor1 in redox homeostasis. Our findings uncover a hierarchical post-translational mechanism that dictates Nor1 non-canonical SUMOylation, disrupting Nor1 transcriptional competence, and neuroprotective redox sensitivity.

AB  - BACKGROUND Colorado potato beetle (CPB; Leptinotarsa decemlineata) is a destructive quarantine pest that develops broad physiological adaptations to potato plants. During feeding, CPB deposits a copious amount of wet frass onto the surface of leaves and stems that remains in place for long periods. Insect behaviors such as feeding, crawling and oviposition are able to mediate plant defenses. However, the specific role of CPB defecation-associated cues in manipulating plant defenses remains unclear. RESULTS CPB larval frass significantly suppressed potato polyphenol oxidase activity and enhanced larval growth on treated potato plants. The incorporation of antibiotics into larval frass triggered higher jasmonic acid (JA)-regulated defense responses in potato plants compared with antibiotic-free frass. Four bacterial symbionts belonging to the genera Acinetobacter, Citrobacter, Enterobacter and Pantoea were isolated from larval frass and suppressed plant defenses. After reinoculation of these bacteria into axenic larvae, Acinetobacter and Citrobacter were found to be highly abundant in the frass, whereas Enterobacter and Pantoea were less abundant probably due to the negative effect of potato steroidal glycoalkaloids (SGA) such as alpha-solanine. Furthermore, direct application of Acinetobacter and Citrobacter to wounded potato plants significantly inhibited the expression of genes associated with the JA-mediated defense signaling pathway and SGA biosynthesis. CONCLUSION Our findings demonstrate that CPB exploits frass-associated bacteria as a deceptive strategy of plant defense suppression, adding an interesting dimension to our understanding of how CPB successfully specializes on potato plants.

AB  - BackgroundNeuronal ferroptosis is a major cause of cognitive impairment and mortality in patients with sepsis-associated encephalopathy (SAE). A low dose of acetaminophen (APAP) in septic mice can prevent ferroptosis in the hippocampal tissue; however, the underlying mechanism is unknown. This study aimed to investigate the mechanism by which APAP reduces ferroptosis in the hippocampal tissues of septic mice. MethodsA mouse model of SAE was established, and the ferroptosis pathway inhibitors RSL3 and iFSP1+RSL3 were used in addition to APAP for the interventions, respectively. The 7-day survival rate of the mice was recorded, and cognitive function was examined using the Morris water maze test. Hematoxylin and eosin staining was performed to observe hippocampal tissue damage. Hippocampal iron and malondialdehyde (MDA) were measured using chemical colorimetric methods. Immunofluorescence was used to detect the reactive oxygen species (ROS) content in hippocampal tissues. ResultsRSL3 reversed the efficacy of APAP on improving cognitive dysfunction in septic mice but did not obviously reverse the survival rate of mice enhanced by APAP. RSL3 aggravated APAP-induced hippocampal tissue damage in mice attenuated by APAP. RSL3 inhibited glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4) expression and increased ferroptosis suppressor protein 1 (FSP1) and 4-hydroxy-2-nonenal (4-HNE) expression. RSL3 also reversed the effects of APAP in reducing iron, MDA, and ROS levels in the hippocampal tissues of septic mice. iFSP1+RSL3 further reversed the effect of APAP on ameliorating cognitive dysfunction in septic mice and successfully reversed the survival rate of mice enhanced by APAP. iFSP1+RSL3 aggravated APAP-induced cerebral hippocampal damage. iFSP1+RSL3 inhibited both GPX4 and FSP1, further reversing the effect of APAP on the reduction in iron, 4-HNE, ROS, and MDA levels in the cerebral hippocampus of mice with sepsis. ConclusionThese data suggest that APAP inhibits ferroptosis in the cerebral hippocampus of septic mice through the GPX4 and FSP1 pathways.

AB  - Chronic stress is a key factor in the development of depression. It leads to hyperactivation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, which in turn increases the formation of glucocorticoids (GCs). Chronically elevated GC levels disrupt neuroplasticity and affect brain lipid metabolism, which may, ultimately, contribute to the development of depression. This study aimed to investigate the effects of the antidepressants St. John's Wort extract and escitalopram on lipid metabolism in vivo. Therefore, repeated corticosterone injections were used to induce depression-like behavior in rats. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were stressed with corticosterone injections (40 mg/kg, s.c.) over 22 consecutive days and were concomitantly treated with varying doses of the St. John's wort extract Ze 117 (30, 90 or 180 mg/kg, p.o.) or escitalopram (10 mg/kg, p.o.) and behavioral changes were evaluated using a modified forced swim test. The results indicate that repeated corticosterone injections significantly decreased the latency to first immobility. Furthermore, co-treatment of corticosterone with Ze 117 increased latency to first immobility significantly compared to rats treated with corticosterone alone. To further investigate the biochemical effects of corticosterone-induced stress, as well as the possible counter-regulation by antidepressants, the lipidomes of the plasma and hippocampus samples were analyzed by shotgun mass spectrometry. Corticosterone-induced stress significantly altered key lipid metabolites in the plasma but not in the hippocampal samples. In the hippocampus, however, specific glycerophospholipids such as lysophosphatidylethanolamines (LPEs) increased with escitalopram treatment and with Ze 117, both showing significant correlations with behavioral parameters. In summary, our study shows significant behavioral- and lipidome-altering processes with Ze 117 and escitalopram in rat plasma and hippocampal samples, thereby providing new targets and biomarker ideas for clinical diagnosis and antidepressant intervention.

AB  - Essential biomolecules can critically influence the performance of consumers. A deficiency in dietary sterols has been shown to constrain the food quality of prokaryotic food sources for aquatic consumers. Here, we assessed the importance of dietary cholesterol for life history traits (survival, growth and egg production) of the freshwater herbivore Daphnia magna in supplementation experiments with various sterol-containing eukaryotic phytoplankton diets (dinoflagellates, diatoms, and golden algae). We combined cholesterol supplementation via liposomes with C-13-labelling of the phytoplankton diets and traced the origin of cholesterol in Daphnia using compound-specific stable isotope analysis. All phytoplankton strains used here were rich in polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) but differed in their phytosterol composition. We show that growth and reproduction of D. magna can be limited by sterols even when feeding on sterol-containing eukaryotic phytoplankton diets. The impact of cholesterol supplementation on growth and reproduction of D. magna differed among phytoplankton diets (strains). The positive effect of cholesterol supplementation was most pronounced on diatom diets. Estimation of source proportions using stable isotopes revealed that D. magna preferentially assimilated the supplemented cholesterol rather than synthesizing it from dietary phytosterols. Our experiments suggest that the different responses to cholesterol supplementation on the various phytoplankton diets were unrelated to the suitability of dietary phytosterols to serve as cholesterol precursors but were caused by other biochemical or morphological food quality constraints. The combination of methods applied here could be very useful for uncovering nutritional constraints and thus for assessing the importance of essential biomolecules for the performance of herbivorous consumers.

AB  - Metaheuristic algorithms are important methods for solving practical optimization problems. Accurate, efficient, and stable metaheuristic algorithms have become the main goal of optimization research. Hippopotamus optimization algorithm (HO) is a new algorithm with good optimization effect proposed by three biological behaviors of hippopotamus: position change, defense, and avoidance of predators. However, due to the many restrictions of hippopotamus itself and the incomplete exploitation of hippopotamus' physiological functions, in the exploration and exploitation stages, the parameter settings are single and limited in range, and the position change strategies under different conditions are less different, resulting in the algorithm's limited search ability, tendency to converge prematurely and fall into the local optimal trap, poor exploration accuracy, and other shortcomings, making it impossible to obtain good results when facing optimization problems. In response to these shortcomings, this paper proposes a multi-strategy Hippopotamus optimization algorithm (MSHO), which achieves better performance by introducing three strategy improvement methods: adaptive perturbation optimization, autonomous optimal screening and new avoidance and defense. The effectiveness of MSHO is verified by comparing it with 10 excellent algorithms on the two test sets of CEC2017 and CEC2020. MSHO ranked first in the Friedman test results of the two experimental test sets, and in the two test sets, the optimization effect of MSHO was improved by 47.21% and 45.66%, respectively, compared with HO. Parameter perturbation analysis experiments were conducted, and the optimization effect of the improved strategy on the algorithm was obtained through ablation experiments. In addition, feature selection (FS) helps to improve the accuracy and efficiency of data analysis in fields such as engineering design and image analysis. In order to verify that MSHO has good effects in FS applications, it was compared with 10 excellent algorithms on 23 FS data sets. The Friedman test results of MSHO on 23 experimental FS data sets show that the optimization effect of MSHO is also better than other comparison algorithms, and the optimization effect is improved by 32.11% compared with HO, proving that MSHO performs better than the original HO and other comparison algorithms in the application of FS. MSHO and HO are tested for exploration and exploitation balance and population diversity, and it is finally concluded that MSHO has good stability and population diversity.

AB  - Background: Perioperative neurocognitive disorder (PND) is the main cause of poor postoperative recovery in elderly patients with age-related reductions in androgen levels. However, the underlying mechanisms have not been completely elucidated.
   Methods: A mouse model of PND was constructed using abdominal surgery. Dihydrotestosterone (DHT), as the primary androgen, can improve the cognitive function of mice with PNDs by reducing REDOX damage. To clarify the role of circular RNA (circRNA) in DHT in improving cognitive function in mice with PND, circRNA sequencing was performed to analyze the expression of circRNA in the hippocampus of mice.
   Results: We confirmed that mmu_circ_0001442 is the primary circRNA responsive to DHT stimulation in mice with PND. The mmu_circ_0001442/miR-125a-3p/NUFIP2 axis was predicted and constructed according to the analysis of databases, including pita, miRanda, TargetScan, miRDB, micro-CDS, PolymiRTS, and TarBase v.8. Subsequently, the axis was verified by qPCR and double-luciferase reporter gene assays. In vitro, we found that DHT rarely had an effect on the growth of BV2 cells using the CCK-8 assay, but it attenuated the cytotoxic effect of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) on BV2 cells. In addition, we found that LPS stimulation promoted the release of proinflammatory cytokines, including IL-6 and TNF-alpha, in BV2 cells, whereas mmu_circ_0001442 knockdown and NUFIP2 knockdown partially abrogated this effect.
   Conclusions: Taken together, DHT inhibited REDOX damage and neuroinflammation in the hippocampus to alleviate cognitive disorders in mice with PNDs via activation of the mmu_circ_0001442/miR-125a-3p/NUFIP2 axis. This study provides a novel rationale for developing DHT as a potential therapeutic agent for PND prevention.

AB  - Introduction To investigate the heterogeneous effect of Apolipoprotein E (ApoE) genotype on clinical phenotypes in early-onset Alzheimer's disease (EOAD) and late-onset Alzheimer's disease (LOAD), respectively. Methods 785 probable AD patients were enrolled from the dementia cohort of Peking Union Medical College Hospital (PUMCH), China. There were 386 EOAD and 399 LOAD cases. All individuals finished history inquiry, neurological examination, blood biochemical test, neuropsychological screening test, electroencephalography, brain CT/MRI, and ApoE genotyping. Some participants had neuropsychological domain assessment (n = 317), MRI morphometry (n = 130), CSF testing of A beta 42, p-tau, t-tau (n = 144), or DNA sequencing (n = 690). The variables were compared mainly between e4 carriers and non-carriers in EOAD and LOAD, respectively. Results In LOAD, e4 carriers showed female predominance; worse performance in trail making test, delayed recall of auditory verbal learning test (AVLT) and rey complex figure; smaller hippocampal, parahippocampal, and entorhinal volume, as compared to e4 non-carriers. In EOAD, e4 carriers had lower scores in AVLT, episodic memory and modified Luria's tapping task; but less cortical atrophy in entorhinal, middle cingulate, inferior frontal, and parieto-occipital regions, in comparison to e4 non-carriers. 6.2% (43/690) subjects harbored potential causative mutations in APP, PSEN1, and PSEN2. In both EOAD and LOAD, no differences were observed between e4 carriers and non-carriers in CSF levels of A beta 42, p-tau, t-tau, or mutation frequency. Conclusions ApoE exerts a heterogeneous effect on clinical phenotypes in EOAD and LOAD, which might be related to the different genetic and pathological basis underlying them.

AB  - Meat production and consumption is associated with the generation of significant environmental pressure and impacts, and resource inefficiencies. This study combines Material Flow Analysis (MFA) and Life cycle Assessment (LCA) to analyse the meat supply chain in order to better comprehend the circularity of the system, considering the Italian meat supply chain as a case study. The system boundaries of both the MFA and LCA included all the life cycle stages starting from slaughter phase to meat consumption at household and food services level. The LCA study included also all the stages upstream of the slaughter phase. Consumed meat and animal by-products (ABPs) were quantified, and the potential benefits due to the re-use of rendered ABPs were assessed. Results showed an average meat consumption of 55 kg/per-capita/year with pig, poultry and cattle meat contributing respectively by 46%, 27% and 25%, followed by other meat categories, representing 2% of the total meat consumption. Daily meat consumption is responsible for the emission of 2.80 kg CO2eq per capita with beef meat contributing to 65% of the emissions. Results showed the same relative importance among meat types for acidification, terrestrial and freshwater eutrophication, and land use impact categories. A sensitivity analysis showed that the approach to allocate environmental impacts between meat and rendered ABPs did not affect the ranking of meat categories. The system under study resulted to be efficient and to promote circularity, thanks to the re-use and valorisation of ABPs.

AB  - Osteoarthritis (OA) is the most prevalent joint disease associated with chronic pain. OA pain is often accompanied by mood disorders. We addressed the role of the Prokineticin (PK) system in pain and mood alterations in a mice OA model induced with monosodium iodoacetate (MIA). The effect of a PK antagonist (PC1) was compared to that of diclofenac. C57BL/6J male mice injected with MIA in the knee joint were characterized by allodynia, motor deficits, and fatigue. Twenty-eight days after MIA, in the knee joint, we measured high mRNA of PK2 and its receptor PKR1, pro-inflammatory cytokines, and MMP13. At the same time, in the sciatic nerve and spinal cord, we found increased levels of PK2, PKR1, IL-1 beta, and IL-6. These changes were in the presence of high GFAP and CD11b mRNA in the sciatic nerve and GFAP in the spinal cord. OA mice were also characterized by anxiety, depression, and neuroinflammation in the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus. In both stations, we found increased pro-inflammatory cytokines. In addition, PK upregulation and reactive astrogliosis in the hippocampus and microglia reactivity in the prefrontal cortex were detected. PC1 reduced joint inflammation and neuroinflammation in PNS and CNS and counteracted OA pain and emotional disturbances.

AB  - This study aims to fabricate a novel integrated photocatalytic adsorbent (IPA) via a green solvothermal process employing tea (Camellia sinensis var. assamica) leaf extract as a stabilizing and capping agent for the removal of organic pollutants from wastewater. An n-type semiconductor photocatalyst, SnS2, was chosen as a photocatalyst due to its remarkable photocatalytic activity supported over areca nut (Areca catechu) biochar for the adsorption of pollutants. The adsorption and photocatalytic properties of fabricated IPA were examined by taking amoxi-cillin (AM) and congo red (CR) as two emerging pollutants found in wastewater. Investigating synergistic adsorption and photocatalytic properties under varying reaction conditions mimicking actual wastewater con-ditions marks the novelty of the present research. The support of biochar for the SnS2 thin films induced a reduction in charge recombination rate, which enhanced the photocatalytic activity of the material. The adsorption data were in accordance with the Langmuir nonlinear isotherm model, indicating monolayer che-mosorption with the pseudo-second-order rate kinetics. The photodegradation process follows pseudo-first-order kinetics with the highest rate constant of 0.0450 min-1 for AM and 0.0454 min-1 for CR. The overall removal efficiency of 93.72 +/- 1.19% and 98.43 +/- 1.53% could be achieved within 90 min for AM and CR via simulta-neous adsorption and photodegradation model. A plausible mechanism of synergistic adsorption and photo-degradation of pollutants is also presented. The effect of pH, Humic acid (HA) concentration, inorganic salts and water matrices have also been included.The photodegradation activity of SnS2 under visible light coupled with the adsorption capability of the biochar results in the excellent removal of the contaminants from the liquid phase.

AB  - To elucidate the morphological diversity and genetic characteristics of the pollen of Polygonatum species, this study utilized a total of 46 samples encompassing six species and one variety of Polygonatum. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was employed to examine the morphological traits of the pollen and to analyze the evolutionary patterns and genetic relationships among Polygonatum species. The results indicate that the pollen grains of the 46 Polygonatum germplasm are uniformly characterized as monads, heteropolar, bilaterally symmetrical, atreme, and possess a mono-sulcus. They were peroblate (P/E-ratio = 0.36-0.42) in shape and medium to large (P = 18.17-27.15 mu m, E = 44.11-67.07 mu m) in size. And there are four types of exine ornamentation: reticulate, reticulate-perforate, reticulate-rugulate, and reticulate-verrucate. The 46 germplasm resources were classified into four clusters based on the results of a pollen morphology clustering analysis: P. cyrtonema and P. macropodum were grouped into cluster I, P. filipes and P. odoratum into cluster II, P. kingianum and P. kingianum var. grandifolium into cluster III, and P. alternicirrhosum was classified as cluster IV, standing alone. This study tentatively suggests that pollen morphology, particularly pollen size and exine ornamentation, can serve as a valuable reference for the classification, genetic relationship, and evolutionary patterns of the genus Polygonatum.

AB  - Procrastination is a prevalent phenomenon throughout the world, which can lead to worse consequences across life domains, such as academic performance, mental health, and even public policy. Despite the evidence for the association between dispositional optimism and procrastination, the neural mechanisms underlying this link remain unexplored. To address this issue, we employed voxel-based morphometry (VBM) and resting-state functional connectivity (RSFC) methods to explore the underlying links between dispositional optimism and procrastination in a large sample (N = 408). The self-report results showed that dispositional optimism was negatively associated with procrastination (r = -.30, p < .001). The VBM analysis indicated that dispositional optimism was positively correlated with gray matter volumes (GMV) in the right para-hippocampal (rPHC), and negatively correlated with GMV in the left cerebellum. Moreover, the functional connectivity analysis with the rPHC as a seed region revealed that rPHC-rMFC (right medial frontal gyrus) functional connectivity was negatively associated with dispositional optimism. Furthermore, the mediation analysis showed that the rPHC-rMFC connectivity partially mediated the relationship between dispositional optimism and procrastination. These results suggested that the rPHC-rMFC connectivity engaged in less task aversiveness by episodic prospection may underlie the association between dispositional optimism and procrastination, which provides a new perspective to understand the relationship between dispositional optimism and procrastination.

AB  - In social insects, behavioral changes are shaped by social context which includes the presence of other castes. Soldiers play a critical role in the defense of a termite colony, although their role beyond defense is less understood. Termites tunnel to safely acquire resources, producing an extended phenotype of the colony shaped by various environmental and genetic factors. In this study, we investigated the indirect influence of the soldier on worker tunneling behavior for three species of Reticulitermes subterranean termites. Groups of 50 worker termites containing either three, one, none, or the cuticular extract of soldiers were placed into planar arenas and allowed to tunnel. The speed and morphology of tunnel construction were determined for the first 36 h of tunneling. We found tunneling differences among species: R. flavipes (Kollar) produced more branches and tunneled faster than both R. hageni Banks and R. virginicus (Banks). Trials with live soldiers produced more branches in R. flavipes, while trials with live soldiers or even the chemical extract of a soldier increased tunnel speed in R. flavipes and accelerated tunnel initiation in R. hageni. In R. virginicus, there was little impact of soldiers. These behavioral changes in R. flavipes and R. hageni may reduce the chance of tunneling workers encountering enemies without soldiers present. All three species used dead reckoning to maintain a straight direction after being forced through two sharp turns, but the presence of soldiers had no influence on this ability. This study, showing that soldiers can influence tunneling behavior in workers in some species, provides additional evidence of the keystone role of soldiers in termite colonies, and demonstrates that this influence can be exerted through chemical cues alone in some species.

AB  - A novel carbonic anhydrase II (CA II) from erythrocytes of camel (Camelus dromedarius) was purified to ho-mogeneity using affinity chromatography and biochemically characterized. Specific activity of 140.88 U/mg was obtained with 745.17-fold purification and 25.37% yield. The enzyme was a monomer with a lower molecular weight (25 kDa) and lower Zn content (0.50 mol of Zn per mol of protein). The enzyme showed higher optimum temperature (70 degrees C) and pH (pH 9.0), moreover, it was stable at higher temperatures and strongly alkaline pH as judged by thermodynamic parameters (Ea, kd, Ed, t1/2, D-value, Z-value, & UDelta;H, & UDelta;G and & UDelta;S). The enzyme was inhibited by cations (Al3+, Ca2+, Cd2+, Co2+, Cr3+, Cu2+, Fe3+, Ni2+, Mg2+ and Zn2+) as well as by anions (Br CH3COO affect enzyme activity. Effect of various chemicals on enzyme activity was also investigated. Km, Vmax, kcat and kcat/Km values for 4-NPA were found to be 1.74 mM, 0.0093 U/mL, 0,0039 s  1 and 0,0023 s  1 mM  1, respec-tively.

AB  - Animal-based research and drug safety studies are essential to understanding the mysteries of nature and the long-term survival of humans. Due to the rapid increase in the global human population, conflict- and economically driven human migration, tourism-related activities, densely populated metropolitan areas, and local policies, humans will be affected by a multitude of novel disease-causing microorganisms and civilizational diseases. Despite disparities among countries, recent and planned changes in regulations concerning animal research and drug safety studies could have detrimental effects on both the animal research community and nations lacking sufficient social support systems. Based on existing scientific literature, I argue that we need animal research encompassing aspects such as animal development, behavior, drug safety studies, and for the understanding of future civilizational diseases. Depending on the nature of the research questions and local challenges, a suitable animal model organism should be made mandatory.

AB  - The management and prevention of key inflammatory-associated pregnancy complications such as chorioamnionitis and pre-eclampsia is hampered by a lack of early gestation risk screening tools. In a proof-of-principle study we used targeted cell-free RNA analyses of maternal plasma samples from large animal (sheep) and human pregnancy cohorts to develop a minimally invasive screening test for inflammatory markers. This study utilised a preterm sheep model of sterile and bacterial chorioamnionitis. Date-mated ewes received either intraamniotic Saline Control (n = 10) or E.Coli LPS (Sterile chorioamnionitis) with 2 days (n = 9) or 8 days exposure(n = 6). Preterm lambs were delivered at 124 +/- 1d gestation. Findings were validated in a bacterial model of chorioamnionitis where ewes were exposed to 7 days of intraamniotic M.Hominis with delivery at 98 d gestion(n = 8) or 128d gestation(n = 8). Maternal blood was collected prior to intervention and at delivery in each group. Random Forest algorithm was used to analyse 8 cell-free RNA(cfRNA) targets related to inflammation in maternal plasma at baseline and delivery, identifying genes that separated animals with or without intrauterine inflammation. Plasma cfRNA data was compared to mRNA expression in placental tissue. Haematological and placental mRNA comparisons were analysed with ANOVA/Tukey HSD/Dunnett T3 tests. Maternal plasma cfRNA findings of intrauterine inflammation were then validated in human plasma samples from a cohort of patients with late onset pre-eclampsia (n = 10) or uncomplicated pregnancies (n = 10). We present data showing that targeted maternal cfRNA assays can accurately identify chorioamnionitis of sterile (AUC 1.0) and infectious (AUC 0.84) origin in a sheep model of pregnancy. Findings were then validated in human maternal plasma samples from patients with late-onset pre-eclampsia in the 1st (AUC = 0.85), 2nd (AUC = 0.90) and 3rd (AUC = 0.82) trimesters. In both sheep and human model systems, cfRNA tests offered high levels of sensitivity and specificity in the absence of overt clinical symptoms. We suggest that further development of this technology may serve as a scalable, rapidly deployed and cost-effective means for predicting major inflammatory conditions in pregnancy.

AB  - Aspects of the feeding ecology of the threatened maned sloth (Bradypus torquatus Illiger, 1811) are poorly understood. Here, we evaluate the diet composition and the influence of leaf chemical compounds on the consumption of plant species by 10 radio-tracked individuals in southern Bahia and construct a list of plants consumed by the species based on our data and the available literature. We confirmed that the maned sloth is a strict folivore and consumes predominantly young leaves. We reported the consumption of 39 species, from 32 genera and 20 families of plants in southern Bahia, and provide an updated list of 68 species so far reported as consumed by maned sloths. The most frequently consumed species in southern Bahia belong to the genera Emmotum, Inga, Ficus and Brosimum, totalling almost half of the maned sloth's diet. Nevertheless, only Ficus spp. were widely consumed by maned sloths elsewhere. The low consumption of Cecropia spp. suggests that maned sloth's diet is not strongly linked to these taxa as reported for other Bradypus. None of the evaluated chemical compounds had a significant effect on the choice of plants consumed. Altogether, the available data indicated that the maned sloth is a generalist at the species level. In addition to morphological and physiological adaptations, it deals with the challenges of a foliage-based diet by selecting young leaves. Our update on maned sloth's diet may be used to overcome the difficulties of keeping and reproducing them in captivity and support actions that aim to recover their habitat.

AB  - A fundamental question in comparative cognition concerns the ability to remember back in time to an earlier event or episode. This ability is referred to as episodic memory. Whether nonhumans can be used to model human episodic memory has engendered much interest and debate for over 2 decades. The central hypothesis of an animal model of episodic memory is that, at the moment of the memory assessment, the animal remembers back in time to a specific earlier event or episode. I describe (a) an approach for evaluating evidence of episodic memory in animal models (b) what aspects of episodic memory are being modeled in animals (c) what standards ought to be applied to a candidate model of episodic memory in nonhumans (d) the first evidence of episodic memory in nonhumans, and (e) a brief overview of the diversity of approaches that are now available. The remainder of the article focuses on the development of a robust model of episodic memory in rats. Converging lines of evidence suggest that rats provide a good model for exploring episodic memory. This evidence includes studies that focus on (a) what-where-when memory (b) source memory (c) binding of episodic memories (d) memory of multiple Items in context using episodic memory (e) replay of episodic memories (f), recollection, and (g) answering an unexpected question after incidental encoding. In each of these domains, I describe evidence for episodic memory in the absence of nonepisodic judgments of familiarity. I end with some consideration of future directions.

AB  - In this work, a phase field fracture model is proposed that includes single crystal anisotropy in both the elastic constants and the fracture energy. The strain energy is decomposed into tensile and compressive parts, and only the tensile part contributes to crack propagation. Anisotropic fracture energy is included to capture the impact of crystal orientations on crack paths. The performance of our model is demonstrated using simulations of single edge notched tension specimens with four different microstructures. Firstly, crack propagation is predicted in single crystal specimens with anisotropic fracture energy but isotropic elastic constants to investigate the impact of the anisotropy strength parameter and the crystal orientation. The anisotropy strength impacts the crack angle and the maximum stress experienced before fracture. The crystal orientation impacts the crack angle but not the maximum stress. Next, similar single crystal simulations are carried out with both anisotropic fracture energy and anisotropic elastic constants, and the crystal orientation impacts the crack direction, the initial slope of the stress strain curve, and the maximum stress before fracture. The capabilities of the model are demonstrated in bicrystal and polycrystal geometries, with cracks changing direction as they cross grain boundaries.

AB  - Chrysoperla externa (Hagen) and Hippodamia convergens (Guerin-Meneville) are voracious generalist predators, and important aphid control agents. In an environment containing a complex of species, the occurrence of intraguild interactions can interfere in the predator behavior and consumption. The aim of this work was to know the number of nymphs of Rhodobium porosum (Sanderson) and Macrosiphum rosae (Linnaeus) consumed by larvae of C. externa and H. convergens, and the interaction between these predators when confined together. First, second and third instar nymphs of R. porosum and M. rosae were provided in Petri dishes containing rose leaflets and second instar larvae of the predators. Intraguild interaction was studied in Petri dishes containing first instar nymphs of both aphid species and a second instar larva of C. externa plus one of H. convergens. A third treatment consisted of dishes containing a second instar larva of both predators maintained in the absence of prey. The evaluations took place throughout the entire instar of the predators. C. externa consumed a greater number of R. porosum nymphs and H. convergens a greater number of M. rosae nymphs. For both species of prey, the highest consumption was verified on the last day of evaluation. There was a positive interaction when the predator's larvae were confined in the presence of aphid nymphs, with no mortality observed for any of them. In the absence of prey, there was 70% mortality of H. convergens larvae due to intraguild predation.

AB  - Developing better practices for rodent pest control is of high importance to reduce damage during forest restoration and in crop production. For example, during direct seeding with large and highly attractive seeds such as acorns, most seeds will disappear due to consumption or dispersal if not protected. An unexplored concept in reducing rodent damage is the use of repellents derived from predators. We tested the efficiency of three volatile compounds (2-propylthietane, 2-phenylethylamine and indole) associated with predators as rodent repellent candidates and scored the reduction of acorn (Quercus petraea) removal at two field sites in southern Sweden. We further investigated at what distance (5 cm, 10 cm, and 15 cm) from the odor source the odors were efficient in lowering the removal of acorns. Removal was lowest with 2-propylthietane (25-45 % of acorn removal), followed by 2-phenylethylamine (75-95% acorn removal) at 5 cm. Indole failed to decrease acorn removal and did not differ significantly from the control treatments. In the control treatments, almost all acorns (95-100%) were removed from the plots during the 48-hour sessions at both sites, and the acorns were removed faster than in the other treatments. Removal increased with distance from the 2-propylthietane odor dispenser at both field sites. Here, the lowest acorn removal occurred at 5 cm from the odor disperser. Our short time experiment shows for the first time the potential of using 2-propylthietane for short-term protection of acorns from foraging by granivorous rodents in oak woodlands. To help increase the reliability of direct seeding as a method for regenerating and restoring forests, future studies should investigate whether the range and longevity in the field of predator odor formulations can be improved.

AB  - The study investigated the effects of dietary leucine (Leu) and fish oil (FO) on skeletal myofiber type transformations in pigs and their potential interactions. The results showed that Leu increased the content of Leu, upregulated myocyte enhancer factor-2C (MEF2C) and activated the CaMKII-AMPK/SIRT1-PGC-1 alpha pathway in the longissimus dorsi (LD) muscle. FO increased adiponectin and fatty acid beta-oxidation of LD muscle. Activation of the adiponectin signaling pathway by FO further enhanced the CaMKII pathway and upregulated the expression of MEF2C. Moreover, we found that Leu increased cyclic AMP and caffeine, and FO increased linoleic acid and glutamine in muscle metabolites, which may be the cause of myofiber conversion. In conclusion, this study demonstrated that dietary Leu and FO co-regulated the transformation from glycolytic to oxidative skeletal myofiber type. It is hypothesized that there is an interaction between amino acids and polyunsaturated fatty acids, possibly via the CaMKII signaling pathway to upregulate MEF2 and mitochondrial biogenesis.

AB  - The presence of secondary metabolites in flower nectar can mediate interactions between plants, pollinators, herbivores, and microbes. Milkweeds range in concentrations of cardenolides in flower nectar from similar to 1 to 100 ng mu l(-1). Using three different behavioral assays with bumblebees Bombus impatiens, we examined the impacts of the commercially available cardenolide ouabain at the range of concentrations at which cardenolides naturally occur in milkweeds. We show that after four days of exposure bees in consumption assays drank more of a nectar solution with a low ouabain concentration of 10 ng mu l(-1) than the control sucrose nectar, and over the course of the experiment bees consumed less of the 100 ng mu l(-1) ouabain solution than the control. Bee activity levels in Petri dish arena assays were not impacted by ouabain consumption, even at the highest concentrations; however, in free-flying choice assays, bees preferentially visited artificial flowers containing 10 ng mu l(-1) ouabain more than flowers with sucrose control, or flowers with 100 ng mu l(-1) of ouabain. We therefore conclude that cardenolides may provide plants advantages to pollination at the low end of the naturally occurring range of concentrations for cardenolides, but may be costly to plants at the high end of the range. This research highlights that secondary metabolites in nectar may be under selection to be maintained at low concentrations, and species with high concentrations of secondary metabolites may be under conflicting selection pressures to maintain high circulating levels to deter herbivores at the cost of reduced pollination.

AB  - Simple Summary The application of chelated trace minerals (CTM) in livestock nutrition is an expanding research area with a focus on the health and quality of animal products. The aim of the current study was to conduct a scientometric analysis of the last three decades on CTM application in animal nutrition to point out main sources, most prolific countries, and current and emerging topics. This investigation is descriptive in terms of type and practical in purpose. The findings showed that the words zinc, copper, performance, pig, cattle, metabolism, and bioavailability were prominent words reflecting the hotspots in the chelate field during the investigated time period. The frequencies of the terms health, muscle, bovine, trace elements, and dietary supplements indicate that they are emerging topics in CTM as research has begun to focus on these areas. The purpose of this study was to look at research trends in the application of CTM in animal nutrition in order to identify current and emerging challenges, as well as to examine the intellectual structure of the subject. The intellectual structure of CTM was examined using keyword and reference analysis. The research community includes all research and review articles published in journals indexed in the Web of Science database during the years 1990-2022. The results showed that the terms zinc, co-occurring 331 times, performance (324 times), and copper 216 (times) were the main and hotspots of research in the field of chelate. The data suggest that the most important keywords during the study period were zinc, copper, pig, bovine, metabolism, and bioavailability. The terms health, muscle, beef, trace elements, and dietary supplements represent emerging topics in CTM, as research began to focus on these areas during the years 2017-2022. The country with the greatest number of published articles was the United States of America. This bibliometric analysis showed that countries are focusing on the effects of CTM on the health and musculature of cattle through dietary supplementation with trace elements. According to the identified hot and emerging topics, this research can serve as a roadmap for a global comprehensive scientific plan and policy.

AB  - Knowledge of the radiographic anatomy of rodent skulls is essential for accurately interpreting extra-oral radiographs, a non-invasive diagnostic tool commonly used in veterinary practice. Due to the complexity of the skull and the potential for distortion in two-dimensional views, a systematic evaluation of anatomical structures is necessary. This study identifies the most clinically relevant anatomical landmarks on standard extra-oral radiographic views of the skull and mandible in various rodent species, including a cane rat, two woodchucks, and seven common mole rats. Specimens were evaluated with bone and soft tissue intact, as well as dried skulls, to identify key anatomical features. The findings highlight distinct species-specific variations despite general similarities in skull structure. These landmarks were catalogued to aid veterinary professionals in interpreting rodent radiographs. Improved recognition of these structures enhances diagnostic accuracy, enabling better assessment of normal anatomy and potential pathological conditions in rodent patients.

AB  - Larval characters are of importance in systematic and evolutionary studies of Diptera but lag behind characters of adults due to difficulties in obtaining relevant information. Larvae of stomach bot flies are obligate parasites completing development exclusively in the alimentary tract of equids and rhinoceroses. They possess diversified morphological adaptations, providing remarkable examples to further our understanding of larval evolution. Herein, three-dimensional structures of first instar Gasterophilus pecoruin and Gyrostigina rhinocerontis are compared using confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). We suggest CLSM has a large potential for exploiting cryptic character systems of micro fly larvae, as spectral range and intensity of autofluorescence emitted by sclerotized structures and soft tissues are distinct, presenting a high-contrast mechanism for multistructural visualization with non-destructive sample preparation. Five new potential synapomorphies are proposed to corroborate the sister-group Gasterophilus and Gyrostigina. The upward curving mouth-hooks of first instar Gasterophilus and Gyrostigma are distinctive in Cyclorrhapha and possibly serve to facilitate the larval subcutaneous migration within the host. Three types of mouthhooks are recognized in first instar Oestridae, with the gently curved and gradually tapered type optimized as the ancestral state, from which the gasterophiline and hypodermatine types evolved independently.

AB  - An efficient shoot regeneration system has been developed via indirect shoot organogenesis from leaf petiole-derived callus in Barleria prattensis Sant., an endemic medicinal plant to the Western Ghats. Callus cultures were established from leaf petiole explants of B. prattensis on MS medium augmented with various concentrations of 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D: 2.28-11.38 mu M) alone or in combination with Kinetin (Kn: 1.16-5.81 mu M). The highest frequency of shoot induction and shoot number was observed (92% and 15.6 shoots per culture) on MS medium supplemented with 14.46 mu M TDZ and 2.69 mu M NAA. The optimum rooting frequency (100% with 8.8 roots per shoot) was observed on quarter strength MS medium supplemented with 7.38 mu M IBA. The rooted plantlets were transplanted to soil with 82% survival rate. Start Codon Targeted (SCoT) marker analysis revealed that all in vitro and mother plants showed monomorphic DNA which indicate genetic stability between them. The analysis of total phenol content (TPC), total flavanoid content (TFC) and antioxidant activity of ethyl acetate extract of root and shoot of both field-grown plants (FGP) and in vitro grown plants (IGP) was studied. The antioxidant activity was confirmed using 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH), 2,2 '-azino-bis[3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid (ABTS)] and ferric-reducing antioxidant power (FRAP) assay. The maximum TPC (203.7 +/- 1.0 mg of gallic acid equivalent (GAE) g(-1)) and TFC (546.0 +/- 0.8 mg of quercetin equivalent (QE) g(-1)) were obtained in root extract of IGP. The same effect could be observed in antioxidant activity. The optimum half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) values for root extracts of IGP in DPPH and ABTS assay were 20.96 +/- 0.4 and 9.63 +/- 0.1 mu g mL(-1), respectively, and the FRAP value was 172.6 +/- 8.4 mu g of ascorbic acid equivalent (AAE) mg(-1) dry weight of sample.

AB  - Background: Ischemic stroke is a leading cause of death and disability worldwide. Survivors face disability and psychiatric sequelae resulting from ischemia-induced cell death and associated neuroinflammation, and oxidative stress. Herbal medicines have been shown to elicit neuroprotective effects following stroke due to their antiinflammatory and antioxidant effects. Preliminary evidence suggests that Ayahuasca (AYA), a decoction made from the vine Banisteriopsis caapi containing beta-carbolines and the shrub Psychotria viridis containing N, NDimethyltryptamine, might attenuate ischemia-induced neuroinflammation and oxidative stress. Therefore, in this study we investigated the putative protective effects of AYA in the middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) model of ischemic stroke. Methods: Wistar rats were subjected to the MCAO stroke model or sham surgery on day 0. After 24-h, rats were treated for three days with AYA (2 and 4 mL/kg, gavage) or saline. Neurological score was assessed for 72-h post- stroke. Rats were tested in the elevated plus maze, open field, and novel object recognition tests to assess locomotion, anxiety-like behavior, and recognition memory. Interleukin (IL)-6, IL-10 myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity, and the nitrite/nitrate (N/N) concentrations were determined in the prefrontal cortex (PFC), hippo- campus (HPC), hypothalamus (HYP) and cortex. as markers of inflammation. Oxidative stress was quantified in the same brain areas as measured by the levels of thiobarbituric acid reactive species (TBARS), protein carbonylation, and superoxide dismutase (SOD), and catalase (CAT) activity. Mitochondrial metabolism was assessed quantifying the activity of complex 1(CI), CII, citrate synthase (CS), succinate dehydrogenase (SDH), and creatine kinase (CK). Results: No differences were observed regarding neurological deficits, locomotion, anxiety-like behavior, and recognition memory. However, AYA reversed the stroke-induced increase in IL-6 levels in the PFC and the HPC, IL-10 in the PFC, HPC, and HYP, MPO activity in the PFC, and N/N concentration and CAT activity in the HYP. Moreover, AYA decreased TBARS levels in the PFC and HPC and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) in the PFC, and increased SOD activity in the cortex. Lastly, AYA increased CI activity in the HPC and cortex and decreased SDH and CK activity in the HPC. Conclusion: AYA administration following ischemic stroke modulates oxidative stress and neuroinflammation in the PFC, HPC, and HYP. Despite no significant improvements in neurological or behavioral scores, these mo- lecular changes suggest a neuroprotective role of AYA. Future studies should explore the timing of AYA treatment and putative long-term effects on functional recovery, as well as its potential in other brain regions critical for cognitive and motor functions.

AB  - Perioperative neurocognitive disorders (PND) is common in aged mild cognitive impairment (MCI) patients and can accelerate the progression to dementia. This process involves heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein A2/B1 (hnRNPA2/B1)-mediated aggregates of stress granules (SGs), while RUVBL2 influences the dynamics of these SGs. Our research explored a new target for modulating hnRNAPA2/B1-SGs dynamics to accelerate their disassembly and potentially delay MCI progression due to PND. We assessed the effect of hippocampal RUVBL2 knockdown on hnRNPA2/B1-SGs in aged MCI rats through behavioral studies, biochemical experiments and MRI. We also examined hnRNPA2/B1-SGs dynamics using immunofluorescence staining and fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) in rat primary hippocampal neurons. Our results revealed that hnRNPA2/B1 in the hippocampus of aged MCI rats translocates to the cytoplasm to form SGs following anesthesia. RUVBL2 knockdown promotes the disappearance of hnRNPA2/B1-SGs, allowing hnRNPA2/B1 to return to the nucleus and enhancing functional activity in the brain regions of aged MCI rats. In primary hippocampal neurons, RUVBL2 deletion facilitated hnRNPA2/B1-SGs transition from hydrogel to liquid, promoting disassembly. We compared three commonly used general anesthetics-3% sevoflurane, 40 mg<middle dot>kg-1<middle dot>h-1 propofol, and 9% desflurane. Sevoflurane upregulated RUVBL2, which decreased the intraneuronal pH and disrupted energy metabolism. These changes resulted in greater stabilization of hnRNPA2/B1- SGs. In conclusion, our findings indicated that the knockdown of RUVBL2 expression contributes to the transition of hnRNPA2/B1-SGs from the hydrogel phase to the liquid phase. Targeted interference with RUVBL2 may represent a novel approach to delay the progression to dementia due to PND in aged MCI patients.

AB  - Morphometric cardiac reference values are reported for macropods and koalas (Phascolarctos cinereus). Body weight (BW), heart weight (HW), left ventricle (LV) wall, interventricular septum (S), right ventricle (RV) wall thickness, and LV+S and RV weights were measured at postmortem examination of 48 macropods and 32 koalas that had no evidence of cardiovascular disease. The HW/BW% (0.43-0.96%) and (LV+S)/RV (2.80-4.22) for macropods were comparable to domestic species. In koalas, the HW/BW% (0.25-0.51%) was lower, and the (LV+S)/RV (3.06-5.41) ranged higher than in macropods and domestic species. The LV:RV of koalas (1.0-10.8) was more variable than in macropods (1.17-4.27). Two macropods with cardiac disease were assessed on postmortem examination against the generated reference values. An adult male common wallaroo (Osphranter robustus) was found dead with copious serous peritoneal effusion, chronic passive hepatic congestion with centrilobular fibrosis, and dilation of the RV, while the LV:RV was elevated, supportive of RV thinning. A 21-year-old female zoo-housed Matschie's tree kangaroo (Dendrolagus matschiei) had a flaccid thin-walled RV, LV cardiomyocyte hypertrophy, interstitial myocardial fibrosis and myofiber degeneration, pulmonary oedema, and serous pericardial effusion. The (LV+S)/RV and LV:RV were elevated and RV:S decreased, supporting left hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Species-specific reference values presented in this study facilitate objective and improved postmortem cardiac assessment in macropods and koalas.

AB  - Memory impairment is a critical issue in patients with temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE). Neuronal loss within the hippocampus and recurrent seizures may cause cognitive impairment in TLE. N -acetyl cysteine (NAC) is a sulfurcontaining amino acid cysteine that is currently being investigated due to its protective effects on neurodegenerative disorders. NAC was orally administrated at a dose of 100 mg/kg for 8 days (7-day pretreatment and 1day post-surgery). Neuronal viability, mTOR protein level, and spatial memory were detected in the kainite temporal epilepsy model via Nissl staining, western blot method, and Morris water maze task, respectively. Results showed that NAC delayed seizure activity and ameliorated memory deficit induced by Kainic acid. Histological analysis showed that NAC significantly increased the number of intact neurons in CA3 and hilar areas of the hippocampus following the induction of epilepsy. NAC also modulated the mTOR protein level 5 days after epilepsy compared to the KA-induced group.Conclusion: These results suggest that NAC improved memory impairment via anticonvulsant and neuroprotective activity and, in all probability, by lowering the level of mTOR.

AB  - Objectives Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) has been related to the etiology of major depressive disorder (MDD). The findings involving the effects of electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) on the VEGF levels have been conflicting. The aim was to examine the possible changes in the VEGF levels and their associations with clinical outcome in patients with MDD during ECT. Methods The study comprised 30 patients suffering from MDD. Their plasma VEGF levels were measured at baseline and 2 and 4 hr after the first, fifth, and last ECT session. The severity of depression was quantified by the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS). Results The VEGF levels increased between the 2-hr and 4-hr measurements during the first (p = .003) and the fifth (p = .017) sessions. The baseline VEGF levels between individual ECT sessions remained unchanged during the ECT series. No correlations were found between the increased VEGF levels and the clinical outcome. Conclusions Electroconvulsive therapy increased the VEGF levels repeatedly at the same time point in two different ECT sessions. These increases had no association with the response to ECT. Consequently, VEGF may act as a mediator in the mechanism of action of ECT.

AB  - Symbiotic octocorals are important reef inhabitants, from shallow to mesophotic depths. However, information regarding their nutritional ecology along the depth gradient, and in particular the changes in the autotrophic and heterotrophic acquisition of nutrients, is limited, despite the fact that nutrient acquisition is a fundamental process in explaining the distribution of reef organisms. Here, the abundance of three lipid biomarkers, specific for autotrophy and heterotrophy, was investigated in the tissue of four octocoral species and one scleractinian sampled in shallow and upper mesophotic reefs of the oligotrophic Northern Red Sea. Our findings show functional mixotrophy for all dinoflagellate-bearing species, with a significant input of heterotrophic feeding on herbivorous crustacean zooplankton at both depths. The relatively high level of the heterotrophic marker in all symbiotic species in shallow conditions does not corroborate the common idea that corals rely mostly on autotrophy in shallow waters. The increase in heterotrophic capacity with depth was however species-specific, likely related to physiological and morphological characteristics. In addition, octocorals maintained similar concentrations of autotrophic markers with increasing depth, while the scleractinian species exhibited a decrease in these markers with depth. These results are in agreement with previous measurements of photosynthetically-fixed carbon acquisition, suggesting that autotrophy remains stable in Red sea soft corals, whereas it decreases in scleractinian corals. This study highlights the importance of heterotrophy across the euphotic-upper mesophotic depth gradient and brings relevant advances on our understanding of the ecological significance of feeding for reef corals.

AB  - Background: Manganese (Mn) is an essential trace metal and a neurotoxicant. Adverse effects of Mn exposure on the neurodevelopment of children have been reported. However, there is limited information on the effects of maternal exposure during pregnancy.
   Objectives: We aimed to investigate the association between maternal and cord blood Mn levels and neurodevelopment in children aged between 6 months and 3 years using data from a Japanese nationwide birth cohort study.
   Methods: We used the data of 63,767 mother-child pairs with maternal blood Mn measurements recorded during the second and third trimester and of 3,787 mother-child pairs with cord blood Mn measurements. Neurodevelopment was assessed using the Japanese version of the Ages and Stages Questionnaires, third edition (J-ASQ-3), which was completed by parents or guardians at 6 months, 1 year, 1.5 years, 2 years, 2.5 years, and 3 years of age.
   Results: The median maternal and cord blood Mn levels were 15.2 and 44.5 ng/g, respectively. After adjusting for covariates, both maternal and cord blood Mn levels were negatively associated with J-ASQ-3 scores. Maternal blood Mn levels were negatively associated with gross motor function scores at all ages except for that at 1.5 years (adjusted beta: -0.55 to -1.23 for a two-fold increase in maternal Mn levels). The risk of developmental delay (score below the cut-off) in gross motor function increased at the same time points (adjusted odds ratio: 1.08 to 1.13). In the subgroup, cord blood Mn levels were negatively associated with gross motor function scores at 1, 2, and 2.5 years (adjusted beta: -1.84 to -3.27).
   Discussion: Maternal blood Mn levels during pregnancy and cord blood Mn levels were negatively associated with neurodevelopment in children up to 3 years of age. Excessive maternal and fetal exposure to Mn may have adverse effects on neuromotor function in children.

AB  - The orderly contraction of the vertebrate heart is determined by generation and propagation of cardiac action potentials (APs). APs are generated by the integrated activity of time-and voltage-dependent ionic channels which carry inward Na+ and Ca2+ currents, and outward K+ currents. This review compares atrial and ventricular APs and underlying ion currents between different taxa of vertebrates. We have collected literature data and attempted to find common electrophysiological features for two or more vertebrate groups, show differences between taxa and cardiac chambers, and indicate gaps in the existing data. Although electrical excitability of the heart in all vertebrates is based on the same superfamily of channels, there is a vast variability of AP waveforms between atrial and ventricular myocytes, between different species of the same vertebrate class and between endothermic and ectothermic animals. The wide variability of AP shapes is related to species-specific differences in animal size, heart rate, stage of ontogenetic development, excitation-contraction coupling, temperature and oxygen availability. Some of the differences between taxa are related to evolutionary development of genomes, which appear e.g. in the expression of different Na+ and K+ channel orthologues in cardiomyocytes of vertebrates. There is a wonderful variability of AP shapes and underlying ion currents with which electrical excitability of vertebrate heart can be generated depending on the intrinsic and extrinsic conditions of animal body. This multitude of ionic mechanisms provides excellent material for studying how the function of the vertebrate heart can adapt or acclimate to prevailing physiological and environmental conditions.

AB  - Insoluble undigested food residues are the predominant dietary form of 'fibre' from food plants, with the potential for fermentation by microbial species resident within the large intestine. Here we present results on in vitro fermentation of undigested fractions of legumes (chickpea flour, lentil flour, mung bean flour), and nuts (peanut, almond, macadamia) using a pooled faecal inoculum from pigs fed a nut- and legume-free diet. All substrates were pre-digested in vitro. Nuts were also separated into two particle sizes (PS), cell cluster (CC = 710-1000 mu m) and fine (F = 250-500 mu m), to test the effect of PS. All substrates tested were fermented for 48 hours, and measured according to gas production, with lentil (within legume flours) being the highest gas producer, and peanut being the highest gas producer within nuts. Undigested fractions from Nuts_F had significantly higher gas production than those from Nuts_CC, consistent with differences in surface area between the two PS. Relative short chain fatty acid concentrations between samples as metabolite end-products were consistent with relative gas production. Analysis of unfermented residues after different fermentation times, showed that cellular integrity was a major factor controlling fermentation rates and that entrapped protein/starch (legumes) and lipid (nuts) all contributed to the fermentation outcomes.

AB  - The retrosplenial cortex (RSP) and the posterior parietal cortex (PPC) are the primary sources of cortical sensory input to the postrhinal cortex (POR) in rodents. Together, these areas compose a major corticohippocampal circuit that is involved in processing visuospatial information. The POR has been implicated in contextual learning and memory, consistent with the type of information presumably being processed by this region. By comparison, little is known about the role of the RSP or the PPC in contextual learning. In the present study, rats were trained either before or after surgery in a standard signaled fear conditioning task in which an auditory cue was paired with foot shock. Contextual fear and tone-specific fear were assessed in subsequent test sessions. In Experiment 1, electrolytic damage to the RSP either before or immediately after training impaired the expression of contextual fear but not tone-specific fear. In contrast, electrolytic damage to the PPC had no effect on conditional fear to the context or the tone in Experiment 2. These findings indicate that the RSP, but not the PPC, contributes to the processing of contextual information by the POR corticohippocampal processing stream.

AB  - Simple Summary Insecticides are widely used in agricultural and household environments. They induce wide range of deleterious effects. Fipronil is one of the most widely used phenylpyrazoles insecticides. The neurotoxic effect of such insecticide was tested in the present study with special emphasis on cognitive deficit as well as testing the possible ameliorative impacts of L-arginine and L-carnitine. The study proposed fipronil-induced cognitive deficit as a reflection to oxidative stress and neuro-inflammation. Moreover, L-arginine and L-carnitine exerted ameliorative influence on fipronil induced oxidative stress and neuro-inflammation. Therefore, L-arginine and L-carnitine can be considered as prospective candidates for mitigation of pesticide induced neurotoxicity especially in people with high-risk exposure to pesticide. The ameliorative effect of L-arginine (LA) and L-carnitine (LC) against fipronil (FPN)-induced neurotoxicity was explored. In this case, 36 adult male rats were randomly divided into six groups: group I received distilled water, group II received 500 mg/kg LA, group III received 100 mg/kg LC, group IV received 4.85 mg/kg FPN, group V received 4.85 mg/kg FPN and 500 mg/kg LA and group VI received 4.85 mg/kg FPN and 100 mg/kg LC for 6 weeks. Cognitive performance was assessed using Barnes maze (BM). Serum corticosterone, brain total antioxidant capacity (TAC), malondialdehyde (MDA) and dopamine were measured. Histopathology and immunohistochemistry of ionized calcium-binding adaptor (Iba-1), doublecortin (DCX) and serotonin (S-2A) receptors were performed. Fipronil induced noticeable deterioration in spatial learning and memory performance. In addition, FPN significantly (p < 0.05) diminished brain antioxidant defense system and dopamine coincide with elevated serum corticosterone level. Histopathological examination revealed degenerative and necrotic changes. Furthermore, Iba-1 and DCX were significantly expressed in cortex and hippocampus whereas S-2A receptors were significantly lowered in FPN group. However, administration of LA or LC alleviated FPN-induced deteriorations. In conclusion, LA and LC could be prospective candidates for mitigation of FPN-induced neurotoxicity via their antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and neuropotentiating effects.

AB  - Purpose This study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of single versus group culture strategies for cumulus-oocyte complexes (COCs) derived from early antral follicles (EAFs), with the goal of optimizing culture conditions to increase oocyte availability for assisted reproductive technologies. Methods COCs isolated from EAFs (350-450 mu m) from sheep ovaries were cultured in TCM199 medium supplemented with 0.15 mu g/mL Zn++ as zinc sulfate, 10-4 IU/mL FSH, 10 ng/mL estradiol, 50 ng/mL testosterone, 50 ng/mL progesterone, and 5 mu M Cilostamide. After 5 days of long in vitro culture (LIVC), COCs underwent in vitro maturation. This study investigated the effects of single and group culture conditions on COCs, focusing on morphology (integrity of oocyte-granulosa cell complex), viability, oocyte diameter, chromatin configuration, and ultrastructure. Additional factors influencing developmental competence were assessed, including global transcriptional activity, gap junction communication, and meiotic competence. Intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels and mitochondrial activity were also measured. Results No significant differences were observed between groups in terms of morphology, viability, oocyte diameter, chromatin configuration, ROS levels, or mitochondrial activity. However, group culture resulted in ultrastructural changes, with a notable reduction in global transcriptional activity, an increase in active gap junctions, and a higher rate of meiosis resumption (p < 0.01). Conclusion Overall, group culture of COCs derived from sheep EAFs promoted meiosis resumption, suggesting that this approach could improve in vitro culture techniques, increase the availability of mature gametes, and support fertility preservation programs.

AB  - Prenatal maternal stressors ranging in severity from everyday occurrences/hassles to the experience of traumatic events negatively impact neurodevelopment, increasing the risk for the onset of psychopathology in the offspring. Notably, the timing of prenatal stress exposure plays a critical role in determining the nature and severity of subsequent neurodevelopmental outcomes. In this review, we evaluate the empirical evidence regarding temporal windows of heightened vulnerability to prenatal stress with respect to motor, cognitive, language, and behavioural development in both human and animal studies. We also explore potential temporal windows whereby several mechanisms may mediate prenatal stress-induced neurodevelopmental effects, namely, excessive hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis activity, altered serotonin signalling and sympatheticadrenal-medullary system, changes in placental function, immune system dysregulation, and alterations of the gut microbiota. While broadly defined developmental windows are apparent for specific psychopathological outcomes, inconsistencies arise when more complex cognitive and behavioural outcomes are considered. Novel approaches to track molecular markers reflective of the underlying aetiologies throughout gestation to identify tractable biomolecular signatures corresponding to critical vulnerability periods are urgently required.

AB  - IntroductionCognitive impairment includes the abnormality of learning, memory and judgment, resulting in severe learning and memory impairment and social activity impairment, which greatly affects the life quality of individuals. However, the specific mechanisms underlying cognitive impairment in different behavioral paradigms remain to be elucidated. MethodsThe study utilized two behavioral paradigms, novel location recognition (NLR) and novel object recognition (NOR), to investigate the brain regions involved in cognitive function. These tests comprised two phases: mice were presented with two identical objects for familiarization during the training phase, and a novel (experiment) or familiar (control) object/location was presented during testing. Immunostaining quantification of c-Fos, an immediate early gene used as a neuronal activity marker, was performed in eight different brain regions after the NLR or NOR test. ResultsThe number of c-Fos-positive cells was significantly higher in the dorsal part of the lateral septal nucleus (LSD) in the NLR and dentate gyrus (DG) in the NOR experiment group than in the control group. We further bilaterally lesioned these regions using excitotoxic ibotenic acid and replenished the damaged areas using an antisense oligonucleotide (ASO) strategy. DiscussionThese data reinforced the importance of LSD and DG in regulating spatial and object recognition memory, respectively. Thus, the study provides insight into the roles of these brain regions and suggests potential intervention targets for impaired spatial and object recognition memory.

AB  - Postpartum depression is a mentally disabling disease with multifactorial etiology that affects women worldwide. It can also influence child development and lead to behavioral and cognitive alterations. Despite the high prevalence, the disease is underdiagnosed and poorly studied. To study the postpartum depression caused by maternal separation model in rats, dams were separated from their litter for 3 h daily starting from lactating day (LD) 2 through LD12. Maternal studies were conducted from LD5 to LD21 and the offspring studies from postnatal day (PND) 2 through PND90. The stress caused by the dam-offspring separation led to poor maternal care and a transient increase in anxiety in the offspring detected during infancy. The female offspring also exhibited a permanent impairment in sociability during adult life. These changes were associated with neurochemical alterations in the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus, and low TSH concentrations in the dams, and in the hypothalamus, hippocampus and striatum of the offspring. These results indicate that the postpartum depression resulted in a depressive phenotype, changes in the brain neurochemistry and in thyroid economy that remained until the end of lactation. Changes observed in the offspring were long-lasting and resemble what is observed in children of depressant mothers.

AB  - The defense mechanisms induced in wild Chinese pine (Pinus tabuliformis) in response to herbivores are not well characterized, especially in the field. To address this knowledge gap, we established a biological model system to evaluate proteome variations in pine needles after feeding by the Chinese pine caterpillar (Dendrolimus tabulaeformis), a major natural enemy and dominant herbivore. Quantitative tandem mass tag (TMT) proteomics and bioinformatics were utilized to systematically identify differentially abundant proteins implicated in the induced defense response of Chinese pine. We validated key protein changes using parallel reaction monitoring (PRM) technology. Pathway analysis revealed that the induced defenses involved phenylpropanoid, coumarin, and flavonoid biosynthesis, among other processes. To elucidate the regulatory patterns underlying pine resistance, we determined the activities of defense enzymes and levels of physiological and biochemical compounds. In addition, the expression of upstream genes for key proteins was validated by qRT-PCR. Our results provide new molecular insights into the induced defense mechanisms in Chinese pine against this caterpillar in the field. A better understanding of these defense strategies will inform efforts to breed more-resistant pine varieties.

AB  - There has been a growing body of evidence indicating that the oxytocin (OT) system plays a significant role in the neurophysiology of chronic stress-related mood disorders in recent years. However, the precise alterations for the OT system in response to chronic stress and the underlying mechanism remains unclear. The present study demonstrated that chronic unpredictable stress (CUS) resulted in a reduction in the expression of RAGE and OTR, as well as an inhibition of AP-1 phosphorylation. RAGE knockdown in hippocampus DG induced depressive-like behaviors, down-regulated the OTR protein and mRNA levels, and reduced the AP-1 phosphorylation. The administration of OT via the nasal route reversed the depressive-like behaviors induced by RAGE knockdown, increased the levels of BDNF expression and AP-1 phosphorylation. On the other hand, RAGE over-expression in the hippocampus DG resisted the effects of CUS on depression-like behaviors, AP-1 phosphorylation, and OTR expression. These finding suggested that RAGE signaling pathway is involved in CUS induced depressive-like behaviors at least partially by regulating OTR expression.

AB  - This study explores the application of the Carrera Unified Formulation (CUF) and a novel hybrid machine learning algorithm in analyzing the vibration behavior of a functionally graded graphene origami-enabled auxetic metamaterial (FG-GEAM) sandwich plate exposed to airflow pressure supported by an auxetic concrete foundation. The integration of graphene origami patterns within the auxetic metamaterial sandwich plate enhances its mechanical properties, enabling high stiffness-to-weight ratios and exceptional flexibility. CUF provides an efficient and accurate means of modeling complex geometries and material gradation within the sandwich plate, capturing the intricate vibrational characteristics induced by the auxetic behavior. The auxetic concrete foundation, with its unique negative Poisson ratio, further augments the structure's vibration response, stabilizing it under dynamic loads. Through CUF-based simulations, the study examines the effects of functionally graded material properties, auxetic configurations, and foundation interactions on natural frequencies and mode shapes. The results of the presented Carrera unified formulation are verified using cutting-edge and trustworthy machine learning (ML) methods. Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) and deep neural networks (DNN) were the two basic models used in the research. In accordance with the tenets of the Dempster-Shafer theory, an ensemble of DNN and XGB was built to enhance the model's performance. Five cutting-edge optimizers-Giant Trevally Optimizer (GTO), Covariance Matrix Adaptation Evolution Strategy (CMAES), the Victoria Amazonica Optimization (VAO), Mountain Gazelle Optimizer (MGO), and Coyote Optimization Algorithm (COA)-were combined to maximize the effectiveness of DNN and XGB. Findings reveal that CUF effectively models the combined influences, offering valuable insights into advanced metamaterial design for resilient, lightweight structures in engineering applications.

AB  - Acidogenic fermentation of biomass to produce volatile fatty acids provides a renewable pathway to industrial chemicals ordinarily derived from petrochemicals. Crassulacean acid metabolism plants such as Euphorbia tirucalli are cultivable on marginal land and offer promising feedstocks for this purpose. This study investigated how the refining of E. tirucalli biomass to fatty acids could be augmented with a high-protein co-substrate, pig blood. Blood mono-digestions provided the highest titres of total fatty acid (up to 38 +/- 2 g/L), while at high substrate concentrations, acetic acid was maximal in co-digestions. 75 % blood with 25 % E. tirucalli produced acetic acid titres 40.8 % (p < 0.001) and 30.8 % (p = 0.001) higher than those in mono-digestions of E. tirucalli and blood, respectively. Where acetate is the desired product, inclusion of blood as a co-substrate offers significant benefit for Euphorbia biorefining.

AB  - Camellia oleifera is an oilseed crop that holds significant economic, ecological, and social value. In the realm of Camellia oleifera cultivation, utilizing hyperspectral analysis techniques to estimate chlorophyll content can enhance our understanding of its physiological parameters and response characteristics. However, hyperspectral datasets contain information from many wavelengths, resulting in high-dimensional data. Therefore, selecting effective wavelengths is crucial for processing hyperspectral data and modeling in retrieval studies. In this study, by using hyperspectral data and chlorophyll content from Camellia oleifera samples, three different dimensionality reduction methods (Taylor-CC, NCC, and PCC) are used in the first round of dimensionality reduction. Combined with these methods, various thresholds and dimensionality reduction methods (with/without further dimensionality reduction) are used in the second round of dimensionality reduction; different sets of core wavelengths with equal size are identified respectively. Using hyperspectral reflectance data at different sets of core wavelengths, multiple machine learning models (Lasso, ANN, and RF) are constructed to predict the chlorophyll content of Camellia oleifera. The purpose of this study is to compare the performance of various dimensionality reduction methods in conjunction with machine learning models for predicting the chlorophyll content of Camellia oleifera. Results show that (1) the Taylor-CC method can effectively select core wavelengths with high sensitivity to chlorophyll variation; (2) the two-stage hybrid dimensionality reduction methods demonstrate superiority in three models; (3) the Taylor-CC + NCC method combined with an ANN achieves the best predictive performance of chlorophyll content. The new two-stage dimensionality reduction method proposed in this study not only improves both the efficiency of hyperspectral data processing and the predictive accuracy of models, but can serve as a complement to the study of Camellia oleifera properties using the Taylor-CC method.

AB  - We studied garbage consumption by Asian elephants at the Uddakandara garbage dump in southern Sri Lanka. Garbage at the dump was classified under six categories and quantified using a grid overlay. Elephants visiting the dump were individually identified by morphological criteria and items and quantities consumed by them were determined by focal animal sampling. Dung of elephants that did not consume garbage and those from the dump were compared quantitatively and dung constituents assessed by washing through three layered sieves. A total of 17 individual elephants visited the garbage dump during the study period, all of who were males. The observed sexual bias could be related to behavioural differences between the sexes. Elephants mostly consumed 'fruits and vegetables' and 'prepared food', possibly due to their higher palatability and nutritional value. Ingestion of polythene was incidental and associated with consuming prepared food. Proportions of the six categories in elephant diet and garbage piles were significantly different, indicating that elephants were highly selective when feeding. Elephant arrivals increased in response to unloading of garbage, suggesting attraction to fresh garbage. Dung analysis found that garbage consumption did not change the quantity and constituents of dung, except for the presence of anthropogenic items. As consumed anthropogenic items were regularly excreted, retention and obstruction of the alimentary tract are unlikely in elephants. Elephants feeding on garbage had better body condition than non-garbage consuming elephants, indicating that garbage provided better nutrition than natural food and was not detrimental to their health.

AB  - Reduced volumes in brain regions of interest (ROIs), primarily from adult samples, are associated with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). We extended this work to children using data from the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) Study (R) (N = 11,848; M-age = 9.92). Structural equation modeling and an elastic-net (EN) machine-learning approach were used to identify potential effects of traumatic events (TEs) on PTSD symptoms (PTSDsx) directly, and indirectly via the volumes 300 subcortical and cortical ROIs. We then estimated the genetic and environmental variation in the phenotypes. TEs were directly associated with PTSDsx (r = 0.92) in children, but their indirect effects (r < 0.0004)-via the volumes of EN-identified subcortical and cortical ROIs-were negligible at this age. Additive genetic factors explained a modest proportion of the variance in TEs (23.4%) and PTSDsx (21.3%), and accounted for most of the variance of EN-identified volumes of four of the five subcortical (52.4-61.8%) three of the nine cortical ROIs (46.4-53.3%) and cerebral white matter in the left hemisphere (57.4%). Environmental factors explained most of the variance in TEs (C = 61.6%, E = 15.1%), PTSDsx (residual-C = 18.4%, residual-E = 21.8%), right lateral ventricle (C = 15.2%, E = 43.1%) and six of the nine EN-identified cortical ROIs (C = 4.0-13.6%, E = 56.7-74.8%). There is negligible evidence that the volumes of brain ROIs are associated with the indirect effects of TEs on PTSDsx at this age. Overall, environmental factors accounted for more of the variation in TEs and PTSDsx. Whereas additive genetic factors accounted for most of the variability in the volumes of a minority of cortical and in most of subcortical ROIs.

AB  - Simple Summary
   Porcine deltacoronavirus (PDCoV) is an emerging enteropathogen distributed globally, which causes substantial economic losses in the swine industry. The characterization of the receptor promiscuity may pose a risk of cross-species transmission. However, the options for pharmaceutical interventions are limited. In this study, the vectors expressing shRNAs targeting the nucleocapsid gene were generated to assess the inhibition effect of PDCoV reproduction. Our preliminary results demonstrate that a dual shRNA expression system is an effective strategy in combating PDCoV infection without cytotoxicity, which would facilitate the ongoing development of RNAi-based therapeutic drugs against viral diseases.
   Porcine deltacoronavirus (PDCoV) is a novel enteric coronavirus and is becoming one of the major causative agents of diarrhea in pig herds in recent years. To date, there are no commercial vaccines or antiviral pharmaceutical agents available to control PDCoV infection. Therefore, developing a reliable strategy against PDCoV is urgently needed. In this study, to observe the antiviral activity of RNA interference (RNAi), four short hairpin RNAs (shRNAs) specific to the nucleocapsid (N) gene of PDCoV were designed and tested in vitro. Of these, a double-shRNA-expression vector, designated as pSil-double-shRNA-N1, was the most effectively expressed, and the inhibition of PDCoV replication was then further evaluated in neonatal piglets. Our preliminary results reveal that plasmid-based double-shRNA-expression targeting the N gene of PDCoV can significantly protect LLC-PK1 cells and piglets from pathological lesions induced by PDCoV. Our study could benefit the investigation of the specific functions of viral genes related to PDCoV infection and offer a possible methodology of RNAi-based therapeutics for PDCoV infection.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Most plant species produce seeds that can be dried to c. 3-7% moisture content, i.e., orthodox, and successfully stored in liquid nitrogen. However, tea seeds are often described as 'recalcitrant', i.e., they die when to lower moisture levels safe for cryopreservation. OBJECTIVE: In this study, we investigated the tolerance to desiccation and freezing of Longjing tea (Camellia sinensis) seeds and analyzed the reason behind seed mortality during desiccation and cryopreservation. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We analyzed the desiccation capacity of tea seeds from Hangzhou, China and subjected the desiccated seeds to programmed cooling and thermal analysis using differential scanning calorimeter (DSC). Subsequently, we used the exotherms to determine the frozen and unfrozen water. We analyzed seed germination and seedling establishment at different water content after storing seeds in liquid nitrogen and correlated the survival with the bound and unbound water. RESULTS: Results showed that the seeds could tolerate drying to 7.9% moisture content without significant viability loss. Moreover, the germination percentage declined sharply after cryopreservation, and the lowest moisture content at which a normal seedling could develop was 11.3 +/- 1%, although seeds dried to lower MC did germinate but did not grow into the seedling phase. CONCLUSION: Longjing tea seeds used in this study were neither orthodox nor recalcitrant. We show that the interaction between lipids and freezable water in seeds may lead to the cryoinjury.

AB  - Micromechanical bending analyses via CPFEM of polysynthetically twinned (PST) single crystal of TiAl composing of one a 2-phase lamella and six y -phase lamellae have been performed. The results have demonstrated that a decrease in the domain size aspect ratio AD/AL D / A L or an increase in the volume fraction of a 2 phase f a 2 have an effect of increasing the induced bending moment and consequently bending resistance under both bending modes of hogging and sagging. The similar variations in AD/AL D / A L and f a 2 results in a decreasing trends of maximum tensile and compressive initial yield stresses (normal bending stresses), obtained through small strain beam theory. Results have also shown the effects of imposed constraints on the bending behavior; traction-free boundary conditions result in activation of prismatic slips instead of pyramidal slips in a 2-phase, leading to a lower observed bending moment for the variables AD/AL D / A L and f a 2 considered. A scaling law is proposed that relates bending moment to domain size aspect ratio and bending angle.

AB  - Background Streptococcus equi ssp. zooepidemicus (SEZ) is one important pathogen. There are still sporadic outbreaks in China, northern United States and the Netherlands. Adenylosuccinate synthetase PurA, a newly discovered protein in prior research, requires further assessment of its protective effectiveness. Methods In this study, we focused on the expression of recombinant PurA from SEZ ATCC 35246. We evaluated the immunoreactivity of this recombinant protein using convalescent mini-pig sera. Additionally, we conducted experiments in mice to assess its immunogenic properties. Results Our findings revealed that the recombinant PurA triggered a substantial antibody response in mice, resulting in an 80% protection rate against SEZ infection. Notably, mice immunized with PurA exhibited significantly reduced bacterial colonization in all organs compared to the PBS control group. Furthermore, the levels of IL-6, IL-8, IL-1 beta, and TNF-alpha in mouse serum were significantly elevated in the PurA-immunized group compared to the control group. Hyperimmune sera targeting PurA effectively eliminated SEZ in bactericidal tests. Remarkably, antibodies against PurA demonstrated a significant inhibitory effect on developing SEZ biofilm. Conclusion Immunization with PurA elicited robust humoral and cellular immune responses in mice. These promising results suggest the potential utility of PurA in developing SEZ vaccine immunogens, providing a valuable avenue for further research into SEZ infection prevention and control.

AB  - Camellia oleifera, a woody plant indigenous to China, is primarily utilized for the production of cooking oil. However, it is frequently afflicted by anthracnose, a highly detrimental disease that leads to significant annual losses. Colletotrichum fructicola is the predominant etiological agent responsible for anthracnose in Ca. oleifera. Additionally, our investigation has revealed that a bZIP transcription factor CfHac1 in C. fructicola governs the pathogenicity and response to endoplasmic reticulum stress. In this study, we conducted an investigation of the role of the CfPDI1 gene in C. fructicola, which was significantly downregulated in & UDelta;Cfhac1 under endoplasmic reticulum stress. The CfPDI1 gene was deleted, resulting in reduced vegetative growth, conidiation, appressoria formation, and appressorium turgor generation. Furthermore, it was observed that the & UDelta;Cfpdi1 mutant exhibited impaired responsiveness to endoplasmic reticulum stresses, and the expression of UPR-related genes in C. fructicola was influenced by CfPdi1. Cytological investigations indicated that CfPdi1 is localized in the endoplasmic reticulum. Further analysis revealed that the & UDelta;Cfpdi1 mutant displays significantly reduced pathogenicity in Ca. oleifera. Taken together, this study illustrated crucial functions of CfPdi1 in development, response to ER stress, autophagy, and pathogenicity in C. fructicola.

AB  - Perinatal asphyxia (PA) and hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy can result in severe, long-lasting neurological deficits. In vitro models, such as oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD), are used experimentally to investigate neuronal response to metabolic stress. However, multiple variables can affect the severity level of OGD/PA and may confound any measured treatment effect. Oxytocin (OXT) has emerged as a potential neuroprotective agent against the deleterious effects of PA. Previous studies have demonstrated OXT's potential to enhance neuronal survival in immature hippocampal cultures exposed to OGD, possibly by modulating gamma-aminobutyric acid-A receptor activity. Moreover, OXT's precise impact on developing hippocampal neurons under different severities of OGD/PA remains uncertain. In this study, we investigated the effects of OXT (0.1 mu M and 1 mu M) on 7-day-old primary rat hippocampal cultures subjected to 2 h OGD/sham normoxic conditions. Cell culture viability was determined using the resazurin assay. Our results indicate that the efficacy of 1 mu M OXT treatment varied according to the severity of the OGD-induced lesion, exhibiting a protective effect (p = 0.022) only when cellular viability dropped below 49.41% in non-treated OGD cultures compared to normoxic ones. Furthermore, administration of 0.1 mu M OXT did not yield significant effects, irrespective of lesion severity (p > 0.05). These findings suggest that 1 mu M OXT treatment during OGD confers neuroprotection exclusively in severe lesions in hippocampal neurons after 7 days in vitro. Further research is warranted to elucidate the mechanisms involved in OXT-mediated neuroprotection.

AB  - Severe neurological impairment was more prevalent in cardiac arrest survivors who were administered epinephrine than in those administered placebo in a randomized clinical trial; short-term reduction of brain tissue O-2 tension (PbtO(2)) after epinephrine administration in swine following a short duration of untreated cardiac arrest has also been reported. We investigated the effects of epinephrine administered during cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) on cerebral oxygenation after restoration of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) in a swine model with a clinically relevant duration of untreated cardiac arrest. After 7 min of ventricular fibrillation, 24 pigs randomly received either epinephrine or saline placebo during CPR. Parietal cortex measurements during 60-min post-resuscitation period showed that the area under the curve (AUC) for PbtO(2) was smaller in the epinephrine group than in the placebo group during the initial 10-min period and subsequent 50-min period (both p < 0.05). The AUC for number of perfused cerebral capillaries was smaller in the epinephrine group during the initial 10-min period (p = 0.005), but not during the subsequent 50-min period. In conclusion, epinephrine administered during CPR reduced PbtO(2) for longer than 10 min following ROSC in a swine model with a clinically relevant duration of untreated cardiac arrest.

AB  - Mycoplasma hyopneumoniae (Mhyo) is a major porcine pathogen worldwide. Understanding its interaction with the pig immune system is crucial for effective disease control. This study evaluates the use of minimal tissue samples from different lung compartments to analyze this interaction in detail, in addition to the microscopic and macroscopic evaluation of lung lesions. Key findings reveal strain-specific virulence variability and a differential cytokine expression in the lung compartments tested, highlighting the relevance of Th1 and Th2, and a potential role for Th17-mediated immune responses in Mhyo infection. The data analyzed shed light on the complex nature of Mhyo infection and its interplay with the pig's immune system, potentially aiding in the development of better disease management strategies. Mycoplasma hyopneumoniae (Mhyo) is the causative agent of porcine enzootic pneumonia (EP), as well as one of the main pathogens involved in the porcine respiratory disease complex. The host-pathogen interaction between Mhyo and infected pigs is complex and not completely understood; however, improving the understanding of these intricacies is essential for the development of effective control strategies of EP. In order to improve our knowledge about this interaction, laser-capture microdissection was used to collect bronchi, bronchi-associated lymphoid tissue, and lung parenchyma from animals infected with different strains of Mhyo, and mRNA expression levels of different molecules involved in Mhyo infection (ICAM1, IL-8, IL-10, IL-23, IFN-alpha, IFN-gamma, TGF-beta, and TNF-alpha) were analyzed by qPCR. In addition, the quantification of Mhyo load in the different lung compartments and the scoring of macroscopic and microscopic lung lesions were also performed. Strain-associated differences in virulence were observed, as well as the presence of significant differences in expression levels of cytokines among lung compartments. IL-8 and IL-10 presented the highest upregulation, with limited differences between strains and lung compartments. IFN-alpha was strongly downregulated in BALT, implying a relevant role for this cytokine in the immunomodulation associated with Mhyo infections. IL-23 was also upregulated in all lung compartments, suggesting the potential involvement of a Th17-mediated immune response in Mhyo infections. Our findings highlight the relevance of Th1 and Th2 immune response in cases of EP, shedding light on the gene expression levels of key cytokines in the lung of pigs at a microscopic level.

AB  - Exposure to space galactic cosmic radiation is a principal consideration for deep space missions. While the effects of space irradiation on the nervous system are not fully known, studies in animal models have shown that exposure to ionizing radiation can cause neuronal damage and lead to downstream cognitive and behavioral deficits. Cognitive health implications put humans and missions at risk, and with the upcoming Artemis missions in which female crew will play a major role, advance critical analysis of the neurological and performance responses of male and female rodents to space radiation is vital. Here, we tested the hypothesis that simulated Galactic Cosmic Radiation (GCRSim) exposure disrupts species-typical behavior in mice, including burrowing, rearing, grooming, and nest-building that depend upon hippocampal and medial prefrontal cortex circuitry. Behavior comprises a remarkably well-integrated representation of the biology of the whole animal that informs overall neural and physiological status, revealing functional impairment. We conducted a systematic dose-response analysis of mature (6-month-old) male and female mice exposed to either 5, 15, or 50 cGy 5-ion GCRSim (H, Si, He, O, Fe) at the NASA Space Radiation Laboratory (NSRL). Behavioral performance was evaluated at 72 h (acute) and 91-days (delayed) postradiation exposure. Specifically, species-typical behavior patterns comprising burrowing, rearing, and grooming as well as nest building were analyzed. A Neuroscore test battery (spontaneous activity, proprioception, vibrissae touch, limb symmetry, lateral turning, forelimb outstretching, and climbing) was performed at the acute timepoint to investigate early sensorimotor deficits postirradiation exposure. Nest construction, a measure of neurological and organizational function in rodents, was evaluated using a five-stage Likert scale 'Deacon' score that ranged from 1 (a low score where the Nestlet is untouched) to 5 (a high score where the Nestlet is completely shredded and shaped into a nest). Differential acute responses were observed in females relative to males with respect to species-typical behavior following 15 cGy exposure while delayed responses were observed in female grooming following 50 cGy exposure. Significant sex differences were observed at both timepoints in nest building. No deficits in sensorimotor behavior were observed via the Neuroscore. This study revealed subtle, sexually dimorphic GCRSim exposure effects on mouse behavior. Our analysis provides a clearer understanding of GCR dose effects on species typical, sensorimotor and organizational behaviors at acute and delayed timeframes postirradiation, thereby setting the stage for the identification of underlying cellular and molecular events.

AB  - Simple Summary One of the major impediments to improving the efficiency of sheep production systems is the difficulty of breeding the females before their young are weaned. A major physiological barrier is suckling, because it prevents the initiation of a new reproductive cycle by inhibiting the pulsatile secretion of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) and thus the secretion of LH pulses. It has now become clear that, at brain level, the secretion of GnRH is controlled primarily by the neuropeptide kisspeptin (Kp), a central player in the 'KNDy' system that generates GnRH pulses. Here, we report that intravenous administration of Kp stimulates pulsatile LH secretion in ewes during postpartum anestrus. Moreover, the response was greater when suckling was restricted to 30 min twice a day. We conclude that kisspeptin application increases pulsatile LH secretion in suckling ewes, suggesting that suckling inhibits ovulation by reducing the activity of kisspeptin neurons. This study tested whether the intravenous application of kisspeptin can stimulate the pulsatile secretion of LH in suckling ewes during postpartum anestrus. Ten days after lambing, Pelibuey ewes were allocated among two groups: (1) continuous suckling (n = 8), where the lambs remained with their mothers; and (2) restricted suckling (n = 8), where the mothers suckled their lambs twice daily for 30 min. On Day 19 postpartum, the ewes were individually penned with ad libitum access to water and feed and given an indwelling catheter in each jugular vein. On Day 20, 4 mL of blood was sampled every 15 min from 08:00 to 20:00 h to determine LH pulse frequency. At 14:00 h, four ewes in each group received 120 mu g of kisspeptin diluted in 3 mL of saline as a continuous infusion for 6 h; the remaining four ewes in each group received only saline. The interaction between kisspeptin and suckling type did not affect LH pulse frequency (p > 0.05). Before kisspeptin administration, pulse frequency was similar in all groups (1.50 +/- 0.40 pulses per 6 h; p > 0.05). With the application of kisspeptin, pulse frequency increased to 3.50 +/- 0.43 pulses per 6 h (p <= 0.014), so the concentration of LH (1.11 +/- 0.14 ng mL(-1)) was greater in kisspeptin-treated ewes than in saline-treated ewes (0.724 +/- 0.07 ng mL(-1); p <= 0.040). The frequency of LH pulses was greater with restricted suckling than with continuous suckling (2.44 +/- 0.29 versus 1.69 +/- 0.29 pulses per 6 h; p <= 0.040). We conclude that intravenous application of kisspeptin increases the pulsatile secretion of LH in suckling ewes and that suckling might reduce kisspeptin neuronal activity, perhaps explaining the suppression of ovulation. Moreover, the effects of kisspeptin and suckling on pulsatile LH secretion appear to be independent, perhaps operating through different neural pathways.

AB  - Eogystia hippophaecola (Hua, Chou, Fang & Chen, 1990) is a major borer pest of sea buckthorn (Hippophae rhamnoides L.), and during its four-year growth period, its feeding site shifts progressively from the trunks to the roots, establishing a complex mutualistic relationship with the host. The factors driving the host-shifting behavior of E. hippophaecola larvae remain unclear. In this study, we compared the nutrient composition of the roots and trunks, measured the activity of metabolizing enzymes in E. hippophaecola, and analyzed secondary metabolites in both the roots and trunks following infestation using LC-MS. Sugars, proteins, fats, and free amino acids were more abundant in the roots, and larvae feeding on this part exhibited a stronger resistance. Non-targeted metabolomics identified 8493 metabolites in total. The trunks exhibited 394 DEMs compared to the roots (223 up-regulated and 171 down-regulated). Lipids and lipid-like molecules represented more than two-thirds of the total, primarily involved in steroid biosynthesis, linoleic acid metabolism, and glycerophospholipid metabolism. The significant down-regulation of key compounds, such as lecithin and linoleate, suggests that resistance metabolism is less pronounced in the trunks compared to the roots. In summary, the host-shifting behavior of E. hippophaecola larvae is primarily driven by a combination of the host's nutritional conditions and defense mechanisms.

AB  - Approximately 70% of women with epilepsy experience additional challenges in seizure exacerbation due to hormonal changes, particularly during fluctuations of estrogen-progesterone levels in the menstrual cycle, which is known as catamenial epilepsy. In animal models of epilepsy, a sustained increase in seizure frequency has been observed in female rats during the proestrus-estrus transition when estrogen levels are high and progesterone levels are low resembling catamenial epilepsy. Cannabidiol (CBD) has been proposed to have anticonvulsant and anti-inflammatory effects, able to decrease seizure duration and increase seizure threshold in rats with epilepsy. However, most studies have used males to investigate the pharmacological effects of CBD on seizures, and the neuroprotective effects of CBD against seizures exacerbated by hormonal fluctuations in females are still little explored. Given this scenario, the aim of the present study was to investigate whether CBD would protect against acute seizures induced by pentylenetetrazole (PTZ) in female rats during a pro-convulsant hormonal phase. Therefore, CBD (50 mg/kg) or saline was administered during the proestrus-estrus transition phase, 1 h prior to induction of seizures with PTZ (60 mg/kg), and the following parameters were recorded: duration, latency to first seizure, as well as percentage of convulsing animals (incidence), mortality, and severity of seizures. Brains were processed for immunohistochemistry for microglial cells (Iba-1), and blood was collected for the analysis of cytokines (IL-16, IL-6, IL-10, and TNF-a). Cannabidiol pre-treated rats showed a significant reduction in duration and severity of seizures, and IL-16 levels, although the latency, incidence of seizures, and mortality rate remained unchanged as well the quantification of microglia in the selected areas. Therefore, acute administration of CBD in a single dose prior to seizure induction showed a partial neuroprotective effect against seizure severity and inflammation, suggesting that female rats in the proconvulsant phase of proestrus-estrus have a low seizure threshold and are more resistant to the anticonvulsant effects of CBD. It appears that other doses or administration windows of CBD may be required to achieve a full protective effect against seizures, suggesting that CBD could be used as an adjunctive therapy during fluctuations of estrogen-progesterone levels. In this sense, considering the hormonal fluctuation as a seizure-potentiating factor, our study contributes to understand the anticonvulsant activity of CBD in females in a pro-convulsant hormonal phase, similar to catamenial seizures in humans.

AB  - Numerous animal and human studies have assessed the relationship between polyphenols and outcomes related to depression. However, no comprehensive synthesis of the main findings has been conducted. The aim of this manuscript was to systematically review the available evidence from animal and human studies on the association and the effects of dietary polyphenols on depression and provide recommendations for future research. We based our review on 163 preclinical animal, 16 observational and 44 intervention articles assessing the relationship between polyphenols and outcomes related to depression. Most animal studies demonstrated that exposure to polyphenols alleviated behaviours reported to be associated with depression. However, human studies are less clear, with some studies reporting an inverse relationship between the intake of some polyphenols, and polyphenol rich foods and depression risk and symptoms, while others reporting no association or effect. Hence, while there has been extensive research conducted in animals and there is some supporting evidence in humans, further human studies are required, particularly in younger and clinical populations.

AB  - Drug addiction is a complicated central nervous system (CNS) disorder. Both basic and clinical studies have confirmed that the neural mechanisms of drug addiction are progressively altered at different stages of the development of addictive behaviors. Genomic studies using technologies such as whole-genome association studies, whole-genome sequencing, whole-exome sequencing or high-throughput transcriptome sequencing have provided insight into the genetic vulnerability of mental disorders, including drug addiction. The single nucleotide polymorphism detection techniques or sequencing technologies mainly predict genetic risk loci for diseases. However, the occurrence of many CNS disorders is closely related to environmental factors and there is brain region-specific cellular heterogeneity information on the expression of relevant genes at different stages of disease development. Therefore, traditional molecular genetic studies have limitations in explaining the pathogenesis of CNS disorder. Single-cell RNA sequencing (ScRNA-seq) technologies, which target individual cells for transcript level determination, avoid the disadvantages of traditional sequencing for detecting the average transcript level of cell populations and can quantitatively describe cellular heterogeneity. In recent years, single-cell transcriptional sequencing technology has been applied to the study of drug addiction. The cortico-mesolimbic system, corticostriatal-thalamo-cortical pathway and the hippocampus are important brain regions associated with drug addiction. It was found that more neuronal subtypes exist in both the striatum and hippocampus than previously known. In the cortex, pyramidal neurons exhibit a projection-specific gene expression profile. In rodent models experiencing from cocaine, morphine, and tetrahydrocannabinol, recent studies have identified single-cell transcriptome alterations in the nucleus accumbens and prefrontal cortex, the key brain regions for rewarding. These studies have advanced the mechanisms of drug addiction and drug development to the level of cellular resolution in specific brain regions. This review summarizes the important applications of single-cell RNA-Seq in neuroscience research and uses drug addiction as an example to illustrate its value in the study of CNS disorders.

AB  - The Chinese indigenous Shiqi (SQ) pigeon and the imported White King (WK) pigeon are two meat-type pigeon breeds of economical and nutritional importance in China. They displayed significant differences in such meat quality traits as intramuscular fat (IMF) content and fatty acid (FA) compositions in the breast muscles. In this study, we aimed to screen candidate genes that could affect fat-related meat quality traits in meat-type pigeons. We investigated the polymorphic variations at the genomic level using double-digest restriction-associated DNA (ddRAD) sequencing in 12 squabs of SQ and WK pigeons that exhibited significant inter-breed differences in IMF content as well as FA and amino acid compositions in the breast muscles, and screened candidate genes influencing fat-related traits in squabs through gene ontology analysis and pathway analysis. By focusing on 6019 SNPs, which were located in genes with correct annotations and had the potential to induce changes in the encoded proteins, we identified 19 genes (ACAA1, ACAA2, ACACB, ACADS, ACAT1, ACOX3, ACSBG1, ACSBG2, ACSL1, ACSL4, ELOVL6, FADS1, FADS2, HACD4, HADH, HADHA, HADHB, MECR, OXSM) as candidate genes that could affect fat-related traits in squabs. They were significantly enriched in the pathways of FA metabolism, degradation, and biosynthesis (p < 0.05). Results from molecular docking analysis further revealed that three non-synonymous amino acid alterations, ACAA1(S357N), ACAA2(T234I), and ACACB(H1418N), could alter the non-bonding interactions between the enzymatic proteins and their substrates. Since ACAA1, ACAA2, and ACACB encode rate-limiting enzymes in FA synthesis and degradation, alterations in the enzyme-substrate binding affinity may subsequently affect the catalytic efficiency of enzymes. We suggested that SNPs in these three genes were worthy of further investigation into their roles in explaining the disparities in fat-related traits in squabs.

AB  - The hormones estrogen and progesterone alter physiological functions, including the estrus cycle and relevant neurological and synaptic activity. Here, we determined the extent to which estrus cycle stage interacts with an inflammatory stimulus, lipopolysaccharide (LPS), to alter synaptic mitochondrial respiration in female rats. LPS elevated synaptic mitochondrial respiration of rats in estrus, but not diestrus. Likewise, estrogen concentration correlated with multiple respiratory metrics in LPS treated females in estrus. These data suggest estrogen likely modulates synaptic mitochondrial respiration in a high progesterone environment.

AB  - Viscoelastic materials exhibit hysteresis under repetitive loading and unloading cycles. Although much research exists on viscoelastic constitutive relationships, this study aims to develop a procedure for estimating linear or nonlinear multi-element viscoelastic models based on hysteresis behaviour under a specified loading condition. A multi-element model based on a generic integral order time derivative operator is employed to represent the experimental hysteresis under cyclic displacement loading. The methodology develops linear and nonlinear models for viscoelastic semi-solids, including elastomeric vibration isolation elements and biomaterials such as pig cartilage from the lumbar spinal segment. Curve fitting via Genetic Algorithm solves a constrained optimization problem to extract model parameters. Initial results validate the model using experimental hysteresis data and predict the responses for varying loading frequencies and amplitudes. Additionally, higher-order nonlinear stiffness and damping parameters are simplified. The validated model effectively predicts dynamic behaviour, offering confidence in its application to structures incorporating such materials.

AB  - Background: Female infertility is a health issue for both humans and animals and despite developments in medical interventions, there are still some conditions that cannot be treated successfully. It is important to explore other potential therapies or remedies that could improve reproductive health. Choline is an over-the-counter supplement and essential nutrient that has many health benefits. It has been suggested to be beneficial in various aspects of fertility, including fetal development and endocrine disorders like polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS). However, choline's impact on ovarian function has not been explored. Methods: To study the effects of choline on ovarian development, 36 female Yorkshire x Landrace pigs were fed the following four supplemented diets between 90 and 186 days of age: (1) Control (corn and soybean meal-based diet that met estimated nutrient requirements, n = 9); (2) Choline (additional 500 mg choline per 1 kg of control diet, n = 8); (3) Omega-3 (additional 5556 mg Omega-3 per 1 kg control diet by introducing fish oil); (4) Choline + Omega-3 (500 mg choline + 5556 mg Omega-3 per 1 kg control diet). Pigs fed the choline-supplemented diet were compared to the control group and those fed diets supplemented with Omega-3 as fertility-promoting agent. Results: It was found that the number of corpus luteum per ovary in the Choline (16.25 +/- 2.88), Omega-3 (10.78 +/- 1.71) and Choline + Omega-3 (14.89 +/- 2.97) groups were all higher in comparison to that of the control group (5.56 +/- 1.72, p < 0.05). The percentage of antral follicles in the Choline + Omega-3 group were higher compared to the control group (p < 0.05). To elucidate the potential molecular mechanism of choline on these improved ovarian phenotypes, the expression of a group of genes that are involved in ovarian development, including cytochrome P450 family 11 subfamily A member 1 (CYP11A1), follicle stimulating hormone receptor (FHSR) and luteinizing hormone receptor (LHR), was analyzed using RT-qPCR. The expression of both LHR and CYP11A1 was significantly upregulated in the choline-supplemented group (p < 0.05), while there are no differences in FSHR expression among all the groups. Additionally, the expression of miR-21, -378, -574, previously found to be important in ovarian function, were examined. Our data showed that miR-574 was upregulated in the Choline group while miR-378 was upregulated in the Choline + Omega-3 group in comparison to the control group (p < 0.05). Further, serum metabolite analysis showed that 1-(5Z, 8Z, 11Z, 14Z, 17Z-eicosapentaenoyl)-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine, a form of phosphatidylcholine metabolite, was significantly increased in all the treatment groups (p < 0.05), while testosterone was significantly increased in both Omega-3 and Choline + Omega-3 groups (p < 0.05) and tended to be reduced in the choline-supplemented group (p = 0.08) compared to the control group. Conclusions: Our study demonstrated choline's influence on ovarian function in vivo, and offered insights into the mechanisms behind its positive effect on ovarian development phenotype.

AB  - The production of oil and natural gas has recently played a significant role in boosting the economy. In this process, the discharge of industrial waste through activities like exploration and extraction operations cause elevated levels of dissolved chemicals, which severely degrade water sources and render them unsafe for human consumption. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the distribution of nineteen physicochemical parameters including heavy metals (pH, EC, TDS, TH, As, Cr, Cu, Ni, Pb, Zn, Ca2+, Mg2+, Na+, K+, Cl-, F-, SO42-, NO3- and HCO3-) in groundwater samples collected around oil and natural gas drilling sites and assess the knowledge gap for a sustainable and safe environment. Groundwater quality was assessed using various hydrogeochemical parameters and pollution indices such as the geoaccumulation index (Igeo), enrichment factor (EF), contamination factor (CF), degree of contamination (Cdeg) with principal component (PCA) and regression coefficient analysis to identify the collective contamination source. The potential ecological risk indices (PERI) and health risk assessments were made using exposure factors references from USEPA's database. The major findings indicated the Piper diagram is predominantly characterised by the Ca-Cl type whereas, Gibb's plot showed evaporation and rock-water interaction influencing groundwater chemistry. Water quality index (WQI) results indicated 2% of samples were excellent, 22% were good, 20% were poor, 8% were extremely poor, and 48% were unsuitable for drinking. The pollution index of groundwater (PIG) showed that 50% of samples from the study area were unsafe to drink. The human health risk assessment revealed significant noncarcinogenic and carcinogenic effects to both adults and children. The study area's geology indicates that the presence of elements in groundwater is primarily due to drilling activities, as no geological formations show high concentrations. The implications of this study highlighted the current status of groundwater quality by identifying the main pollutants arising due to drilling extraction methods and developing a strategy aimed at mitigating both point and non-point sources of contamination.

AB  - BackgroundLimited information exists on the active role of females during mate searching. Theory primarily focuses on male reproductive behaviours, suggesting male distribution follows that of females, while female distribution is influenced by food resources and habitat. This approach might underestimate the females' role in shaping mating strategies. Incorporating a female perspective into mating studies can enhance our understanding of evolutionary factors.MethodsUsing GPS data from brown bears Ursus arctos across Finland, Romania and Slovakia, we explored female movement behaviour during the mating period. First, we estimated movement speed, total distance and net distance at a daily scale. Then, we quantitatively described when the movement peaks occur by estimating two critical points of the functions described by each of the aforementioned movement parameters: (1) the point in time when the rate of change in brown bear movement behaviour is the highest; and (2) the point in time when each aspect of brown bear movement is most pronounced. We quantified temporal variations in male and female movements throughout the year using generalized additive mixed models, while we used linear mixed models to assess the relationship between peak movement parameters, bear sex and population.ResultsOur findings identified two overlooked behaviours: (1) male and female movement parameters showed the highest rate of change during the mating season, challenging the notion of male roaming as the primary mating strategy; and (2) females travelled the longest distances during the mating season, potentially seeking high-quality mates. This behaviour aligns with the strategy of engaging in copulations with multiple males to avoid infanticide.ConclusionsOur study reveals novel insights into the active role of female brown bears in mating strategies, challenging traditional male-centric views. These results support the need for detailed investigations into female behaviours across mammalian taxa, which offer potential to advance our understanding of mammalian social and mating systems. Local differences also underscore the importance of social and ecological conditions to explain variation in the female role in mating strategies.

AB  - African swine fever (ASF) is a severe infectious disease affecting domestic and wild suids. Spatiotemporal dynamics analysis of the ASF is crucial to understanding its transmission. The ASF broke out in Vietnam in February 2019. The research on the spatiotemporal evolution characteristics of ASF in Vietnam is lacking. Spatiotemporal statistical methods, including direction analysis, spatial autocorrelation analysis, and spatiotemporal scan statistics were used to reveal the dynamics of the spatial diffusion direction and spatiotemporal aggregation characteristics of ASF in Vietnam. According to the cessation of the epidemic, it was divided into three phases: February to August 2019 (phase 1), April to December 2020 (phase 2), and January 2021 to March 2022 (phase 3). The ASF showed a significant spread trend from north to south in phase 1. The occurrence rate of the ASF aggregated spatially in phase 1 and became random in phases 2 and 3. The high-high ASF clusters (the province was a high cluster and both it and its neighbors had a high ASF occurrence rate) were concentrated in the north in phases 1 and 2. Four spatiotemporal high-risk ASF clusters were identified with a mean radius of 121.88 km. In general, there were significant concentrated outbreak areas and directional spread in the early stage and small-scale, high-frequency, and randomly scattered outbreaks in the later stage. The findings could contribute to a deeper understanding of the spatiotemporal spread of the ASF in Vietnam.

AB  - Nanobodies (Nbs) have emerged as a promising class of biologics. Despite having marked physicochemical properties, Nbs are derived from camelids and may require humanization to improve translational potentials. By systematically analyzing the sequence and structural properties of Nbs, we found substantial framework diversities and revealed the key differences between Nbs and human immunoglobulin G antibodies. We identified conserved residues that may contribute to enhanced solubility, structural stability, and antigen binding, providing insights into Nb humanization. Based on big data analysis, we developed "Llamanade," an open source software to facilitate rational humanization of Nbs. Using sequence as input, Llamanade can rapidly extract sequence features, model structures, and optimize solutions to humanize Nbs. Finally, we used Llamanade to successfully humanize a cohort of structurally diverse and potent SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing Nbs. Llamanade is freely available and will be easily accessible on a server to support the development of therapeutic Nbs into safe and effective trials.

AB  - Sporadic Alzheimer's disease (sAD) is the most common of neurodegenerative disorders. The lack of effective therapy indicates that the mechanisms of sAD development remain poorly understood. To investigate this pathology in animals, intracerebroventricular injection of (3-amyloid peptide (A(3) using a Hamilton syringe, either during stereotactic surgery or through a pre-implanted cannula, is used. In this study, we analyzed the effect of chronic cannula implantation on the severity of A(3 effects at the behavioral, histological, and biochemical levels. The results showed that the local damage to neural tissue caused by cannulation has no bearing on the effect of A(3 on animal behavior and the microglial parameters of the unilateral hippocampus two weeks after the A(3 administration. However, cannula implantation fundamentally modifies some bi- ochemical markers of the oxidative stress that occurs in the brain tissue in response to A(3 administration. Thus, the presence of a cannula reduces the severity of the A(3 impact on the levels of peroxidized lipids and glutathione two- and 10-fold, respectively. It is important to note that the detected changes are chronic and systemic. This is known because the homogenate of the entire contralateral (in relation to the cannula implantation site) hemisphere was analyzed, and the analysis was performed two weeks after implantation. At the same time, cannulation does not affect the rate of reactive oxygen species production. The obtained data indicate that chronic implantation of a cannula into the brain of experimental animals fundamentally distorts some parameters of oxidative stress in the neural tissue, which are widely used to assess the severity of experimental Alzheimer's-type diseases.

AB  - Sertoli cells, important constituents of the somatic niche, supports the growth and development of spermatogonia. Heat stress (HS), among multiple intrinsic and external factors, can induce physiological and biochemical changes in Sertoli cells. However, the underlying molecular mechanism remains largely unclear. Here, we showed that acute heat stress (43 degrees C, 0.5 h) could reduce cell viability, promote apoptosis, and increase the lactate production of porcine immature Sertoli cells (iSCs) cultured in vitro. Then, transcriptome sequencing identified 126 immediately and 3372 prolonged responded differentially expressed genes (DEGs) after acute heat stress (43 degrees C, 0.5 h) (HS0.5), and 36 h recovery culture following heat stress (HS0.5-R36), respectively. Enrichment analyses found different signaling pathways: immediate changes including cell response to heat, regulation of cellular response to stress, heat shock protein binding, chaperon-mediated protein folding, and sterol biosynthetic process, but prolonged changes mainly involving cell cycle, regulation of apoptotic process/cell proliferation, reproductive process, P53, PI3K-Akt and Glycolysis/Gluconeogenesis. Furthermore, transcriptional patterns of 9 DEGs (Dnajb1, Traf6, Insig1, Gadd45g, Hdac6, Fkbp4, Serpine1, Pfkp and Galm), and 6 heat shock proteins (HSPs) (Hspa6, Hspb1, Hspd1, HSP90aa1, HSP90ab1 and Hsph1) were validated, as well as the protein pattern of HSP90AA1 via immunostaining and western blot. Taken together, heat stress could initiate immediate changes of heat shock-related genes, and reprogram transcriptome and signaling pathways affecting the viability, apoptosis and metabolite production of pig iSCs.

AB  - Trichomes, which develop from epidermal cells, are considered one of the important characteristics of the tea plant [Camellia sinensis (L.) O. Kuntze]. Many nutritional and metabolomic studies have indicated the important contributions of trichomes to tea products quality. However, understanding the regulation of trichome formation at the molecular level remains elusive in tea plants. Herein, we present a genome-wide comparative transcriptome analysis between the hairless Chuyeqi (CYQ) with fewer trichomes and the hairy Budiaomao (BDM) with more trichomes tea plant genotypes, toward the identification of biological processes and functional gene activities that occur during trichome development. In the present study, trichomes in both cultivars CYQ and BDM were unicellular, unbranched, straight, and soft-structured. The density of trichomes was the highest in the bud and tender leaf periods. Further, using the high-throughput sequencing method, we identified 48,856 unigenes, of which 31,574 were differentially expressed. In an analysis of 208 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) encoding transcription factors (TFs), five may involve in trichome development. In addition, on the basis of the Gene Ontology (GO) annotation and the weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) results, we screened several DEGs that may contribute to trichome growth, including 66 DEGs related to plant resistance genes (PRGs), 172 DEGs related to cell wall biosynthesis pathway, 29 DEGs related to cell cycle pathway, and 45 DEGs related to cytoskeleton biosynthesis. Collectively, this study provided high-quality RNA-seq information to improve our understanding of the molecular regulatory mechanism of trichome development and lay a foundation for additional trichome studies in tea plants.

AB  - Neurotrophins and inflammatory mediators are known to influence endometrial function, but their interplay in luminal epithelial cells remains poorly characterized. In this study, sheep endometrial luminal epithelial cells (SELECs) were treated with nerve growth factor (NGF), lipopolysaccharide (LPS), or both, and the effects on gene expression and prostaglandin secretion were evaluated. NGF stimulation alone induced a clear transcriptional activation of NGF, neurotrophic receptor tyrosine kinase 1 (NTRK1), p75 neurotrophin receptor (p75NTR), cyclooxygenase 2 (COX2), and steroidogenic acute regulatory protein (STAR). LPS treatment selectively increased Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), COX2, and insulin-like growth factor binding protein 6 (IGFBP6). Combined NGF and LPS treatment did not enhance the transcriptional response beyond that induced by NGF alone, except for STAR. However, co-treatment resulted in a modest increase in prostaglandin production, particularly prostaglandin F2 alpha (PGF2 alpha), but not prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), compared to single treatments, suggesting a possible post-transcriptional modulation rather than a transcriptional synergy. These findings indicate that NGF acts as the primary transcriptional driver in SELECs, while LPS contributes selectively and may enhance prostaglandin output. The observed increase in prostaglandin production may involve post-transcriptional mechanisms, although this remains to be confirmed.

AB  - Strontium isotope ratios (87Sr/86Sr) in dental tissues are widely used to study animal and human migration. However, questions remain regarding how different biological processes and sampling methods influence measured 87Sr/86Sr and subsequent interpretations. We present a unique experiment with the known relocation history of a zoo elephant to evaluate the influence of biological turnover, tissue type, and sampling methods. We collected 87Sr/86Sr data from the elephant's tusk and molar enamel using in-situ laser ablation microsampling, conventional drilling, and micromilling techniques. Our data comparisons show that the innermost enamel best records the primary 87Sr/86Sr turnover history, while enamel maturation affects outer enamel 87Sr/86Sr. Conventional drilling and micromilling show attenuated 87Sr/86Sr records due to enamel maturation and sample averaging. To effectively account for 87Sr/86Sr signal attenuation due to turnover, we demonstrated a microsampling-modeling workflow using our tusk and enamel data. This recommended workflow can facilitate geospatially explicit interpretations of seasonal migration.

AB  - In this study, sRNA libraries and mRNA libraries of HFs of FMD were constructed and sequenced using an Illumina HiSeq 2500, and the expression profiles of miRNAs and genes in the HFs of FMD were obtained at the anagen and catagen stages. In total, 565 differentially expressed unigenes (DEGs) were identified, 90 of which were upregulated and 475 of which were downregulated. In the BP category of GO enrichment, the DEGs were enriched in the processes related to HF development and differentiation, including the hair cycle regulation and processes, HF development, skin epidermis development, regulation of HF development, skin development, the Wnt signaling pathway, and the BMP signaling pathway. Through KEGG analysis it was found that DEGs were significantly enriched in pathways associated with HF development and growth. A total of 186 differentially expressed miRNAs (DEmiRNAs) were screened (p < 0.05) in the HFs of FMD at the anagen stage vs. the catagen stage, 33 of which were upregulated and 153 of which were downregulated. Through DEmiRNA-mRNA association analysis, we found DEmiRNAs and target genes that mainly play regulatory roles in HF development and growth. The enrichment analysis of DEmiRNA target genes revealed similarities with the enrichment results of DEGs associated with HF development. Notably, both sets of genes were enriched in key pathways such as the Notch signaling pathway, melanogenesis, the cAMP signaling pathway, and cGMP-PKG. To validate our findings, we selected 11 DEGs and 11 DEmiRNAs for experimental verification using RT-qPCR. The results of the experimental validation were consistent with the RNA-Seq results.

AB  - Recent investigations into autonomous ingestible microjet devices have demonstrated the feasibility of delivering many drug modalities directly into the gastrointestinal (GI) wall via the oral route. However, the expression and biodistribution of mRNA after such injections remain unexplored. mRNA-lipid nanoparticles (mRNA-LNPs) are promising therapeutics for treating or vaccinating against many diseases and pathogens. Today, mRNA-LNPs are given as injections, necessitating trained medical personnel and resulting in reduced patient compliance. Here, we elucidate the expression and biodistribution of mRNA-LNPs after injection into the gastric and intestinal walls of mice and minipigs. We see a controlled release of mRNA from the stomach and intestine with mRNA in both plasma and lymph nodes, leading to a broad biodistribution profile, which could lead to better immunization after vaccination. Our results substantiate the argument that ingestible microjet devices facilitate a viable route of administration for use as an alternative to injections of mRNA-LNP.

AB  - Simple Summary:& nbsp;Previous research found that FATP1 plays an important role in the regulation of fatty acid metabolism and lipid accumulation in pig and chicken, but its function has not been explored in bovine adipocyte yet. In this study, we investigated the effect of FATP1 expression on preadipocyte differentiation in Qinchuan cattle using overexpression and interference assays. Our results reveal that FATP1 overexpression promoted preadipocyte differentiation, lipid droplet formation, and the expression of LPL and PPAR?, while FATP1 interference had the opposite effects on adipocyte differentiation and fat deposition. Following FATP1 overexpression and FATP1 interference in adipocytes, RNA-seq analysis identified that SLPI, STC1, SEMA6A, TNFRSF19, SLN, PTGS2, ADCYP1, FADS2, and SCD genes were differentially expressed. Pathway analysis revealed that the PPAR signaling pathway, AMPK signal pathway, and Insulin signaling pathway were enriched with differentially expressed genes. We propose that the FATP1 gene may affect the beef quality by involving adipocyte differentiation and lipid deposition, and may shed new light on the formation mechanisms of adipose tissues.</p>

   FATP1 plays an important role in the regulation of fatty acid metabolism and lipid accumulation. In this study, we investigated the patterns of FATP1 expression in various tissues obtained from calf and adult Qinchuan cattle, and in differentiating adipocytes. Next, we investigated the effect of FATP1 expression on preadipocyte differentiation in Qinchuan cattle using overexpression and interference assays. We also identified the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and pathways associated with FATP1 overexpression/interference. Our results reveal that FATP1 was broadly expressed in heart, kidney, muscle, small intestine, large intestine, and perirenal fat tissues. While FATP1 overexpression promoted preadipocyte differentiation, fat deposition, and the expression of several genes involved in fat metabolism, FATP1 interference had the opposite effects on adipocyte differentiation. Following FATP1 overexpression and FATP1 interference in adipocytes, RNA-seq analysis was performed to identify DEGs related to fat metabolism. The DEGs identified include SLPI, STC1, SEMA6A, TNFRSF19, SLN, PTGS2, ADCYP1, FADS2, and SCD. Pathway analysis revealed that the DEGs were enriched in the PPAR signaling pathway, AMPK signal pathway, and Insulin signaling pathway. Our results provide an in-depth understanding of the function and regulation mechanism of FAPT1 in fat metabolism.</p>

AB  - Chronic alcohol use disorder, a major risk factor for the development of neuropsychiatric disorders including addiction to other substances, is associated with several neuropathology including perturbed neuronal and glial activities in the brain. It affects carbon metabolism in specific brain regions, and perturbs neuro-metabolite homeostasis in neuronal and glial cells. Alcohol induced changes in the brain neurochemical profile accompany the negative emotional state associated with dysregulated reward and sensitized stress response to withdrawal. However, the underlying alterations in neuro-astroglial activities and neurochemical dysregulations in brain regions after chronic alcohol use are poorly understood. This study evaluates the impact of chronic ethanol use on the regional neuro-astroglial metabolic activity using H-1-[C-13]-NMR spectroscopy in conjunction with infusion of [1,6-C-13(2)]glucose and sodium [2-C-13]acetate, respectively, after 48 h of abstinence. Besides establishing detailed C-13 labeling of neuro-metabolites in a brain region-specific manner, our results show chronic ethanol induced-cognitive deficits along with a reduction in total glucose oxidation rates in the hippocampus and striatum. Furthermore, using [2-C-13]acetate infusion, we showed an alcohol-induced increase in astroglial metabolic activity in the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex. Interestingly, increased astroglia activity in the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex was associated with a differential expression of monocarboxylic acid transporters that are regulating acetate uptake and metabolism in the brain.

AB  - Reducing the saturate content of vegetable oils is key to increasing their utility and adoption as a feedstock for the production of biofuels. Expression of either the FAT5 16 : 0-CoA desaturase from Caenorhabditis elegans, or an engineered cyanobacterial 16 : 0/18 : 0-glycerolipid desaturase, DES9*, in seeds of Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) substantially lowered oil saturates. However, because pathway fluxes and regulation of oil synthesis are known to differ across species, translating this transgene technology from the model plant to crop species requires additional investigation. In the work reported here, we found that high expression of FAT5 in seeds of camelina (Camelina sativa) provided only a moderate decrease in saturates, from 12.9% of total oil fatty acids in untransformed controls to 8.6%. Expression of DES9* reduced saturates to 4.6%, but compromised seed physiology and oil content. However, the coexpression of the two desaturases together cooperatively reduced saturates to only 4.0%, less than one-third of the level in the parental line, without compromising oil yield or seedling germination and establishment. Our successful lowering of oil saturates in camelina identifies strategies that can now be integrated with genetic engineering approaches that reduce polyunsaturates to provide optimized oil composition for biofuels in camelina and other oil seed crops.

AB  - Neural stem cells (NSCs) in the adult brain are a source of neural cells for brain injury repair. We investigated whether their capacity to generate new neurons and glia is determined by thyroid hormone (TH) during development because serum levels peak during postnatal reorganization of the main NSC niche, the subventricular zone (SVZ). Re-analysis of mouse transcriptome data revealed increased expression of TH transporters and deiodinases in postnatal SVZ NSCs, promoting local TH action, concomitant with a burst in neurogenesis. Inducing developmental hypothyroidism reduced NSC proliferation, disrupted expression of genes implicated in NSC determination and TH signaling, and altered the neuron/glia output in newborns. Three-month-old adult mice recovering from developmental hypothyroidism had fewer olfactory interneurons and underperformed on short-memory odor tests, dependent on SVZ neurogenesis. Our data provide readouts permitting comparison with adverse long-term events following thyroid disruptor exposure and ideas regarding the etiology of prevalent neurodegenerative diseases in industrialized countries.

AB  - Hydrologic signatures are quantitative metrics that describe a streamflow time series. Examples include annual maximum flow, baseflow index and recession shape descriptors. In this paper, we use machine learning (ML) to learn encodings that are optimal ML equivalents of hydrologic signatures, and that are derived directly from the data. We compare the learned signatures to classical signatures, interpret their meaning, and use them to build rainfall-runoff models in otherwise ungauged watersheds. Our model has an encoder-decoder structure. The encoder is a convolutional neural net mapping historical flow and climate data to a low-dimensional vector encoding, analogous to hydrological signatures. The decoder structure includes stores and fluxes similar to a classical hydrologic model. For each timestep, the decoder uses current climate data, watershed attributes and the encoding to predict coefficients that distribute precipitation between stores and store outflow coefficients. The model is trained end-to-end on the U.S. CAMELS watershed data set to minimize streamflow error. We show that learned signatures can extract new information from streamflow series, because using learned signatures as input to the process-informed model improves prediction accuracy over benchmark configurations that use classical signatures or no signatures. We interpret learned signatures by correlation with classical signatures, and by using sensitivity analysis to assess their impact on modeled store dynamics. Learned signatures are spatially correlated and relate to streamflow dynamics including seasonality, high and low extremes, baseflow and recessions. We conclude that process-informed ML models and other applications using hydrologic signatures may benefit from replacing expert-selected signatures with learned signatures.

AB  - BACKGROUND Sugarcane is the most important sugar crop in the world. Like other crops, sugarcane suffers from herbivorous insect attack. The oriental armyworm Mythimna separata is a devastating pest of various crops in northeast Asia and an outbreak of this pest can result in substantial yield loss for sugarcane. However, the plant defense response situation is widely acquisition in model crops, but there is little information about how sugarcane plants defend themselves against this herbivore at the molecular and biochemical levels. RESULTS We combined transcriptome and metabolomic analysis to investigate the changes in gene expression and metabolic processes that occurred in sugarcane plants after continuous feeding by M. separata larvae for 12 and 24 h. We identified 13 662 genes and 55 metabolites that were differentially regulated in sugarcane plants fed on by M. separata. The genes involved in phytohormones, transcription factors, and kinase-related were activated and metabolism compounds such as carbohydrate, amino acid, ferulic substances and glutathione were detected regulated in sugarcane defense response. Comparable analyses showed a close correspondence relationship among pathways of phenylalanine metabolism, phenylpropanoid biosynthesis, and flavonoid biosynthesis in transcript and metabolite profiles. Furthermore, a bioassay experiment was conducted to test the influence of up-regulated metabolites on M. separata growth and found chlorogenic acid had a lethal effect. CONCLUSION The results of our study greatly enhanced the understanding of the sugarcane-induced defense response mechanism against herbivore infestation at the transcriptional and metabolic levels. Also make contributions to provide clues for development of green pest control method.

The present experiment furthered this investigation by examining the effect of electrolytic fornix lesions on acquisition of trace and delay eyeblink conditioning in the rat. Importantly, the conditioned stimulus (CS) for trace conditioning was a standard tone-on cue, and the CS for delay conditioning was either a tone-off or tone-on CS. The results showed that fornix lesions impaired trace-, but not delay conditioning in rats trained with the tone-on CS or tone-off CS. The findings are consistent with previous studies that found trace-, but not delay eyeblink conditioning is a hippocampal dependent form of associative learning. Our results also indicate that the neural pathways for tone-off delay conditioning and tone-on trace conditioning are different, even though the structural composition of a tone-off CS and the trace conditioning interval are the same cue (i.e., the absence of sound). These findings indicate that the absence of a sensory cue (i.e., tone-off CS) and the presence of a sensory cue (i.e., tone-on CS) have equivalent associative value and effectiveness for engaging the neural pathways that support delay eyeblink conditioning.

AB  - Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) is recognized as one of the most efficacious interventions for depression. However, it is associated with impairments in learning and memory functions. Ketamine has demonstrated potential in mitigating cognitive deficits. Notably, the metabotropic glutamate system is hypothesized to play a pivotal role in cognitive process regulation. Nevertheless, the involvement of the metabotropic glutamate system in esketamine-mediated alleviation of electroconvulsive shock (ECS, an animal analogue of ECT)-induced memory impairment remains to be elucidated. In this study, a depressive rat model was established using chronic unpredictable mild stress. The depressive-like behavior and cognitive performance of the rats were evaluated using the sucrose preference test, the open field test, and the Morris water maze test, respectively. The expression levels of type-5 metabotropic glutamate receptor (mGluR5) and N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor 1 (NMDAR1) were quantified through immunofluorescence and real-time PCR techniques. Long-term potentiation (LTP) of hippocampal Schaffer collateral (SC)-CA1 synapses was observed in electrophysiological experiments. The results of this investigation revealed that a low dose of esketamine administration upregulated the expression of mGluR5 and NMDAR1 in the hippocampus of stressed rats, alleviated ECS-induced cognitive impairment, and ameliorated depressive-like behavior. Conversely, the mGluR5 antagonist MTEP effectively reversed esketamine-mediated changes in the rat hippocampus and counteracted its protective effect on learning and memory functions following ECS. In conclusion, the findings of this study support the hypothesis that esketamine upregulates mGluR5 and NMDAR1 expression, thereby enhancing NMDAR activation in the hippocampus. This mechanism may be responsible for the protective effects on spatial learning and memory function observed in depressed rats subjected to ECS.

AB  - Large herbivores prefer to consume plants with high concentration of digestible carbohydrates and protein, whereas fire spread is favored by foliage characteristics that induce rapid ignition and high radiant energy. We tested in eight Patagonian woody plants whether foliar traits that determine dry matter and nitrogen digestibility to browsing herbivores were related to four variables that determine their flammability. We found a negative relation between digestibility and flammability. Fiber content (i.e. Neutral and Acid Detergent Fiber), was positively related with heat emission, maximum temperature and flame duration, being negatively related to time to ignition. PCA indicated that digestibility was negatively related with all variables associated with flammability. Digestibility decreased throughout the growing season, whereas flammability showed no clear seasonal trend. Fiber content was correlated with time to ignition and maximum temperature during most of the growing season, except in late spring. We conclude that highly digestible plants are likely to be less flammable than fiber rich ones, and that fiber content may serve as an indicator of seasonal changes in flammability of foliage. Because leaf traits are likely to influence habitat selection and movement by herbivores as well as spread and severity of fires, further studies linking foliar shape variables and plant architecture with their chemical composition may improve current mechanistic models of herbivore and fire behavior.

AB  - Extremely low frequency electromagnetic field (ELF-EMF) exists widely in public and occupational environments. However, its potential adverse effects and the underlying mechanism on nervous system, especially behavior are still poorly understood. In this study, zebrafish embryos (including a transfected synapsin IIa (syn2a) overexpression plasmid) at 3 h post-fertilization (hpf) were exposed to a 50-Hz magnetic field (MF) with a series of intensities (100, 200, 400 and 800 mu T, respectively) for 1 h or 24 h every day for 5 days. Results showed that, although MF exposure did not affect the basic development parameters including hatching rate, mortality and malformation rate, yet MF at 200 mu T could significantly induce spontaneous movement (SM) hypoactivity in zebrafish larvae. Histological examination presented morphological abnormalities of the brain such as condensed cell nucleus and cytoplasm, increased intercellular space. Moreover, exposure to MF at 200 mu T inhibited syn2a transcription and expression, and increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) level as well. Overexpression of syn2a could effectively rescue MF-induced SM hypoactivity in zebrafish. Pretreatment with N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC) could not only recover syn2a protein expression which was weakened by MF exposure, but also abolish MF-induced SM hypoactivity. However, syn2a overexpression did not affect MF-increased ROS. Taken together, the findings suggested that exposure to a 50-Hz MF inhibited spontaneous movement of zebrafish larvae via ROS-mediated syn2a expression in a nonlinear manner.

AB  - We recently reported that growth/differentiation factor 15 (GDF15) and its receptor GDNF family receptor alpha -like (GFRAL) are expressed in the periventricular germinal epithelium thereby regulating apical progenitor proliferation. However, the mechanisms are unknown. We now found GFRAL in primary cilia and altered cilia morphology upon GDF15 ablation. Mutant progenitors also displayed increased histone deacetylase 6 (Hdac6) and ciliary adenylate cyclase 3 (Adcy3) transcript levels. Consistently, microtubule acetylation, endogenous sonic hedgehog (SHH) activation and ciliary ADCY3 were all affected in this group. Application of exogenous GDF15 or pharmacological antagonists of either HDAC6 or ADCY3 similarly normalized ciliary morphology, proliferation and SHH signalling. Notably, Gdf15 ablation affected Hdac6 expression and cilia length only in the mutant periventricular niche, in concomitance with ciliary localization of GFRAL. In contrast, in the hippocampus, where GFRAL was not expressed in the cilium, progenitors displayed altered Adcy3 expression and SHH signalling, but Hdac6 expression, cilia morphology and ciliary ADCY3 levels remained unchanged. Thus, ciliary signalling underlies the effect of GDF15 on primary cilia elongation and proliferation in apical progenitors.

AB  - Streamflow forecasting over gauged and ungauged basins play a vital role in water resources planning, especially under the changing climate. Increased availability of large sample hydrology data sets, together with recent advances in deep learning techniques, has presented new opportunities to explore temporal and spatial patterns in hydrological signatures for improving streamflow forecasting. The purpose of this study is to adapt and benchmark several state-of-the-art graph neural network (GNN) architectures, including ChebNet, Graph Convolutional Network (GCN), and GraphWaveNet, for end-to-end graph learning. We explicitly represent river basins as nodes in a graph, learn the spatiotemporal nodal dependencies, and then use the learned relations to predict streamflow simultaneously across all nodes in the graph. The efficacy of the developed GNN models is investigated using the Catchment Attributes and MEteorology for Large-sample Studies (CAMELS) data set under two settings, fixed graph topology (transductive learning), and variable graph topology (inductive learning), with the latter applicable to prediction in ungauged basins (PUB). Results indicate that GNNs are generally robust and computationally efficient, achieving similar or better performance than a baseline model trained using the long short-term memory (LSTM) network. Further analyses are conducted to interpret the graph learning process at the edge and node levels and to investigate the effect of different model configurations. We conclude that graph learning constitutes a viable machine learning-based method for aggregating spatiotemporal information from a multitude of sources for streamflow forecasting

AB  - In this study, the effect of different exhibit designs on visitor dwell time was evaluated based on an unobtrusive and covert observation method in Budapest Zoo, Prague Zoo and Sosto Zoo. The time spent showing direct interest toward the species in an exhibit was measured. Observations took place under the criteria of visibility and fixed weather conditions. Exhibits displaying members of Cervidae and Bovidae were investigated to minimise taxonomic and size differences. The results demonstrate a clear difference between the times spent at different exhibits in the zoos. There was no influence of taxonomic group on visitor dwell time. However, the study showed exhibit features that did affect visitor dwell time. Overall, four features appeared to increase dwell time, one decreased dwell time, and seven had no significant influence. This study provides a generalised estimate that can be applied in different geolocations and aimed at visitors with different demographic characteristics. The results will allow zoos to strategically plan the design of their exhibits and use these features to increase visitor interest, although further research is needed to translate this engagement into pro-conservation knowledge and action.

AB  - Well-orchestrated maternal-fetal cross talk occurs via secreted ligands, interacting receptors, and coupled intracellular pathways between the conceptus and endometrium and is essential for successful embryo implantation. However, previous studies mostly focus on either the conceptus or the endometrium in isolation. The lack of integrated analysis impedes our understanding of early maternal-fetal cross talk. Herein, focusing on ligand-receptor complexes and coupled pathways at the maternal-fetal interface in sheep, we provide the first comprehensive proteomic map of ligand-receptor pathway cascades essential for embryo implantation. We demonstrate that these cascades are associated with cell adhesion and invasion, redox homeostasis, and the immune response. Candidate interactions and their physiological roles were further validated by functional experiments. We reveal the physical interaction of albumin and claudin 4 and their roles in facilitating embryo attachment to endometrium. We also demonstrate a novel function of enhanced conceptus glycolysis in remodeling uterine receptivity by inducing endometrial histone lactylation, a newly identified histone modification. Results from in vitro and in vivo models supported the essential role of lactate in inducing endometrial H3K18 lactylation and in regulating redox homeostasis and apoptotic balance to ensure successful implantation. By reconstructing a map of potential ligand-receptor pathway cascades at the maternal-fetal interface, our study presents new concepts for understanding molecular and cellular mechanisms that fine-tune conceptus- endometrium cross talk during implantation. This provides more direct and accurate insights for developing potential clinical intervention strategies to improve pregnancy outcomes following both natural and assisted conception.

AB  - A new method to quantitatively analyze heterogeneous distributions of local proton densities around paramagnetic centers in unstructured and weakly structured biomacromolecules and soft matter is introduced, and its feasibility is demonstrated on aqueous solutions of stochastically spin-labeled polysaccharides. This method is based on the pulse EPR experiment ih-RIDME (intermolecular hyperfine relaxation-induced dipolar modulation enhancement). Global analysis of a series of RIDME traces allows for a mathematically stable transformation of the time-domain data to the distribution of local proton concentrations. Two pulse sequences are proposed and tested, which combine the ih-RIDME block and the double-electron-electron resonance (DEER) experiment. Such experiments can be potentially used to correlate the local proton concentration with the macromolecular chain conformation.

AB  - The objective of this study was to evaluate the interaction of guanidinoacetic acid (GAA) with standardised ileal digestible methionine + cysteine (SID Met + Cys) levels in finishing pig diets on the performance, carcase characteristics, pork quality, blood variables, gene expression of creatine transporter (SLC6A8) and oxidant and antioxidant action. The experimental design (n = 32) was in randomised blocks arranged in a 2 x 2 factorial scheme, consisting of two levels of guanidinoacetic acid (0.00% and 0.05%) and two levels of SID Met + Cys (0.44% and 0.50%). There was no interaction of SID Met + Cys and GAA levels on the performance variables, carcass characteristics, pork quality and creatine transporter gene expression (p >= .05), except for plasma lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) (p = .016), wherein at the highest SID Met + Cys level the GAA supplementation (0.05%) showed lower plasma LDH concentration in relation to non-supplementation. Longissimus dorsi muscle depth (MD) (p = .001) showed an isolated effect for the evaluated GAA levels, in which the supplementation increased the MD. Blood urea presented an isolated effect (p = .040) for SID Met + Cys levels, showing lower plasma concentration for the highest dietary level. It was concluded that GAA does not require a higher intake of SID Met + Cys in finishing pig diets and its supplementation improved the depth of Longissimus dorsi muscle, without changing the performance, meat quality and gene expression of the SLC6A8 transporter in the liver.

AB  - A high-throughput platform for assessing the activity of synthetic or natural compounds on the motility and development of Haemonchus contortus larvae has been established for identifying new anthelmintic compounds active against strongylid nematodes. This study evaluated the impact of serum supplementation on larval development, motility and survival in vitro and its implications for phenotypic compound screening. Of five blood components assessed, 7.5% sheep serum significantly enhanced larval development, motility and survival compared to the original medium (LB*), leading to the formulation of an improved medium (LBS*). Proteomic analysis revealed marked differences in protein expression in larvae cultured in LBS* versus LB*, including molecules associated with structural integrity and metabolic processes. The phenotypic screening of 240 compounds ("Global Priority Box" from Medicines Malaria Venture) using LBS* yielded results distinct from those in LB*, highlighting the effect of culture conditions on screening assessments. These findings indicate/emphasise the critical need to evaluate and optimise culture media for physiologically relevant conditions in screening platforms, improving the reliability of anthelmintic discovery.

AB  - Background:Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) expression, which can be measured in blood serum, has been found to increase with aerobic exercise. The link between BDNF level, physical exercise, and genetic status (Val66Met polymorphism) has not been well researched in older adults.Objective:To investigate the possible link between BDNF expression, acute aerobic exercise, and the Val66Met polymorphism in older adults.Method:Twenty-three healthy older adults participated in one session of acute aerobic exercise. Their serum BDNF levels were measured both at baseline and post exercise. Saliva samples were collected to identify each individual's genetic status.Results:At baseline, the individuals' mean serum BDNF level was 16.03 ng/mL (Val66Val = 15.89 ng/mL; Val66Met = 16.34 ng/mL); post exercise, the individuals' mean serum BDNF level was 16.81 ng/mL (Val66Val = 16.14 ng/mL; Val66Met = 18.34 ng/mL).Conclusion:One session of acute aerobic exercise significantly increased the individuals' mean serum BDNF level. Males had higher BDNF levels than females. There was a significant interaction between gender and BDNF expression post exercise and a significant between-group effect of gender. The Val66Met carriers had a more positive response to the acute aerobic exercise compared with the Val66Val carriers, although without a significant difference between the two groups.

AB  - Pheromones play a pivotal role in coordinating collective activities. Recent research has demonstrated that workers of the Japanese subterranean termite, Reticulitermes speratus, secrete an aggregation pheromone that induces quick assemble and prolonged stay at the pheromone source for nestmate workers, facilitating efficient dead-wood digestion and colony expansion. The question remains: do other termite species also utilize aggregation pheromones? In this study, we report that workers of the Formosan subterranean termite, Coptotermes formosanus, use a mixture of fatty acids as part of the pheromone components to maintain worker aggregation for extended periods of time. Through bioassays and gas-chromatography mass-spectrometry (GC-MS) analysis, we determined that a mixture of four fatty acids including palmitoleic acid, palmitic acid, (Z)-10-heptadecenoic acid, and stearic acid possesses arrestant activity but little or no attractant activity. Also, the inclusion of cholesterol and cuticular hydrocarbons reinforces only its arrestant activity. Further, GC-MS analysis of extracts of wood and soil, which serve as termite food, indicated that the pheromone components other than palmitic acid are not derived from their food, and GC analysis of extracts from different parts of the worker's body revealed that these components were most likely produced in the midgut and excreted to the outside of the body via the hindgut. These findings suggest that the aggregation pheromone components and their functions in C. formosanus are largely different from those in R. speratus. This research provides insights into the differences among termite species in the development of chemical signals triggering aggregation behavior.

AB  - To survive, animals have to quickly modify their behaviour when the reward changes. The internal representations responsible for this are updated through synaptic weight changes, mediated by certain neuromodulators conveying feedback from the environment. In previous experiments, we discovered a form of hippocampal Spike-Timing-Dependent-Plasticity (STDP) that is sequentially modulated by acetylcholine and dopamine. Acetylcholine facilitates synaptic depression, while dopamine retroactively converts the depression into potentiation. When these experimental findings were implemented as a learning rule in a computational model, our simulations showed that cholinergic-facilitated depression is important for reversal learning. In the present study, we tested the model's prediction by optogenetically inactivating cholinergic neurons in mice during a hippocampus-dependent spatial learning task with changing rewards. We found that reversal learning, but not initial place learning, was impaired, verifying our computational prediction that acetylcholine-modulated plasticity promotes the unlearning of old reward locations. Further, differences in neuromodulator concentrations in the model captured mouse-by-mouse performance variability in the optogenetic experiments. Our line of work sheds light on how neuromodulators enable the learning of new contingencies.
   Author summary Reversal learning likely involves changes in synaptic connections, a neural mechanism known as synaptic plasticity, so old information can be updated. We previously discovered that acetylcholine, an important neuromodulator in the brain, changes synaptic connections in a way that favours reversal learning. Specifically, acetylcholine weakens active synapses in brain slices, but these synapses can later be strengthened by a reward signal. Based on this result in slices, we used a computational model to propose a behavioural function for the action of acetylcholine on synaptic connections. In the model, acetylcholine would weaken synaptic connections associated with an old reward, allowing an agent to quickly learn a new reward location. We tested this hypothesis here by silencing acetylcholine neurons in mice while they navigated a maze for food rewards. These animals were able to learn the location of the first food reward, but were impaired when the reward was shifted to a new location. The behavioural results of this study suggest that acetylcholine indeed facilitates reversal learning, which the computational model attributes to a weakening of synaptic connections that do not lead to reward. Taken together, our experimental and computational work show how synaptic strength changes, gated by neuromodulators, affect learning behaviour.

AB  - Synopsis Tails are widespread in the animal world and play important roles in locomotor tasks, such as propulsion, maneuvering, stability, and manipulation of objects. Kangaroo rats, bipedal hopping rodents, use their tail for balancing during hopping, but the role of their tail during the vertical evasive escape jumps they perform when attacked by predators is yet to be determined. Because we observed kangaroo rats swinging their tails around their bodies while airborne following escape jumps, we hypothesized that kangaroo rats use their tails to not only stabilize their bodies while airborne, but also to perform aerial re-orientations. We collected video data from free-ranging desert kangaroo rats (Dipodomys deserti) performing escape jumps in response to a simulated predator attack and analyzed the rotation of their bodies and tails in the yaw plane (about the vertical-axis). Kangaroo rat escape responses were highly variable. The magnitude of body re-orientation in yaw was independent of jump height, jump distance, and aerial time. Kangaroo rats exhibited a stepwise re-orientation while airborne, in which slower turning periods corresponded with the tail center of mass being aligned close to the vertical rotation axis of the body. To examine the effect of tail motion on body re-orientation during a jump, we compared average rate of change in angular momentum. Rate of change in tail angular momentum was nearly proportional to that of the body, indicating that the tail reorients the body in the yaw plane during aerial escape leaps by kangaroo rats. Although kangaroo rats make dynamic 3D movements during their escape leaps, our data suggest that kangaroo rats use their tails to control orientation in the yaw plane. Additionally, we show that kangaroo rats rarely use their tail length at full potential in yaw, suggesting the importance of tail movement through multiple planes simultaneously.

AB  - In this paper, we introduce a novel method for classifying and computing the frequencies of movement modes of intraspecific and interspecific dyads, focusing in particular on distance-mediated approach, retreat, following and side-by-side movement modes. Besides distance, other factors such as time of day, season, sex or age can be included in the analysis to assess whether they cause frequencies of movement modes to deviate from random. By subdividing the data according to selected factors, our method allows us to identify those responsible for (or correlated with) significant differences in the behaviour of dyadic pairs. We demonstrate and validate our method using both simulated and empirical data. Our simulated data were obtained from a relative-motion, biased random-walk (RM-BRW) model with attraction and repulsion components. Our empirical data were GPS relocation data collected from African elephants in Etosha National Park, Namibia. The simulated data were primarily used to validate our method while the empirical data were used to illustrate the types of behavioural assessment that our methodology reveals. Our method facilitates automated, observer-bias-free analysis of the locomotive interactions of dyads using GPS relocation data, which are becoming increasingly ubiquitous as telemetry and related technologies improve. It should open up a whole new vista of behavioural-interaction type analyses to movement and behavioural ecologists.

AB  - The objective of the present report is the dissemination of information acquired during the application of ISO 6579-1:2017 for the isolation of Salmonella spp. from swine samples. ISO 6579-1:2017 is the protocol officially recommended by the EU for the isolation of Salmonella spp., aiming for the harmonization of effective control of Salmonella infection in food-producing animals. Successful control of animal salmonellosis is highly dependent on the sensitivity and reliability of the biochemical methods used to detect the presence of the pathogen in various stages of food production. Application of ISO 6579-1:2017 resulted in the isolation of twelve Salmonella spp. and eighteen other members of the family of Enterobacteriaceae biochemically and other bacteria antigenically resembling salmonellae. An evaluation of the culture media was conducted, including xylose-lysine-desoxycholate agar (XLD), Salmonella-Shigella Agar (SS), Brilliant Green Agar (BGA), Salmonella Chromogenic Agar (SCA), Triple Sugar Iron (TSI), and modified semi-solid Rappaport-Vassiliadis (MSRV) agar. The evaluation showed that these culture-selective media differed significantly in their performance for the isolation of Salmonella from swine samples. It was concluded that the presence of atypical Salmonella strains negatively affects the prevalence of Salmonella, thus affecting the identification of carrier pigs and eventually affecting the efficiency of control programs. Thus, doubtful results require additional biochemical testing to confirm the accuracy of such universally recommended isolation methods.

AB  - Uterine inflammation is a very common and serious pathology in domestic animals, the development and progression of which often result from disturbed myometrial contractility. We investigated the effect of inflammation on the protein expression of galanin (GAL) receptor subtypes (GALR)1 and GALR2 in myometrium and their role in the contractile amplitude and frequency of an inflamed gilt uterus. The gilts of the E. coli and SAL groups received E. coli suspension or saline in their uteri, respectively, and only laparotomy was performed (CON group). Eight days later, the E. coli group developed severe acute endometritis and lowered GALR1 protein expression in the myometrium. Compared to the pretreatment period, GAL (10(-7) M) reduced the amplitude and frequency in myometrium and endometrium/myometrium of the CON and SAL groups, the amplitude in both stripes and frequency in endometrium/myometrium of the E. coli group. In this group, myometrial frequency after using GAL increased, and it was higher than in other groups. GALR2 antagonist diminished the decrease in amplitude in myometrium and the frequency in endometrium/myometrium (SAL, E. coli groups) induced by GAL (10(-7) M). GALR1/GALR2 antagonist and GAL (10(-7) M) reversed the decrease in amplitude and diminished the decrease in frequency in both examined stripes (CON, SAL groups), and diminished the drop in amplitude and abolished the rise in the frequency in the myometrium (E. coli group). In summary, the inflammation reduced GALR1 protein expression in pig myometrium, and GALR1 and GALR2 participated in the contractile regulation of an inflamed uterus.

AB  - This study was conducted to examine whether glucose in maturation medium containing reduced NaCl could improve oocyte maturation and embryonic development in pigs. The base medium was bovine serum albumin-free porcine zygote medium (PZM)-3 containing 10% (v/v) pig follicular fluid (FPZM) or 0.1% (w/v) polyvinyl alcohol (PPZM). Using each medium, the effects of NaCl concentrations (108 and 61.6 mM) and 5.56 mM glucose supplementation (designated as PZM108N, PZM108G, PZM61N, and PZM61G, respectively) were examined using a 2 x 2 factorial arrangement. When oocytes were matured in FPZM, glucose supplementation improved nuclear maturation compared with no supplementation, regardless of the NaCl concentrations. FPZM61G showed a higher blastocyst formation compared with FPZM108N and FPZM108G after parthenogenesis (PA). Blastocyst formations of somatic cell nuclear transfer (SCNT) embryos derived from FPZM61N and FPZM61G were higher compared with those of oocytes from FPZM108N. When oocytes were matured in PPZM, glucose added to PPZM108 and PPZM61 increased nuclear maturation compared with no supplementation. However, glucose added to PPZM108 did not alter embryonic development after PA. Additionally, oocytes matured in PPZM61G showed a higher blastocyst formation compared with those from PPZM61N. In SCNT, blastocyst formation was not influenced by glucose supplementation of PPZM108, but was increased by maturation in glucose-supplemented PPZM61. In embryonic development of in vitro fertilization (IVF), oocytes matured in medium with reduced NaCl and glucose showed significantly higher blastocyst formation compared with those matured in PPZM108G. Our results demonstrated that glucose in maturation medium containing 61.6 mM NaCl increased oocyte maturation and embryonic development after PA, SCNT, and IVF.

AB  - Slow-release gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonist implants are frequently used for contraception in male dogs. Although the effects are fully reversible, there is still concern about the safety of the implant's mode of action. Addressing this, we investigated cellular stress and androgen receptor (AR) signaling during downregulation and recovery. Testicular tissues were sampled from dogs castrated at different time points after GnRH implant removal and compared with untreated controls. AR, hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF1A), heat shock proteins heat shock protein 72 (HSP72), heat (inducible isoform) (HSP90AA1), and heat shock protein 90 beta (constitutive isoform) (HSP90AB1) were investigated by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction and AR, HSP72, HSP73, and HSP90 immunohistochemically. While AR, HIF1A, and HSP70 were upregulated at gene expression level, HSPA8, HSPA2, and HSP90AA1 expression were downregulated during spermatogenic arrest; HSP90AB1 expression did not change. Immunohistochemistry verified AR-expression in Sertoli, peritubular, and Leydig cells, occasionally also in spermatogonia. Stress-inducible HSP72 was occasionally detected, while constitutive HSP73 and HSP90 were abundantly expressed by germ cells. Our results were similar to studies on seasonal breeders such as pine voles, geese, fish, and soft-shelled turtles. Accordingly, GnRH implants did not impose additional cellular stress on testicular cells when compared with natural recrudescence. Since comparative data on HIF1 alpha are scarce, we cannot draw conclusions about hypoxic conditions.

AB  - Background Plants respond to attackers by triggering phytohormones signaling associated metabolites, including herbivore-induced plant volatiles (HIPVs). HIPVs can indirectly act against herbivory by recruitment of natural enemies and priming of neighboring plants. Ostrinia furnacalis and Mythimna separata are important insect herbivores of maize plants that have a devastating influence on yield. However, little is known about how maize temporally reconfigures its defense systems against these herbivores and variation of neighboring plant resistance. Results This study investigated the effects of HIPVs on the behavior of the dominant predatory beetle Harmonia axyridis and priming in neighboring maize defense against O. furnacalis and M. separata over time. The results showed that maize damaged by either O. furnacalis or M. separata enhanced the release of volatiles including terpenes, aldehydes, alkanes and an ester, which elicited an increased attractive response to H. axyridis after 3 and 12 h, respectively. O. furnacalis damage resulted in accumulations of leaf jasmonic acid (JA) and salicylic acid in maize after 6 and 3 h, respectively, while M. separata damage only raised the JA level after 3 h. Furthermore, HIPVs were able to prime neighboring plants through the accumulation of JA after 24 h. Both larvae showed a significant decrease in weight accumulation after 48 h of feeding on the third leaves of the primed plant. Conclusion Taken together, the findings provide a dynamic overview of how attacked maize reconfigures its volatiles and phytohormones to defend against herbivores, as well as priming of neighboring plants against oncoming attacks.

AB  - The aim of this work was to study the effect of prolonged lurasidone administration on the cytochrome 2D (CYP2D) expression and activity in the rat liver and selected brain structures involved in the therapeutic or side effects of this neuroleptic. Male Wistar rats received lurasidone (1 mg/kg ip.) for two weeks. The activity of CYP2D was measured in brain and liver microsomes as the rate of bufuralol 1'-hydroxylation. The CYP2D protein level was determined in microsomes by Western blot analysis. The CYP2D gene expression was estimated in liver tissue by a qRT-PCR method. Lurasidone decreased the activity and protein level of CYP2D in the frontal cortex but increased them in the striatum, nucleus accumbens, brain stem, substantia nigra, and the remainder of the brain. The neuroleptic did not affect CYP2D in the hippocampus, hypothalamus, and cerebellum. In the liver, lurasidone did not affect the CYP2D activity and protein level, though it enhanced the mRNA of CYP2D1 without affecting that of CYP2D2, CYP2D3, CYP2D4, and CYP2D5. In conclusion, lurasidone regulates brain (but not liver) CYP2D activity/protein level in a region-dependent manner, which is similar to that of other atypical neuroleptics (iloperidone and asenapine) as concerns the frontal cortex (down-regulation) and nigrostriatal pathway (up-regulation) and may be of pharmacological significance. However, further molecular studies with selective receptor agonists are necessary to find out which individual monoaminergic receptors/signaling pathways are involved in the regulation of the rat CYP2D4 and human CYP2D6 enzyme in particular brain structures.

AB  - ObjectiveSmall mammals such as the Julia Creek dunnart (Sminthopsis douglasi) may be difficult to detect using traditional trapping methods. Here, we conducted a pilot study to determine whether eDNA collected from soil and/or air could detect the presence of terrestrial vertebrates, including S. douglasi, in a semi-arid, open grassland environment.ResultsAirborne eDNA analysis returned vertebrate DNA from five sample sites (n = 7), whereas soil eDNA analysis returned vertebrate DNA from a single site (n = 7). The Julia Creek dunnart was not detected in any of the experimental samples. However, several airborne eDNA samples did return strong matches to three terrestrial vertebrates, the long-haired rat (Rattus villosissimus), red kangaroo (Osphranter rufus) and brown quail (Synoicus ypsilophorus), all native species known to occur commonly in the study area. Overall, our preliminary findings suggest that the effectiveness of airborne and soil-derived eDNA in detecting terrestrial vertebrates was constrained by high human signal and low sampling intensity. For future studies, we recommend a number of field and lab-based refinements to increase the likelihood of detecting more taxa, particularly those that occur at low density.Clinical trial numberNot applicable

AB  - BackgroundPalm kernel cake (PKC), a non-conventional feed resource, contains a large amount of crude fibre (CF), mainly manna-polysaccharides, which are key limiting factors in regard to monogastric animal production. In this study, we have developed a synergistic bacteria-enzyme co-fermentation system to enhance the nutritional profile of PKC and evaluated its digestion dynamics using a physiologically relevant porcine in vitro gastrointestinal model.ResultsSequential fermentation with Lactobacillus plantarum LY19 and Bacillus natto ND1 (48 h, 37 degrees C) degraded 3.0% crude fiber, yielding 9.30 g kg-1 reducing sugars. Enzymatic treatment (beta-mannanase 45 U g-1 + cellulase 160 U g-1 + acid protease 125 U g-1) synergistically enhanced nutrient release: soluble protein increased 214% (0.72% to 2.26%), reducing sugars surged 13.8-fold (4.45 to 61.21 g kg-1), with 55.3% fibre reduction (15.40% to 6.88%). In vitro digestion demonstrated an improvement in regard to dry matter (7.1% increase) and protein digestibility (17.0% increase), whereas colonic fermentation showed decreased concentrations of short-chain fatty acids and gases production during 48 h. 16S ribosomal RNA analysis revealed increased beneficial Lachnospiraceae NK4A136 alongside decreased pathogens (i.e. Escherichia-Shigella) and fibre-degrading taxa (i.e. Christensenellaceae R-7, UCG-005).ConclusionThe integrated bacterial-enzymatic co-fermentation process significantly enhanced the nutritional profile of PKC through fibre reduction, protein solubilisation, and sugar release.

AB  - L-tryptophan is amino acid which can significantly affects metabolic activities in humans and herbivore animals. L-tryptophan also known as precursor for melatonin, and serotonin and its level should be controlled in the human body. Thus, it is required to develop the cost-effective, simple processed, sensitive and selective L-tryptophan. In this paper, we reported benign approach for the synthesis of ZnO hexagonal plates. Various advanced physiochemical techniques such as powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX), and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopic (XPS) were adopted to characterize the synthesized of ZnO hexagonal plates. Glassy carbon electrode (GCE) was modified with ZnO hexagonal plates using drop cast method. This modified GCE (ZnO/GCE) was applied as tryptophan sensor. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) and linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) techniques were adopted for the detection of tryptophan (TRP). The limit of detection (LOD) of 1.49 mu M and 0.94 mu M were obtained using CV and LSV, respectively. The fabricated electrode (ZnO/GCE) also exhibited excellent stability, reproducibility, repeatability, and selectivity towards the determination of L-tryptophan.

AB  - Purpureocillium lilacinum (Hypocreales: Ophiocordycipitaceae) is a cosmopolitan fungus not only pathogenic to insect and nematode hosts but also to other fungi. Although having one organism with multiple effects would be desirable in a biocontrol strategy, few studies have looked at the multiple roles one strain could play. This work shows how three strains of P. lilacinum, previously proven to be entomopathogenic to leaf-cutter ants (LCA), could degrade several strains of Leucoagaricus sp., the fungus cultivated by LCA as their food source. We isolated four strains of Leucoagaricus sp. from Acromyrmex and Atta LCA species, and we determined their species molecularly, as well as their clade identity (Leucoagaricus gongylophorus, clade-A). We observed the effects on growth rates on Petri dishes and the interaction of microscopic structures of both fungi on slides. All three P. lilacinum strains inhibited the growth of L. gongylophorus. They also degraded all L. gongylophorus isolated from the Acromyrmex species, causing hyphae expansion and degradation of the cell wall. However, only one of them succeeded in degrading the L. gongylophorus strain isolated from the Atta species. The results confirm the damage to the hyphae of ant cultivars and highlight the need for future studies that reveal whether such behavior is due to P. lilacinum's mycoparasitic behavior. Using a single P. lilacinum strain with a dual function that includes the degradation of the cultivar of LCA of both genera would be a very promising strategy for the biocontrol of one of the worst herbivore pests in the Neotropics.

AB  - Single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) intermediates which emerge during DNA metabolic processes are shielded by replication protein A (RPA). RPA binds to ssDNA and acts as a gatekeeper to direct the ssDNA towards downstream DNA metabolic pathways with exceptional specificity. Understanding the mechanistic basis for such RPA-dependent functional specificity requires knowledge of the structural conformation of ssDNA when RPA-bound. Previous studies suggested a stretching of ssDNA by RPA. However, structural investigations uncovered a partial wrapping of ssDNA around RPA. Therefore, to reconcile the models, in this study, we measured the end-to-end distances of free ssDNA and RPA-ssDNA complexes using single-molecule FRET and double electron-electron resonance (DEER) spectroscopy and found only a small systematic increase in the end-to-end distance of ssDNA upon RPA binding. This change does not align with a linear stretching model but rather supports partial wrapping of ssDNA around the contour of DNA binding domains of RPA. Furthermore, we reveal how phosphorylation at the key Ser-384 site in the RPA70 subunit provides access to the wrapped ssDNA by remodeling the DNA-binding domains. These findings establish a precise structural model for RPA-bound ssDNA, providing valuable insights into how RPA facilitates the remodeling of ssDNA for subsequent downstream processes.

AB  - Osmoregulation plays a vital role in sperm function, encompassing spermatogenesis, maturation, and fertilization. Aquaglyceroporins, a subclass of aquaporins (AQPs), facilitate the transport of water and glycerol across the sperm membrane, with glycerol serving as an important substrate for sperm bioenergetics. This study aimed to elucidate the significance of AQP-mediated glycerol permeability in sperm motility. The presence and localization of AQP3 and AQP7 in human sperm were assessed using immunofluorescence. Subsequently, the glycerol permeability of spermatozoa obtained from normozoospermic individuals (n = 30) was measured, using stopped-flow light scattering, after incubation with specific aquaporin inhibitors targeting AQP3 (DFP00173), AQP7 (Z433927330), or general aquaglyceroporin (phloretin). Sperm from asthenozoospermic men (n = 30) were utilized to evaluate the AQP7-mediated glycerol permeability, and to compare it with that of normozoospermic men. Furthermore, hypermotile capacitated sperm cells were examined, to determine the AQP7 expression and membrane glycerol permeability. AQP3 was predominantly observed in the tail region, while AQP7 was present in the head, midpiece, and tail of human sperm. Our findings indicate that AQP7 plays a key role in glycerol permeability, as the inhibition of AQP7 resulted in a 55% decrease in glycerol diffusion across the sperm membrane. Importantly, this glycerol permeability impairment was evident in spermatozoa from asthenozoospermic individuals, suggesting the dysregulation of AQP7-mediated glycerol transport, despite similar AQP7 levels. Conversely, the AQP7 expression increased in capacitated sperm, compared to non-capacitated sperm. Hence, AQP7-mediated permeability may serve as a valuable indicator of sperm motility, and be crucial in sperm function.

AB  - In this work, we quantify the impact of grain boundary (GB) and surface diffusion on fission gas bubble evolution and fission gas release in UO 2 nuclear fuel using simulations with a hybrid phase field/cluster dynamics model. We begin with a comprehensive literature review of uranium vacancy and xenon atom diffusivity in UO 2 through the bulk, along GBs, and along surfaces. In our model we represent fast GB and surface diffusion using a heterogeneous diffusivity that is a function of the order parameters that represent bubbles and grains. We find that the GB diffusivity directly impacts the rate of gas release via GB transport, and that the GB diffusivity is likely below 10 4 times the lower value from Olander and van Uffelen (2001). We also find that the surface diffusivity impacts bubble coalescence and mobility, and that the bubble surface diffusivity is likely below 10 -4 times the value from Thou and Olander (1984).

AB  - Estimating fuel load and potential flight ranges of migrant passerines are basic issues in understanding bird migration strategies. Thirteen sub-Saharan and three pre-Saharan migrant passerine species were analysed in this study. The birds were captured at the T delta m delta rd Bird Ringing Station in the western part of the Carpathian Basin. A general linear model with body mass as the dependent variable and fat score, muscle score and wing length as independent variables were used to estimate lean body mass (body mass without fuel deposits) and fuel load. In ten of the species studied, models considering interactions between factors fit the data better than the main-effect models. Body mass was positively correlated with the fat score in all species, with muscle score in ten species and wing length in 14 species. During autumn, fuel load tended to be larger in the sub-Saharan migrants, especially in four species which pass over the Mediterranean Sea, Common Nightingale (Luscinia megarhynchos), Icterine Warbler (Hippolais icterina), Garden Warbler (Sylvia borin) and Barred Warbler (Curruca nisoria). Nine sub-Saharan migrants, Marsh Warbler (Acro-cephalus palustris), Sedge Warbler (A. schoenobaenus), Eurasian Reed Warbler (A. scirpaceus), European Pied Flycatcher (Ficedula hypoleuca), Spotted Flycatcher (Muscicapa striata), Wood Warbler (Phylloscopus sibilatrix), Willow Warbler (Ph. trochilus), Common Whitethroat (C. communis) and Lesser Whitethroat (C. curruca) had estimated flight ranges similar (<1300 km) to two pre-Saharans, European Robin (Erithacus rubecula) and Eurasian Blackap (S. atricapilla). The three short-distance migrants, including the Common Chiffchaff (Ph. col-lybita) with the shortest distance, had sufficient fuel load to reach their southern European wintering sites without needing to refuel at stopover sites.

In this study, we utilized a pilocarpine-induced status epilepticus (SE) mouse model and found that depression-like behavior does not appear within a day after SE but develops within one week and persists for over two weeks. We also observed a significant reduction in hippocampal LRP4 expression one day after SE. However, despite partial recovery over the next seven days, LRP4 levels remained markedly lower through day 14, correlating with the onset and persistence of postictal depression. These findings suggest that SE-induced modulation of LRP4 expression plays distinct roles at different stages of postictal depression. Furthermore, treatment with (2R, 6R)-hydroxynorketamine ((2R, 6R)-HNK), a ketamine metabolite that lacks dissociative and addictive properties while retaining strong antidepressant-like effects, significantly alleviated depressive-like behaviors and reduced LRP4 expression in hippocampal astrocytes within one day of administration. This treatment continued to alleviate depressive-like behaviors for up to seven days, while notably increasing Lrp4 levels within one week. To further investigate the role of LRP4, we generated astrocyte-specific LRP4 over- expression mice by stereotactically injecting an Lrp4 OE adenovirus with the gfaABC1D promoter, driving astrocyte-specific expression, into the molecular layer (ML) of the hippocampus. LRP4 overexpression in hippocampal astrocytes accelerated the onset of depressive-like behaviors and abolished the antidepressant effects of (2R, 6R)-HNK. These findings indicate that (2R, 6R)-HNK alleviates postictal depression induced by pilocarpine through stage-specific modulation of LRP4 expression in hippocampal astrocytes. This research provides novel insights into potential therapeutic targets for managing postictal depression.

AB  - Climate change has intensified nutrient deficiencies in soils of semi-arid regions, largely due to low organic matter, high pH levels and harsh environmental conditions. This study investigates how the combined application of nanostructured iron and zinc micronutrients with farmyard manure influences the oil quality of Camelina sativa L. The experiment was based on three levels of farmyard manure application (0, 10 and 20 t ha-1) and foliar sprays of nanostructured micronutrients at 300 ppm (water, nanostructured zinc and nanostructured iron). The oil extracted from the camelina seeds was analyzed for its fatty acids profile. The principal component analysis showed that the first two components explained 66 and 22 % of the total variance, respectively. Among the treatments, the combination of 10 t ha(-1) of farmyard manure with nanostructured zinc foliar application resulted in the most notable improvement in the oil quality, significantly enhancing the levels of linolenic, oleic, docosanoic and total saturated fatty acids. It also demonstrated the strongest ability to represent and discriminate traits. Applying higher levels of manure (20 t ha(-1)) led to a decrease in the linolenic acid content, suggesting that the excessive organic input may negatively affect the oil's nutritional profile. However, the combination of 20 t ha(-1) of manure with nanostructured iron yielded the highest content of docosahexaenoic acid. Nanostructured zinc showed to be more effective than nanostructured iron in improving the camelina oil quality.

AB  - Large carnivores can influence smaller scavengers through both positive and negative interactions (e.g., carrion provisioning and intraguild killing) and ultimately shape scavenging efficiency. However, we know little about this trade-off in anthropogenic landscapes where humans kill carnivores and provide carrion subsidies. In the context of wolf (Canis lupus) recolonization of human-impacted landscapes in Washington, USA, we investigated how sources of ungulate mortality (wolves, cougars [Puma concolor], and vehicles) shape scavenging efficiency, community-wide carcass visitations, and the strategies used by scavengers to navigate risk-reward trade-offs. Cougar and wolf kills mostly occurred in areas with low-to-moderate human influence, whereas roadkill typically occurred in areas with high human impact. Wolves consumed their kills most rapidly (median <4.7 days), providing fewer scavenging opportunities than cougar- and vehicle-killed ungulates, which persisted longer (median = 8.9 and 12 days, respectively). Roadkill primarily attracted avian scavengers, whereas mammalian scavengers used roadkill to a lesser degree and did so by shifting to more nocturnal foraging. The absence in winter of turkey vultures (Cathartes aura) and black bears (Ursus americanus), which are obligate and apex scavengers, respectively, coincided with a seasonal increase in scavenging by most other species. The two mammalian mesocarnivores exhibited divergent strategies: Coyotes (Canis latrans) frequently scavenged but usually for short durations and with heightened vigilance at predator kills, whereas bobcats (Lynx rufus) visited carcasses less frequently but fed for longer durations and displayed low vigilance while scavenging. These results suggest a hierarchical decision-making process whereby scavengers first choose whether to forage at a carcass before fine-tuning foraging duration, using temporal refugia, or increasing vigilance. Predator recovery in human-dominated landscapes therefore adds complexity to the spatiotemporal landscape of risks and rewards, and outcomes for scavengers will likely depend on their propensity to scavenge and vulnerability to humans and large predators.

AB  - Pig groups are known to be organised along dominance hierarchies. Little is known about the characteristics of the hierarchy in groups of sows and there are various methods to calculate dominance ranks within the hierarchy. Assessing dominance through recording agonistic interactions requires time-consuming observations. In order to compare the ranking methods, to investigate the sociometric characteristics of pig hierarchy such as stability, linearity and steepness, and to identify easy-to-record proxy indicators of hierarchy, four groups of 18 (+/- 2) gestating sows were studied. The sows were followed from 71 to 106 days of gestation. Starting from day 79, the access to the self-locking automatic feeders was limited to 6 h a day from to stimulate agonistic interactions. Each week, agonistic interactions were recorded during six continuous hours allowing the calculation of several dominance scores and sociometric variables. The restriction of feeding time increased the number of agonistic interactions but did not impact the proportion of agonistic behaviours with physical contact. The Dominance index, the David score and the Elo-score, used to rank the sow according to their dominance position, were highly inter-correlated (R > 0.92). The hierarchy was stable (stability index Stab = 0.996 +/- 0.081), transitive (proportion of transitive triads Pt = 0.967 +/- 0.035), quasi linear (Improved Landau index of linearity h' = 0.701 +/- 0.068) and moderately steep (real steepness Steep = 0.545 +/- 0.085). The rankings obtained through Elo-score were highly correlated with the mean order feeding order (RS = 0.76), weakly correlated with the total number of feeder visits (RS = -0.21, P < 0.001) and not correlated with the daily mean time spent in the feeder (RS = 0.09, P = 0.10), or the total daily spent time in the feeder (RS = 0.10, P = 0.07). The rank was also highly negatively correlated to parity (RS = -0.83, P < 0.001) and to the weight at the end of gestation (RS = -0.75, P < 0.001). The results suggest that dominance hierarchies in stable groups of pregnant sows are stable and strong. Dominance rank of an individual can be estimated according to the feeding order, body weight or parity if there is enough variability in the group.

AB  - The understanding of sustainability is shifting from that of a purely environmental dimension to one that includes social concerns. Combined with the growing customer interest in livestock husbandry practices, this study investigates the assessment of animal welfare as a socially influenced impact category for the life cycle assessment (LCA) of pig farming. The weighting of animal welfare impacts is based on a quantitative approach using a set of indicators derived from an expert survey using the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP). The aim is to develop an easy-to-implement score that translates the characteristics of several animal welfare indicators into a comparable value. To demonstrate the feasibility of the weighting part of the framework, a case study is conducted with nine experts in the fields of animal husbandry, agricultural sciences, and veterinary medicine. The case study results show that the main criteria of single animal observation and feed intake are the most relevant factors, at 30.6%, followed by operation-specific parameters at 23.9% and husbandry conditions at 14.9%. This case study highlights that animal losses (13.9%) significantly influence the impact category, while access to outdoor areas (1.4%) is less important. The overall conclusion is that an animal health-centered approach is preferable when assessing animal welfare.

AB  - Bisphenol A (BPA) is one of the chemicals that is firmly accompanied by hippocampal neuronal injury. As oxidative stress appears to be a major contributor to neurotoxicity induced by BPA, antioxidants with remarkable neuroprotective effects can play a valuable protective role. Around the world, (-)-epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG) was one of the most popular antioxidants that could exert a beneficial neuroprotective role. Here, we examined the potential efficiency of EGCG against neurotoxicity induced by BPA in the hippocampal CA3 region of the rat model. This study revealed that EGCG was unable to abrogate the significant decrease in circulating adiponectin level and hippocampal superoxide dismutase activity as well as an increase in hippocampal levels of nitric oxide and malondialdehyde. Notably, EGCG failed to antagonize the oxidative inhibitory effect of BPA on hippocampal neurotransmission and its associated cognitive deficits. In addition, the histopathological examination with immunohistochemical detection of caspase-3 and NF-kB/p65 emphasized that EGCG failed to protect hippocampal CA3 neurons from apoptotic and necrotic effects induced by BPA. Our study revealed that EGCG showed no protective role against the neurotoxic effect caused by BPA, which may be attributed to its failure to counteract the BPA-induced oxidative stress in vivo. The controversial effect is probably related to EGCG's ability to impede BPA glucuronidation and thus, its detoxification. That inference requires further additional experimental and clinical studies.

AB  - The inappropriate activation of eosinophils is a well-recognized driver of various human inflammatory diseases including asthma, chronic rhinitis, and various gastrointestinal diseases, including eosinophilic esophagitis. Steroids, both topical and systemic, remain a cornerstone of treatment and can be highly effective. However, some individuals suffer side effects, unresolved symptoms, or both. OmeGo, an enzymatically liberated fish oil, has demonstrated anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties as well the reduction of the activation, migration, and survival of eosinophils. Two animal models of eosinophilic inflammation were used to further assess OmeGo's profile. A house dust mite model of induced asthma showed a significant reduction in eosinophilic lung inflammation compared to the negative control, linoleic acid. The CRTH2 antagonist fevipiprant showed a similar eosinophilic inhibitory profile to OmeGo. In contrast, cod liver oil had no impact on any measure of inflammation. A guinea pig model of mild intraperitoneal eosinophilia showed a significant reduction in eosinophil activity by OmeGo, assessed by chemotaxis and chemokinesis. Apolipoprotein A-IV, an endogenous human protein with anti-inflammatory actions, showed a similar but numerically lower effect. OmeGo therefore combines a consistent antieosinophilic action with the known anti-inflammatory effects of polyunsaturated fatty acids. Proof-of-concept studies in asthma are warranted.

AB  - The long-tailed goral (Naemorhedus caudatus) faces significant threats from habitat loss and fragmentation and is classified as a Class I endangered species by the Ministry of Environment in South Korea and vulnerable by the IUCN. Understanding the behavioral ecology of this species is crucial for effective conservation and protective measures. Using GPS collars, this study investigated the home range sizes and activity patterns of nine rehabilitated long-tailed gorals (four males and five females) across three regions (Yanggu, Seoraksan National Park, and Uljin) from 2014 to 2016. The 95% minimum convex polygon (MCP) home range averaged 0.64 +/- 0.33 km2, while the 50% MCP home range averaged 0.15 +/- 0.05 km2. The male home ranges were larger than the female home ranges. Additionally, the home ranges varied seasonally, with the smallest recorded in winter. The activity pattern of long-tailed gorals was predominantly crepuscular and diurnal, with no significant sexual differences. There were no significant differences in activity during spring, summer, and autumn; however, activity in winter differed significantly from that in the other seasons. The data provided on the home ranges and activity patterns of the species will serve as a basis for developing effective conservation and management strategies to protect this endangered species. By elucidating the spatial and temporal behaviors of long-tailed gorals, this study enhances our understanding of the ecological needs of the species and helps develop precise conservation measures.

AB  - Postweaning diarrhea (PWD) is a significant concern in the swine industry, causing substantial economic losses due to decreased growth rates, increased mortality, and the extensive use of antimicrobials. Certain Escherichia coli (E. coli) pathovars are frequently implicated in PWD cases among piglets. Regular surveillance and testing of E. coli susceptibility to different antimicrobials is essential. This helps veterinarians and farmers select appropriate treatments, avoid unnecessary antibiotic use, and prevent the further spread of antimicrobial resistance (AMR). Herein, we tested the susceptibility to fourteen antimicrobials of 251 E. coli strains isolated from fecal samples of diarrheic (n = 148) and apparently healthy piglets (n = 103) in farms in Catalonia. The results of this study showed that 41.4% of the E. coli were multidrug-resistant (MDR) strains, presenting high resistance to conventional veterinary antimicrobials such as erythromycin, amoxicillin, streptomycin, tetracycline, lincospectin, sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim, and florfenicol. A special concern was also observed for human last-resort antimicrobials, like quinolones and colistin. Moreover, pigs suffering from diarrhea had a higher frequency of infection with MDR strains than the healthy ones. To reduce the incidence and impact of PWD in pig herds, optimization of antimicrobial therapies had to be implemented with other strategies, such as good hygiene practices, optimizing nutrition, managing stress levels, and employing proper vaccination protocols.

AB  - Simple Summary Diapause is a dormant period typically controlled by daylength that ensures an insect's survival through harsh environmental conditions. The convergent lady beetle, Hippodamia convergens, undergoes a reproductive diapause in winter, where female ovaries remain immature and no eggs are laid. This species is an important biological control agent, but during diapause, beetles are less likely to eat pest insects. Thus, knowledge of diapause mechanisms may facilitate manipulation thereof to improve biological control. Further, molecular studies of adult diapause and diapause in Coleoptera are relatively lacking. Here, we assembled and annotated a transcriptome for this species and quantified transcript expression changes during diapause. Female beetles were sampled at three times in diapause (early, mid, and late diapause), which allowed us to characterize the molecular processes occurring at distinct transitions throughout diapause. We found that transcripts involved in flight were consistently upregulated during diapause, which is consistent with dispersal flights at this stage, while transcripts involved in ovarian development were downregulated, which is consistent with the shutdown of reproduction in diapausing females. These findings identify key regulators of diapause in H. convergens and contribute to a growing body of literature on the molecular mechanisms of diapause across the insect phylogeny. Diapause is an alternate development program that synchronizes an insect's life cycle with seasonally abundant resources and ensures survival in unfavorable conditions. The physiological basis of diapause has been well characterized, but the molecular mechanisms regulating it are still being elucidated. Here, we present a de novo transcriptome and quantify transcript expression during diapause in the convergent lady beetle Hippodamia convergens. H. convergens is used as an augmentative biocontrol agent, and adult females undergo reproductive diapause that is regulated by photoperiod. We sampled females at three stages (early, mid, and late diapause) and compared transcript expression to non-diapausing individuals. Based on principle component analysis, the transcriptomes of diapausing beetles were distinct from non-diapausing beetles, and the three diapausing points tended to cluster together. However, there were still classes of transcripts that differed in expression across distinct phases of diapause. In general, transcripts involved in muscle function and flight were upregulated during diapause, likely to support dispersal flights that occur during diapause, while transcripts involved in ovarian development were downregulated. This information could be used to improve biological control by manipulating diapause. Additionally, our data contribute to a growing understanding of the genetic regulation of diapause across diverse insects.

AB  - The correct development of the composting process is essential to obtain a product of high value from organic wastes. Nowadays, some composting mixture parameters (i.e., air-filled porosity, moisture and the C/N ratio) are used to optimize the composting process, but their suitability is still debated because the literature reports contrasting results. This paper aimed to find other parameters that control the correct development of composting. The relationship between these and the compost quality was then verified. Twelve different composting mixtures were prepared using different organic wastes and bulking agents and were aerobically treated in a 300 L composter. The physico-chemical and chemical parameters of initial mixtures were analyzed, with particular regard to the total and water-extractable forms of organic C and N and their ratios and correlated with the temperature measured during composting. A positive correlation between temperature parameters during the active phase and soluble forms of N in the initial mixtures was found. A high total organic C to soluble N ratio in the composting mixtures was correlated with the low quality of the compost produced. Based on the results, a minimum content of WEN (water-extractable N) (0.4% w/w) or a TOC/WEN (total organic C/WEN) ratio in the range of 40-80 was recommended to ensure the correct development of the process and to produce compost of high quality.

AB  - Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), also recently referred as metabolic (dysfunction)-associated fatty liver disease (MAFLD), is characterized by hepatocyte steatosis in the setting of metabolic risk conditions and in the absence of an underlying precursor, for instance alcohol consumption, hepatotropic viruses and hepatotoxic drugs. A possible association between NAFLD and depression has been proposed, owing to intersecting pathophysiological pathways. This narrative review aimed to summarize the current evidence that illustrate the potential pathophysiological and clinical linkage between NAFLD-related metabolic state and depression. Prefrontal cortex lesions are suggested to be a consequence of liver steatosis-associated systematic hyperinflammatory state, a phenomenon also occurring in depression. In addition, depressive symptoms are present in neurotransmitter imbalances. These abnormalities seem to be correlated with NAFLD/MAFLD, in terms of insulin resistance (IR), ammonia and gut dysbiosis' impact on serotonin, dopamine, noradrenaline levels and gamma aminobutyric acid receptors. Furthermore, reduced levels of nesfatin-1 and copine-6-associated BDNF (brainderived neurotrophic factor) levels have been considered as a probable link between NAFLD and depression. Regarding NAFLD-related gut dysbiosis, it stimulates mediators including lipopolysaccharides, short-chain fatty acids and bile acids, which play significant role in depression. Finally, western diet and IR, which are mainstay components of NAFLD/MAFLD, are, also, substantiated to affect neurotransmitters in hippocampus and produce neurotoxic lipids that contribute to neurologic dysfunction, and thus trigger emotional disturbances, mainly depressive symptoms.

AB  - Background: Electromagnetic radiation is relevant to human life, and radiation can trigger neurodegenerative diseases by altering the function of the central nervous system through oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, and protein degradation. Astragaloside IV (AS-IV) is anti-oxidative, anti-apoptotic, activates the BDNF-TrkB pathway and enhances synaptic plasticity in radiated mice, which can exert its neuroprotection. However, the exact molecular mechanisms are still unclear. Purpose: This study investigated whether AS-IV could play a neuroprotective role by regulating BDNF-TrkB pathway in radiation damage and its underlying molecular mechanisms. Methods: Transgenic mice (Thy1-YFP line H) were injected with AS-IV (40 mg/kg/day body weight) by intraperitoneal injection daily for 4 weeks, followed by X-rays. PC12 cells and primary cortical neurons were also exposed to UVA after 24 h of AS-IV treatment (25 mu g/ml and 50 mu g/ml) in vitro. The impact of radiation on learning and cognitive functions was visualized in the Morris water maze assay. Subsequently, Immunofluorescence and Golgi-Cox staining analyses were utilized to investigate the structural damage of neuronal dendrites and the density of dendritic spines. Transmission electron microscopy was performed to examine how the radiation affected the ultrastructure of neurons. Finally, western blotting analysis and Quantitative RT-PCR were used to evaluate the expression levels and locations of proteins in vitro and in vivo. Results: Radiation induced BDNF-TrkB signaling dysregulation and decreased the levels of neuron-related functional genes (Ngf, Bdnf, Gap-43, Ras, Psd-95, Arc, Creb, c-Fos), PSD-95 and F-actin, which subsequently led to damage of neuronal ultrastructure and dendrites, loss of dendritic spines, and decreased dendritic complexity index, contributing to spatial learning and memory deficits. These abnormalities were prevented by AS-IV treatment. In addition, TrkB receptor antagonists antagonized these neuroprotective actions of AS-IV. 7,8-dihydroxyflavone and AS-IV had neuroprotective effects after radiation. Conclusion: AS-IV inhibits morphological damage of neurons and cognitive dysfunction in mice after radiation exposure, resulting in a neuroprotective effect, which were mediated by activating the BDNF-TrkB pathway.

AB  - Aspirin (ASA) is a popular nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID), which exerts its therapeutic properties through the inhibition of cyclooxygenase (COX) isoform 2 (COX-2), while the inhibition of COX-1 by ASA results in the formation of gastrointestinal side effects. Due to the fact that the enteric nervous system (ENS) is involved in the regulation of digestive functions both in physiological and pathological states, the aim of this study was to determine the influence of ASA on the neurochemical profile of enteric neurons in the porcine duodenum. Our research, conducted using the double immunofluorescence technique, proved an increase in the expression of selected enteric neurotransmitters in the duodenum as a result of ASA treatment. The mechanisms of the visualized changes are not entirely clear but are probably related to the enteric adaptation to inflammatory conditions resulting from aspirin supplementation. A detailed understanding of the role of the ENS in the development of drug-induced inflammation will contribute to the establishment of new strategies for the treatment of NSAID-induced lesions.

AB  - BACKGROUND With the development of intensive farming, long-term exposure of pigs to poor light conditions is not conducive to the production of vitamin D-3, and vitamin D-3 deficiency could affect absorption and metabolism of calcium (Ca) and phosphorus (P). 25-Hydroxyvitamin D-3 (25OHD(3)) has higher bioactivity than regular vitamin D-3. This study investigated the effects of 25OHD(3) on performance, serum parameters, fecal microbiota, and metabolites in weaned piglets fed with low Ca-P diet. RESULTS It was found that a low Ca-P diet supplemented with 50 mu g/kg 25OHD(3) (NC + 25-D) improved (P < 0.05) average daily gain (ADG) in phase 2 and in the overall period of the experiment, and increased (P < 0.05) the immunoglobulin G (IgG), immunoglobulin A (IgA), catalase (CAT), bone-specific alkaline phosphatase (BALP), and osteocalcin (OC) serum content on day 28 compared with a low Ca-P diet (NC), but no differences were observed between a normal Ca-P diet (PC) and the NC + 25-D diet. Compared with NC, the abundance of Firmicutes was higher (P < 0.05) in PC and NC + 25-D. NC + 25-D decreased (P < 0.05) the abundance of Streptococcaceae compared with PC and NC, and increased (P < 0.05) the abundance of Lachnospiraceae compared with NC. Serum 25OHD(3) was negatively correlated with the abundance of fecal Streptococcaceae (P < 0.05), and positively correlated with the abundance of fecal Lachnospiraceae (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION Supplementation of 25OHD(3) in a low Ca-P diet improved serum immunity, bone biochemical parameters, and fecal microbiota such as decreased Streptococcaceae abundance and increased Lachnospiraceae abundance, which could subsequently promote growth of piglets. The effects were similar to that of a normal Ca-P diet. (c) 2021 Society of Chemical Industry.

AB  - The heterotrimeric G-protein alpha o subunit is ubiquitously expressed in the CNS as two splice variants G alpha(o1) and G alpha(o2), regulating various brain functions. Here, we investigated the effect of single G alpha(o1), G alpha(o2), and double G alpha(o1/2 )knockout on the postnatal development of the murine mossy fiber tract, a central pathway of the hippocampal connectivity circuit. The size of the hippocampal synaptic termination fields covered by mossy fiber boutons together with various fiber length parameters of the tract was analyzed by immunohistochemical staining of the vesicular Zinc transporter 3 (ZnT3) or Synaptoporin at postnatal days 2, 4, 8, 12, 16, and in the adult. Ultimately, G alpha(o1) knockout resulted in a reduced developmental growth of synaptic mossy fiber terminal fields by 37% in the adult Stratum lucidum and by 30% in the total mossy fiber tract size. Other morphological parameters such as projection length of the infrapyramidal bundle of the tract were increased (+52% in G alpha(-/-)(o1) mice). In contrast, G alpha(o2) knockout had no effects on the mossy fiber tract. Moreover, by using primary heterozygous and homozygous G alpha o1 knockout hippocampal cultures, we detected a strongly pronounced reduction in axon and dendrite length (-50% and -38%, respectively) as well as axon and dendrite arborization complexity (-75% and -72% branch nodes, respectively) in the homozygous knockout. Deletion of both splice variants G alpha(o1) and G alpha(o2) partially rescued the in vivo and completely reconstituted the in vitro effects, indicating an opposing functional relevance of the two G alpha(o) splice variants for neuronal development and synaptic connectivity.image

AB  - Plastics breaking down of larger plastics into smaller ones (microplastics and nanoplastic) as potential threats to the ecosystem. Previous studies demonstrate that the central nervous system (CNS) is a vulnerable target of nanoplastics. However, the potentially epigenetic biomarkers of nanoplastic neurotoxicity in rodent models are still unknown. The present research aimed to determine the role of competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) in the process of polystyrene nanoplastics (PS NPs) exposure-induced nerve injury. The study was designed to inves-tigate whether 25 nm PS NPs could cause learning dysfunction and to elucidate the underlying mechanisms in mice. A total of 40 mice were divided into 4 groups and were exposed to PS NPs (0, 10, 25, 50 mg/kg). Chronic toxicity was introduced in mice by administration of oral gavage for 6 months. The evaluation included assessment of their behavior, pathological investigation and determination of the levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and DNA damage. RNA-Seq was performed to detect the expression levels of circRNAs, miRNAs and mRNAs in PFC samples of mice treated with 0 and 50 mg/kg PS NPs. The results indicated that exposure of mice to PS NPs caused a dose-dependent cognitive decline. ROS levels and DNA damage were increased in the PFC following exposure of the mice to PS NPs. A total of 987 mRNAs, 29 miRNAs and 67 circRNAs demonstrated significant differences between the 0 and 50 mg/kg PS NPs groups. Functional enrichment analyses indicated that PS NPs may induce major injury in the synaptic function. A total of 96 mRNAs, which were associated with synaptic dysfunction were identified. A competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) network containing 27 circRNAs, 19 miRNAs and 35 synaptic dysfunction-related mRNAs was constructed. The present study provided insight into the molecular events associated with nanoplastic toxicity and induction of cognitive dysfunction.

KW  - Morris-Lecar neural model
AB  - Time perception is fundamental for decision-making, adaptation, and survival. In the peak-interval (PI) paradigm, one of the critical features of time perception is its scale invariance, i.e., the error in time estimation increases linearly with the to-be-timed interval. Brain lesions can profoundly alter time perception, but do they also change its scalar property? In particular, hippocampus (HPC) lesions affect the memory of the reinforced durations. Experiments found that ventral hippocampus (vHPC) lesions shift the perceived durations to longer values while dorsal hippocampus (dHPC) lesions produce opposite effects. Here we used our implementation of the Striatal Beat Frequency (SBFML) model with biophysically realistic Morris-Lecar (ML) model neurons and a topological map of HPC memory to predict analytically and verify numerically the effect of HPC lesions on scalar property. We found that scalar property still holds after both vHPC and dHPC lesions in our SBFML-HPC network simulation. Our numerical results show that PI durations are shifted in the correct direction and match the experimental results. In our simulations, the relative peak shift of the behavioral response curve is controlled by two factors: (1) the lesion size, and (2) the cellular-level memory variance of the temporal durations stored in the HPC. The coefficient of variance (CV) of the behavioral response curve remained constant over the tested durations of PI procedure, which suggests that scalar property is not affected by HPC lesions.

AB  - Hydrogels have become an important material in the field of wearable flexible electronics owing to their excellent flexibility and adjustable conductivity. However, due to the large amount of free water contained within the hydrogel, it freezes in low-temperature environments, resulting in poor conductivity and mechanical properties. In this study, an ionically conductive hydrogel was developed by introducing phytic acid (PA), a biomass-based antifreezing material. The addition of PA improved the mechanical, adhesion, and electrical properties, as well as the frost resistance of the hydrogel. The PAM/PVA0.15/Gelatin0.02/PA4 hydrogel prepared in this study exhibited an ultrahigh tensile strain (3083%), excellent adhesion (with adhesion strength to pig skin up to 448.45 kPa), and high conductivity (10.07 S m-1). At the same time, PA endowed the hydrogel with good frost resistance and long-term environmental stability. The hydrogel could remain soft even at -20 degrees C, as well as retain good electrical properties. In addition, an integrated hydrogel sensor exhibited a wide strain response range (1-1000%), excellent stability, and high sensitivity. Moreover, hydrogel sensors were also successfully used for motion and pipeline flow rate monitoring, as well as simple human-computer interaction applications.

AB  - To evaluate the efficiency of activated charcoal (AC) in cottonseed meal-based feed (CSM; 38.46 % CSM, 1275 mg/kg free gossypol), experimental diets supplemented with 0 % AC, 1.5 % AC and 3.0 % AC were prepared and used to feed grass carp juveniles ( Ctenopharyngodon idellus, initial weight of 5.0 +/- 0.5 g) for 8 weeks. The results showed that the 1.5 % AC group significantly increased final body weight (FBW), weight growth rate (WGR), specific growth rate (SGR), and activated the expressions of intestinal barrier-associated genes zonula occludens-1 (zo-1), zo-2 and claudin-c compared with 0 % AC group (P < 0.05). Additionally, the 1.5 % AC and the 3.0 % AC groups significantly promoted the expression of claudin-12 (P < 0.05). Compared with the 0 % AC group, the 1.5 % AC group had significantly higher total protein (TP) concentration and significantly lower glucose (GLU) concentration and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) activity (P < 0.05). Liver antioxidant results showed that supplementation with 1.5 % AC and 3.0 % AC groups significantly reduced malondialdehyde (MDA) content and increased glutathione reductase (GR) activity (P < 0.05). Total-superoxide dismutase (T-SOD) and glutathione-S-transferase (GST) activities were significantly higher in the 1.5 % AC group than those in the other groups (P < 0.05). The antioxidant gene results showed that gr and GST omega 1 ( gsto1 ) levels were significantly higher in the 3.0 % AC group than in the 0 % AC group (P < 0.05). The 1.5 % AC group significantly promoted nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 ( nrf2 ) expression, and the 1.5 % AC and 3.0 % AC groups significantly inhibited the expressions of kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1 ( keap1a ) and keap1b (P < 0.05). Liver apoptotic and inflammatory genes showed that the expressions of caspase 9 ( casp9 ), BCL2 associated X a (baxa), nuclear factor-kappa B ( nf kappa b ) and inhibitor of kappa B (i kappa b) were significantly lower in the 1.5 % AC group than those in the other groups (P < 0.05). The expression of casp8 in the 1.5 % AC group was significantly lower than in the 0 % AC group (P < 0.05). Additionally, the expressions of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase ( p38MAPK ) and i kappa b kinase-beta ( ikk beta ) were significantly suppressed in the 1.5 % AC group and 3.0 % AC group (P < 0.05). In summary, 1.5 % AC supplementation in CSM-based feed can enhance intestinal barrier function, alleviate CSMbased feed-induced apoptosis, improve liver antioxidant, and thus promote grass carp weight growth rate.

AB  - Magnesium (Mg) as a bimetal plays critical roles in biochemical processes, membrane stability, and enzyme activity. Mg transporters (MGTs) are involving in maintaining Mg homeostasis in cells. Although the MGT family members have been identified in different plant species, there is no comprehensive analysis of the other plants' MGT genes. In the current study, 62 and 41 non-redundant putative MGT proteins were recognized into the genome of Camelina sativa, and Triticum turgidum and they were compared based on physicochemical properties, protein structure, expression, and interaction. All identified MGTs were classified into three subgroups, NIPA, CorA, and MRS2/MGT, based on conserved-motifs distribution. The results showed that the secondary structure pattern in NIPA and MRS2 subfamily members in both studied plant species were highly similar. Furthermore, MGTs encompass the conserved structures and the critical sites mainly in the metal ion and Mg2+ binding centers as well as the catalytic sites were observed. The highest numbers of protein channels were predicted in CorA proteins in both C. sativa and T. turgidum with 24 and 17 channel numbers, respectively. The Ser, Pro, Gly, Lys, Tyr, and Arg amino acids were predicted as the binding residues in MGTs channel regions. The expression pattern of identified genes demonstrated that MGT genes have diverse tissue-specific expression and stress response expression patterns. Besides, 147 co-expressed genes with MGTs were clustered into the eight co-expression nodes involved in N-glycan biosynthesis, protein processing in the endoplasmic reticulum, carbon metabolism, biosynthesis of amino acids, and endocytosis. In the present study, all interpretations are based on in silico predictions, which can be used in further studies related to functional genomics of MGT genes.

AB  - Ethnopharmacological relevance: Huashi Baidu Granule (HSBDG), a traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), is used for treating coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRS) is considered the "COVID-19" for swine. According to the TCM theory, "dampness" is the main pathogenic factor in COVID-19 and PRRS, and "Huashi" means that this formula is good at removing "dampness". Studies have demonstrated that HSBDG's effect in COVID-19; but the mechanism of removing "dampness" remains elusive. Aim of the study: We aimed to assess the effect of HSBDG on PRRS, and elucidate its potential mechanism in removing "dampness". Materials and methods: We established a PRRS-virus (PRRSV)-infected Marc-145 cells model, and performed qRTPCR, Western blot analysis, and indirect immunofluorescence assay to examine the anti-PRRSV effects of HSBDG in vitro. PRRSV-infected pig model was established and used to investigate HSBDG's effect in PRRS and explore underlying mechanisms in removing "dampness" using ELISA and immunohistochemistry assay methods. Results: HSBDG exhibited anti-PRRSV activity and suppressed the viral replication and release phases. HSBDG treatment alleviated PRRS, lowered rectal temperature, reduced histopathological changes and viral load in lung tissues, and ameliorated organ lesions. Moreover, IL-1 beta, IL-6, IL-8, and TNF-alpha expressions were decreased in lung tissues. Mechanistically, HSBDG inhibited the NLRP3/Caspase-1/GSDMD-N pathway to reduce the inflammatory response and upregulated AQP1, AQP5, alpha-ENaC, and Na-K-ATPase expressions to promote lung fluid clearance. Conclusion: HSBDG exerted anti-PRRSV effects and could attenuate PRRS. HSBDG potentially removes "dampness" by attenuating inflammation by suppressing the NLRP3/Caspase-1/GSDMD-N pathway and inhibiting pulmonary edema by upregulating the expression of AQP1, AQP5, alpha-ENaC, and Na-K-ATPase.

AB  - Acacia auriculiformis is an invasive weed that causes significant environmental damage across Florida, USA. Previous native range surveys in Australia identified a number of herbivores that are commonly associated with this plant, including several species of leaf-tying moths (Macrobathra spp.) and a chrysomelid beetle (Calomela intemerata). These herbivores are considered strong candidates as biological control agents, but the range of host species they use has not been determined. We therefore conducted a transect survey of herbivorous insects on A. holosericea, a closely-related sympatric relative of A. auriculiformis. These species share areas of sympatry and the latter was sampled simultaneously (in sympatry and allopatry). DNA barcoding approach identified an array of herbivorous insects feeding on A. holosericea, but few were found on both the Acacia species sampled. A literature survey suggested this pattern of host specificity may be consistent across Australian acacias, to the extent that each Acacia species may largely host its own suite of herbivores. These results do not negate the need for host testing procedures in biological control, but they do increase our confidence substantially that several promising potential biological control agents of A. auriculiformis (Macrobathra moths and Calomela beetles) have a restricted host species range. Our study illustrates how exploring the herbivore diversity of plant species closely related to the target weed can provide crucial information for biological control researchers.

AB  - Astrocytes play a key role in the regulation of synaptic strength and are thought to orchestrate synaptic plasticity and memory. Yet, how specifically astrocytes and their neuroactive transmitters control learning and memory is currently an open question. Recent experiments have uncovered an astrocyte-mediated feedback loop in CA1 pyramidal neurons which is started by the release of endocannabinoids by active neurons and closed by astrocytic regulation of the D-serine levels at the dendrites. D-serine is a co-agonist for the NMDA receptor regulating the strength and direction of synaptic plasticity. Activity-dependent D-serine release mediated by astrocytes is therefore a candidate for mediating between long-term synaptic depression (LTD) and potentiation (LTP) during learning. Here, we show that the mathematical description of this mechanism leads to a biophysical model of synaptic plasticity consistent with the phenomenological model known as the BCM model. The resulting mathematical framework can explain the learning deficit observed in mice upon disruption of the D-serine regulatory mechanism. It shows that D-serine enhances plasticity during reversal learning, ensuring fast responses to changes in the external environment. The model provides new testable predictions about the learning process, driving our understanding of the functional role of neuron-glia interaction in learning.
   A biophysical model, based on astrocyte-mediated feedback in CA1 neurons, aligns with the BCM model, explaining learning deficits in mice when D-serine regulation is disrupted

AB  - This study presents the first phylogenetic analysis focused on the subfamily Aceratheriinae to date, with 392 characters (361 parsimony-informative characters) coded from 50 taxa at the species level. We added 80 newly defined and 33 revised characteristics to an existing matrix, covering features of the skull, teeth, and postcranial bones. Based on the results of ordered and unordered analyses, combined with a diagnosis in accordance with traditional morphological taxonomy, we revised the diagnosis of Aceratheriinae and reconstructed the phylogeny of Aceratheriinae. The tribe Teleoceratini, as well as the tribe Aceratheriini, was reclassified within Aceratheriinae; however, the traditionally established contents of each tribe were changed somewhat. Aceratheriinae underwent evolutionary adaptation several times during the early stages of its evolution, and several genera are herein reconstructed as early-diverging taxa, such as Floridaceras, Chilotheridium, and Plesiaceratherium. Turkanatherium and Protaceratherium are excluded from Aceratheriinae in this study. We suggest another two subclades of Aceratheriinae, containing Hoploaceratherium and Aprotodon, respectively. Aceratheriini and Teleoceratini are redefined as two highly specialized groups of Aceratheriinae.

AB  - With the development of urbanization, kitchen waste and garden waste have become an important part of municipal solid waste (MSW), which is in urgent need of resource treatment. This study investigated the impacts of garden waste as auxiliary materials on maturity and odor emissions (NH3 and H2S) during kitchen waste composting. The result showed that the combined composting product of kitchen waste and garden waste achieved the maturity effect, and the co-composting effect was better than that of separate composting of kitchen waste. Meanwhile, compared with the separate composting treatment of kitchen waste, the co-composting treatment of kitchen waste and garden waste can effectively reduce the cumulative emissions of H2S by more than 85%, and effectively reduce the cumulative emissions of NH3 by more than 75%. This study provides a technical reference for the green fertilizer utilization of kitchen waste and garden waste.

AB  - Excessive consumption of food rich in saturated fatty acids and carbohydrates can lead to metabolic disturbances and cardiovascular disease. Hyperlipidemia is a significant risk factor for acute cardiac events due to its association with oxidative stress. This leads to arterial wall remodeling, including an increase in the thickness of the intima media complex (IMT), and endothelial dysfunction leading to plaque formation. The decreased nitric oxide synthesis and accumulation of lipids in the wall result in a reduction in the vasodilating potential of the vessel. This study aimed to establish a clear relationship between markers of endothelial dysfunction and the activity of repair enzymes in cardiac tissue from a pig model of early atherosclerosis. The study was conducted on 28 female Polish Landrace pigs, weighing 40 kg (approximately 3.5 months old), which were divided into three groups. The control group (n = 11) was fed a standard, commercial, balanced diet (BDG) for 12 months. The second group (n = 9) was fed an unbalanced, high-calorie Western-type diet (UDG). The third group (n = 8) was fed a Western-type diet for nine months and then switched to a standard, balanced diet (regression group, RG). Control examinations, including blood and urine sampling, were conducted every three months under identical conditions with food restriction for 12 h and water restriction for four hours before general anesthesia. The study analyzed markers of oxidative stress formed during lipid peroxidation processes, including etheno DNA adducts, ADMA, and NEFA. These markers play a crucial role in reactive oxygen species analysis in ischemia-reperfusion and atherosclerosis in mammalian tissue. Essential genes involved in oxidative-stress-induced DNA demethylation like OGG1 (8-oxoguanine DNA glycosylase), MPG (N-Methylpurine DNA Glycosylase), TDG (Thymine-DNA glycosylase), APEX (apurinic/apirymidinic endodeoxyribonuclease 1), PTGS2 (prostaglandin-endoperoxide synthase 2), and ALOX (Arachidonate Lipoxygenase) were measured using the Real-Time RT-PCR method. The data suggest that high oxidative stress, as indicated by TBARS levels, is associated with high levels of DNA repair enzymes and depends on the expression of genes involved in the repair pathway. In all analyzed groups of heart tissue homogenates, the highest enzyme activity and gene expression values were observed for the OGG1 protein recognizing the modified 8oxoG. Conclusion: With the long-term use of an unbalanced diet, the levels of all DNA repair genes are increased, especially (significantly) Apex, Alox, and Ptgs, which strongly supports the hypothesis that an unbalanced diet induces oxidative stress that deregulates DNA repair mechanisms and may contribute to genome instability and tissue damage.

AB  - The objective of the study was to investigate the piscicidal efficacy of Camellia sinensis (Tea) leaves, Jatropha curcas (Bherenda) seeds, Hevea brasiliensis (Rubber) seeds, Tephrosia purpurea (Bannilgach) leaves and Trichosanthes tricuspidata (Makal) fruits against Murrel ( Channa spp). Aqueous extracts were prepared (in a ratio of 1:5) using locally sourced materials from Tripura. These extracts were then subjected to a static bioassay technique, which was performed for 24 and 48 hours in glass aquaria. Test concentrations ranged from 5-100 ml/L. The behavioral responses of the fish were recorded upon exposure to the extracts, and the absence of reflexes was regarded as an indication of fish mortality. The median lethal concentrations (LC50) of the extracts were determined by plotting fish mortality against the test concentrations. Among the tested substances, tea leaves exhibited the highest effectiveness, followed by Tephrosia leaves, Jatropha seeds, Trichosanthes fruits, and Rubber seeds. The 24 hour LC50 values varied from 11.0 to 52.5 ml/L, while the 48 hour LC50 values ranged from 9.4 to 29.5 ml/L. The results of this study suggest that tea leaves, bherenda and rubber seeds, bannilgach leaves, and makal fruits have the capacity to function as viable piscicides.

AB  - The freshwater grey mullet, Rhinomugil corsula, exhibits distinctive behaviors in its habitat. Based on these behaiour patterns, eight novel capture strategies have been noticed for catching this species in the lower and estuary zones of the Ganges River. Fishers take advantage of the attraction to light by this species by using traditional gear such as 'Set barrier' and 'Cast net', along with light traps at night. The tendency of the fish to leap when escaping has inspired the use of an aerial trap called 'Chali tana' in Nabadwip. Their habit of schooling and swimming at the surface is exploited with various modified lift nets - 'Chhita' or 'Chowki jal' in Buxar and Patna, Bihar, and 'Khancha' in Roychak, West Bengal. The small mesh gill net, known as 'Corsula jaal', is effective when water is disturbed with a boat's oar, forcing the mullet to dive and become caught in the net. Other behaviors, like gathering in whirlpools or near drainage outlets, aid in using the scoop net, 'Thopa jal', in Tribeni. Juveniles of R. corsula are also collected alive near shorelines or drains using push nets and seine nets, for subsequent cultivation in ponds. This study sheds light on specific fishing techniques informed by the mullet's behavior, enhancing management of this valuable species in the wild and for aquaculture purposes.

AB  - The composition of genomic mediators of glucocorticoid actions in the brain remains elusive because of low-statistical-power experiments and the associated transcriptomic data with very low consistency. The problem is further exaggerated by the underrepresentation of chronic experiments and the interpretation of differentially expressed genes without understanding their contribution to the total transcriptomic activity. To fill existing gaps in knowledge, we have performed a large transcriptomic experiment, testing the effects of prolonged treatment with corticosterone on the hippocampal transcriptome (RNA sequencing). The experiment showed that prolonged treatment with corticosterone induced a set of transcriptomic effects that were replicable across treatment durations, including genes relevant for human PTSD (Opalin, Pllp, Ttyh2, Lpar1) and prolonged stress in animals (Cnp, Fam163a, Fcrls, Tmem125). Some of the affected genes are specific for oligodendrocytes, neurons, astrocytes, immune cells, the vascular system, and brain ventricles, indicating that glucocorticoids may affect all central nervous system components. The data also showed that the largest changes in expression of corticosterone-responsive genes are restricted to genes with a relatively low expression level and small contribution to the overall pool of mRNAs in the hippocampus. As a result, even a large change in the number of affected genes leads to a small change in the number of newly synthesized mRNA copies. This means, in turn, that the transcriptomic changes induced by corticosterone have low-cost effects on the brain. This specificity of transcriptomic responses also poses a challenge for the interpretation of data and constitutes a potential source of reporting bias in past studies. Therefore, there is a need for further research on products of gene expression, both at the transcriptomic and proteomic levels, during stress conditions.

AB  - Reproductive specializations in caviomorphs (infraorder Hystricognathi), are very peculiar within the Order Rodentia. These include long gestations, the birth of offspring with an extreme degree of precociality, and short lactation periods. This study describes the embryo-placental relationship of viable implantation sites (IS) of the plains viscacha, Lagostomus maximus, after 46 post-coital days. The observations recorded in this study are comparatively discussed with those of other hystricognaths and eutherians. At this stage, the embryo resembles that of other eutherians. At this time of embryo development, the placenta exhibits a size, shape, and organi-zation similar to that it will have in its mature state. Besides, the subplacenta is already highly folded. These characteristics are adequate to sustain the development of future precocial offspring. The mesoplacenta, a structure present in other hystricognaths and related to uterine regeneration is described for the first time in this species. This detailed description of the placental and embryonic structure contributes to the knowledge of the reproductive and developmental biology of the viscacha, as well as that of hystricognaths. These characteristics will allow testing other hypotheses related to the morphology and physiology of the placenta and subplacenta, and their relationship with the growth and development of precocial offspring in Hystricognathi.

AB  - The hippocampal salt-inducible kinase 2 (SIK2)-CREB-regulated transcription co-activator 1 (CRTC1) system has been demonstrated to participate in not only the pathogenesis of depression but also the antidepressant mechanisms of several antidepressant medications including fluoxetine, paroxetine, and mirtazapine. Like fluoxetine, paroxetine is also a widely used selective serotonin (5-HT) reuptake inhibitor (SSRI). Recent studies have indicated that paroxetine also modulates several pharmacological targets other than the 5-HT system. Here, we speculate that paroxetine regulates the hippocampal SIK2-CRTC1 system. Chronic stress models of depression, various behavioral tests, western blotting, co-immunoprecipitation, quantitative real-time reverse transcription PCR, and genetic knockdown were used together in the present study. Our results show that the antidepressant actions of paroxetine in mice models of depression were accompanied by its preventing effects against chronic stress on hippocampal SIK2, CRTC1, and CRTC1-CREB binding. In contrast, genetic knockdown of hippocampal CRTC1 notably abrogated the antidepressant effects of paroxetine in mice. In summary, regulating hippocampal SIK2 and CRTC1 participates in the antidepressant mechanism of paroxetine, extending the knowledge of its pharmacological targets.

AB  - Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) patients often suffer from depressive symptoms, which seriously affect cooperation in treatment and nursing. The amygdala plays a significant role in depression. This study aims to explore the microstructural alterations of the amygdala in T2DM and to investigate the relationship between the alterations and depressive symptoms. Fifty T2DM and 50 healthy controls were included. Firstly, the volumes of subcortical regions and subregions of amygdala were calculated by FreeSurfer. Covariance analysis (ANCOVA) was conducted between the two groups with covariates of age, sex, and estimated total intracranial volume to explore the differences in volume of subcortical regions and subregions of amygdala. Furthermore, the structural covariance within the amygdala subregions was performed. Moreover, we investigate the correlation between depressive symptoms and the volume of subcortical regions and amygdala subregions in T2DM. We observed a reduction in the volume of the bilateral cortico-amygdaloid transition area, left basal nucleus, bilateral accessory basal nucleus, left anterior amygdaloid area of amygdala, the left thalamus and left hippocampus in T2DM. T2DM patients showed decreased structural covariance connectivity between left paralaminar nucleus and the right central nucleus. Moreover, there was a negative correlation between self-rating depression scale scores and the volume of the bilateral cortico-amygdaloid transition area in T2DM. This study reveals extensive structural alterations in the amygdala subregions of T2DM patients. The reduction in the volume of the bilateral corticoamygdaloid transition area may be a promising imaging marker for early recognition of depressive symptoms in T2DM.

AB  - Classical and molecular cytogenetic methods were applied to study the karyotypes of one species of Hipposideridae and three taxa of the Rhinolophidae subgenus Aquias from Malaysian Borneo. Except for four chromosomal pairs with autapomorphic arm combinations, the karyotype of Coelops robinsoni was found to be similar to the closely related Aselliscus stoliczkanus. From the three Rhinolophus taxa studied, only R. trifoliatus was found to share the karyotype with conspecifics from Peninsular Malaysia. In contrast, the karyotype of R. luctus foetidus from Sarawak, Borneo differed in the composition of the Y-autosomal translocation products from the closely related R. morio from Peninsular Malaysia, formerly also a subspecies of R. luctus. Therefore, elevation to specific rank is suggested for R. l. foetidus. Examination of the chromosomal set of male R. sedulus specimens from Borneo with 2n = 45 and a Neo-X1X2Y sex chromosome system revealed extreme differences to the karyotype of specimens from Peninsular Malaysia with 2n = 28, to date also classified as R. sedulus. Therefore, with Sarawak, Borneo, as the type locality for R. sedulus, the taxon from Peninsular Malaysia is here described as a new species.

AB  - Simple Summary This study explored how retinal vasculature changes during central hypovolemia induced by lower body negative pressure (LBNP). LBNP is known to shift blood to the lower body and is routinely employed to assess the effects of central hypovolemia and/or to simulate the effects of hemorrhage on systems physiology. In this study, retinal imaging was carried out in participants of both sexes as they underwent LBNP. Surprisingly, no significant changes were observed in retinal blood flow between time points or across the sexes. This study is the first in this field, shedding light on retinal response during a moderate LBNP of -40 mmHg, which induces fluid shifts and evokes systematic physiological responses like those that occur during upright standing. However, further research is needed with stronger LBNP levels, including those that can induce pre-fainting (presyncope) states, to fully understand how retinal microcirculation adapts during complete cardiovascular collapse (e.g., during hypovolemic shock) and/or during severe hemorrhage.Abstract Introduction: Lower body negative pressure (LBNP) is routinely used to induce central hypovolemia. LBNP leads to a shift in blood to the lower extremities. While the effects of LBNP on physiological responses and large arteries have been widely reported, there is almost no literature regarding how these cephalad fluid shifts affect the microvasculature. The present study evaluated the changes in retinal microcirculation parameters induced by LBNP in both males and females. Methodology: Forty-four participants were recruited for the present study. The retinal measurements were performed at six time points during the LBNP protocol. To prevent the development of cardiovascular collapse (syncope) in the healthy participants, graded LBNP until a maximum of -40 mmHg was applied. A non-mydriatic, hand-held Optomed Aurora retinal camera was used to capture the retinal images. MONA Reva software (version 2.1.1) was used to analyze the central retinal arterial and venous diameter changes during the LBNP application. Repeated measures ANOVAs, including sex as the between-subjects factor and the grade of the LBNP as the within-subjects factor, were performed. Results: No significant changes in retinal microcirculation were observed between the evaluated time points or across the sexes. Conclusions: Graded LBNP application did not lead to changes in the retinal microvasculature across the sexes. The present study is the first in the given area that attempted to capture the changes in retinal microcirculation caused by central hypovolemia during LBNP. However, further research is needed with higher LBNP levels, including those that can induce pre-fainting (presyncope), to fully understand how retinal microcirculation adapts during complete cardiovascular collapse (e.g., during hypovolemic shock) and/or during severe hemorrhage.

AB  - The state of acid-base balance among the calf bulls of red steppe, black-and-white breeds and the chickens of different ages under the conditions of high air temperature was studied. At a temperature of 38 degrees C, the bulls increased the respiratory rate significantly (by 2.1-2.3 times), the volume of pulmonary ventilation (by 40.6-50.4%), oxygen consumption by 14.4% on average, and the release of carbon dioxide (by 31-40%). Thus, pCO(2) decreased by 0.55-0.65 kPa (P<0.01), the active reaction of the blood (pH(ist).) increased by 0.017-0.018 (P<0.05). An alkalous shift of the respiratory character of the subcompensated stage was recorded in blood, which was more pronounced among black-and-white bulls, as they were less adapted to the heat. By the end of the four-hour exposure, the alkalous shift in the acid-base state of the calf blood persisted, but it passed into the compensated stage. At 21 degrees C and the humidity of 70% the balance of acid-base relations was observed among chickens. All parameters characterizing it were within the physiological norm. At 23 degrees C, respiratory subcompensated alkalosis was found in the blood of three-month-old pullets. Whereas among the poultry of other ages, the acid-base balance was maintained with the decrease of pCO(2) at this temperature. At 25 degrees C the chickens of all ages, except for 12-day-old chickens, had compensated respiratory alkalosis in blood. 12-day-old chickens showed metabolic acidosis in a compensated phase at this temperature. The shift of the buffer bases was negative and amounted to - 2.8 +/- 0.5 mmol/L, pCO(2) - 4.5 +/- 0.3 kPa. Due to the inclusion of the respiratory component of the compensation, the pH(ist). remained in the lower limit of the norm. These features can be explained by the fact that the temperature of 25 degrees C was below the required temperature regime recommended for chicken growing of this age (29 - 31 degrees C). At 27 degrees C - the chickens of all studied ages had subcompensated respiratory alkalosis. At 31, 33, and 34 degrees C, respiratory alkalosis passed into a decompensated phase, even among the chickens at the age of 20 days, with the accumulation of buffer bases above the norm. Knowledge of the nature of disorders and adaptive capabilities of the acid-base balance of blood among farm animals and poultry under heat stress in the practice of animal husbandry and poultry farming will allow to take timely measures to maintain health and high productivity.

AB  - In brief: Transforming the endometrial luminal epithelium (LE) into a receptive state is a requisite event for successful embryo implantation. This study suggests the role of a transcription factor in regulating endometrial LE receptivity. The endometrial luminal epithelium (LE) undergoes extensive remodeling during implantation to establish receptivity of the uterus in response to the conceptus signals, such as interleukin 1 beta (IL1B). But the mechanisms remain to be fully understood. This study investigated the role of CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein beta (C/EBP-beta) in regulating pig endometrial LE receptivity. Our results showed that C/EBP-beta was expressed and activated only in the endometrial LE in an implantation-dependent manner. In addition, C/EBP-beta was highly activated at the pre-attachment stage compared to the attachment stage, and its activation was correlated with the expression of IL1B-dependent extracellular signal-regulated kinases1/2-p90 ribosomal S6 kinase signaling axis. Subsequent chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP)-sequencing analysis revealed that the binding of C/EBP-beta within the promoter was positively associated with the transcription of genes related to cell remodeling. One such gene is matrix metalloproteinase 8 (MMP8), which is responsible for extracellular matrix degradation. The expression of MMP8 was abundant at the pre-attachment stage but dramatically declined at the attachment stage in the endometrial LE. Consistent with C/EBP-beta, the expression and activation of MMP8 were limited to the endometrial LE in an implantation-dependent manner. Using ChIP-qPCR and electrophoresis mobility shift assay approaches, we demonstrated that C/EBP-beta regulated the expression of the MMP8 gene during implantation. Furthermore, we detected that MMP8 and one of its substrates, type II collagen, showed a mutually exclusive expression pattern in pig endometrial LE during implantation. Our findings indicate that C/EBP-beta plays a role in pig endometrial LE receptivity by regulating cell remodeling-related genes, such as MMP8, in response to conceptus signals during implantation.

AB  - Identification of the factors influencing refractory lining wear and its residual thickness in the basic oxygen furnace (BOF) is a prerequisite for optimizing the steelmaking process. In this study, the factors that contribute significantly to the wear of the refractory lining in the most stressed areas of the banded lining (i.e., the trunnion ring area and slag line area) are identified. Knowledge of the rate at which a given factor acts on refractory wear is closely related to the development of technological procedures aimed at limiting its influence. This research evaluates the technological causes and describes the lining wear mechanism and the thermodynamic parameters of the reactions between the MgO-C metal, slag, and gunning material phases. In researching the topic, real operational data were processed using statistical methods and data analysis, which were supported by thermodynamic modeling of chemical reactions. The results show that the combination of technological factors, mechanical action of the raw materials, blowing and free oxygen in the metal, silicon from the pig iron, and slag viscosity have the greatest influence on the residual thickness of the MgO-C refractory lining in BOFs. Refractory gunning material consumption, its effect on campaign length, and the cost-effectiveness of repair work were also analyzed.

AB  - Regulation of gluconeogenesis rate-limiting enzymes is a novel approach to improve fish glucose utilization. Phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK), one of important gluconeogenesis rate-limiting enzymes, exists a cytosolic isoform (PEPCK-C) and a mitochondrial isoform (PEPCK-M) encoded by pck1 and pck2, respectively. Here, we first investigated the PEPCK-C/PEPCK-M activity ratio in the livers of six fishes with three different food habits. No direct relevance between food habit and the two enzymes proportion was observed among the fishes. To further explore the role of fish PEPCK isoforms regulation in response to energy change, we detected the enzyme activities and gene expressions of the isoforms in the livers of three representative fishes with different food habits after preprandial and postprandial administration. The decreased enzyme activities and increased gene expressions of two PEPCK isoforms in herbivorous grass carp were observed after postprandial administration compared with preprandial administration. Significantly decreased gene expressions and enzyme activities of these two isoforms of omnivorous crucian carp were induced by postprandial administration. In carnivorous mandarin fish, only the pck2 gene expression was down-regulated by the postprandial administration, no significant difference was seen in the enzyme activities of the two PEPCK isoforms. Therefore, the regulation of PEPCK isoforms might be one of the reasons for the discrepancy in glucose utilization among fishes with different food habits.

AB  - Protein quantification is a routine procedure in ecological studies despite the inherent limitations of well-acknowledged protein determination methods which have been largely overlooked by ecologists. Thus, we want to bridge this knowledge gap, in hopes of improving the way ecologists quantify proteins and interpret findings.
   We surveyed the ecological literature to determine how and why ecologists quantify proteins. To determine whether different quantification methods produce comparable results across taxa, and between populations of a single species, we estimated the protein content of eight phylogenetically diverse taxa, and of desert isopods fed different diets, using various derived protocols of the 'crude protein', Bradford and bicinchoninic acid approach (BCA) methods.
   We found that ecologists use many protein quantification procedures, often without reporting the crucial information needed to evaluate and repeat their methods. Our empirical work demonstrated that the three quantification methods examined, and their derived protocols, resulted in highly divergent protein estimations that were inconsistent in rank across taxa, preventing conversion between methods. We also found that different quantification methods yielded different answers to whether isopod protein content is affected by diet.
   We conclude that commonly used quantification techniques yield distinct protein estimations with varying precision, and no single method is likely to be more accurate than another across taxa which may lead to inconsistent results across taxa and between conspecifics. Inaccurate protein quantification may explain the observed mismatch between organismal N and protein that has plagued some recent studies and that contradicts the principles of ecological stoichiometry. We recommend using a single BCA protocol to reduce inconsistencies across studies, until the promising amino acid analysis becomes more affordable, accurate and accessible to ecologists. Until then, ecologists should consider the abovementioned drawbacks of protein quantification methods and interpret their results accordingly.

AB  - The orchid genus Brachystele Schltr. (Orchidoideae, Cranichideae, Spiranthinae) comprises 20 species distributed from Mexico to Argentina, with 10 species found in Brazil. Anatomical studies of Orchidoideae Lindl. have been scarce, and the anatomy and histochemistry of Brachystele are still largely unknown. In this study, we conducted a characterization of the vegetative organs of B. guayanensis (Lindl.) Schltr. using standard anatomical and histochemical microtechniques. In this study, we provide the first information about the anatomy and histochemistry of Brachystele. The studied species was observed to display anatomical characters commonly found in the vegetative organs of representatives of the Cranichideae tribe (e.g., uniseriate epidermis; homogeneous mesophyll with 6-11 layers; rhizomes with rings of fibers; vascular bundles in the form of "<^>" or "v"; fleshy roots with uniseriate velamen, simple trichomes, and spiranthosomes). Others can be interpreted as adaptive strategies conditioned by the environment and their terrestrial life form (e.g., cuticle thickness; amphistomatic leaves; roots with reduced velamen compared to the cortex (18-20 layers); and raphides). In this study, cataphylls, and the presence of spiranthosomes in leaves, including stomatal guard cells, as well as alkaloids in these structures, are anatomically described for the first time in Orchidaceae. The presence of hyphae and pelotons in the stem of B. guayanensis is described for the first time in Cranichideae. Histochemical tests confirmed the presence of lignin, proteins, and alkaloids, the lipidic nature of the cuticle, starch grains stored in spiranthosomes, and the composition of the raphides. Alkaloids were observed in abundance, particularly in the roots, suggesting a potential role in defense against pathogens and herbivores, as well as potential medicinal activities, as seen in phylogenetically related groups to Brachystele.

AB  - The present study investigated the effects of treatments with sulfatase to desulfate the sulfated carbohydrate chain residues of the zona pellucida (ZP) and arylsulfatase A-blocking peptide (ARSA-BP) for the specific masking of sperm ARSA on the interaction of sperm ARSA with ZP, which plays an important role in the in vitro fertilization (IVF) of porcine oocytes. The pretreatment of oocytes with sulfatase for 10 min before the onset of insemination or the addition of 5 ng/mL ARSA-BP to IVF medium significantly reduced the incidence of polyspermy; however, these treatments did not affect sperm penetrability or male pronucleus formation. Combined treatments with sulfatase plus ARSA-BP significantly reduced the incidence of polyspermy to the range of 23-26 % under conditions maintaining a high sperm penetration rate from that of untreated oocytes (56 %). Although the treatments with sulfatase or ARSA-BP alone and sulfatase plus ARSA-BP during IVF did not affect the number of sperm that bound to the ZP or ZP solubility, the incidence of sperm with the acrosome reaction that bound to the ZP was efficiently reduced by the treatment. In oocytes treated with ARSA-BP but not sulfatase, developmental potency to the blastocyst stage was enhanced by decreasing the number of apoptotic blastomeres. Therefore, the present results clearly indicate that interference with the interaction between sperm ARSA and sulfated ZP glycoprotein residues reduced the induction of the acrosome reaction in sperm that bound to the ZP, effectively suppressing polyspermy during porcine IVF.

Nusantara Bioscience 17: 49-56. The black soldier fly (Hermetia illucens (Linnaeus, 1758)) is an insect commonly used as an organic waste decomposer. The Black Soldier Fly (BSF) has four life stages, and as an adult, it dies shortly after reproducing, which leads to it being an underutilized waste product. This study aimed to determine and compare the effects of the fermented BSF Carcass Meal (fBSFM) and Fermented Palm Kernel Meal (fPKM) as substrates on the growth rate and proximate composition of BSF Larvae (BSFL). The present research used a completely randomized design with four groups: a control group (100% fPKM) and three experimental groups with varying percentages of fBSFM (P1: 5% fBSFM, P2: 7.5% fBSFM, P3: 10% fBSFM). The results showed that substituting fBSFM at concentrations of 7.5- and 10% in fPKM increased growth rate, individual weight, biomass, and bioconversion, supporting their life cycle; the use of 15% fBSFM as BSFL substrate significantly impacted substrate reduction. The substrate reduction rate was measured at 55.18 +/- 8.49%, suggesting that black soldier fly larvae can effectively reduce both fBSFM and fPKM. The different proportions of fPKM and fBSFM did not have a significant effect on the proximate values of the BSFL. Therefore, this research provides valuable insight for waste management and agriculture, suggesting that incorporating more than 5% of fermented BSF carcass meal into the substrate mixture with fPKM is advisable to enhance the growth indices of BSFL.

AB  - Sheep farming plays a crucial role for Mediterranean countries, wherefrom a plethora of dairy products is produced. Yet, numerous indigenous sheep breeds in temperate latitudes such as the Mediterranean present a serious drawback that milk production is impaired by the seasonality of reproduction. Towards the efforts for reduction of this phenomenon, the purpose of this study was to evaluate and compare different oestrus synchronization treatments, as well as to associate two genes alleles', namely the MTNR1A and the GDF9, with the response to those treatments. Three indigenous breeds were investigated (Florina, Chios and Karagouniko sheep) and inside each breed three different oestrus synchronization treatments were applied (A: intravaginal sponges, B: GNRH use and C: male effect). In group A, Florina ewes expressed oestrus at 90% in July and fecundity was 85%. Karagouniko and Chios ewes exhibited an oestrus expression of 100% with fecundity rates at 95% and 99%, respectively. In group B, Florina ewes expressed oestrus at 60% with fecundity at 57%, Karagouniko ewes expressed oestrus at 65% with fecundity at 54%, whereas Chios breed animals expressed oestrus at 87% with fecundity rate at 85%. In group C, 68% of the Florina breed expressed oestrus 20-25 days post ram induction, whereas this proportion was 84% and 94%, for Karagouniko and Chios breed, respectively. For the molecular analysis, partial segments of the two genes were sequenced and analysed, whereas alleles were scored based on the detected SNPs. All frequencies of the four detected SNPs in MTNR1A gene were statistically and significantly different in ewes that expressed oestrus in comparison with ewes that did not express oestrus in Florina and Karagouniko breeds concerning all treatments. Two SNP's were detected in GDF9 gene, G1 and Fec(G), from which, only the Fec(G) mutation exhibited statistically significant difference in twins and triplets than in singles in Florina and Karagouniko breeds.

AB  - The target of rapamycin (TOR) signaling pathway is highly conserved and plays a crucial role in diverse biological processes in eukaryotes. Despite its significance, the underlying mechanism of the TOR pathway in Aspergillus flavus remains elusive. In this study, we comprehensively analyzed the TOR signaling pathway in A. flavus by identifying and characterizing nine genes that encode distinct components of this pathway. The FK506-binding protein Fkbp3 and its lysine succinylation are important for aflatoxin production and rapamycin resistance. The TorA kinase plays a pivotal role in the regulation of growth, spore production, aflatoxin biosynthesis, and responses to rapamycin and cell membrane stress. As a significant downstream effector molecule of the TorA kinase, the Sch9 kinase regulates aflatoxin B-1 (AFB(1)) synthesis, osmotic and calcium stress response in A. flavus, and this regulation is mediated through its S_TKc, S_TK_X domains, and the ATP-binding site at K340. We also showed that the Sch9 kinase may have a regulatory impact on the high osmolarity glycerol (HOG) signaling pathway. TapA and TipA, the other downstream components of the TorA kinase, play a significant role in regulating cell wall stress response in A. flavus. Moreover, the members of the TapA-phosphatase complexes, SitA and Ppg1, are important for various biological processes in A. flavus, including vegetative growth, sclerotia formation, AFB1 biosynthesis, and pathogenicity. We also demonstrated that SitA and Ppg1 are involved in regulating lipid droplets (LDs) biogenesis and cell wall integrity (CWI) signaling pathways. In addition, another phosphatase complex, Nem1/Spo7, plays critical roles in hyphal development, conidiation, aflatoxin production, and LDs biogenesis. Collectively, our study has provided important insight into the regulatory network of the TOR signaling pathway and has elucidated the underlying molecular mechanisms of aflatoxin biosynthesis in A. flavus.

AB  - The presence of allergen-specific IgE in serum is a biomarker for allergic disease. Specific IgE antibodies for research and diagnostics, however, remain scarce. In contrast to prototypic antibodies, camelid species have evolved single domains as moiety for antigen recognition. These so-called nanobodies represent a versatile platform for the development of diagnostic and therapeutic approaches. In this study, we aimed for generating nanobodies and derived IgE formats from an extract-shaped immune repertoire. Timothy grass pollen represents a complex, but well-defined mixture of individual allergens. Therefore, a repertoire library from a timothy grass pollen extract immunised llama was established. The selection by phage display yielded 3 nanobodies with immunoreactivity to the extract. IgE-like nanobody-based human IgE (nb-hIgE) antibodies were produced in mammalian cells and assessed in different immunoassays and commercial platforms. Immunoblotting and diagnostic ImmunoCap analysis of single timothy grass pollen allergens identified the major allergens Phl p 6 and Phl p 4 as targets. Assessment of immunoreactivity further documented significant molecular cross-reactivity with pollen extract of different grass species and variant presence of allergens within extracts of Pooideae grasses. In summary, our study shows that extract-based immunisation enables the generation of allergen-specific nanobodies and derived nb-hIgE formats linking nanobody technologies with allergological applications.

AB  - Aluminum sulphate (alum, Al2(SO4)3 center dot nH2O) has successfully been used to reduce ammonia loss from poultry litter, cattle feedlots and manure composting, but has not yet been utilized in the thermal drying process of digestate solids. The objectives of the present study were to evaluate the effects of alum addition on ammonium nitrogen (NH4+-N) content and phosphorus (P) solubility in dried digestate solids in comparison to the addition of concentrated sulfuric acid (H2SO4). Manure-based (MDS) and sewage sludge-based (SDS) digestate solids were chosen to conduct a drying experiment at four pH levels (original pH, 8.0, 7.5 and 6.5) and using two acidifying agents (alum, concentrated H2SO4). Alum addition increased the final NH4+-N content significantly from 1.4 mg g-1 in the non-acidified control up to 18 mg g-1 and 10.8 mg g-1 in dried MDS and SDS, respectively, which were higher levels than obtained with the addition of concentrated H2SO4. Moreover, alum considerably lowered the water extractable phosphorus (WEP) in raw and dried SDS by 37-83% and 48-72%, respectively, compared with the non-treated control. In contrast, concentrated H2SO4 notably increased WEP in raw and dried MDS by 18-103% and 29-225%, respectively. The comparison between the two acidifying agents indicated that alum had the potential to be an efficient and easy-handling alternative to concentrated sulfuric acid, resulting in higher NH4+-N content and lower P solubility.

AB  - Sus scrofa or pig was domesticated thousands of years ago. Through various indigenous breeds, different phenotypes were produced such as Chinese inbred miniature minipig or Wuzhishan pig (WZSP), which is broadly used in the life and medical sciences. The whole genome of WZSP was sequenced in 2012. Through a bioinformatics study of pig carbonic anhydrase (CA) sequences, we detected some beta- and gamma-class CAs among the WZSP CAs annotated in databases, while beta- or gamma-CAs had not previously been described in vertebrates. This finding urged us to analyze the quality of whole genome sequence of WZSP for the possible bacterial contamination. In this study, we used bioinformatics methods and web tools such as UniProt, European Bioinformatics Institute, National Center for Biotechnology Information, Ensembl Genome Browser, Ensembl Bacteria, RSCB PDB and Pseudomonas Genome Database. Our analysis defined that pig has 12 classical alpha-CAs and 3 CA-related proteins. Meanwhile, it was approved that the detected CAs in WZSP are categorized in the beta- and gamma-CA families, which belong to Pseudomonas spp. and Acinetobacter spp. The protein structure study revealed that the identified beta CA sequence from WZSP belongs to Pseudomonas aeruginosa with PDB ID: 5JJ8, and the identified gamma-CA sequence from WZSP belongs to P. aeruginosa with PDB ID: 3PMO. Bioinformatics and computational methods accompanied with bacterial-specific markers, such as 16S rRNA and beta- and gamma-class CA sequences, can be used to identify bacterial contamination in mammalian DNA samples.Y

AB  - COVID-19 impacted abattoirs worldwide. The processing lines became a hotspot for the spread of COVID-19 resulting in plant restructuring and ultimately a critical loss of pig material for research. Commercial sources of pig oocytes are available but are costly and companies were already operating at a maximum capacity for supplying the oocyte needs around the United States. Here, we provide an alternative source of oocytes that are competent to produce live, healthy piglets.

AB  - Sperm quality is crucial for animal reproduction but is often deteriorates due to oxidative stress. Preserving functionality during storage by protecting it from oxidative stress is crucial for enhancing the success of assisted reproductive technologies and maintaining fertility. Nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN), a precursor of Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD & thorn;), acts as a potent antioxidant. However, its role and regulatory mechanism in porcine sperm liquid preservation in vitro are remains unclear. In this study we demonstrated that NMN supplementation in the semen diluent significantly improved porcine sperm quality during storage at 17 degrees C by increasing NAD+ concentrations and decreasing the reactive oxygen species (ROS) concentrations in sperm. Subsequent analysis revealed that NMN, upon conversion to NAD+ within sperm, exerted antioxidant effect by upregulating the mitochondrial protein sirtuin 3 (SIRT3), resulting in the downregulation of superoxide dismutase 2 (SOD2) acetylation. This pathway mitigated oxidative stress. Additionally, NMN also enhanced sperm oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) thereby increase adenosine triphosphate (ATP) production concentrations via activating SIRT3, without affecting sperm glycolysis. Furthermore, the semen diluent supplemented with 50 mu g/mL NMN resulted in improved reproductive outcomes, including the birth of healthier piglets and a reduction in stillbirths rates following artificial insemination (AI). Taken together, NMN improves porcine sperm quality through SIRT3-activating the SOD2/ROS axis and oxidative phosphorylation. Our findings advance understanding of sperm physiology and metabolism and provide a new avenue promising approach for developing innovative semen diluents for liquid preservation in animal reproduction biology in vitro.

AB  - Elevated environmental temperatures can induce heat stress which could reduce fertility and early embryonic development. Fatty acids can initiate an endergonic reaction that absorbs cellular heat and decreases intracellular temperature. This study's objective was to minimize heat stress-induced damage to in vitro matured oocytes by supplementing maturation media with either 50 RM linoleic or linolenic acid or both (25 or 50 mu M) during maturation at either 38.5 or 41.5 degrees C. Oocytes were evaluated for intracellular antioxidative pathways, fertilization characteristics, or early embryonic development. Elevated maturation temperatures increased (p < 0.05) reactive oxygen species (ROS) formation and supplementation with linoleic or linolenic acid decreased (p < 0.05) ROS in oocytes matured at 41.5 degrees C. Maturation temperature had an effect (p < 0.05) on the intracellular antioxidative pathways of the oocyte except for glutathione peroxidase activity. Regardless of maturation temperature, supplementation with linoleic or linolenic acid increased (p < 0.05) the enzyme activities and glutathione concentrations in the oocytes compared to no fatty acid supplementation. Supplementation of both linoleic and linolenic acid decreased (p < 0.05) polyspermic fertilization rates. Supplementing either 25 or 50 mu M linoleic and linolenic acid to maturing oocytes at 41.5 degrees C increased (p < 0.05) cleavage rates by 48 h after IVF and the blastocyst formation rates by 144 h after IVF compared to other treatments. Oocytes matured at 38.5 degrees C had greater (p < 0.05) embryonic development than those matured at 41.5 degrees C except for those supplemented with 50 mu M linoleic and linolenic acid. Supplementing 50 mu M linoleic and linolenic acid to the maturation medium of pig oocytes reduces the effects of heat stress-induced damage.

AB  - P21-activated kinase 3 (PAK3) gene mutations are linked to several neurodevelopmental disorders, but the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. In this study, we used a tetracycline-inducible system to control the expression of a mutant PAK3 (mPAK3) protein in immediate early gene, namely cFos, positive cells to disrupt PAK signaling, specifically in cells activated by social interaction in transgenic mice. We show that the expression of mPAK3-GFP proteins was in cFos-expressing excitatory and inhibitory neurons in various brain regions, such as the cortex and hippocampus, commonly activated during learning and memory. Basal expression of mPAK3-GFP proteins in cFos-positive cells resulted in social recognition memory deficits in the three-chamber social interaction test, without affecting locomotor activity or other forms of memory. The social memory deficit was rescued by doxycycline to halt the mPAK3-GFP transgene expression. In addition, we show that the expression of mPAK3-GFP proteins in a subset of cFos-positive cells, induced by an antecedent short social interaction, termed social pairing, was sufficient to impair social recognition memory. These results indicate that normal PAK signaling in cFos-positive cells activated during social interaction is critical for social memory.

AB  - BackgroundChronic inflammatory pain (CIP) frequently coincides with depression among patients. The onset and development of pain and depression are associated with altered neural synaptic plasticity. Electroacupuncture (EA) can effectively relieve CIP and depression. However, the underlying mechanisms have not been fully illustrated.ObjectiveTo explore whether EA can relieve CIP and depression by regulating hippocampal synaptic plasticity, and the present study offers foundational evidence for the efficacy of EA in treating CIP-related depression (CIPD).MethodsRats were divided into four groups: 0.9% normal saline group, complete Freund's adjuvant (CFA) group, CFA + duloxetine group, and CFA + EA group. Pain hypersensitivity was detected by mechanical withdrawal threshold and thermal paw withdrawal latency, and the depression level was gauged using the open field test, the sucrose preference test, and the forced swimming test. The morphology of the hippocampal neurons was observed using Nissl staining. The protein expression levels of synuclein (Syn), postsynaptic density protein-95 (PSD-95), brain-derived neurotrophic factors (BDNFs), tyrosine-protein kinase B (TrKB), p-TrkB, cAMP response element binding protein (CREB), and p-CREB were measured by western blotting and immunofluorescence staining. BDNF and TrkB mRNA expression were detected using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) (qRT-PCR). The content of 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) was detected using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and the glutamic acid (Glu) content was determined using the ultraviolet colorimetry method. The hippocampal neuron ultrastructure was observed using transmission electron microscopy.ResultsEA could alleviate CIP and related depressive behaviors as well as protect the hippocampal neuronal structure from damage and regulate 5-HT/GABA/Glu levels in the hippocampus. Additionally, EA could significantly increase the expression of synapse-associated proteins such as PSD-95 and Syn by activating the BDNF/TrKB/CREB signaling pathway.ConclusionEA improves pain and depressive behaviors in CIPD rats, and the mechanism may be related to synaptic plasticity mediated by the BDNF/TrKB/CREB signaling pathway.
   CFA injection can induce pain sensitivity and depression-like behavior in adult male SD rats. Electroacupuncture has demonstrated antidepressant and analgesic properties, which can be attributed to its ability to enhance hippocampal synaptic plasticity by mitigating neuronal damage, modulating neurotransmitters, regulating synaptic proteins, and activating the BDNF/TrkB/CREB signaling pathway.image

AB  - Elephant grass (Cenchrus purpureus syn. Pennisetum purpureum) stands out for its high dry matter production per unit area and good nutritional value and is cultivated throughout Brazil. This study aimed to evaluate the performance of Elephant grass cultivar 'Cameroon' fertilized with nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) at different rates. The experimental design was in randomized blocks with 10 treatments and 4 replicates. The treatments consisted of 5 doses of N (0, 200, 400, 600 and 800 kg N/ha) all with 66 kg P/ha and 5 doses of P (0, 22, 44, 66 and 88 kg P/ha) all with 600 kg N/ha. The variables evaluated during 3 harvests were: shoot dry matter (DM) yield, N and P concentrations in shoots, and uptakes of N and P in forage. Results showed that, in the arenosol of the experimental area, high doses of N and P could produce high yields of the grass (40-41 t DM/ha) over 260 days. The grass extracted large amounts of N (on average, 800 kg N/ha over 260 days) and P concentrations were significantly affected by P fertilization only in the last harvest, where it increased from 0.27 to 0.78 g P/kg DM. However, application of only 200 kg N/ha will produce more than 60 % of the DM yield response achieved with 800 kg N/ha. Similarly, there seems little merit in applying more than 22 kg P/ha with the N. Longer-term studies are needed to test these hypotheses along with economic assessments to determine the financial soundness of such decisions.

AB  - Background. Sustained stress with the overproduction of corticosteroids has been shown to increase reactive oxygen species (ROS) leading to an oxidative stress state. Mitochondria are the main generators of ROS and are directly and detrimentally affected by their overproduction. Neurons depend almost solely on ATP produced by mitochondria in order to satisfy their energy needs and to form synapses, while stress has been proven to alter synaptic plasticity. Emerging evidence underpins that Rhodiola rosea, an adaptogenic plant rich in polyphenols, exerts antioxidant, antistress, and neuroprotective effects. Methods. In this study, the effect of Rhodiola rosea extract (RRE) WS (R) 1375 on neuronal ROS regulation, bioenergetics, and neurite outgrowth, as well as its potential modulatory effect on the brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) pathway, was evaluated in the human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y and the murine hippocampal HT22 cell lines. Stress was induced using the corticosteroid dexamethasone. Results. RRE increased bioenergetics as well as cell viability and scavenged ROS with a similar efficacy in both cells lines and counteracted the respective corticosteroid-induced dysregulation. The effect of RRE, both under dexamethasone-stress and under normal conditions, resulted in biphasic U-shape and inverted U-shape dose response curves, a characteristic feature of adaptogenic plant extracts. Additionally, RRE treatment promoted neurite outgrowth and induced an increase in BDNF levels. Conclusion. These findings indicate that RRE may constitute a candidate for the prevention of stress-induced pathophysiological processes as well as oxidative stress. Therefore, it could be employed against stress-associated mental disorders potentially leading to the development of a condition-specific supplementation.

AB  - Female herbivorous insects are expected to oviposit on the host plant providing the best performance of the offspring. However, in some insects the larvae are mobile and are not totally dependent on the mother's choice. They can change host plant when conditions for development or exposure to natural enemies vary between individual plants within a patch. Here we study larval migration and preference between two host plants, cotton and alfalfa, in the Egyptian leafworm, Spodoptera littoralis (Boisduval) (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae). Previous studies have shown that although larval performance is better on cotton, females prefer to oviposit on alfalfa, and this preference corresponds to a higher survival of the eggs. In this study, S. littoralis larvae showed directed movement between host plants and were found to prefer alfalfa over cotton in field test in Egypt, as well as in laboratory selection of feeding site assays. To determine effects by natural enemies, the parasitism rates and various life-history traits were measured for one larval parasitoid, Microplitis rufiventris Kokujev (Hymenoptera: Braconidae), on several host plants including cotton and clover (equivalent host plant to alfalfa). Overall, parasitism was higher on cotton and parasitoid performance (cocoon mass, adult longevity, and female egg load) was better on cotton compared to clover. This fact suggests an enemy-free space on clover and alfalfa, as parasitism rate is higher on cotton, and the parasitoid performance is also better on cotton-fed larvae.
   Larval migration was investigated in the Egyptian leafworm, Spodoptera littoralis (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae). Larvae showed directed movement between host plants and were found to prefer alfalfa over cotton in field and laboratory tests, even though larval performance is better on cotton. However, parasitism rates were higher and parasitoid performance (cocoon mass, adult longevity, and female egg load) was better for the larval parasitoid Microplitis rufiventris (Hymenoptera: Braconidae) on cotton, suggesting enemy-free space on alfalfa.image

AB  - In vitro expansion of spermatogonial stem cells (SSCs) has gained significant attention, as it offers a promising alternative for preserving and utilizing these cells beyond their natural regenerative capacity. Present study aimed to investigate the effect of supplementation of growth factors in culture media and its comparison with commercially available media for in vitro expansion and maintenance of culture characteristics of adult caprine SSCs (cSSCs). In Trial-1, cSSCs were isolated from adult goats and an enriched population of cSSC was randomly divided into 5 groups i.e., group-1 (control; no growth factor), group-2 (GDNF; 40 ng/mL), group-3 (FGF2; 10 ng/mL), group-4 (EGF; 5 ng/mL) and group-5 (GDNF+FGF2+EGF). Following cultivation of cSSCs, morphological assessment, colony counting, and expression of alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and PGP9.5 were conducted and results were compared among the groups. Further, in Trial-2, the performance of optimized cSSCs culture media (in-house media) was compared with 5 commercial media viz, alpha-MEM, of cSSCs. The cluster-forming activity (CFA) assay, ALP staining, morphological evaluation of cSSCs colonies, and expression analyses of marker genes were performed. In Trial-1, the total number of colonies, size of colonies, and ALP expression were significantly (P<0.05) higher in group-5 compared with other groups. In Trial 2, the in-house media produced significantly (P<0.05) higher number and larger cSSC colonies among all the media tested. Similar results were observed in CFA and ALP staining. The results of expression analyses demonstrate upregulation of pluripotency (PGP9.5 and PLZF) and adhesion (E-cadherin) marker genes, and downregulation of apoptosis marker gene (BCL-6) in the cells when grown in in-house media. Overall, our results demonstrate that in-house media, with a combination of growth factors, provides a more favorable niche for proliferation, colony formation, and maintenance of functional characteristics of adult cSSCs in the in vitro culture systems. These results can be utilized for future studies and application that require optimum expansion of cSSCs or other stem cells.

AB  - Adult aphid predators disperse across the landscape seasonally in search of prey aggregations that are patchily distributed and temporally variable. However, flight is energetically costly and consumes resources that could be invested in reproduction. Hippodamia convergens is an important aphid predator in North American cereal crops and other agricultural systems. Consumption of floral resources can enhance adult survival during periods of low prey availability and may improve reproductive success. We tested how an omnivorous adult diet containing floral resources (diluted honey and pulverized bee pollen) interacts with body size to influence reproduction and flight behavior compared to a prey-only diet. Two sizes of beetles were produced by controlling larval access to food-3 h daily access produced small beetles; ad libitum access produced large beetles with faster development. Reproductive performance was tracked for 18 days, and female flight activity was assayed via 3 h bouts of tethered flight. Diet composition and body size interacted to influence preoviposition period, with large females in prey-only treatments delaying oviposition the longest. The omnivorous adult diet improved 18-day fecundity relative to a prey-only diet, but egg fertility was unaffected. Adult size affected oviposition pattern, with small beetles laying smaller, but more numerous, clutches. Females flew up to 7 km in 6 h, but neither body size nor adult diet influenced flight distance, suggesting that all diet treatments generated energy reserves sufficient to power flights of short duration. However, pre-reproductive females flew > 60% further than they did post-reproduction, likely due to the energetic costs of oviposition. Thus, access to pollen and nectar increased reproductive success and altered oviposition patterns in H. convergens, indicating the importance of floral resources in the agricultural landscape to conservation of this predator and its biological control services.

AB  - The choroid plexus (ChP) of the brain plays a central role in orchestrating the recruitment of peripheral leukocytes into the central nervous system (CNS) through the blood-cerebrospinal fluid (BCSF) barrier in pathological conditions, thus offering a unique niche to diagnose CNS disorders. We explored whether magnetic resonance imaging of the ChP could be optimized for mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI). mTBI induces subtle, yet influential, changes in the brain and is currently severely underdiagnosed. We hypothesized that mTBI induces sufficient alterations in the ChP to cause infiltration of circulating leukocytes through the BCSF barrier and developed macrophage-adhering gadolinium [Gd(III)]-loaded anisotropic micropatches (GLAMs), specifically designed to image infiltrating immune cells. GLAMs are hydrogel-based discoidal microparticles that adhere to macrophages without phagocytosis. We present a fabrication process to prepare GLAMs at scale and demonstrate their loading with Gd(III) at high relaxivities, a key indicator of their effectiveness in enhancing image contrast and clarity in medical imaging. In vitro experiments with primary murine and porcine macrophages demonstrated that GLAMs adhere to macrophages also under shear stress and did not affect macrophage viability or functions. Studies in a porcine mTBI model confirmed that intravenously administered macrophage-adhering GLAMs provide a differential signal in the ChP and lateral ventricles at Gd(III) doses 500- to 1000-fold lower than those used in the current clinical standard Gadavist. Under the same mTBI conditions, Gadavist did not offer a differential signal at clinically used doses. Our results suggest that macrophage-adhering GLAMs could facilitate mTBI diagnosis.

AB  - Emerging evidence shows that chronic restraint stress (CRS) can induce cognitive dysfunction, which involves in hippocampal damage. Our recent research reveals that hydrogen sulfide (H2S), a novel gasotransmitter, protects against CRS-induced cognitive impairment, but the underlying mechanism remains unclear. Adiponectin, the most abundant plasma adipokine, has been shown to elicit neuroprotective property and attenuate cognitive impairment. Hence, the present work was aimed to explore whether adiponectin mediates the protective effect of H2S on CRS-induced cognitive impairment by inhibiting hippocampal damage. Results found that administration of Anti-Acrp30, a neutralizing antibody of adiponectin, obviously reverses sodium hydrosulfide (NaHS, an exogenous H2S donor)-induced the inhibition on CRS-induced cognitive impairment according to Y-maze test, Novel object recognition (NOR) test, and Morris water maze (MWM) test. In addition, Anti-Acrp30 blocked the protective effect of NaHS on hippocampal apoptosis in rats-subjected with CRS as evidenced by the pathological changes in hippocampus tissues in hematoxylin and eosin (HE) staining and the increases in the amount of the condensed and stained to yellowish-brown or brownish yellow neuron nucleuses in terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase transfer-mediated dUTP nick end-labeling (TUNEL) staining as well as the expression of hippocampal pro-apoptotic protein (Bax), and a decrease in the expression of hippocampal anti-apoptotic protein (Bcl-2). Furthermore, Anti-Acrp30 mitigated the inhibitory effect of NaHS on CRS-induced oxidative stress as illustrated by the up-regulation of malondialdehyde (MDA) content and the down-regulation of superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity and glutathione (GSH) level in the hippocampus. Moreover, Anti-Acrp30 eliminated NaHS-induced the reduction of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress-related proteins including binding immunoglobulin protein (BIP), C/EBP homologous protein (CHOP), and Cleaved Caspase-12 expressions in the hippocampus of rats-exposed to CRS. Taken together, these results indicated that adiponectin mediates the protection of H2S against CRS-induced cognitive impairment through ameliorating hippocampal damage.

AB  - Background Accumulating evidence demonstrates that certain microRNAs play critical roles in epileptogenesis. Our previous studies found microRNA (miR)-129-2-3p was induced in patients with refractory temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE). In this study, we aimed to explore the role of miR-129-2-3p in TLE pathogenesis.
   Method By bioinformatics, we predicted miR-129-2-3p may target the gene GABRA1 encoding the GABA type A receptor subunit alpha 1. Luciferase assay was used to investigate the regulation of miR-129-2-3p on GABRA1 3'UTR. The dynamic expression of miR-129-2-3p and GABRA1 mRNA and protein levels were measured in primary hippocampal neurons and a rat kainic acid (KA)-induced seizure model by quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (qPCR), Western blotting, and immunostaining. MiR-129-2-3p agomir and antagomir were utilized to explore their role in determining GABRA1 expression. The effects of targeting miR-129-2-3p and GABRA1 on epilepsy were assessed by electroencephalography (EEG) and immunostaining.
   Results Luciferase assay, qPCR, and Western blot results suggested GABRA1 as a direct target of miR-129-2-3p. MiR-129-2-3p level was significantly upregulated, whereas GABRA1 expression downregulated in KA-treated rat primary hippocampal neurons and KA-induced seizure model. In vivo knockdown of miR-129-2-3p by antagomir alleviated the seizure-like EEG findings in accordance with the upregulation of GABRA1. Furthermore, the seizure-suppressing effect of the antagomir was partly GABRA1 dependent.
   Conclusions The results suggested GABRA1 as a target of miR-129-2-3p in rat primary hippocampal neurons and a rat kainic acid (KA) seizure model. Silencing of miR-129-2-3p exerted a seizure-suppressing effect in rats. MiR-129-2-3p/GABRA1 pathway may represent a potential target for the prevention and treatment of refractory epilepsy.

AB  - Infusion of 17(3-estradiol (E2) into the dorsal hippocampus (DH) of ovariectomized (OVX) mice enhances memory consolidation, an effect that depends on rapid phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) and Akt. Astrocytic glutamate transporter 1 (GLT-1) modulates neurotransmission via glutamate uptake from the synaptic cleft. However, little is known about the contribution of DH astrocytes, and astrocytic glutamate transport, to the memory-enhancing effects of E2. This study was designed to test whether DH astrocytes contribute to estrogenic modulation of memory consolidation by determining the extent to which DH GLT-1 is necessary for E2 to enhance memory in object recognition and object placement tasks and trigger rapid phosphorylation events in DH astrocytes. OVX female mice were bilaterally cannulated into the DH or the DH and dorsal third ventricle (ICV). Post-training DH infusion of the GLT-1 inhibitor dihydrokainic acid (DHK) dosedependently impaired memory consolidation in both tasks. Moreover, the memory-enhancing effects of ICVinfused E2 in each task were blocked by DH DHK infusion. E2 increased p42 ERK and Akt phosphorylation in DH astrocytes, and these effects were blocked by DHK. Results suggest the necessity of DH GLT-1 activity for object and spatial memory consolidation, and for E2 to enhance consolidation of these memories and to rapidly activate cell signaling in DH astrocytes. Findings indicate that astrocytic function in the DH of OVX females is necessary for memory formation and is regulated by E2, and suggest an essential role for DH astrocytic GLT-1 activity in the memory-enhancing effects of E2.

AB  - Developing metal-free carbon nanozyme for tumor hypoxia is difficult. In biomedical applications, especially in the case of biomolecular detection, extensive research has been done on nanozymes with enzyme-mimicking catalytic activity. However, there are considerably fewer investigations on targeted nano-catalytic tumor ther-apy. Nano catalytic medicine-enabled chemotherapy is a safe and promising treatment strategy that involves the conversion of excess H2O2 into O2 in a tumor environment. Here we have synthesized carbon nanosphere (CNS) using the Camellia sinensis plant (CS-CNS). Further surface functionalization was achieved via nitrilotriacetic acid conjugation (NTA@CS-CNS). A stability study of synthesized nanozyme in the presence of various cations, an-ions, and 5 different pH range suggested the robustness of carbon based nanoassembly. The catalytic in vitro study shows that NTA@CS-CNS mimics peroxidase and catalase using TMB and H2O2 as substrates. NTA@CS-CNS showed Km and Vmax values of -193.2 mu M and 0.43 mu M/s, -413 mu M and 1.42 mu M/s, and -378 mu M and 1.63 mu M/s, respectively when H2O2 and TMB was used for CAT and POD activity. Results showed that NTA@CS-CNS in combination with SFN and laser irradiation reduces hypoxia. Hence, our study could pave the path for the development of different non-toxic nano catalytic therapy for tumors in cancerous cells.

AB  - Camelids produce a special type of antibody, known as VHHs, that has lost the VL domain, providing a more optimised VH domain. This particular highly stable antibody domain has interesting properties for biotechnological development. Ordinarily, those molecules possess only one disulphide bridge, but surprisingly, at least a quarter of these VHHs have a second one. Curiously, this does not seem to be essential for the stability and the function of this domain. In an attempt to characterise precisely the role and impact of this disulphide bridge at the molecular level, several in silico mutants of a VHH were created to disrupt this second disulphide bridge and those systems were submitted to molecular dynamics simulation. The loss of the second disulphide bridge leads to an increase in the flexibility of CDR1 and CDR3 and an unexpected rigidification of CDR2. Local conformational analysis shows local differences in the observed protein conformations. However, in fact, there is no exploration of new conformations but a change in the equilibrium between the different observed conformations. This explains why the interaction of VHHs is not really affected by the presence or absence of this second bridge, but their rigidity is slightly reduced. Therefore, the additional disulphide bridge does not seem to be an essential part of VHHs function.

AB  - Trichosporon asahii is an opportunistic pathogen that can cause severe or even fatal infections in patients with low immune function. sPLA2 plays different roles in different fungi and is also related to fungal drug resistance. However, the mechanism underlying its drug resistance to azoles has not yet been reported in T. asahii. Therefore, we investigated the drug resistance of T. asahii PLA2 (TaPLA2) by constructing overexpressing mutant strains (TaPLA2(OE)). TaPLA2(OE) was generated by homologous recombination of the recombinant vector pEGFP-N1-TaPLA2, induced by the CMV promoter, with Agrobacterium tumefaciens. The structure of the protein was found to be typical of sPLA2, and it belongs to the phospholipase A2_3 superfamily. TaPLA2(OE) enhanced antifungal drug resistance by upregulating the expression of effector genes and increasing the number of arthrospores to promote biofilm formation. TaPLA2(OE) was highly sensitive to sodium dodecyl sulfate and Congo red, indicating impaired cell wall integrity due to downregulation of chitin synthesis or degradation genes, which can indirectly affect fungal resistance. In conclusion, TaPLA2 overexpression enhanced the resistance to azoles of T. asahii by enhancing drug efflux and biofilm formation and upregulating HOG-MAPK pathway genes; therefore, it has promising research prospects.

AB  - Many studies have focused on the role of the medial entorhinal cortex (MEC) in spatial memory and spatial processing. However, more recently, studies have suggested that the functions of the MEC may extend beyond the spatial domain and into the temporal aspects of memory processing. The current study examined the effect of MEC lesions on spatial and nonspatial tasks that require rats to learn and remember information about location or stimulus-stimulus associations across short temporal gaps. MEC- and sham-lesioned male rats were tested on a watermaze delayed match to position (DMP) task and trace fear conditioning (TFC). Rats with MEC lesions were impaired at remembering the platform location after both the shortest (1 min) and the longest (6 h) delays on the DMP task, never performing as precisely as sham rats under the easiest condition and performing poorly at the longest delay. On the TFC task, although MEC-lesioned rats were not impaired at remembering the conditioning context, they showed reduced freezing in response to the previously associated tone. These findings suggest that the MEC plays a role in bridging temporal delays during learning and memory that extend beyond its established role in spatial memory processing.

AB  - BackgroundThe avian node is the equivalent of the amphibian Spemann's organizer, as indicated by its ability to induce a secondary axis, cellular contribution, and gene expression, whereas the node of the mouse, which displays limited inductive capacities, was suggested to be a part of spatially distributed signaling. Furthermore, the structural identity of the mouse node is subject of controversy, while little is known about equivalent structures in other mammals.ResultsWe analyzed the node and emerging organizer in the pig using morphology and the expression of selected organizer genes prior to and during gastrulation. The node was defined according to the "four-quarter model" based on comparative consideration. The node of the pig displays a multilayered, dense structure that includes columnar epithelium, bottle-like cells in the dorsal part, and mesenchymal cells ventrally. Expression of goosecoid (gsc), chordin, and brachyury, together with morphology, reveal the consecutive emergence of three distinct domains: the gastrulation precursor domain, the presumptive node, and the mature node. Additionally, gsc displays a ventral expression domain prior to epiblast epithelialization.ConclusionOur study defines the morphological and molecular context of the emerging organizer equivalent in the pig and suggests a sequential development of its function.

AB  - The entomopathogen Beauveria bassiana (Bals.) Vuill. (Ascomycota: Hypocreales) can colonize plants endophytically and stimulate the production of secondary plant metabolites with anti-herbivore activities. We assayed the topical virulence of B. bassiana to Aphis gossypii Glover (Hemiptera: Aphididae), the effects of cucumber inoculation with this fungus on plant metabolites, and the physiological consequences for aphids that fed on these plants. Assays were conducted with both the commercial formulation of B. bassiana, 'Naturalis (R)-L', at the recommended concentration of 1.5 ml / L (yielding a spore concentration of 2.3 x 107 CFU per ml), and with a similar concentration of the isolated fungal strain. Topical application of 0.03 ml of solution per cm2, or 1 x 103 CFU, caused 100% mortality to A. gossypii adults after seven days, whether Naturalis (R)-L or the isolate alone was used. The fungus grew endophytically into foliage when sprayed on cucumbers at the 2-leaf stage and concentrations of alkaloids, flavonoids, phenols, hydrogen peroxide, and total chlorophyll were higher than in control plants 28 days after inoculation. Malondialdehyde content, plant growth, and total yield were unaffected by B. bassiana inoculation. Aphids fed on B. bassiana-inoculated plants for 24 h had reduced activities of detoxifying enzymes (glutathione-S-transferase, carboxylesterase, and acetylcholinesterase) compared to controls. Activities of digestive enzymes, (lipase, alpha-amylase, alpha-glucosidase, and aminopeptidase) were reduced in aphids from inoculated plants, which exhibited higher activities of superoxide dismutase, ascorbate peroxidase, and phenoloxidase, but lower catalase activity. Energy reserves (lipids, protein, and glycogen) were lower in aphids from inoculated plants, and they exhibited reduced fecundity, longevity, and reproductive periods, and a 50% reduction in the LC50 of pirimicarb. Thus, in addition to causing direct pathogenicity, inoculation of plants with B. bassiana negatively impacted A. gossypii physiology and reproductive performance and could usefully complement other strategies for managing cotton aphids on greenhouse cucumber.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Poplar in China has long been plagued by the fall webworm Hyphantria cunea. Enhancing plant immunity using chemical elicitors is an environmentally friendly approach to pest control. The phytohormone methyl jasmonate (MeJA) can stimulate the chemical defenses of poplars against herbivores but has been shown to have limited efficacy in practice. Here, we studied the effects of a MeJA and mesoporous silica nanoparticle (MSN) complex (MeJA@MSN) regarding the induction of poplar resistance to H. cunea, which may provide strategies for the effective use of MeJA. RESULTS: The silicon-based phytohormone complex (MeJA@MSNs) exhibited excellent biological and physiochemical properties, such as excellent biocompatibility and plant tissue transportability. The changes in metabolites in poplar leaves induced by MeJA, MSNs, and MeJA@MSNs were investigated by metabolic analysis. MeJA@MSNs led to highly potent induced resistance along with elevated salicylaldehyde content, which increased with the dose administered. The salicylaldehyde metabolite showed a strong antifeedant effect on H. cunea larvae at a dosage of 1 mu g, with the 50% lethal dose being 20.4 mu g/mg. Furthermore, transcriptional analysis showed that MeJA@MSNs upregulated key genes in biosynthetic pathways more than MeJA and MSNs. CONCLUSION: Our results show that MeJA and MSNs interact positively in poplar, leading to salicylaldehyde accumulation and increased induced resistance to H. cunea, providing new insights into the underlying resistance mechanisms induced by MeJA@MSNs.

AB  - Yunnan semi-fine wool (YSFW) is a recently developed dual-purpose (meat and wool) sheep breed mainly found in Yunnan Province, China. Moreover, dietary calcium is essential for animal health and productivity. The current experiment aimed to investigate the impact of dietary calcium on sheep gut metabolite profile. For this, thirty YSFW rams (male, age = 10 months, and body weight = 40.37 +/- 0.49 kg) were randomized into three groups (n = 10 rams/group), followed by a completely randomized design, and the groups were allotted to one of three dietary calcium levels (Q_1 = 0.50%, Q_3 = 0.73%, and Q_5 = 0.98% on a dry basis). The rams were fed ad libitum by feeding twice a day (at 08:00 and 17:00 h/day) throughout the experimental period (44 day). On the 21st day of the experiment, fecal samples were collected from 27 rams (9/group) and untargeted metabolite profiling was performed by using ultra-performance liquid chromatography. The PCA plot showed that the Q_5 group metabolites were clustered more tightly than for Q_1 and Q_3, respectively. The tightly clustering molecules were mainly alkaloids and their derivatives, benzenoids, lignans and related compounds, lipids, nucleotides, organic acids, and nitrogenous-based derivatives. According to the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway analysis, these molecules potentially contribute to metabolic pathways, biosynthesis of secondary metabolites, proteinaceous compounds, and the metabolism of the protein derivatives, particularly amino acids. The PLS-DA plots revealed a significant difference between the Q_1, Q_3, and Q_5 groups, suggesting that Q_5 had a clear separation across the groups. Based on the metabolomic analysis, feeding different levels of dietary calcium significantly changed the metabolomic profile of YSFW rams, which primarily entails metabolic pathways such as energy, protein, and lipid metabolism.

AB  - Background: Cerebral microcirculation disturbance manifested by decrease of cerebral blood flow (CBF) is one of early features of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Shenqi Yizhi prescription (SQYZ) is widely used in the treatment of AD. However, the effect of SQYZ on the early feature of AD is not clarified. Purpose: To explore the effect and mechanism of SQYZ on AD-like behavior from the perspective of early pathological features of AD. Methods: The fingerprint of SQYZ was established by ultra-high-performance liquid chromatograph. The improvement effect of SQYZ on A beta 1-42 Oligomer (A beta O)-induced AD-like behavior of mice was evaluated by behavioral test. The changes of CBF were detected by laser doppler meter and laser speckle imaging. The pathological changes of the hippocampus were observed by HE staining and transmission electron microscope. The expressions of intercellular communication molecules were detected by western blotting or immunofluorescence staining. The content of platelet-derived growth factor-BB (PDGF-BB) was detected by ELISA. Finally, the core components of SQYZ were docked with platelet-derived growth factor receptor beta (PDGFR beta) using AutoDock Vina software. Results: The similarity of the components in SQYZ extracted from different batches of medicinal materials was higher than 0.9. SQYZ administration could improve A beta O-induced memory impairment and CBF reduction. Compared with the sham group, the number of neurons in the hippocampi of A beta O group was significantly reduced, and the microvessels were shrunken and deformed. By contrary, SQYZ administration mitigated those pathological changes. Compared with the sham mice, the expressions of CD31, N-cadherin, PDGFR beta, glial fibrillary acidic protein, phosphorylation of focal adhesion kinase, integrin beta 1, and integrin alpha 5 in the hippocampi of A beta O mice were significantly increased. However, SQYZ administration significantly reduced A beta O-induced expression of those proteins. Interestingly, the effect of PDGFR beta inhibitor, sunitinib demonstrated a consistent modulating effect as SQYZ. Finally, the brain-entering components of SQYZ, including ginsenoside Rg5, coptisine, cryptotanshinone, dihydrotanshinone IIA, stigmasterol, and tanshinone IIA had high binding force with PDGFR beta, implicating PDGFR beta as a potential target for SQYZ. Conclusions: Our data indicate that SQYZ improves CBF in A beta O-triggered AD-like mice through inhibiting brain pericyte contractility, indicating the treatment potential of SQYZ for AD at the early stage.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to observe the changes in memory impairment and hippocampal phosphorylated protein levels in mice caused by obesity, and to explore the key phosphorylation modification proteins and pathways of memory impairment induced by high-fat diet. First, sixteen C57BL/6 J mice were randomly divided into simple obese group (group H, n = 8) and normal control group (group C, n = 8). And at the end of the experiment, the cognitive function of the mice was assessed by Morris water maze and serological indexes were measured. Finally, phosphoproteomics was used to identify the differentially phosphorylted protein expression in the hippocampus of obese mice. Compared with group C, mice in group H had significantly decreased learning and memory abilities, and significantly increased body weight, blood glucose and lipid levels. The results of the phosphoproteomics analysis showed 442 up-regulated differentially phosphorylated proteins and 402 downregulated differentially phosphorylated proteins. Further protein-protein interaction (PPI) analysis revealed pathway hub proteins, including beta-actin (ACTB), Phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted on chromosome ten (PTEN), Phosphoinositide-3-kinase regulatory subunit 1 (PIK3R1), mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), ribosomal protein 6 (RPS6), etc. Notably, the hub proteins PTEN, PIK3R1, and mTOR were jointly involved in the mTOR signaling pathway. Our study shows for the first time that a high-fat diet increases the phosphorylation of PTEN proteins, which may affect cognitive function.

AB  - The spatial orientation of mammals and birds has been intensively studied for many years, but the cognitive mechanism of spatial orientation and memory used by squamates remains poorly understood. Our study evaluated the learning and memory abilities of leopard geckos (Eublepharis macularius) in an adapted Morris water maze. The animals learned during the training phase consisted of 20 trials. To assess long-term memory, we retested geckos twice after several months. The geckos remembered the learned information in a short re-test after two months, but after four months, they required retraining to find the platform. We hypothesise that the duration of memory corresponds with short-term changes in semi-desert environments within one season, while disruption of memory performance after a six-month gap may simulate the more extensive seasonal change in spatial relationships in their natural environment. Moreover, during the winter period, geckos exhibit low activity, which can be connected with decreased frequency of foraging trips. Therefore, the memory loss after four months may reflect the low level of memory jogging. The motivation during the experiment was the crucial parameter of learning and memory processes. In later phases, geckos were less motivated to perform the task. Finally, they relearned the spatial orientation task, but they moved more slowly as the experiment progressed.

AB  - Shingles is caused by the reactivation of varicella zoster virus (VZV) and manifests as painful skin rashes. While the recombinant protein-based vaccine proves highly effective, it encounters supply chain challenges due to a shortage of the necessary adjuvant. Messenger RNA (mRNA)-based vaccines can be rapidly produced on a large scale, but their effectiveness relies on efficient delivery and sequence design. Here, an mRNA-based VZV vaccine using a synergistic lipid nanoparticle (Syn-LNP) containing two different ionizable lipids is developed. Syn-LNP shows superior mRNA expression compared to LNPs formulated with either type of ionizable lipid and to a commercialized LNP. After encapsulating VZV glycoprotein E (gE)-encoding mRNA, mgE@Syn-LNP induces robust humoral and cellular immune responses in two strains of mice. The magnitude of these responses is similar to that induced by adjuvanted recombinant gE proteins and significantly higher than that observed with live-attenuated VZV. mgE@Syn-LNP exhibits durable humoral responses for over 7 months without obvious adverse effects. In addition, mgE@Syn-LNP protects vaccinated guinea pigs against live VZV challenges. Preliminary studies on the mRNA antigen design reveal that the removal of glycosylation sites of gE greatly reduces its immune responses. Collectively, Syn-LNP encapsulating gE-encoded mRNA holds great promise as a shingles vaccine.
   A synergistic lipid nanoparticle (Syn-LNP) containing two ionizable lipids is developed for the efficient delivery of messenger RNA (mRNA) varicella zoster virus (VZV) vaccine. Syn-LNP encapsulating the full VZV glycoprotein E-encoding mRNA elicits potent humoral and cellular immune responses in two strains of mice and protects vaccinated guinea pigs against live VZV challenges.image

AB  - To assess the loading profiles of groundwater nitrate (NO3-) and fluoride (F-), their spatial distributions, geochemistry and associated health risks were determined for 131 groundwater samples from eastern (ESR), central (CSR) and Trans-Indus Salt Ranges (TSR) in Pakistan. Groundwater NO3- concentrations were 0.2-308 mg/L (mean 59 mg/L) in ESR, 2.7-203 mg/L (mean 73 mg/L) in CSR and 1.1-259 mg/L (mean 69 mg/L) in the TSR. Forty-one %, 57% and 36% of the ESR, CSR and TSR samples, respectively, exceeded the WHO and Pak-NEQs permissible limit of 50 mg/L NO3-. Likewise, groundwater F- concentrations ranged from 0.1-1.8 mg/L (mean 0.6 mg/L), 0.1-2.7 mg/L (mean 0.9 mg/L) and 0.3-2.5 mg/L (mean 1.6 mg/L) mg/L in the ESR, CSR and TSR sites, respectively. In this case, 3%, 17% and 27% of the ESR, CSR and TSR samples, respectively, exceeded the WHO and Pak-NEQs permissible limit of 1.5 mg/L F. Oxidation of coal and coal waste resulted in the release of NO3- to groundwater. By contrast, enrichment of F- in groundwater was due to dissolution and cation exchange processes. Elevated values of the Higher Pollution Index (PI) and Health Risk Index (HRI) reflect a non-acceptable carcinogenic risk for drinking water NO3- and F- which should be addressed on a priority basis to protect human health.

AB  - Traffic-related air pollution (TRAP) has been a common public health problem, which is associated with central nervous system dysfunction according to large-scale epidemiological studies. Current studies are mostly limited to artificial laboratory exposure environments and specific genetic mechanisms remain unclear. Therefore, we chose a real-world transportation environment to expose aged mice, transporting them from the laboratory to a 1-m-high dry platform inside the campus and tunnel, and the mice were exposed daily from 7 a.m. to 7 p.m. for 2, 4 and 12 weeks respectively. Compared with the control group (in campus), the memory function of mice in the experimental group (in tunnel) was significantly impaired in the Morris water maze test. TRAP exposure increased the number of activated microglia in the hippocampal DG, CA1, CA3 regions and dorsolateral pre -frontal cortex (dPFC). And neuroinflammation and oxidative stress levels were up-regulated in both hippo-campus and dPFC of aged mice. By screening the risk genes of Alzheimer's disease, we found the mRNA and protein levels of ABCA7 were down-regulated and those of PYK2 were up-regulated. The DNA methylation ratios increased in four CpG sites of abca7 promoter region and decreased in one CpG site of pyk2 promoter region, which were consistent with the altered expression of ABCA7 and PYK2. In conclusion, exposure to the real traffic environment impaired memory function and enhanced neuroinflammation and oxidative stress responses, which could be relevant to the altered expression and DNA methylation levels of ABCA7 and PYK2. Our work provides a new and promising understanding of the pathological mechanisms of cognitive impairment caused by traffic-related air pollution.

AB  - Being able to store toxic baits could allow livestock producers to target 'hot spots' of predator activity, supplementing or even replacing broadscale baiting, therefore avoiding potential risk of bait-resistant populations. We compared 1080 dose recovered from dried meat baits (DMB; camel, horse and kangaroo) and sausage baits stored by different methods (shed, locked transport box, freezer, cryo-vacuumed) to identify whether they were still lethal, and address concern that freezing/thawing could result in loss of the water-soluble 1080 toxicant. We developed a bait collection method to halt microbial activity (preserving 1080 dose), allowing collection of baits manufactured under field conditions by five regional Recognised Biosecurity Groups according to their own schedule and methods. We assayed 351 baits (including 43 negative control baits, i.e., no toxicant), just over half (54%) of which were manufactured by us, using consistent meat masses, 1080 doses, and drying methods. For freshly manufactured baits, there was good consistency in bait manufacture, with no significant difference in recovered 1080. For stored baits, there was no effect of time on recovered 1080 for up to 2 months (maximum length of study), indicating different storage methods were equally effective in maintaining lethal baits. Manufactured sausage baits contained significantly more 1080 than DMB manufactured for this study, and showed substantial variability in recovered 1080 dose, which could reflect gun handling error. Storage in a locked transport box resulted in marked insect damage, likely rendering baits unattractive to target species. Freezing baits did not result in reduced 1080 dose. The majority (93%) of deployed/stored baits had a lethal 1080 dose recovered (13/192 baits were below the LD50 for a 20 kg dingo). Dry shed storage is prescribed as best practice, but freezing baits does not reduce their toxic dose. Future testing for longer durations of storage would be beneficial.

AB  - 11 beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1 (11 beta-HSD1) is a key enzyme that transform cortisone to cortisol, which activates the endogenous glucocorticoid function. 11 beta-HSD1 has been observed to regulate skeletal metabolism, specifically within osteoblasts. However, the function of 11 beta-HSD1 in osteoclasts has not been elucidated. In this study, we observed increased 11 beta-HSD1 expression in osteoclasts within an osteoporotic mice model (ovariectomized mice). Then, 11 beta-HSD1 global knock-out or knock-in mice were employed to demonstrate its function in manipulating bone metabolism, showing significant bone volume decrease in 11 beta-HSD1 knock-in mice. Furthermore, specifically knock out 11 beta-HSD1 in osteoclasts, by crossing cathepsin-cre mice with 11 beta-HSD1(flox/flox) mice, presented significant protecting effect of skeleton when they underwent ovariectomy surgery. In vitro experiments showed the endogenous high expression of 11 beta-HSD1 lead to osteoclast formation and maturation. Meanwhile, we found 11 beta-HSD1 facilitated mature osteoclasts formation inhibited bone formation coupled H type vessel (CD31(hi)Emcn(hi)) growth through reduction of PDFG-BB secretion. Finally, transcriptome sequencing of 11 beta-HSD1 knock in osteoclast progenitor cells indicated the Hippo pathway1 was mostly enriched. Then, by suppression of YAP expression in Hippo signaling, we observed the redundant of osteoclasts formation even in 11 beta-HSD1 high expression conditions. In conclusion, our study demonstrated the role of 11 beta-HSD1 in facilitating osteoclasts formation and maturation through the Hippo signaling, which is a new therapeutic target to manage osteoporosis.

AB  - Isoprene has recently been proposed to be a signaling molecule that can enhance tolerance of both biotic and abiotic stress. Not all plants make isoprene, but all plants tested to date respond to isoprene. We hypothesized that isoprene interacts with existing signaling pathways rather than requiring novel mechanisms for its effect on plants. We analyzed the cis-regulatory elements (CREs) in promoters of isoprene-responsive genes and the corresponding transcription factors binding these promoter elements to obtain clues about the transcription factors and other proteins involved in isoprene signaling. Promoter regions of isoprene-responsive genes were characterized using the Arabidopsis cis-regulatory element database. CREs bind ARR1, Dof, DPBF, bHLH112, GATA factors, GT-1, MYB, and WRKY transcription factors, and light-responsive elements were overrepresented in promoters of isoprene-responsive genes; CBF-, HSF-, WUS-binding motifs were underrepresented. Transcription factors corresponding to CREs overrepresented in promoters of isoprene-responsive genes were mainly those important for stress responses: drought-, salt/osmotic-, oxidative-, herbivory/wounding and pathogen-stress. More than half of the isoprene-responsive genes contained at least one binding site for TFs of the class IV (homeodomain leucine zipper) HD-ZIP family, such as GL2, ATML1, PDF2, HDG11, ATHB17. While the HD-zipper-loop-zipper (ZLZ) domain binds to the L1 box of the promoter region, a special domain called the steroidogenic acute regulatory protein-related lipid transfer, or START domain, can bind ligands such as fatty acids (e.g., linolenic and linoleic acid). We tested whether isoprene might bind in such a START domain. Molecular simulations and modeling to test interactions between isoprene and a class IV HD-ZIP family START-domain-containing protein were carried out. Without membrane penetration by the HDG11 START domain, isoprene within the lipid bilayer was inaccessible to this domain, preventing protein interactions with membrane bound isoprene. The cross-talk between isoprene-mediated signaling and other growth regulator and stress signaling pathways, in terms of common CREs and transcription factors could enhance the stability of the isoprene emission trait when it evolves in a plant but so far it has not been possible to say what how isoprene is sensed to initiate signaling responses.

AB  - Background: Medial temporal lobe atrophy has been linked to decline in neuropsychological measures of explicit memory function. While the hippocampus has long been identified as a critical structure in learning and memory processes, less is known about contributions of the amygdala to these functions. We sought to investigate the relationship between amygdala volume and memory functioning in a clinical sample of older adults with and without cognitive impairment. Methods: A serial clinical sample of older adults that underwent neuropsychological assessment at an outpatient neurology clinic was selected for retrospective chart review. Patients were included in the study if they completed a comprehensive neuropsychological assessment within six months of a structural magnetic resonance imaging scan. Regional brain volumes were quantified using Neuroreader (R) software. Associations between bilateral hippocampal and amygdala volumes and memory scores, derived from immediate and delayed recall conditions of a verbal story learning task and a visual design reconstruction task, were examined using mixed-effects general linear models, controlling for total intracranial volume, scanner model, age, sex and education. Partial correlation coefficients, adjusted for these covariates, were calculated to estimate the strength of the association between volumes and memory scores. Results: A total of 68 (39 F, 29 M) participants were included in the analyses, with a mean (SD) adjusted age of 80.1 (6.0) and educational level of 15.9 (2.5) years. Controlling for age, sex, education, and total intracranial volume, greater amygdala volumes were associated with better verbal and visual memory performance, with effect sizes comparable to hippocampal volume. No significant lateralized effects were observed. Partial correlation coefficients ranged from 0.47 to 0.33 (p<.001). Conclusion: These findings contribute to a growing body of knowledge identifying the amygdala as a target for further research in memory functioning. This highlights the importance of considering the broader functioning of the limbic system in which multiple subcortical structures contribute to memory processes and decline in older adults.

AB  - O-hexyl O-2,5-dichlorophenyl phosphoramidate (HDCP) induces delayed neuropathy. The R (+)-HDCP inhibits and caused the so call "aging reaction" on inhibited-NTE. This enantiomer is not hydrolyzed by Ca(II)-dependent A-esterases in mammal tissues but is hydrolyzed by Cu(II)-dependent chicken serum albumin (CSA). With the aim of identifying HDCP hydrolysis by other vertebrate albumins, we incubated albumin with 400 mu M racemic HDCP in the presence of 100 mu M copper sulfate. HDCPase activity was assessed by measurement of HDCP with chiral chromatography. Human, sheep, dog, pig, lamprey or cobra serum albumin did not show a significant activity (-10%). Rabbit and bovine albumins hydrolyzed both enantiomers of HDCP (25% and 50% respectively). Turkey serum albumin had more HDCPase activity (-80 mu M remaining) than the chicken albumin (-150 mu M remaining). No animal albumins other than chicken showed stereoselective hydrolysis. Preincubation of chicken albumin with 1 mM the histidine modifying agents, 100 mu M N-bromosuccinimide (NBS) and Zn(II), inhibited its Cu(II)-dependent R (+)-HDCPase activity, where as other mM amino acids modifiers had no inhibitory effects. . These results confirm that the stereoselective hydrolysis of (+)-HDCP is a specific A-esterase catalytic property of chicken albumin. The higher HDCPase activity by turkey albumin suggests the aminoterminal sequence of avian albumins (DAEHK) is the active center of this Cu(II)-dependent A-esterase activity.

AB  - The endangered plant clay phacelia ( Phacelia argillacea) ) is endemic to Spanish Fork Canyon, Utah, USA. In addition to habitat loss and abiotic stressors, herbivory is one of clay phacelia's major threats, but negative effects of herbivory have not been quantified. To examine the effects of simulated herbivory by small mammals, we grew 300 clay phacelia plants in a greenhouse (20 replicates of 15 half-sibling families). After six months of growth, half of the plants were randomly assigned to a defoliation treatment that mimicked herbivory from ground squirrels. After providing additional time for growth and natural pollination, we collected seeds and harvested shoots and roots from a subset of the plants. Among the 15 half-sibling families, we found significant genetic variation in shoot mass and a significant correlation between total mass when defoliated and undefoliated, suggesting a strong genetic component to growth. Defoliation significantly reduced seed production, shoot production and root production by 29%, 32%, and 35%, respectively. For these traits, interactions between family (F) and defoliation (D) were not statistically significant, suggesting fixation for tolerance to herbivory. In contrast, for root-to-shoot ratio, there was a statistically significant F x D interaction, revealing genetic variation for tolerance to herbivory. Depending on the type, intensity, and timing of herbivory, clay phacelia may benefit from either increased allocation to shoots or to roots. In fact, tolerance in terms of reproduction was correlated with shoot mass when defoliated, while tolerance in terms of growth was correlated with root mass when defoliated.

AB  - BackgroundMales consume more alcohol than females, and alcohol use disorder (AUD) is more prevalent in males than females. However, females progress faster to AUD. Sex differences in neural alcohol cue reactivity were previously observed in young social drinkers, indicating a role of hypersensitivity to alcohol-related cues in very early stages of addiction. To our knowledge, this is the first study on patients diagnosed with AUD to test sex differences in neural reactivity to alcohol cues in order to widen previous findings. MethodsWe analyzed data from previous studies, using a well-established functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) paradigm to compare neural reactivity to alcohol cues between 42 female and 124 male patients with AUD (mean age 45 and 46 years) in predefined regions of interest that were implicated by previous studies (ventral and dorsal striatum as well as caudate, putamen, amygdala, hippocampus, insula, anterior cingulate cortex, and medial prefrontal cortex) using independent samples t-tests. Post-hoc, effect size calculations were performed. ResultsThroughout all nine regions of interest, we found no statistically significant sex differences in neural reactivity toward alcoholic pictures alone or in comparison to neutral pictures (p > 0.05, FDR-corrected). Post-hoc effect size estimates indicated a magnitude between 0.137 and 0.418 (Hedge's g) on alcohol reactivity to alcohol cues compared to neutral cues and indicate very small to less than medium effect sizes in the direction of higher cue reactivity in female patients. ConclusionPrevious studies showed sex differences in neural alcohol cue reactivity in younger social and problematic alcohol drinkers, i.e., stronger striatal cue-reactivity in males. After correction for multiple comparisons, we did not observe significant sex differences in a cohort of middle-aged females and males with AUD. Sex differences that are present during early phases of addiction development might disappear at later stages of AUD and might thus be considered as clinically less relevant in patients with more severe AUD.

AB  - Brassicaceae crops, including Brassica, Camelina and Raphanus species, are among the most economically important crops globally; however, their production is affected by several diseases. To predict cloned disease resistance (R) gene homologs (CDRHs), we used the protein sequences of 49 cloned R genes against fungal and bacterial diseases in Brassicaceae species. In this study, using 20 Brassicaceae genomes (17 wild and 3 domesticated species), 3172 resistance gene analogs (RGAs) (2062 nucleotide binding-site leucine-rich repeats (NLRs), 497 receptor-like protein kinases (RLKs) and 613 receptor-like proteins (RLPs)) were identified. CDRH clusters were also observed in Arabis alpina, Camelina sativa and Cardamine hirsuta with assigned chromosomes, consisting of 62 homogeneous (38 NLR, 17 RLK and 7 RLP clusters) and 10 heterogeneous RGA clusters. This study highlights the prevalence of CDRHs in the wild relatives of the Brassicaceae family, which may lay the foundation for rapid identification of functional genes and genomics-assisted breeding to develop improved disease-resistant Brassicaceae crop cultivars.

AB  - Skeletal muscle fat accumulation, a common complication of obesity, has garnered increasing attention. For livestock animals, intramuscular fat content is a key determinant of meat quality and directly influences consumer preferences for different meat products. However, genes effectively regulating intramuscular and intermuscular fat (IIMF) deposition remain largely unexplored. To address this gap, we employed transcriptome sequencing of muscle from pigs with high and low IIMF contents, uncovering Aldolase C (ALDOC) as a novel key gene controlling IIMF. ALDOC overexpression significantly enhanced the IIMF content both in vivo and in vitro. Mechanistic investigations revealed that ALDOC activates the AKT-mTORC1 axis to promote lipid accumulation in myotubes and intramuscular adipocytes. Notably, the mTORC1 inhibitor rapamycin abrogated ALDOC's proadipogenic effect. Our findings establish ALDOC as a novel key gene regulating IIMF deposition and identify the ALDOC-AKT-mTORC1 signaling pathway as a promising therapeutic target for treating skeletal muscle fat infiltration and improving pork quality.

AB  - Rattus norvegicus and Rattus rattus are commensal pest rodents, considered reservoirs and vectors of zoonotic pathogens. In livestock farms, the wide use of antimicrobials and their release into the environment lead to high long-term residual concentrations, which may in turn lead to the occurrence of antimicrobial resistance (AMR). Farm environments serve as AMR sources, resulting in the transmission of antimicrobial-resistant bacteria and their AMR genes of livestock origin into wildlife. This study aimed to analyse the profile of enterobacteria carrying AMR determinants in rats captured in livestock farms to determine their potential vectors as for the spread of AMR. To this end, 56 rats (52 R. norvegicus and 4 R. rattus) were live-trapped on 11 farms (pig, dairy, poultry and mixed farms) located in central Argentina, from spring 2016 to autumn 2017. From 50 of the R. norvegicus individuals and three of the R. rattus individuals found in 10 of the farms, we isolated 53 Escherichia coli and five Salmonella strains. Susceptibility to antimicrobials, genotypic profiles, minimal inhibitory concentration of colistin and the presence of mcr-1 and genes encoding extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) were determined. Of the 58 isolates not susceptible to different antimicrobial classes, 28 of the E. coli strains and two of the Salmonella strains were defined as multi-drug resistant (MDR). S. Westhampton and S. Newport recovered were not susceptible to ampicillin or all the cephems tested. One of the E. coli obtained showed resistance to colistin and harboured the mcr-1 gene, demonstrated by PCR and conjugation. In two ESBL-producing Salmonella isolated from rats, CTX-M-2 genes were responsible for the observed resistance to third-generation cephalosporins. The MDR E. coli isolates showed several different resistance patterns (23), although some of them were the same in different individuals and different farms, with six resistance patterns, evidencing the dispersion of strains. These findings suggest that rats play a role in the dissemination of AMR determinants between animal, humans and environmental reservoirs.

AB  - This study presents the development of a novel membrane-based absorbent by incorporating Mimosa pudica hydrogel (MPH) powder, derived from the mucilage of its seeds, into a cellulose acetate polymer matrix using the non-solvent induced phase separation (NIPS) method. The membranes were prepared with varying weight percentages (wt%) of MPH to evaluate their potential as absorbent cores for hygiene products. The enhanced absorbency observed for 1 wt% MPH-loaded cellulose acetate membrane (MCA-2) was attributed to the MPH powder's large surface area and macroporous structure, as confirmed by Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) analysis. The MCA-2 membrane exhibited maximum absorbency values of 276.66%, 402.87%, and 572.5% in distilled water, 0.9 wt% saline solution, and defibrinated sheep blood, respectively, within 30 minutes along with an absorbency under load value of 439.69% in saline solution at 60 minutes. An in-depth analysis of the thermal, mechanical, morphological and topographical properties of the developed membrane was conducted. This exhibited a modulus value of approximately 120 +/- 0.5 MPa with 13.07 +/- 0.2% elongation and also possessed significant antibacterial properties against E. coli and S. aureus bacteria justifying its potential as an absorbent core. Additionally, 16S rRNA sequencing was performed to identify bacteria involved in soil burial degradation, highlighting its overall impact and sustainability towards the environment. These findings suggest that MPH-incorporated membranes hold significant promise as absorbent materials in female hygiene applications.

AB  - Carbon dots (CDs) are carbon-based zero-dimensional nanomaterials that can be prepared from a number of organic precursors. In this research, they are prepared using fat-free UHT cow milk through the hydrothermal method. FTIR analysis shows C=O and C-H bond presence, as well as nitrogen-based bond like C-N, C=N and -NH2 presence in CDs, while the absorption spectra show the absorption band at 280 +/- 3 nm. Next, the Biuret test was performed, with the results showing no presence of unreacted proteins in CDs. It can be said that all proteins are converted in CDs. Photo luminance spectra shows the emission of CDs is 420 nm and a toxicity study of CDs was performed. The Presto Blue method was used to test the toxicity of CDs for murine hippocampal cells. CDs at a concentration of 4 mg/mL were hazardous independent of synthesis time, while the toxicity was higher for lower synthesis times of 1 and 2 h. When the concentration is reduced in 1 and 2 h synthesized CDs, the cytotoxic effect also decreases significantly, ensuring a survival rate of 60-80%. However, when the synthesis time of CDs is increased, the cytotoxic effect decreases to a lesser extent. The CDs with the highest synthesis time of 8 h do not show a cytotoxic effect above 60%. The cytotoxicity study shows that CDs may have a concentration and time-dependent cytotoxic effect, reducing the number of viable cells by 40%.

AB  - Male reproductive diseases are becoming increasingly prominent, and sperm quality is an important indicator to reflect these diseases. Seminal plasma extracellular vesicles (SPEVs) are involved in sperm motility. However, their effects on sperm remain unclear. Here, we identified 222 differentially expressed circRNAs in SPEVs between boars with high or low sperm motility. We found that circ-CREBBP promoted sperm motility and inhibited sperm apoptosis by sponging miR-10384 and miR-143-3p. In addition, miR-10384 and miR-143-3p can regulate the expression of MCL1, CREB1 and CREBBP. Furthermore, we demonstrated that MCL1 interacted directly with BAX and that CREBBP interacted with CREB1 in sperm. We showed that inhibition of circ-CREBBP can reduce the expression of MCL1, CREB1 and CREBBP and increase the expression of BAX and CASP3, thus promoting sperm apoptosis. Our results suggest that circ-CREBBP may be a promising biomarker and therapeutic target for male reproductive diseases.

AB  - We have used whole genome sequencing (WGS) to determine mutational signatures induced in the T-cells of rats treated in vivo with N-propyl-N-nitrosourea (PNU) or procarbazine (PCZ). The signatures from the treated rats were different from the signature of background mutations. The main component of the spontaneous T-cell mutational signature was C -> T transition with all other single base substitutions evenly distributed. The PNU-induced mutational signature showed relatively equal contributions from C -> T and T -> C transitions, and T -> A transversions. The PCZ-induced signature was characterized by T -> C transitions, T -> A and, to a smaller extent, T -> G transversions. C -> G transversions were infrequent in either the PNU or PCZ signatures. WGS not only allowed mutational signature detection, but also measured quantitative responses to mutagen treatment: 10-40X increases in the number of mutations per clone were detected in T-cell clones from treated rats. The overall strand specificity of induced mutations for annotated rat genes was comparable to the strand specificity of mutations determined previously for the endogenous X-linked Pig-a gene. Our results provide valuable reference data for future applications of WGS in safety research and risk assessment.

AB  - We focused on Piper longum L., a herbal drug produced in Myanmar, which has a renoprotective effect. Thus, we attempted to isolate and identify compounds that enhance the expression of the ABCG2 gene from the aerial parts of the plant except for the fruit. Among the various P. longum extracts, we isolated and identified the components. Using Caco-2 cells, the hABCG2 mRNA expression-enhancing effects of the isolated compounds were compared with the positive reference compound (3-methylcholanthrene [3MC]) using real-time polymerase chain reaction. Six compounds were isolated and identified from the methanol extract of P. longum. Among the isolated compounds, licarin A and neopomatene had lower toxicity and higher hABCG2 mRNA expression-enhancing effects in Caco-2 cells. Suppression of hAhR expression by siRNA reduced the activity of licarin A and neopomatene, as well as the hAhR agonist 3MC, suggesting that these 2 compounds may act as hAhR agonists to promote hABCG2 expression.
   Graphical Abstract Six compounds were isolated and identified from the aerial parts of Piper longum, and their promotion effects for ABCG2 mRNA expression were examined.

AB  - Several studies suggest poorer episodic memory among adults with overweight (OW) relative to those with healthy weight (HW); however, few have used food stimuli. To understand the salience of food-related items when assessing memory, we adapted an episodic memory task, by replacing some non-food words with snack foods. Participants were 96 weight-loss seeking adults with OW compared to 48 adults with HW from the community matched on age, gender, ethnicity, and education. Overall memory ability was similar, although a trend showed the adults with HW performed better than adults with OW on immediate recall (d = 0.32, p = 0.07). However, there were clear differences in the use of learning strategies. Adults with HW utilized sematic clustering more effectively than adults with OW during all test phases (ds = 0.44-0.62; ps <= 0.01). Adults with HW also utilized serial clustering more effectively (d = 0.51; p < 0.01). Adults with HW showed better semantic clustering for both food and non-food words during immediate and short delay recall (ds = 0.42-0.78; ps <= 0.01) but semantic clustering was only better for the non-food category at long delay (d = 0.55; p < 0.01). These results show that adults with OW utilized less efficient learning strategies throughout the task and food-related content may impact learning. Clinically, these findings may suggest that weight-loss treatments should consider incor-porating the teaching of learning and memory strategies to help increase utilization of new skills.

AB  - Avaluating ingestive behavior is crucial for making decisions about animal management; however, direct observation can be laborious, time-consuming, and exhaustive for the observer. In this context, the development of measurement devices coupled with computational methods to reliably discriminate animal behavior and identify an appropriate sampling frequency for battery autonomy without compromising precision is important. This study aimed to develop an electronic device for discriminating ingestive behavior in sheep using a triaxial accelerometer and machine learning, considering different sampling frequencies and classification models. The analyzed sampling frequencies were 1, 0.2, 0.1, 0.067, and 0.05 Hz, validated in 18 sheep. The electronic device successfully distinguished feeding, rumination, and other behaviors. The highest values in the results for ingestive behavior classification were achieved by the Random Forest model with and without variable selection, with accuracies ranging from 85.2 to 88.6 %, Kappa indices from 0.78 to 0.83, and false -positive rates from 5.4 to 7.2. Furthermore, the best -performing model differentiated feeding, rumination, and other behaviors with sensitivities ranging from 85.70 to 88.33 % and specificities from 92.71 to 94.11 %. Sampling frequencies of 1, 0.2, 0.1, and 0.05 Hz showed statistically similar means (p < 0.05) for the average error between observed and device -recorded data, ranging from 1.50 to 2.82 min/hour for feeding behavior, 4.61 to 6.10 min/hour for rumination behavior, and 2.43 to 3.60 min/hour for other behaviors. Therefore, the developed electronic device successfully discriminated ingestive behavior in sheep using a triaxial accelerometer and machine learning. Additionally, the 0.05 Hz sampling frequency yielded good results, indicating its potential to reduce device energy consumption without compromising precision in assessing feeding, rumination, and other behaviors.

AB  - The pregnancy disorder preeclampsia (PE) is characterized by maternal hypertension, increased level of circulating antiangiogenic soluble fms-like tyrosine kinase-1 (sFLT1), and reduced placental perfusion, leading to foetal growth restriction (FGR) and preterm birth. All these adverse effects are associated with neurocognitive disorders in the offspring. However, the direct interplay between increased antiangiogenesis during PE and disturbed foetal brain development independent of prematurity has not been investigated yet. To examine foetal brain development in sFLT1-related PE, hsFLT1/rtTA-transgenic mice with systemic (maternal or maternal/fetoplacental) human sFLT1 (hsFLT1) overexpression since 10.5 days postconception (dpc) were used, and histological and molecular analyses of foetal brains were performed at 18.5 dpc. Consequences of elevated hsFLT1 on placental/foetal vascularization and hypoxia of placentas and foetal brains were analysed using the hypoxia markers pimonidazole and hemeoxygenase-1 (HO-1). Immunohistochemical analysis revealed increased hypoxia in placentas of PE-affected pregnancies. Moreover, an increase in HO-1 expression was observed upon elevated hsFLT1 in placentas and foetal brains. PE foetuses revealed asymmetrical FGR by increased brain/liver weight ratio. The brain volume was reduced combined with a reduction in the cortical/hippocampal area and an increase of the caudate putamen and its neuroepithelium, which was associated with a reduced cell density in the cortex and increased cell density in the caudate putamen upon hsFLT1 overexpression. Mild influences were observed on brain vasculature shown by free iron deposits and mRNA changes in Vegf signalling. Of note, both types of systemic hsFLT1 overexpression (indirect: maternal or direct: maternal/fetoplacental) revealed similar changes with increasing severity of impaired foetal brain development. Overall, circulating hsFLT1 in PE pregnancies impaired uteroplacental perfusion leading to disturbed foetal oxygenation and brain injury. This might be associated with a disturbed cell migration from the caudate putamen neuroepithelium to the cortex which could be due to disturbed cerebrovascular adaption.

AB  - Long-term neurodevelopmental disorders following neonatal anesthesia have been reported both in young animals and in children. The activation of transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 (TRPV1) channels in hippocampus adversely affects neurodevelopment. The current study explored the underlying mechanism of TRPV1 channels on long-lasting cognitive dysfunction induced by anesthetic exposure to the developing brain. we demonstrated that TRPV1 expression was increased after sevoflurane exposure both in vitro and in vivo. Sevoflurane exposure to hippocampal neurons decreased the synaptic density and the surface GluA1 expression, as well as increased co-localization of internalized AMPAR in early and recycling endosomes. Sevoflurane exposure to newborn mice impaired learning and memory in adulthood, and reduced AMPAR subunit GluA1, 2 and 3 expressions in the crude synaptosomal fractions from mouse hippocampus. The inhibition of TRPV1 reversed the phenotypic changes induced by sevoflurane. Moreover, sevoflurane exposure increased Src phosphorylation at tyrosine 416 site thereby reducing cofilin phosphorylation. TRPV1 blockade reversed these suppressive effects of sevoflurane. Our data suggested that TRPV1 antagonist may protect against synaptic damage and cognitive dysfunction induced by sevoflurane exposure during the brain developing stage.

AB  - Chronic aluminium(Al) exposure can affect the antioxidant and glutaminergic systems through N-methyl-Daspartate receptors (NMDAR). This study was aimed to investigate the neurotoxic effect of Al through different mechanisms in rat hippocampus and to evaluate the protective role of epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG), a wellknown antioxidant, with simultaneous administration of Al,as well as post-treatment after Al exposure.For this purpose, aluminum chloride(AlCl3) was administered simultaneously with two different EGCG doses for 8 weeks as the first part of the study.In the second part of the study, after 4 weeks of AlCl3 pre-administration, two different EGCG doses were also administered during four additional weeks as post-treatment.Al administration led to oxidative stress and increased acetylcholinesterase levels.NMDAR subunit mRNA expressions were downregulated by Al, which was apparent in NMDAR1/2B subunits.Simultaneous EGCG treatment has shown a better neuroprotective effect in terms of these mechanisms and represents novel approach for the prevention of neurodegenerative diseases likely to be induced by Al.

AB  - Polystyrene nanoplastic(PS-NP) can originate from sources such as plastic waste and industrial wastewater and have been shown to have deleterious effects on abnormal neurobehaviors. However, evidence regarding the health impacts, biological mechanisms, and treatment strategies underlying developmental exposure to low dose PS-NP is still lacking. This study aimed to fill this knowledge gap by administering low doses of PS-NP(50 and 100 mu g/L) to weaning rats for 4 consecutive weeks. Behavioral and morphological experiments were performed to evaluate hippocampal damage, and transcriptomics and Assay for Transposase Accessible Chromatin with hight-throughput sequencing(ATAC) analyses were conducted to identify potential key targets. Additionally, Connectivity Map(CMap) database, Limited proteolysis-mass spectrometry(LiP-SMap), and molecular-protein docking were used to examine potential phytochemicals with therapeutic effects on key targets. The results indicated that developmental exposure to PS-NP can induce hippocampal impairment and aberrant neurobehaviors in adulthood. Multi-omics analyses consistently showed that apoptosis-related signaling pathways were sensitive to PS-NP exposure, and mitogen-activated protein kinase 3(Mapk3) was identified as the core gene by the gene network, which was further validated in vitro experiments. The CMap database provided a series of phytochemicals that might regulate Mapk3 expression, and trihydroxy-phenolacetone(THP) was found to have directly binding sites with Mapk3 through LiP-SMap and molecular docking analysis. Furthermore, THP administration could significantly alleviate apoptosis induced by PS-NP exposure in primary hippocampal cells through down-regulation of Mapk3. These findings suggested that developmental exposure to PS-NP has adverse effects on cognitive function and that THP can alleviate these effects by directly binding to Mapk3.

AB  - The massive amount of water-soluble urea used leads to nutrient loss and environmental pollution in both water and soil. The aim of this study was to develop a novel lignin-based slow-release envelope material that has essential nitrogen and sulfur elements for plants. After the amination reaction with a hydrolysate of yak hair keratin, the coating formulation was obtained by adding different loadings (2, 5, 8, 14 wt%) of aminated lignin (AL) to 5% polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) solution. These formulations were cast into films and characterized for their structure, thermal stability, and mechanical and physicochemical properties. The results showed that the PVA-AL (8%) formulation had good physical and chemical properties in terms of water absorption and mechanical properties, and it showed good degradation in soil with 51% weight loss after 45 days. It is suitable for use as a coating material for fertilizers. Through high-pressure spraying technology, enveloped urea particles with a PVA-AL (8%) solution were obtained, which showed good morphology and slow-release performance. Compared with urea, the highest urea release was only 96.4% after 30 days, conforming to Higuchi model, Ritger-Peppas model, and second-order dynamic model. The continuous nitrogen supply of PVA-AL coated urea to Brassica napus was verified by potting experiments. Therefore, the lignin-based composite can be used as a coating material to produce a new slow-release nitrogen fertilizer for sustainable crop production.

AB  - Episodic memory involves binding stimuli and/or events together in time and place. Furthermore, memories become more complex when new experiences influence the meaning of stimuli within the original memory. Thus collectively, complex episodic memory formation and maintenance involves processes such as encoding, storage, retrieval, updating and reconsolidation, which can be studied using animal models of higher-order conditioning. In the present study aversive and appetitive sensory preconditioning paradigms were used to test the hypothesis that the postrhinal cortex (POR), which is a component of the hippocampal memory system, is involved in higher-order conditioning. Drawing on the known role of the POR in contextual learning, Experiment 1 employed a four-phase sensory preconditioning task that involved fear learning and context discrimination in rats with or without permanent lesions of the POR. In parallel, to examine POR function during higher-order conditioning in the absence of a particular spatial arrangement, Experiments 2 and 3 used a three-phase sensory preconditioning paradigm involving phasic stimuli. In Experiment 2, bilateral lesions of the POR were made and in Experiment 3, a chemogenetic approach was used to temporarily inactivate POR neurons during each phase of the paradigm. Evidence of successful sensory preconditioning was observed in sham rats which, during the critical context discrimination test, demonstrated higher levels of freezing behavior when re-exposed to the paired versus the unpaired context, whereas POR-lesioned rats did not. Data from the appetitive sensory preconditioning paradigm also confirmed the hypothesis in that during the critical auditory discrimination test, sham rats showed greater food cup responding following presentations of the paired compared to the unpaired auditory stimulus, whereas POR-lesioned rats did not. Lastly, in Experiment 3, when the POR was inactivated only during preconditioning or only during conditioning, discrimination during the critical auditory test was impaired. Thus, regardless of whether stimulus-stimulus associations were formed between static or phasic stimuli or whether revaluation of the paired stimulus occurred through association with an aversive or an appetitive unconditioned stimulus, the effects were the same; POR lesions disrupted the ability to use higher-order conditioned stimuli to guide prospective behavior.

AB  - Permethrin (PERM) is a member of the class I family of synthetic pyrethroids. Human use has shown that it affects different systems, with wide health dysfunctions. Our aim was to determine bioenergetics, neuroinflammation and morphology changes, as redox markers after subacute exposure to PERM in rats. We used MDA determination, protein carbonyl assay, mitochondrial O-2 consumption, expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines and a deep histopathological analysis of the hippocampus. PERM (150 mg/kg and 300 mg/kg body weight/day, o.v.) increased lipoperoxidation and carbonylated proteins in a dose-dependent manner in the brain regions. The activities of antioxidant enzymes glutathione peroxidase, reductase, S-transferase, catalase, and superoxide dismutase showed an increase in all the different brain areas, with dose-dependent effects in the cerebellum. Cytokine profiles (IL-1 beta, IL-6 and TNF-alpha) increased in a dose-dependent manner in different brain tissues. Exposure to 150 mg/kg of permethrin induced degenerated and/or dead neurons in the rat hippocampus and induced mitochondrial uncoupling and reduction of oxidative phosphorylation and significantly decreased the respiratory parameters state 3-associated respiration in complex I and II. PERM exposure at low doses induces reactive oxygen species production and imbalance in the enzymatic antioxidant system, increases gene expression of pro-inflammatory interleukins, and could lead to cell damage mediated by mitochondrial functional impairment.

AB  - Seasonal reproduction in sheep reduces reproductive efficiency. Melatonin (MT) plays a crucial role in reproductive processes. The purpose of this study was to assess the effects of a 5-day MT implant pretreatment on estrus synchronization and reproductive performance in sheep during seasonal anestrus. A total of 40 multiparous Mongolian sheep were selected and randomly divided into two groups. In the MT group (n = 20), the ewes received an MT implant for 5 days, and then, they were given a progesterone (P4)-containing vaginal sponge for 14 days with equine chorionic gonadotropin (eCG) administered (330 I.U. per ewe; I.M.) at sponge removal. Control (CON) ewes (n = 20) were similarly treated but did not receive MT implants. The results demonstrated that MT implantation significantly improved serum levels of total antioxidant capacity (T-AOC), superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), glutathione (GSH), and glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px), increased post-ovulatory luteal diameter and serum P4 levels, and reduced ovarian apoptosis. Compared with the CON group, the MT group showed significantly higher pregnancy (68.23% vs. 50.59%) and lambing rates (63.53% vs. 47.06%; number of lambed ewes/number of total ewes) following cervical-timed artificial insemination. Ovarian transcriptome analysis revealed 522 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in the MT group compared with the CON group, including 355 upregulated and 167 downregulated DEGs. In addition, MT significantly enhanced proliferation and inhibited apoptosis in cultured granulosa cells (GCs) and luteal cells (LCs) in vitro. Moreover, it enhanced the antioxidant capacity of GCs and LCs probably by activating the NRF2 signaling pathway as well as stimulating steroid hormone synthesis. In conclusion, MT implantation 5 days before applying the conventional P4-eCG protocol enhances ovine reproductive outcomes during seasonal anestrus. MT implantation has a beneficial role on the growth and function of ovarian cells. These findings offer novel evidence supporting the functional role of MT in mammalian reproduction, and would be informative for optimizing estrus synchronization in sheep.

AB  - BackgroundPsychotherapeutic memory plays an important role in maintaining therapeutic effects; however, the neural mechanisms of therapeutic metaphor promoting long-term memory were still unknown.ObjectiveThis study used metaphorical micro-counseling dialog scenarios to investigate the memory effect of therapeutic metaphor and correlated neural mechanisms.MethodsAt first, 31 participants read a mental distress problem, followed by a metaphorical or a literal solution, while undergoing functional magnetic resonance imaging scanning during the encoding phase. One week later, a recognition memory test was performed outside the scanner.ResultsThe results revealed that metaphorical solutions were associated with higher insight experiences and better memory performance than literal solutions. Greater activations were observed in the multiple memory systems, including episodic (parahippocampal gyrus, hippocampus, and thalamus), emotional (amygdala), and procedural/implicit (caudate, putamen, and cerebellum), in contrast to later remembered versus later forgotten based on the gap between metaphorical and literal solutions. Insightfulness and activities of the hippocampus, caudate, and cerebellum could predict memory performance.ConclusionsThese findings indicated that multiple memory systems are involved in successful memory encoding of therapeutic metaphors; this suggested that incorporating metaphors into psychotherapy practices could lead to better retention of therapeutic information and improve clinical outcomes compared to literal psychotherapy.

AB  - Understanding the impact of microstructure on corrosion rates can aid the development of corrosionresistant alloys for molten salt reactors. In this work, we develop an electrochemical phase-field model for capturing the microstructure-dependent corrosion of structural alloys by molten salts. As a demonstration problem, we apply this model to capture the selective depletion of Cr from Ni-Cr grain boundaries during corrosion in molten FLiBe salt. We perform sensitivity analysis and model verification on 1D simulations to confirm that the model predicts diffusion-limited kinetics. The model is validated using 1D, 2D, and 3D simulations against experimental data for Ni-5Cr and Ni-20Cr corrosion in molten FLiBe. The 1D simulations predict the corrosion behavior with reasonable accuracy when using an effective diffusion coefficient that accurately represents the grain boundary diffusion. 2D simulations that represent the grain structure underpredict the corrosion. 3D simulations that represent the grain structure predict the corrosion with reasonable accuracy. The corrosion rate predicted by the 3D simulations is proportional to the average grain size at the alloy/salt interface.

AB  - Retrograde signaling at the synapse is a fundamental way by which neurons communicate and neuronal circuit function is fine-tuned upon activity. While long-term changes in neurotransmitter release commonly rely on retrograde signaling, the mechanisms remain poorly understood. Here, we identified adenosine/A2A 2A receptor (A2AR) 2A R) as a retrograde signaling pathway underlying presynaptic long-term potentiation (LTP) at a hippocampal excitatory circuit critically involved in memory and epilepsy. Transient burst activity of a single dentate granule cell induced LTP of mossy cell synaptic inputs, a BDNF/TrkB-dependent form of plasticity that facilitates seizures. Postsynaptic TrkB activation released adenosine from granule cells, uncovering a non-conventional BDNF/TrkB signaling mechanism. Moreover, presynaptic A2ARs 2A Rs were necessary and sufficient for LTP. Lastly, seizure induction released adenosine in a TrkB-dependent manner, while removing A2ARs 2A Rs or TrkB from the dentate gyrus had anti-convulsant effects. By mediating presynaptic LTP, adenosine/A2AR 2A R retrograde signaling may modulate dentate gyrus-dependent learning and promote epileptic activity.

AB  - Ethnopharmacological relevance: Velvet antler (VAE) is a famous traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), which has been used for thousands of years to treat bone-related diseases. Nonetheless, whether VAE has anti-diabetic osteoporosis (DOP) properties remains to be elucidated. Aim of the study: The therapeutic mechanism of VAE on DOP is based on integrated proteomics of network pharmacology strategies to study related targets and pathways. Materials and methods: Liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC/MS) was used to analyze the main molecular components present in the VAE. The DOP mouse model was created by combining a high-fat diet with streptozotocin (STZ). High glucose (HG) induced MC3T3-E1 cells were used as a cell model to evaluate the therapeutic effect of VAE. The mechanisms of VAE in treating DOP were predicted through proteomics. Molecular docking, molecular dynamics simulations, DARTS and functional experiments were employed to further verify its mechanisms. Results: Altogether 30 components were identified by LC-MS. In vitro and in vivo results were confirmed that VAE had a protective effect on DOP. Combined with network pharmacology, proteomics and functional experiments revealed that TNF/PI3K-AKT signaling pathway may be the potential biochemical pathway for VAE in treating DOP. Conclusions: The innovation of this study was investigating the effectiveness of VAE in treating DOP in vivo and in vitro and suggested that VAE might exert anti-DOP effects through the TNF/PI3K-AKT signaling pathway by network pharmacology and proteomics and found that ATK1 was the core target of VAE, which provided valuable insights for the clinical application of VAE in DOP.

AB  - Liaoning cashmere goat (LCG) is characterized by the highest individual cashmere yield, but its cashmere fineness tends to be coarse. Therefore, our research primarily focuses on reducing cashmere fineness. Through lipidomics screening and identification, we identified the crucial functional genes FA2H and ELOVL3 associated with cashmere fineness. Subsequently, using PCR-seq, we conducted gene typing and SNP analysis on the experimental population DNA, In the FA2H gene, a SNP locus T42443G was detected in LCG buck, with the TT genotype showing advantageous traits in cashmere fineness, meat quality, and body size, while the TG genotype demonstrated advantages in slaughter performance,In LCG doe, the TG genotype shows advantageous traits in cashmere fineness, milk production, and meat quality, while the TT genotype exhibits advantages in slaughter performance, lambing, and body size. In the ELOVL3 gene, a SNP locus C2133A was identified in LCG buck, where the CC genotype was advantageous for cashmere fineness, Only CA genotype was found in slaughter and meat quality. Additionally, and the CA genotype showed superiority in body size. On LCG doe, The CC genotype was the advantageous genotype in terms of cashmere fineness, milk production, slaughter performance, and meat quality. The CA genotype was the advantageous genotype in terms of lambing and body size. The dominant genotypes identified to influence both doe cashmere fineness and slaughter performance were TT and CC. The identified dominant haplotype combination for cashmere production performance in LCG was CCTG. The dominant haplotype combination for doe slaughter performance was the CCTT haplotype combination. The dominant haplotype combination for buck slaughter performance was the CATG haplotype combination. Therefore, the TT genotype of the FA2H gene and the CC genotype of the ELOVL3 gene in LCG buck, and the TG genotype of the FA2H gene and the CC genotype of the ELOVL3 gene in doe can be used as molecular markers for assisted selection of cashmere fineness. CCTG haplotype combination was the superior haplotype combinations for cashmere production performance. To provide a theoretical basis for the breeding and expansion of fine-fiber type new strains of LCG.

AB  - Arsenic is a neurotoxin associated with cognitive impairment following long-term exposure, while Neurotrophin-3 (NT-3) is essential for the survival and development of neurons. This study aims to explore the protective effects of NT-3 on arsenic-caused cognitive impairment and neuronal damage, as well as clarify the underlying mechanisms. In vivo and in vitro results indicated that sodium arsenite impaired cognitive function, reduced neuronal density, and induced apoptosis, which was accompanied by the down-regulation of NT-3 and the PI3K/ AKT pathway. Overexpression of NT-3 in HT-22 cells mitigated apoptosis triggered by arsenic and partially restored PI3K/AKT pathway activity. Thus, our findings suggest that NT-3 may counteract the arsenic neurotoxicity by activating PI3K/AKT.

AB  - Within the mammalian pallium, layered structures, such as the six-layered isocortex and the three-layered hippocampal formation, are crucial for integrating sensory cues from the environment and for forming and recalling memories. Similar layered pallial systems have also been shown in avian and non-avian reptiles. Despite sharing similar needs for processing external information and remembering important sites, teleosts have generally not evolved such defined layered organizations in their dorsal telencephalon. One exception is gobiiform fishes in which a subregion of the dorsal telencephalon is organized into several fiber-rich and soma-dense layered subregions. We investigated the connectivity of these layered subregions (referred to as the dorsal telencephalic area X, Dx), as well as the connectivity of the medial (Dm) and dorsolateral (dDl) parts of the dorsal telencephalon through tracer injections. We found that extratelencephalic projections reach Dm, Dx, and dDl from different regions within the preglomerular complex (PG): Dm receives input from different PG regions: PG region 1 (PG1), PG region 2 (PG2), and the commissural PG (PGc), but not from the nucleus prethalamicus (PTh). In contrast, both Dx and dDl receive projections from the lateral PTh (PTh-l) and the medial PTh (PTh-m). We find that projections to dDl come from more ventral regions of PTh-m than those that project to Dx. The majority of ascending connections could be found within the telencephalon itself, with each of the telencephalic zones receiving its own distinct pattern of intratelencephalic afferent connectivity. From our results, we conclude that Dm and Dx constitute two distinct zones of the dorsal telencephalon.

AB  - Tea plant [Camellia sinensis (L.) O. Kuntze] is one of the important foliar cash crops in China, and its root system absorbs heavy metal (HM) elements enriched in the soil and transports them to the over ground part. In order to ensure the safety of the soil ecological environment and tea raw materials in the tea production area, the HM contents of soil and tea plant leaves in Suzhou tea plantations were detected, the relationship between HMs and soil physicochemical properties was analyzed, and the ecological risk of HMs in tea plantation soils was evaluated by using relevant detection techniques and evaluation models. The results showed that the average pH of tea plantation soils around Tai Lake in Suzhou was within the range suitable for the growth of tea plants. The pH, soil organic matter, total nitrogen, available phosphorus and available potassium of tea plantation soil satisfying the requirements of high quality, high efficiency and high yield ('3H') tea plantation accounted for 47.06%, 26.47%, 8.82%, 79.41% and 67.65%, respectively. Site 2 fully met the requirements of '3H' tea plantation. In addition, the contents of cadmium (Cd) and mercury (Hg) were extremely variable, and the average contents exceeded the background value of soil in Jiangsu Province, but the HM contents of tea leaves all met the pollution-free standard, and the HM contents of tea leaves around Tai Lake in Suzhou were generally at a safe level. The composite ecological risk index ranged from 0.05 to 0.60, and 32 of the 34 sample sites (except site 21 and site 23) are the most suitable agricultural land for tea plantations.

AB  - Novel coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) has affected the people's health, their lifestyle and economical status across the globe. The application of advanced Artificial Intelligence (AI) methods in combination with radiological imaging is useful in accurate detection of the disease. It also assists the physicians to take care of remote villages too. The current research paper proposes a novel automated COVID-19 analysis method with the help of Optimal Hybrid Feature Extraction (OHFE) and Optimal Deep Neural Network (ODNN) called OHFE-ODNN from chest x-ray images. The objective of the presented technique is for performing binary and multi-class classification of COVID-19 analysis from chest X-ray image. The presented OHFE-ODNN method includes a sequence of procedures such as Median Filtering (MF)-based pre-processed, feature extraction and finally, binary (COVID/Non-COVID) and multiclass (Normal, COVID, SARS) classification. Besides, in OHFE-based feature extraction, Gray Level Co-occurrence Matrix (GLCM) and Histogram of Gradients (HOG) are integrated together. The presented OHFE-ODNN model includes Squirrel Search Algorithm (SSA) for fine-tuning the parameters of DNN. The performance of the presented OHFE-ODNN technique is conducted using chest x-rays dataset. The presented OHFE-ODNN method classified the binary classes effectively with a maximum precision of 95.82%, accuracy of 94.01% and F-score of 96.61%. Besides, multiple classes were classified proficiently by OHFE-ODNN model with a precision of 95.63%, accuracy of 95.60% and an F-score of 95.73%.

AB  - Cyanogenic plants can release toxic hydrogen cyanide (HCN) to defend against herbivory by hydrolyzing the cyanogenic glycosides (CNGs) with its (3-glucosidases ((3-GLUs). Numerous studies have speculated this CNGmediated toxicity by a plant-pest interaction manner. However, the specific toxic effect of HCN was not welldemonstrated because of the interference of other ingested metabolites. Additionally, the physiological- and biochemical-based mode of action of HCN were seldom determined. To fill those knowledge gaps, the twospotted spider mite (TSSM), Tetranychus urticae, was used as a model organism to elucidate the toxic mechanism of HCN. In addition, three CNG-enzyme combinations were screened for effective cyanogenesis and TSSM lethality. Linamarin-(3-GLU (lima bean-derived) presented prompt HCN release, and molecular docking indicated higher binding energy and more robust binding sites compared with other two groups, i.e., lotaustralin-(3-GLU (lima bean-derived) and amygdalin-(3-GLU (almond-derived). Meanwhile, this combination led to higher TSSM mortality. Moreover, we found that the median lethal concentration of this combination will significantly prolong the developmental duration, and decrease the longevity and fecundity of TSSM. Besides, the population growth was also significantly suppressed. Furthermore, the sustainable activation of enzyme activity and the encoding gene expression related to physiological process such as detoxification (cytochrome P450, glutathione S-transferase, UDP-glucuronosyltransferase and (3-cyanoalanine synthase), antioxidation (superoxide dismutase, catalase and peroxidase), neural transduction (acetylcholinesterase) and respiration (cytochrome c oxidase) were attributed to the detrimental impact on development and reproduction of TSSM. The present findings can provide insight regarding reasonable utilization of toxic chemicals in pest management and creation of novel pestresistant germplasm.

AB  - The expression of Cry proteins in genetically modified rice varieties safeguards the crop from lepidopteran pests. These proteins have the potential to be transferred through the food chain to arthropods like planthoppers and predatory spiders, triggering defensive responses in these unintended organisms. Hence, we hypothesized that Cry protein might influence the growth and development of spiders by altering protective enzyme activities. The results showed that CrylAb protein could accumulate in tissues and subcellular organelles of Pardosa pseudoannulata from Nilaparvata lugens. CrylAb protein exposure prolonged the developmental duration in the 5th and 7th instar spiderlings but induced no alterations of other growth indicators, such as body length, median ocular area, and survival rate. In addition, CrylAb protein exerted no adverse impacts on several detoxifying enzymes (i.e., superoxide dismutase, catalase, glutathione peroxidase, and acetylcholine esterase) in muscle, midgut, ganglia, and hemolymph at subcellular components (i.e., microsome and cytoplasm). To further explore the effects of CrylAb protein on the spiderlings, we performed an integrated transcriptome analysis on spiderlings exposed to CrylAb protein. The results showed that CrylAb protein might prolong the development duration of P. pseudoannzdata via the altered cuticle metabolism (e.g., chitin metabolic process and structural constituent of cuticle). In addition, the gene expression profile associated with detoxifying enzymes and three stress-responsive pathways (JAK/STAT, JNK/SAPK, and Hippo pathways) also displayed no significant alterations under CrylAb exposure. Collectively, this integrated analysis generates multidimensional insights to assess the effects of CrylAb protein on non-target spiders and demonstrates that CrylAb protein exerts no toxicity in P. pseudoannulata.

AB  - Simple Summary We collected Lepidoptera (Phoebis spp., Pieridae) from native and exotic legume hostplants (species of Senna) over several years, rearing them to test the hypothesis that caterpillars on native hostplants would be parasitized more frequently than those on exotic hostplants. Our findings were the opposite of our prediction: greater rates of parasitization occurred on Pieridae using exotic hostplants.Abstract Are parasitoids less likely to find their Lepidoptera hosts on non-native hostplants than native hostplants? We predicted that with longer periods of coevolution between herbivores and the plants they consume, the parasitoids that provide top-down control would be more attuned to finding their hosts on native plants. To test this hypothesis, we collected immature stages of sulfur butterflies (the cloudless sulfur (Phoebis sennae) and the orange-barred sulfur (Phoebis agarithe) over a three-year period (2008-2011) from native and ornamental hostplants in the genus Senna in three different parts of the urban landscape of Miami, Florida, USA. We reared the immature specimens to pupation and either eclosion of adults or emergence of parasitoids and compared the levels of parasitization among the three areas, and among native vs. exotic hostplants. We found, contrary to our prediction, that caterpillars feeding on non-native leguminous hostplant species were more likely to be parasitized than those feeding on native hostplants. We discuss this surprising finding in the light of recent findings in other plant/herbivore/parasitoid systems.

AB  - Concerns regarding the welfare of farm animals continue to grow. Traditionally, research efforts have largely focused on refining existing management practices to improve welfare. However, the incorporation of views from those directly involved in animal care is equally, if not more, important. This study investigated the perspectives of Canadian dairy farmers on animal welfare. We conducted 16 interviews with a total of 22 participants from four provinces across Canada. Recorded audio files and field notes were transcribed, anonymised, and coded using deductive and inductive thematic analysis. The interview data revealed two major themes: (1) animal dimension of animal welfare, including views related to biological functioning, naturalness and affective states; and (2) dairy farmer identity, including, the voice of the 'city', what it means to be a good 'cow-man', and the nature of human-animal relationships. Dairy farmers emphasised biological functioning, but they made numerous references to the emotional and natural living aspects of their animals' lives. Our work also provides evidence that farmers believed it was their duty to care for their animals beyond simply milking cows and making a profit. In terms of the larger debate, this study identified potential shared values with members of the public: opportunities for natural living and agency, attentiveness to individual animals, and the value of life over death. Finally, the emotional relationship that farmers developed with their animals highlights the values dairy farmers have for their animals beyond simply utilitarian function. Overall, these shared values could contribute to constructive dialogue.

AB  - The topic of keeping livestock is very well suited to addressing the ecological, social, and economic aspects of the sustainable production of our food in school lessons. However, the production of animal-based foods is mainly outside the personal experience of children and young people. To derive relevant implications for teaching, this paper explores the following research question: 'What conceptions do elementary school students have about keeping fattening pigs and dairy cows on farms?' In more detail, this study examines students' conceptions of stock sizes, husbandry practices, and feeding of fattening pigs and dairy cows and how these differ between urban and farm students. For this purpose, six elementary school students (M-Age = 8.8 years, SD = 0.4 ; 83% female) from Lower Saxony and North Rhine-Westphalia were interviewed. Three of the subjects were growing up on a conventional farm with fattening pigs. The study is informed by the Model of Educational Reconstruction. To elicit students' conceptions, we used semi-structured guided interviews, during which students made a drawing of a farm that they described in detail. The data were evaluated with the help of qualitative content analysis. The study results show a wide range of conceptions, ranging from naive and unbiased conceptions to clear conceptions of modern, conventional livestock farming.

AB  - This study assessed osteointegration and degradation of 3D-printed porous pure iron (Fe) versus titanium (Ti) interference screws in porcine anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction over 12 months. Twelve pigs were assigned to Fe (experimental) or Ti (control) groups and euthanized at 3-, 6-, or 12-month post-surgery. Osteointegration was evaluated via micro-computed tomography, biomechanical tests measured ACL failure load, and histology examined bone and tissue integration. No significant differences in ACL failure load were noted between groups. Fe implants showed significantly greater bone volume fraction, bone surface density, and intersection-to-total surface area (P = 0.025, 0.047, 0.021). Minimal degradation of Fe implants was observed, with stable implant volumes and histological confirmation of osteoid attachment. Median ambulation time was shorter with Fe implants (5 weeks) than with Ti implants (11 weeks; P = 0.075). Findings demonstrate Fe implants' biocompatibility and enhanced peri-implant osteogenesis, though improved degradation rates are needed.

AB  - Many captive Asian elephants (Elephas maximus) in Thailand participate in the tourism industry at attractions known as 'elephant camps.' There has been significant criticism of low welfare venues, where the elephants may experience injuries, poor nutrition, unnatural social environments and aversive handling. Despite increasing concern for animal welfare, the general public often have difficulty identifying the welfare issues affecting captive animals.The aim of this study was to investigate participants' willingness to support an elephant attraction and their perceived emotional value from the experience, based on the affective state of the captive elephant and their level of contact with it. Participants (n = 590) from the United States were randomly assigned to one of four vignettes (using a 2 x 2 experimental design) that described an elephant attraction, varying the affective state of the elephant (feels excellent, feels terrible) and the level of contact they could have with the elephant (low, high). A mixed methods approach was used, where participants provided answers to Likert-type questions, followed by an open-ended response. Participants showed greater willingness to support the elephant attraction and greater perceived emotional value from the experience when the elephant felt excellent, as opposed to when the elephant felt terrible. There were no significant differences between low and high contact for the measures included in this study. Qualitative responses varied greatly, with participants making many assumptions about the elephant and the attraction, revealing potential misconceptions that they had regarding the welfare of captive elephants.This research may be used to encourage a shift in tourism preferences to venues that reflect positive elephant welfare.

AB  - Timely administration of key medications toward patients with sudden diseases is critical to saving lives. However, slow transport of first-aid therapeutics and the potential absence of trained people for drug usage can lead to severe injuries or even death. Herein, an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-mediated first-aid system for targeted delivery (uFAST) is developed. It allows unattended administration of emergency therapeutics-loaded transdermal microneedle (MN) patches toward patients to relieve symptoms by a contact-triggered microneedle applicator (CTMA). The implementability and safety of the uFAST for first aid is demonstrated in a severe hypoglycemic pig model by automatically delivering a glucagon patch with immediate and bioresponsive dual release modes. This platform technique may facilitate the development of UAV-mediated first-aid treatments for other sudden diseases.

AB  - Australia was first peopled by maritime voyagers who intentionally crossed from Indonesia using watercraft 65,000 years ago. Despite this, the Holocene archaeological record suggests that many Australian islands were abandoned for several thousand years after separation from the mainland, and only visited again in the last few thousand years. The implication is that coastal peoples reintroduced watercraft into their maritime repertoire only in the recent past. Since first-peopling, sea levels have fluctuated over 120 m, transforming the coastlines and offshore island geographies. In this study, we assess Australia's offshore islands over the range of past sea levels, to discover that most of the Australian coastline has far more islands now than at any time in the human past. Australia's island-rich coastlines emerged with the high sea levels of the late Holocene. The existing island geographies of the Pilbara, the Great Barrier Reef, the Bass Strait and the Rottnest Shelf have no Pleistocene equivalents, meaning coastal peoples encountered new maritime opportunities as modern sea level was established (c. 7 ka). We present regional time series, and detailed paleogeographical maps of these changes, produced by a fully reproducible GIS method. We contextualise this in a review of Australian island archaeology, and demonstrate that key exceptions to this geographical trend are the Kimberley and the Torres Strait e which have evidence for earlier and longer continuous island sequences. These exceptions provided the opportunity for regional persistence of Pleistocene seafaring. (c) 2023 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The exponential growth of industrial waste is a problem that has forced the development of clean technologies for their appropriate management. About 0.25e0.30 tons of slag is generated per ton of crude steel or pig iron in blast furnaces. In this research, blast furnace slag was recycled to progressively replace the fine fraction of flint clay at 0, 5,10,15, and 20 wt% in laboratory-scale conventional refractory castable samples fired at 120, 850, 1050, and 1400 degrees C. The physical properties were measured by linear shrinkage, bulk density, apparent porosity, and water absorption. The mechanical behavior was evaluated by cold crushing strength and cold modulus of rupture. Microstructural and mineralogical characteristics were analyzed by scanning electron microscopy and X-ray diffraction, respectively. The incorporation of 10 wt% of blast furnace slag allowed the development of a slag-containing conventional refractory castable with improved properties compared to those of the reference castable, such as a bulk density of 2.61 g/cm3, percentages of apparent porosity, and water absorption of 10.64% and 4.08%, respectively, and mechanical resistance of 94.5 MPa. A denser microstructure via ceramic body's porosity reduction is reached by the anorthite crystallization from a silica-rich liquid phase with CaO contents. This densification mechanism improves mechanical resistance by about 74%. The anorthite phase and the physical and mechanical characteristics exhibited by the sustainable refractory castable are attractive and suitable for its possible application in the aluminum industry as smelting furnace lining.

AB  - Simple Summary: Mistiming of puberty onset has negative consequences for humans and livestock. Puberty depends on increased brain secretion of gonadotrophin-releasing hormone (GnRH), which causes pituitary luteinizing hormone (LH) release. Luteinizing hormone then stimulates estrogen release from the ovary and, eventually, the first ovulation. The brain neural systems that control the pubertal increase in GnRH and LH are not completely known. Neurons co-expressing kisspeptin, neurokinin B (NKB), and dynorphin (called KNDy neurons) are critical for puberty, with kisspeptin and NKB stimulating and dynorphin inhibiting LH secretion. Herein, we used female sheep at prepubertal, peripubertal, and postpubertal ages and hypothesized that kisspeptin and NKB would increase, and dynorphin decrease, during the pubertal increase in LH secretion. We observed that kisspeptin and NKB protein and mRNA expression were evident well before the pubertal increase in LH secretion and did not change with age. We saw no change in numbers of dynorphin neurons, but actually saw an increase in the amount of mRNA per neuron at a postpubertal age. We conclude that puberty-associated increases in GnRH and LH secretion occur without significant changes in KNDy peptide expression and suggest that, while critical, KNDy neurons await inputs from other neural systems to trigger puberty onset.
   & nbsp;</p>
   The neural mechanisms underlying increases in gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) and luteinizing hormone (LH) secretion that drive puberty onset are unknown. Neurons coexpressing kisspeptin, neurokinin B (NKB), and dynorphin, i.e., KNDy neurons, are important as kisspeptin and NKB are stimulatory, and dynorphin inhibitory, to GnRH secretion. Given this, we hypothesized that kisspeptin and NKB expression would increase, but that dynorphin expression would decrease, with puberty. We collected blood and hypothalamic tissue from ovariectomized lambs implanted with estradiol at five, six, seven, eight (puberty), and ten months of age. Mean LH values and LH pulse frequency were the lowest at five to seven months, intermediate at eight months, and highest at ten months. Kisspeptin and NKB immunopositive cell numbers did not change with age. Numbers of cells expressing mRNA for kisspeptin, NKB, or dynorphin were similar at five, eight, and ten months of age. Age did not affect mRNA expression per cell for kisspeptin or NKB, but dynorphin mRNA expression per cell was elevated at ten months versus five months. Thus, neither KNDy protein nor mRNA expression changed in a predictable manner during pubertal development. These data raise the possibility that KNDy neurons, while critical, may await other inputs for the initiation of puberty.</p>

AB  - Pregnancy and lactation are important stages of fetal development. Therefore, this study investigated how different maternal diets offered during gestation and lactation periods affect adipose tissue inflammation and liver tissue oxidative stress of dams and their female offspring. Female BALB/c albino mice (60 days old) were randomized into three groups receiving a standard (CONT), hypercaloric (HD), or restricted (RD) diet during the pregnancy. After birth, female offspring weaned at 21 days were divided into two groups that received a standard or restricted diet (CONT/CONT, CONT/RD, RD/CONT, RD/RD, HD/CONT, and HD/RD) until 100 days old. Histological, oxidative parameters and inflammatory infiltrate of dams' and offspring's liver and adipose tissue were evaluated. HD dams presented non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) diagnosis and an increase in tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-& alpha;) concentrations when compared to the RD and CONT dams, indicating a pro-inflammatory state. High concentrations of malondialdehyde (MDA) formation and catalase (CAT) activity in HD when compared to the CONT in the liver. SOD activity decreased in RD mice compared to CONT, and the SOD/CAT ratio was decreased in the RD and HD in comparison to the CONT. The maternal diet leads to an increase in SOD in RD/RD compared to HD/RD. RD-fed dams showed an increase in inflammatory infiltrates compared to CONT, evidencing changes caused by a restrictive diet. In the HD/CONT offspring, we verified an increase in inflammatory infiltrates in relation to the offspring fed a standard diet. In conclusion, HD, and RD, during pregnancy and lactation, altered the liver and adipose tissues of mothers. Furthermore, the maternal diet negatively impacts the offspring's adipose tissue but does not cause liver damage in these animals in adult life.

AB  - Proper regulation of synapse formation and elimination is critical for establishing mature neuronal circuits and maintaining brain function. Synaptic abnormalities, such as defects in the density and morphology of postsynaptic dendritic spines, underlie the pathology of various neuropsychiatric disorders. Protocadherin 17 (PCDH17) is associated with major mood disorders, including bipolar disorder and depression. However, the molecular mechanisms by which PCDH17 regulates spine number, morphology, and behavior remain elusive. In this study, we found that PCDH17 functions at postsynaptic sites, restricting the number and size of dendritic spines in excitatory neurons. Selective overexpression of PCDH17 in the ventral hippocampal CA1 results in spine loss and anxiety- and depression -like behaviors in mice. Mechanistically, PCDH17 interacts with actin -relevant proteins and regulates actin filament (F -actin) organization. Specifically, PCDH17 binds to ROCK2, increasing its expression and subsequently enhancing the activity of downstream targets such as LIMK1 and the phosphorylation of cofilin serine-3 (Ser3). Inhibition of ROCK2 activity with belumosudil (KD025) ameliorates the defective F -actin organization and spine structure induced by PCDH17 overexpression, suggesting that ROCK2 mediates the effects of PCDH17 on F -actin content and spine development. Hence, these findings reveal a novel mechanism by which PCDH17 regulates synapse development and behavior, providing pathological insights into the neurobiological basis of mood disorders.

AB  - Camellia sinensis, renowned as the second most widely consumed nonalcoholic beverage worldwide, bears substantial economic importance, prompting cultivators to breed various clones for enhanced flavor and quality. This study analyzed the variation in leaf phenotype, phytochemicals (total tannins and proanthocyanidins content) and antioxidant potential of 36 widely cultivated tea clones from India's sub-Himalayan region using multivariate analysis. Results indicated that TV23 had the largest leaf and SS27 and RR had the smallest. TS520 was the richest in tannin, proanthocyanidins, and antioxidants, while S3A1 and Heeleakah were the least. Principal components analysis (PCA) and cluster analysis unveiled four morphological clusters (representative clones - TV1, TV23, TV30, 124.48.8) and four phytochemical clusters (representative clones - TS520, TV9, TV27, P126). GC-MS analysis revealed that TV1 and TV30 had high caffeine content (82.0%), while TS520 exhibited abundant antioxidant compounds, including sycllo-inositol (23.84%) and epigallocatechin (4.23%). TS520's exceptional antioxidant properties, confirmed by DPPH, ABTS, and total antioxidant capacity assays, may result from its cultivation through seed propagation. Correlation analysis showed antioxidant potential had moderate negative associations with leaf size, strong negative with inter-secondary vein number, and positive with petiole length. This study is pivotal for assessing tea clone diversity, with broader applications in tea improvement and breeding programs.

AB  - In developing regions that engage in agricultural and industrial activities, access to high-quality water for drinking, domestic, irrigation and industrial purposes is limited. In this study, comprehensive water quality assessment has been carried out to unravel the suitability of water supplies in Umunya suburb for human consumption, industrial and irrigation purposes. Water samples from spring, streams, and boreholes were analysed for physicochemical properties and heavy metals pollution. Pollution index of groundwater (PIG) was used to assess the drinking suitability of the waters whereas several indexical methods were integrated to unravel their suitability for irrigation and industrial purposes. The pH (4.61-6.53) revealed that majority of the samples are acidic. All the chemical ions were within their respective standard allowable limits, except for Fe, Pb and Ni. Generally, these heavy metals significantly impacted the water quality of the area. The PIG evaluation of the waters for drinking purpose revealed that 40% of the samples are unsuitable. However, most of the indices used for the irrigation water quality evaluation showed that majority of the samples are suitable for irrigation uses. The industrial water quality assessment indicated that the natural waters have more corrosive tendency than scaling tendency. Corrosivity and scaling indices, such as Langelier index, Larson-Skold index, chloride-sulphate mass ratio, aggressive index, Ryznar stability index, and Puckorius scaling index, unveiled that the natural waters are severely corrosive, having the tendency to damage domestic, irrigational, and industrial water distribution systems. This paper provides significant information necessary for the management and sustainability of water resources in Umunya suburb.

AB  - Microplastics (MPs) accumulation in rocky shore organisms has limited knowledge. This study investigated MPs accumulation in filter-feeding oysters, herbivorous limpets and carnivorous snails to assess their performance as sentinel species in the MPs trophic transfer. The samples were obtained along a contamination gradient in the Santos Estuarine System, Brazil. All three studied species showed MPs concentrations related to the contamination gradient, being the oysters the species that showed the highest levels, followed by limpets and snails (average of less and most contaminated sites of 1.06-8.90, 2.28-5.69 and 0.44-2.10 MP g-1, respectively), suggesting that MPs ingestion rates are linked to feeding habits. MPs were mainly polystyrene and polyacetal. The polymer types did not vary among sites nor species. Despite minor differences in percentages and diversity of size, shape, and color classes, the analyzed species were equally able to demonstrate dominance of small, fiber, transparent, black and blue MPs. Thus, oysters, limpets, and snails are proposed as sentinels of MPs in monitoring assessments.

AB  - Highly proliferative cells rely on one carbon (1C) metabolism for production of formate required for synthesis of purines and thymidine for nucleic acid synthesis. This study was to determine if extracellular serine and/or glucose and fructose contribute the production of formate in ovine conceptuses. Suffolk ewes (n = 8) were synchronized to estrus, bred to fertile rams, and conceptuses were collected on Day 17 of gestation. Conceptuses were either snap frozen in liquid nitrogen (n = 3) or placed in culture in medium (n = 5) containing either: 1) 4 mM D-glucose + 2 mM [U-C-13]serine; 2) 6 mM glycine + 4 mM D-glucose + 2 mM [U-C-13]serine; 3) 4 mM D-fructose + 2 mM [U-C-13]serine; 4) 6 mM glycine + 4 mM D-fructose + 2 mM [U-C-13]serine; 5) 4 mM D-glucose + 4 mM D-fructose + 2 mM [U-C-13]serine; or 6) 6 mM glycine + 4 mM D-glucose + 4 mM D-fructose + 2 mM [U-C-13]serine. After 2 h incubation, conceptuses in their respective culture medium were homogenized and the supernatant analyzed for C-12- and C-13-formate by gas chromatography and amino acids by high performance liquid chromatography. Ovine conceptuses produced both C-13- and C-12-formate, indicating that the [U-C-13]serine, glucose, and fructose were utilized to generate formate, respectively. Greater amounts of C-12-formate than C-13-formate were produced, indicating that the ovine conceptus utilized more glucose and fructose than serine to produce formate. This study is the first to demonstrate that both 1C metabolism and serinogenesis are active metabolic pathways in ovine conceptuses during the peri-implantation period of pregnancy, and that hexose sugars are the preferred substrate for generating formate required for nucleotide synthesis for proliferating trophectoderm cells.

AB  - Simple Summary
   Natural service is currently the predominant method of breeding in extensively managed beef herds. In these herds, the importance of the bull has been largely overlooked, focusing instead on female fertility. However, the bull might be the most important factor in determining the reproductive performance of the herd, because one subfertile or infertile bull could mean a decrease of 25 to 40 calves per year. Thus, bull management is critical to increase herd fertility. Infectious bovine rhinotracheitis (IBR) and bovine viral diarrhea (BVD) are infections associated with reduced conception rates. In this study, we analyzed the effect of IBR, BVD, and bull: cow ratio on seminal parameters of the bull and herd fertility, finding a significant negative effect of BVD on sperm concentration and motility, and a negative correlation between the number of cows per bull and herd fertility. Our data suggest that serological control of BVD and sperm parameters, as well as including less than 40 cows per bull, could improve the reproductive efficiency of the herd in extensively managed herds.
   Natural service remains the main breeding method in extensively managed beef herds. Although the bull might be the most important factor in determining herd fertility, its importance has been largely overlooked, focusing instead on female fertility. Management of the bull is critical to maximize the opportunities for cow conception. Infectious bovine rhinotracheitis (IBR) and bovine viral diarrhea (BVD) are infections associated with reduced conception rates. This study aimed to determine the effect of both IBR and BVD infection, and bull: cow ratio on seminal parameters in the bull and herd fertility. The presence of antibodies to IBR and BVD, seminal parameters (volume, concentration, mass, and progressive motility), and herd fertility were analyzed in 158 extensively managed bulls. Sperm concentration and mass motility, as well as herd fertility, were significantly lower in BVD-positive bulls. No significant differences were found between IBR-positive and -negative bulls in any reproductive parameter. Sperm concentration was negatively affected by BVD infection in both Charolais and Limousin bulls, whereas mass motility and herd fertility were reduced in Limousin bulls only. No differences were observed in the cow: bull ratio between BVD+ and BVD- bulls. A significant negative correlation was detected between the number of cows per bull and herd fertility, which was negatively affected when herds had more than 40 cows per bull. In conclusion, BVD and bull overuse negatively affect the reproductive performance of the herd.

AB  - Testosterone derived from testicular Leydig cells (LCs) is important for male sheep, and the testis is susceptible to external temperature. The present study aimed to explore the alleviating effect of selenomethionine (Se-Met) on heat-induced injury in Hu sheep LCs. Isolated LCs were exposed to heat (41.5 degrees C, heat exposure, HE) or not (37 degrees C, nonheat exposure, NE), and cells in NE and HE were treated with 0 (C) or 8 mu mol/L (S) Se-Met for 6 h. Cell viability, testosterone level, and the expression of GPX1, HSD3B, apoptosis-related genes and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (p38MAPK)/heat shock protein beta-1 (HSPB1) pathway were examined. The results showed that Se-Met increased GPX1 expression (NE-S vs. NE-C: 2.28-fold; HE-S vs. HE-C: 2.36-fold, p < 0.05) and alleviated heat-induced decrease in cell viability (HE-S vs. HE-C: 1.41-fold; HE-C vs. NE-C: 0.61-fold, p < 0.01), although the viability was still lower than that in the NE-C cells (HE-S vs. NE-C: 0.85-fold) and Se-Met-treated cells (HE-S vs. NE-S: 0.81-fold). Se-Met relieved heat-induced decrease in testosterone level (HE-S vs. HE-C: 1.84-fold, p < 0.05) and HSD3B expression (HE-S vs. HE-C: 1.67-fold, p < 0.05). Se-Met alleviated heat-induced increase in Bcl2-associated protein X (BAX) expression (HE-C vs. HE-S: 2.4-fold, p < 0.05), and decrease in B-cell lymphoma-2 (BCL2) expression (HE-S vs. HE-C: 2.62-fold, p < 0.05), resulting in increased BCL2/BAX ratio in the HE-S cells (HE-S vs. HE-C: 5.24-fold, p < 0.05). Furthermore, Se-Met alleviated heat-induced activation of p-p38MAPK/p38MAPK (HE-C vs. HE-S: 1.79-fold, p < 0.05) and p-HSPB1/HSPB1 (HE-C vs. HE-S: 2.72-fold, p < 0.05). In conclusion, p38MAPK/HSPB1 might be involved in Se-Met-mediated alleviation of heat-induced cell apoptosis, cell viability and testosterone secretion impairments in sheep LCs.

AB  - Over 33% of Americans are labeled as obese, leading the World Health Organization to designate obesity as a major public health problem. One consequence of obesity is the development of metabolic syndrome, a condition which has been correlated to an increased risk for developing cardiovascular disease and Type 2 diabetes. Prolonged ingestion of a higher-fat diet, one cause of obesity, results in alterations to the gut microbiome. These alterations are implicated to have a profound role in the evolution and progression of obesity-linked diseases. Probiotics are associated with positive health effects such as limiting pathogen colonization, aiding in digestion, and vitamin synthesis. Using Ossabaw pigs as a model for obesity, and in conjunction with our previous research, we performed an in-depth, nontargeted, metabolomic analysis on select organs to elucidate the effects of dietary supplementation with the probiotic Lacticaseibacillus paracasei. We focused our analysis on the effects of probiotic supplementation on a higher-fat (obesogenic) diet and a nutritionally balanced diet. Notably, our findings reveal that the brain cortex is highly sensitive to dietary influencers, and with probiotic supplementation, several aberrant metabolites associated with a higher-fat diet revert to healthy levels, thus demonstrating the potential for a probiotic intervention for obesity-linked disease.

AB  - Biopesticides such as essential oils (EOs) are considered an improvement for integrated pest control as they appear to be less toxic to the environment than chemical acaricides. The current study aimed to evaluate the acaricidal activity of Artemisia herba-alba and Melia azedarach oil loaded nano-emulsion as alternatives for chemical acaricides against the camel tick Hyalomma dromedarii, besides evaluating their toxic effect on Swiss albino mice. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) were used for the characterization of loaded nano-emulsions.The immersion test was used for the bioassay of both loaded nanoemulsions on tick stages (egg, nymph, larva, and adult). Mortality percentages and LC50 values of each tick stage were calculated. Reproductive performance for the survived engorged females after treatment was monitored. The toxicity of both loaded nano-emulsions was evaluated on Swiss albino mice by an oral dose of 1500 mg/kg/day for five successive days. The hematological, biochemical, and histopathological changes were evaluated. TEM characterization revealed spherical droplets for A. herba-alba and M. azedarach oil loaded nano-emulsion with droplet size ranging from 62 to 69 nm and 52-91 nm, respectively. FTIR revealed the absence of extra peaks in the loaded nano-emulsions that confirmed no chemical changes existed by ultrasonication. The LC50 values of A. herba-alba and M. azedarach oil loaded nano-emulsion on embryonated eggs, larvae, engorged nymphs, and unfed adults were 0.3 and 1.1%, 0.7 and 1.7%, 0.3 and 0.4%, 4.4 and 22.2%, respectively. The egg productive index (EPI), egg number, and hatchability percentage were lower in the treated females compared with Butox 5% (deltamethrin) and control. The hematological picture and biochemical analysis revealed insignificant changes in the treatment group compared with the negative control group. The liver of the A. herba-alba and M. azedarach oil loaded nano-emulsion treated group exhibited vacuolar degeneration and infiltration of lymphocytic cells. The kidney of mice treated with A. herba-alba and M. azedarach oil loaded nano-emulsion showed hemolysis and slight degeneration of epithelial cells of tubules. It is concluded that A. herba-alba and M. azedarach oil loaded nano-emulsion have good acaricidal activity against camel tick H. dromedarii.

AB  - Plant induced defenses may benefit plants by increasing cannibalism among insect herbivores. However, the general efficacy of plant defenses that promote cannibalism remains unclear. Using a generalist Lepidopteran herbivore (Helicoverpa zea), we examined whether plant induced defenses in Solanum lycopersicum increased cannibalism among H. zea and whether defense-mediated cannibalism benefits both the plant and the cannibal. In a separate experiment, we also examined whether defense-mediated cannibalism has effects on H. zea herbivory that are comparable to the effects of pathogenic virus of H. zea (HzSNPV) and whether defense-mediated cannibalism modified pathogen efficacy. We found that both plant defenses and cannibalism decreased herbivory: H. zea consumed less plant material if plants were induced, if dead conspecifics were provided, or both. Cannibalism increased cannibal growth rate: cannibals effectively overcome the costs of plant defenses by eating conspecifics. Inoculating half of H. zea with virus strongly reduced caterpillar survival. Cannibalism occurred sooner among virus-inoculated groups of H. zea, and all caterpillars in virus-inoculated treatments died before the end of the 7-day experiment. Although the rise in mortality caused by HzSNPV occurred more rapidly than the rise in mortality due to defense-mediated cannibalism, overall H. zea mortality at the end of the experiment was equal among virus-inoculated and induced-defense groups. Defense-mediated cannibalism and viral inoculation equally reduced herbivory on S. lycopersicum. Our results provide evidence that defense-mediated increases in cannibalism can be as effective as other forms of classic herbivore population regulation, and that both viral pathogens and defense-induced cannibalism can have significant benefits for plants.

AB  - Background: Previous studies have demonstrated that early life stress (ELS) impacts hoarding behavior in adult humans. This study aimed to assess the potential mitigation by environmental enrichment on hoarding behavior in rodents caused by maternal separation, thereby providing insights into therapeutic strategies for hoarding disorder. Methods: Newborn mice were randomly divided into four groups. The control group was allowed to grow naturally. The maternal separation group underwent two weeks of maternal separation. The short-term environmental enrichment group received two weeks of environmental enrichment intervention after the two weeks of maternal separation. The long-term environmental enrichment group received five weeks of environmental enrichment intervention after the two weeks of maternal separation. Hoarding behavior was assessed during adolescence and adulthood. Hippocampal tissue from adult female mice was analyzed using LC-MS/MS-based metabolomics. Spearman correlation analysis was then performed to assess the relationship between differentially expressed metabolites and hoarding behavior. Results: Environmental enrichment attenuates maternal separation-induced excessive hoarding behavior in adult female mice. The untargeted metabolomics of the hippocampal region in female mice showed that long-term environmental enrichment reversed multiple differential metabolites, including Substance P, which were mainly concentrated in metabolic pathways such as cancer choline metabolism, glycolipid metabolism, and linoleic acid metabolism. Conclusions: Our findings indicate that ELS and long-term environmental enrichment have sex-dependent effects on adult hoarding behavior, potentially related to altered hippocampal metabolism. This study highlights the importance of environmental enrichment in mitigating the long-term effects of early maternal separation on hoarding behavior.

AB  - Piled raft foundation (PRF) is a cost effective and sustainable foundation option which can reduce the total and differential settlement, and improve the bearing capacity of the foundation in case of high-rise superstructures or marine structures. This study mainly focuses on a parametric analysis of PRF and also checks the impact of various design parameters on the structural and geotechnical aspects of PRF including the settlement of PRF and its components, raft-soil contact behaviour, bending moment, axial stress on pile, soil stress and settlement in different directions etc. To understand the contribution of piles in PRF, two factors such as relative improvement in the stiffness and settlement ratio are also evaluated. The results of the present study indicate that the differential and reference settlement can be controlled by the addition of piles under the raft, whereas the value of normalized differential settlement remains increasing with an increase in the pile spacing to diameter (s/d) ratio. In case of raft-soil contact behaviour, the contact pressure increases if the raft width is increased, but the rate of increment is prominent in case of a higher number of piles. The raft is showing both the sagging and hogging bending moment and as s/d ratio increases, bending moment also tends to increase.

AB  - Background: Sleep deprivation (SLD) is a widespread condition that disrupts physiological functions and may increase mortality risk. Valeriana officinalis, a traditional medicinal herb known for its sedative and hypnotic properties, contains isobicyclogermacrenal (IG), a newly isolated active compound. However, research on the therapeutic potential of IG for treating SLD remains limited.<br /> Methods: In this study, IG was extracted and characterized from Valeriana officinalis, and an SLD model was established in rats using p-chlorophenylalanine (PCPA). Behavioral tests and pathological studies were conducted to assess the effects of IG on SLD, and transcriptomic and metabolomic analyses were utilized to investigate its underlying mechanisms.<br /> Results: IG administration significantly improved the cognitive performance of SLD rats in behavioral tests and ameliorated histological injuries in the hippocampus and cerebral cortex. IG treatment increased the levels of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and neurotransmitters such as serotonin (5-HT) in SLD rats. Additionally, IG directly targets TFRC, thereby improving iron metabolism in the hippocampus. Comprehensive transcriptomic and metabolomic analyses revealed that the improvements from IG stemmed from the mitigation of abnormalities in iron metabolism, cholesterol metabolism, and glutathione metabolism, leading to reduced oxidative stress, ferroptosis, and neuroinflammation in the hippocampus caused by SLD.<br /> Conclusions: Collectively, these findings suggest that IG has the potential to ameliorate neurological damage and cognitive impairment caused by SLD, offering a novel strategy for protection against the adverse effects of SLD.

AB  - Animals derive resources from their diet and allocate them to organismal functions such as growth, maintenance, reproduction, and dispersal. How variation in diet quality can affect resource allocation to life-history traits, in particular those important to locomotion and dispersal, is poorly understood. We hypothesize that, particularly for specialist herbivore insects that are in co-evolutionary arms races with host plants, changes in host plant will impact performance. From their coevolutionary arms-race with plants, to a complex migratory life history, Monarch butterflies are among the most iconic insect species worldwide. Population declines initiated international conservation efforts involving the replanting of a variety of milkweed species. However, this practice was implemented with little regard for how diverse defensive chemistry of milkweeds experienced by monarch larvae may affect adult fitness traits. We report that adult flight muscle investment, flight energetics, and maintenance costs depend on the host plant species of larvae, and correlate with concentration of milkweed-derived cardenolides sequestered by adults. Our findings indicate host plant species can impact monarchs by affecting fuel requirements for flight.
   The growth of muscle and flight performance in monarch butterflies is influenced by the plant species the larvae grow on.

AB  - Mosaicism is the most important limitation for one-step gene editing in embryos by CRISPR/Cas9 because cuts and repairs sometimes take place after the first DNA replication of the zygote. To try to minimize the risk of mosaicism, in this study a reversible DNA replication inhibitor was used after the release of CRISPR/Cas9 in the cell. There is no previous information on the use of aphidicolin in porcine embryos, so the reversible inhibition of DNA replication and the effect on embryo development of different concentrations of this drug was first evaluated. The effect of incubation with aphidicolin was tested with CRISPR/Cas9 at different concentrations and different delivery methodologies. As a result, the reversible inhibition of DNA replication was observed, and it was concentration dependent. An optimal concentration of 0.5 mu M was established and used for subsequent experiments. Following the use of this drug with CRISPR/Cas9, a halving of mosaicism was observed together with a detrimental effect on embryo development. In conclusion, the use of reversible inhibition of DNA replication offers a way to reduce mosaicism. Nevertheless, due to the reduction in embryo development, it would be necessary to reach a balance for its use to be feasible.

AB  - In small German farms, there is a technically usable potential of cattle manure and pig manure ranging from 153 to 187 million tons of fresh matter per year. Since 2021 and 2023, new incentives under the Renewable Energy Sources Act (EEG) have been promoting biogas production in small farms. These incentives, applicable to biogas plants up to 150 kWel, include direct compensations for plants up to 100 kWel and market premiums for those up to 150 kWel. A small biogas plant made of textile materials was designed for both pilot and full-scale applications. Compared to conventional concrete biogas reactors, these textile-based reactors offer a simplified construction and operation, eliminating the need for specialized civil engineering. The primary objective of this research is to demonstrate the process engineering feasibility of biogas reactors based on textile materials for small farm biogas plants (30 to 75 kWel). Another goal is to design the construction method in such a way that this type of system can be built by farmers themselves after type testing on site. Operational insights were gathered from the laboratory plant with a 300-L digester volume, using cattle manure and clover grass silage. To adapt the system to the biogas reactor made of textile materials, the reactor was designed without a stirrer. These insights were considered in the design and approval procedure of the full-sized demonstration biogas plant made of textile materials. The full-size demonstration plant digesters underwent an approval procedure from local authorities, featuring treatment volumes of 120 m3 for the main biogas reactor and 550 m3 for the digestate reactor in an earth basin style. This new type of biogas plant could be built in small farms for self-sufficiency in electrical and thermal energy or for treating sewage sludge in small-scale communal wastewater treatment and biogas plants.

AB  - Sensorineural hearing loss is prevalent within society affecting the quality of life of 460 million worldwide. In the majority of cases, this is due to insult or degeneration of mechanosensory hair cells in the cochlea. In adult mammals, hair cell loss is irreversible as sensory cells are not replaced spontaneously. Genetic inhibition of Notch signaling had been shown to induce hair cell formation by transdifferentiation of supporting cells in young postnatal rodents and provided an impetus for targeting Notch pathway with small molecule inhibitors for hearing restoration. Here, the oto-regenerative potential of different gamma-secretase inhibitors (GSIs) was evaluated in complementary assay models, including cell lines, organotypic cultures of the organ of Corti and cochlear organoids to characterize two novel GSIs (CPD3 and CPD8). GSI-treatment induced hair cell gene expression in all these models and was effective in increasing hair cell numbers, in particular outer hair cells, both in baseline conditions and in response to ototoxic damage. Hair cells were generated from transdifferentiation of supporting cells. Similar findings were obtained in cochlear organoid cultures, used for the first time to probe regeneration following sisomicin-induced damage. Finally, effective absorption of a novel GSI through the round window membrane and hair cell induction was attained in a whole cochlea culture model and in vivo pharmacokinetic comparisons of transtympanic delivery of GSIs and different vehicle formulations were successfully conducted in guinea pigs. This preclinical evaluation of targeting Notch signaling with novel GSIs illustrates methods of characterization for hearing restoration molecules, enabling translation to more complex animal studies and clinical research.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Hippodamia variegata (Goeze) (Coleoptera: Coccinellidae), a dominant predatory natural enemy species in cotton-planting, is a key biological control agent for aphids in China. Our previous study showed that herbivore-induced plant volatiles (HIPVs) from Glycyrrhiza uralensis (Fisch.) (Fabales: Fabaceae) and Alhagi sparsifolia (Desv.) (Fabales: Fabaceae) plants infested with Aphis atrata (Zhang) (Homoptera: Aphididae), were important semiochemicals for Hippodamia variegata to locate aphids. However, little was known about the varieties and function of active volatiles from HIPVs of the two plant species.RESULTS: In this study, results from gas chromatography-electroantennography detection (GC-EAD) demonstrated that seven HIPVs (butyl acrylate, alpha-pinene, butyl isobutyrate, beta-pinene, butyl butyrate, 1,3-diethylbenzene and 1,4-diethylbenzene) identified from the two damaged plant species elicited antennal responses from Hippodamia variegata. Also, results from gas chromatograph-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) analysis showed that the concentrations of the seven active volatiles were significantly higher than those from corresponding healthy plants. Hippodamia variegata exhibited varying degrees of response to each active volatile in electroantennography (EAG) trials, however, only alpha-pinene, butyl isobutyrate, beta-pinene and butyl butyrate significantly attracted Hippodamia variegata in behavioral trials conducted in the laboratory. They also had a better trapping effect on Hippodamia variegata in cotton fields.CONCLUSION: Four active compounds (alpha-pinene, butyl isobutyrate, beta-pinene and butyl butyrate) identified from two damaged plant species were considered the most effective HIPVs that attract Hippodamia variegata. These findings provide possibilities for the development of Hippodamia variegata attractants.

AB  - In the cotton fields of Xinjiang province, China, the cotton aphid, Aphis gossypii Golver, is a significant pest, while Hippodamia variegata (Goeze) is its primary natural enemy. Both species are present during the cotton seedling and budding stages, but as the flowering and boll-formation stage progresses, the aphid population rapidly declines, whereas the adult population of H. variegata often remains high for an extended period. To understand this phenomenon, we investigated the effects of feeding newly emerged H. variegata adults with cotton pollen and honey on their survival rate, lifespan, and reproductive capacity. The study found that pollen consumption in H. variegata adults varied significantly with age and sex, with females generally consuming more pollen than males, particularly at 10, 15, and 20 days of age. The aphid-fed group exhibited the longest lifespan (female 56.0 f 1.8 d, male 60.1 f 2.7 d), significantly surpassing those fed with cotton honey, collected from bees, (female 36.1 f 2.2 d, male 31.7 f 0.9 d) and pollen (female 12.2 f 0.4 d, male 9.7 f 0.8 d). While predation on aphids allowed H. variegata to produce 646.1 f 14.6 eggs over a 30-d period (starting from the first oviposition), none of the adults fed with cotton pollen or honey laid eggs. Therefore, cotton pollen and honey play a positive role in maintaining the adult population of H. variegata in the field when aphids are absent but cannot support reproduction. Nevertheless, this maintenance effect benefits conservation biological control in cotton fields and effectively controls thrips and other pests at subsequent cotton growing stages.

AB  - The aim of the present study was to evaluate: 1) the association between AMH, AFC, superovulatory response and embryo yield in sheep; and 2) the effect of FSH treatment length during superstimulation of the first follicular wave on ovarian response and embryo yield, particularly in ewes with low and high AMH. The experiment was performed on 63 Polled Dorset ewes that received an ovarian superstimulatory treatment during the first follicular wave (Day 0 protocol). Ewes were administered a total dose of 240 mg of FSH distributed in six (6-dose regimen, n = 30) or eight (8-dose regimen, n = 33) decreasing doses administered 12 h apart. On Day -9 (random stage of the estrous cycle) and Day 0 (day of the first FSH dose) ovarian ultrasonography was performed and blood samples were collected for AFC and AMH determinations, respectively. A weak positive correlation between AMH and small AFC (follicles <4 mm) was observed (r = 0.23; P = 0.07), and AMH concentration was positively correlated (r = 0.29; P < 0.05) with the number of corpora lutea (CL) determined at embryo collection (i.e., 6 d after insemination). The length of FSH treatment tended (P = 0.06) to affect the ovarian response, such that the number of CL was greater in 8-dose than 6-dose treated ewes, while no differences (P > 0.10) in embryo yield outcomes were observed. For further analysis, ewes were classified into low (<7 ng/mL) and high (>10 ng/ mL) serum AMH. In high AMH ewes, there were no differences (P > 0.05) in the number of CL nor embryo yield between the 6-dose and 8-dose treatment (e.g., 7.8 +/- 2.4 and 8.3 +/- 2.5 transferable embryos, respectively; P = 0.92). Conversely, for low AMH ewes, fertilized ova and embryo yield were greater (P < 0.05) for ewes receiving the 8-dose than the 6-dose superstimulatory treatment (e.g., 8.4 +/- 2.8 vs. 2.7 +/- 0.9 transferable embryos, respectively, P < 0.05). In conclusion, embryo production in poor responding ewes with low low circulating AMH is improved by extending the superstimulatory treatment length from 6 to 8 FSH doses.

AB  - Porcine enteric coronaviruses, including transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV), porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) and porcine deltacoronavirus (PDCoV), have caused enormous economic losses to the global pig industry. Unfortunately, new variants emerge of these viruses will make it difficult for pigs vaccinated with the appropriate vaccine to develop protective immunity. Hence, it is urgent to explore effective therapeutic agents and targets against these viruses. Capsaicin is an active compound found in plants of the Capsicum genus (prevention and/or treatment of pain, hypertension and inflammation), but little is known about its effects on enterovirus infections. Herein, we used porcine enteric coronavirus TGEV as a model to evaluate the antiviral activity of capsaicin and discovered that capsaicin inhibited the replication phase of TGEV. Mechanistically, calcium signaling pathway participates in the capsaicin-mediated antiviral function. Importantly, capsaicin treatment impaired the viral replication by attenuating cytosolic calcium, and supplementation with CaCl2 reduced the inhibitory effect of capsaicin on TGEV infection. Finally, we revealed that TRPV4 plays an essential role in modulating calcium ion influx in IPEC-J2 cells, and capsaicin inhibits TGEV replication by decreasing calcium ion influx through inhibition of TRPV4. Overall, our data suggest that capsaicin is a promising small molecular drug candidate for strengthening host resistance to porcine enteric coronavirus infection.

AB  - Accurate estrus detection and optimal insemination timing are crucial for improving sow productivity and enhancing farm profitability in intensive pig farming. However, sows' estrus typically lasts only 48.4 +/- 1.0 h, and interference from false estrus further complicates detection. This study proposes an enhanced YOLOv8 model, Integrated Convolution and Attention Enhancement (ICAE), for vulvar detection to identify the estrus stages. This model innovatively divides estrus into three phases (pre-estrus, estrus, and post-estrus) and distinguishes five different estrus states, including pseudo-estrus. ICAE-YOLO integrates the Convolution and Attention Fusion Module (CAFM) and Dual Dynamic Token Mixing (DDTM) for improved feature extraction, Dilation-wise Residual (DWR) for expanding the receptive field, and Focaler-Intersection over Union (Focaler-IoU) for boosting the performance across various detection tasks. To validate the model, it was trained and tested on a dataset of 6402 sow estrus images and compared with YOLOv8n, YOLOv5n, YOLOv7tiny, YOLOv9t, YOLOv10n, YOLOv11n, and the Faster R-CNN. The results show that ICAE-YOLO achieves an mAP of 93.4%, an F1-Score of 92.0%, GFLOPs of 8.0, and a model size of 4.97 M, reaching the highest recognition accuracy among the compared models, while maintaining a good balance between model size and performance. This model enables accurate, real-time estrus monitoring in complex, all-weather farming environments, providing a foundation for automated estrus detection in intensive pig farming.

AB  - Paraquat (PQ), widely used as an agricultural herbicide, is a known neurotoxicant and linked to neurodegenerative diseases including Parkinson's disease. However, the mechanisms of PQ neurotoxicity remain to be determined. Herein, we explored the PQ neurotoxicity by focusing on its effect during murine neural stem cell (mNSC) differentiation. Based on our extensive single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) analyses, we classified the differentiated mNSCs into eight cell subtypes, namely immature neuron, NSC, astrocyte, Purkinje cell, neuroblast, ependymal cell, OPC, and oligodendrocyte, and obtained unique transcriptome in each cell type. Significantly, PQ exposure changed the proportions of these subtypes, with decreased neurons and increased astrocytes. Such changes suggested PQ impacting neurogenesis for neurotoxicity. Besides, we analyzed the unique transcript signature (differentially expressed genes) in each cell subtype and unveiled PQ-altered cell-specific-responses in immature neurons. PQ increased intracellular and mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS) in a dose-dependent manner. Intriguingly, pretreatment with mitochondria-targeted antioxidant MitoTEMPO ameliorated PQ-altered neuronal reduction. In addition, PQ dysregulated cell-to-cell communications. Taken together, our results showed that PQ altered differentiation of mNSCs and ROS played a key role in PQ-altered neuronal reduction. This study provided new insights into better understanding the neurotoxicity of PQ.

AB  - In the vertebrate cochlea, the reticular lamina seals the organ of Corti against the endolymph filled scala media. After noise exposure, fast alterations in the endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) expression level were identified in this cochlear structure. Minor amounts of nitric oxide (NO) produced by eNOS or applied by NO donors such as S-nitroso-N-acetyl-penicillamine (SNAP) might protect this vulnerable part of the organ of Corti, on the line of gap junctions of supporting cells and cochlear microcirculation. In n=5 anesthetized guinea pigs, SNAP was intravenously applied in two concentrations. Six untreated animals served as controls. The cochleae were removed and prepared for immunoelectron microscopy using specific gold-labeled anti-eNOS antibodies. The density of the gold particles was quantified for seven cellular regions in the reticular lamina at the ultrastructural level. Following SNAP application, a significant increase in eNOS expression (+176%) was detected compared with controls (p=0.012). The increase occurred mainly in actin-rich cuticular structures and the prominent microtubules bundles. Correlation analysis revealed three clear and five moderate cellular associations for controls, whereas only one clear and one moderate after SNAP application. Thus, application of the NO donor SNAP resulted in an increase in eNOS expression in distinct regions of the reticular lamina:

AB  - Pigs are widely used in metabolic research with procedures often requiring general anaesthesia. The aim was to investigate the effect of four different anaesthetic protocols: 1) isoflurane inhalation, 2) propofol infusion, 3) a mixture of tiletamine, zolazepam, medetomidine, ketamine and butorphanol (TZMKB)) and 4) ketamine combined with midazolam and xylazine (KMX)) on selected biomarkers during basal and glucose stimulated conditions. Eight domestic pigs were included in a cross-over design. Plasma concentrations of glucose, insulin, C-peptide, glucagon, cortisol, triglycerides, total cholesterol, aspartate amino transferase and alanine amino transferase, creatinine, urea, fructosamine, albumin, free fatty acids (FFAs) and glycerol were measured at baseline, during 2 h of anaesthesia and during 1 h of recovery. Intravenous glucose tolerance test (IVGTT, 0.5 g glucose/kg) was performed after 1 h of anaesthesia. Glucose disappearance rate and areas under the insulin, C-peptide and glucagon curves from the IVGTT were calculated. All four anaesthetic protocols affected glucose metabolism parameters significantly compared with un-anaesthetised pigs, which was particularly evident during IVGTT and for TZMKB and KMX anaesthesia. Propofol additionally influenced the plasma concentrations of triglycerides, FFAs and glycerol significantly. The remaining circulating biomarkers were largely unaffected by anaesthesia. These data underline the importance of considering the anaesthetic protocol in porcine studies of circulating metabolic biomarkers.

Les concentrations plasmatiques de glucose, d'insuline, de peptide C, de glucagon, de cortisol, de triglycerides (TG), de cholesterol total, d'aspartate aminotransferase et d'alanine aminotransferase, de creatinine, d'uree, de fructosamine, d'albumine, les acides gras libres (AGL) et le glycerol ont ete mesures au depart, pendant 2 h d'anesthesie et pendant 1 h de recuperation. Un test de tolerance au glucose par voie intraveineuse (IVGTT, 0,5 g de glucose/kg) a ete effectue apres 1 h d'anesthesie. Les taux de disparition du glucose (KG) et les zones sous les courbes d'insuline, de peptide C et de glucagon de l'IVGTT ont ete calcules.Les quatre protocoles d'anesthesie ont affecte significativement les parametres du metabolisme du glucose par rapport aux porcs non anesthesies, ce qui etait particulierement evident pendant l'IVGTT et en ce qui concerne l'anesthesie TZMKB et KMX. Le propofol a en outre influence significativement les concentrations plasmatiques de TG, AGL et glycerol. Les autres biomarqueurs circulants n'ont pas ete affectes par l'anesthesie.Ces donnees soulignent l'importance de considerer le protocole anesthesique dans les etudes porcines des biomarqueurs metaboliques circulants.
   Schweine werden in der Stoffwechselforschung in grossem Umfang eingesetzt, wobei die Verfahren haufig eine Vollnarkose erfordern. Ziel war es, die Wirkung von folgenden vier Narkoseprotokollen auf ausgewahlte Biomarker unter basalen und glukosestimulierten Bedingungen zu untersuchen: 1) Isofluran-Inhalation, 2) Propofol-Infusion, 3) eine Mischung aus Tiletamin, Zolazepam, Medetomidin, Ketamin und Butorphanol (TZMKB) und 4) Ketamin in Kombination mit Midazolam und Xylazin (KMX).Acht Hausschweine wurden in einem Cross-over-Design untersucht. Die Plasmakonzentrationen von Glukose, Insulin, C-Peptid, Glucagon, Cortisol, Triglyceriden (TG), Gesamtcholesterin, Aspartat-Aminotransferase und Alanin-Aminotransferase, Kreatinin, Harnstoff, Fruktosamin, Albumin, freien Fettsauren (FFA) und Glycerin wurden zu Beginn, wahrend der 2-stundigen Narkose und wahrend der 1-stundigen Erholungsphase gemessen. Ein intravenoser Glukosetoleranztest (IVGTT, 0,5 g Glukose/kg) wurde nach 1 Stunde Narkose durchgefuhrt. Die Glukoseabbaurate (KG) und die Flachen unter den Insulin-, C-Peptid- und Glucagon-Kurven des IVGTT wurden berechnet.Alle vier Narkoseprotokolle beeinflussten die Parameter des Glukosestoffwechsels im Vergleich zu nicht anasthesierten Schweinen signifikant, was insbesondere wahrend des IVGTT und bei der TZMKB- und KMX-Anasthesie zu beobachten war. Propofol beeinflusste zusatzlich die Plasmakonzentrationen von TG, FFA und Glycerin signifikant. Die ubrigen zirkulierenden Biomarker blieben von der Narkose weitgehend unbeeinflusst.Diese Daten unterstreichen die Bedeutung einer grundlegenden Berucksichtigung des Narkoseprotokolls bei Studien an Schweinen uber zirkulierende Stoffwechsel-Biomarker.
   Los cerdos se utilizan ampliamente en la investigacion metabolica, con procedimientos que a menudo requieren anestesia general. El objetivo era investigar el efecto de cuatro protocolos anestesicos diferentes: 1) inhalacion de isoflurano, 2) Infusion de propofol, 3) Una mezcla de tiletamina, zolazepam, medetomidina, ketamina y butorfanol (TZMKB)) y 4) ketamina combinada con midazolam y xilacina (KMX)) sobre biomarcadores seleccionados durante condiciones basales y estimuladas por glucosa.Se incluyeron ocho cerdos de granja en un diseno cruzado. Las concentraciones plasmaticas de glucosa, insulina, peptido C, glucagon, cortisol, trigliceridos (TG), colesterol total, aspartato aminotransferasa y alanina aminotransferasa, creatinina, urea, fructosamina, albumina, acidos grasos libres (AGL) y glicerol se midieron al inicio, durante 2 horas de anestesia y durante 1 hora de recuperacion. Se realizo una prueba de tolerancia a la glucosa intravenosa (IVGTT, 0,5 g de glucosa/kg) tras 1 hora de anestesia. Se calcularon la tasa de desaparicion de glucosa (KG) y las areas bajo las curvas de insulina, peptido C y glucagon del IVGTT.Los cuatro protocolos anestesicos afectaron significativamente a los parametros del metabolismo de la glucosa en comparacion con los cerdos no anestesiados, lo que fue particularmente evidente durante el IVGTT y para la anestesia TZMKB y KMX. Asimismo, el propofol influyo significativamente en las concentraciones plasmaticas de TG, FFA y glicerol. El resto de biomarcadores circulantes no se vieron afectados en gran medida por la anestesia.Estos datos destacan la importancia de tener en cuenta el protocolo anestesico en los estudios porcinos de biomarcadores metabolicos circulantes.

AB  - Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) are synthetic perfluorinated compounds known for their persistence in the environment and reproduction toxicity. PFAS, perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS), have been identified in the follicular fluid of infertile women. However, the specific of PFOA and PFOS mixture on oocyte quality and female fertility remain unclear. In this study, we exposed female mice to combination of PFOA and PFOS to investigate the underlying mechanisms impairing fertility and oocyte maturation. Our results showed that exposure to the mixture induced epigenetic alterations and DNA damage in oocytes, impairing meiosis. Additionally, mitochondrial dysfunction caused by the exposure to the mixture led to oxidative stress and apoptosis in the oocytes. The reduction in oocyte quality resulted in a decrease in blastocyst quality and litter size. Furthermore, single-cell transcriptome analysis indicated that exposure to the mixture disrupted energy metabolism and triggered apoptosis, possibly through the activation of the Hippo signaling pathway. Overall, our results suggest that exposure to PFOA and PFOS mixture impairs the fertility in mice through the activation of the Hippo signaling pathway-induced oocytes apoptosis.

AB  - Purpose Abnormalities within the Sonic Hedgehog (SHH), Bone Morphogenetic Protein (BMP) and SMAD4 signalling pathways have been associated with the malignant behavior of esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC). We recently developed two specific llama-derived antibodies (VHHs), C4C4 and C8C8, which target BMP4 and BMP2/4, respectively. Here we aimed to demonstrate the feasibility of the VHHs for the treatment of EAC and to elucidate its underlying mechanism. Methods Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) was performed on a TCGA dataset, while expression of SHH, BMP2/4 and SMAD4 was validated in a cohort of EAC patients. The effects of the VHHs were tested on the recently established SMAD4(-) ISO76A primary EAC cell line and its counterpart SMAD4(+) ISO76A. In a patient-derived xenograft (PDX) model, the VHHs were evaluated for their ability to selectively target tumor cells and for their effects on tumor growth and survival. Results High expression of BMP2/4 was detected in all SMAD4 negative EACs. SHH upregulated BMP2/4 expression and induced p38 MAPK signaling in the SMAD4(-) ISO76A cells. Inhibition of BMP2/4 by VHHs decreased the aggressive and chemo-resistant phenotype of the SMAD4(-) ISO76A but not of the SMAD4(+) ISO76A cells. In the PDX model, in vivo imaging indicated that VHHs effectively targeted tumor cells. Both VHHs significantly inhibited tumor growth and acted synergistically with cisplatin. Furthermore, we found that C8C8 significantly improved survival of the mice. Conclusions Our data indicate that increased BMP2/4 expression triggers aggressive non-canonical BMP signaling in SMAD4 negative EAC. Inhibiting BMP2/4 decreases malignant behavior and improves survival. Therefore, VHHs directed against BMP2/4 hold promise for the treatment of SMAD4 negative EAC.

AB  - In conventional assisted reproductive technologies (ARTs), oocytes are in vitro cultured in static conditions. Instead, dynamic systems could better mimic the physiological in vivo environment. In this study, a millifluidic in vitro oocyte maturation (mIVM) system, in a transparent bioreactor integrated with 3D printed supports, was investigated and modeled thanks to computational fluid dynamic (CFD) and oxygen convection-reaction-diffusion (CRD) models. Cumulus-oocyte complexes (COCs) from slaughtered lambs were cultured for 24 h under static (controls) or dynamic IVM in absence (native) or presence of 3D-printed devices with different shapes and assembly modes, with/without alginate filling. Nuclear chromatin configuration, mitochondria distribution patterns, and activity of in vitro matured oocytes were assessed. The native dynamic mIVM significantly reduced the maturation rate compared to the static group (p < 0.001) and metaphase II (MII) oocytes showed impaired mitochondria distribution (p < 0.05) and activity (p < 0.001). When COCs were included in a combination of concave+ring support, particularly with alginate filling, oocyte maturation and mitochondria pattern were preserved, and bioenergetic/oxidative status was improved (p < 0.05) compared to controls. Results were supported by computational models demonstrating that, in mIVM in biocompatible inserts, COCs were protected from shear stresses while ensuring physiological oxygen diffusion replicating the one occurring in vivo from capillaries.

AB  - Dendritic spines are sites of synaptic plasticity and their head size correlates with the strength of the corresponding synapse. We recently showed that the distribution of spine head sizes follows a lognormal-like distribution even after blockage of activity or plasticity induction. As the cytokine tumor necrosis factor (TNF) influences synaptic transmission and constitutive TNF and receptor (TNF-R)-deficiencies cause changes in spine head size distributions, we tested whether these genetic alterations disrupt the lognormality of spine head sizes. Furthermore, we distinguished between spines containing the actin-modulating protein synaptopodin (SP-positive), which is present in large, strong and stable spines and those lacking it (SP-negative). Our analysis revealed that neither TNF-deficiency nor the absence of TNF-R1, TNF-R2 or TNF-R 1 and 2 (TNF-R1/R2) degrades the general lognormal-like, skewed distribution of spine head sizes (all spines, SP-positive spines, SP-negative spines). However, TNF, TNF-R1 and TNF-R2-deficiency affected the width of the lognormal distribution, and TNF-R1/2-deficiency shifted the distribution to the left. Our findings demonstrate the robustness of the lognormal-like, skewed distribution, which is maintained even in the face of genetic manipulations that alter the distribution of spine head sizes. Our observations are in line with homeostatic adaptation mechanisms of neurons regulating the distribution of spines and their head sizes.
   Lognormal-like skewed spine size distribution is maintained in tumor necrosis factor deficiency and receptor loss. Dendritic spines sizes are distributed lognormally with a high percentage of the population consisting of small spines and a small percentage of the population consisting of large spines. The logarithm of the data shows a normal distribution. In mice exhibiting TNF deficiency, the lognormal distribution is maintained, albeit with a differences in its width, with the TNF deficient mice having more small and large sized spines and less medium sized spines. This finding was also observed in mice lacking TNF-receptor 1 and partially in mice lacking TNF-receptor 2. In mice lacking both TNF-receptor 1 and receptor 2 the lognormal distribution of spine head sizes was maintained, however, the distribution was shifted to the left, indicating a globalised reduction in spine head sizes of all spines. Spines maintain a lognormal distribution in multiple different conditions including homo- and heterosynaptic plasticity, blockage of presynaptic transmitter release and genetic disruption of TNF or its receptors, strenghtening the concept of redistribution of spine head sizes as a crucial functional adaptation within the neuron. image

AB  - l-asparaginase degrades l-asparagine and some of them, to a lesser extent, also degrades l-glutamine. This enzyme is found in microorganisms, plants, and guinea pig serum. Acute lymphoblastic leukemia and other malignancies are treated with l-asparaginase because malignant cells need an exogenous source of l-asparagine, and this enzyme depletes this amino acid from serum. l-asparaginase is also used to prevent acrylamide formation, mainly in French fries. Currently, therapeutic l-asparaginase is produced by Escherichia coli and Erwinia chrysanthemi, but they cause hypersensitivity and toxic reactions in some patients. New l-asparaginases could boost treatment protocols and food quality. This work conducted a bioprospection in solid media for l-asparaginase production in fungi obtained from different sources and bacteria isolated previously from decaying maize grains. The best l-asparaginase producers, regarding the non-production of l-glutaminase or urease and not causing the media alkalinization, had the genus or species confirmed by DNA barcoding as Beauveria bassiana UEPG 43, Phomopsis sp. UnB 602, and Pseudomonas putida FEI3 33. These three microorganisms confirmed the production of l-asparaginase in liquid media, but P. putida FEI3 33 was the leading producer. A gene coding for a type II l-asparaginase was cloned from P. putida FEI3 33. A phylogenetic tree showed that the coded protein grouped mainly with other P. putida group species from the Pseudomonas genus. The obtained protein structure model showed the alpha/beta monomeric structure with the two characteristic domains in the monomeric form. In addition, a tetrameric model was also predicted.

AB  - The Biotic Interactions Hypothesis (BIH) predicts that species interactions will intensify from the poles to the tropics. We studied the ant-plant defensive interaction mediated by extrafloral nectaries (EFNs) in the castor bean plant, Ricinus communis, across a similar to 21 degrees latitudinal gradient in its naturalized range in India. Among our study sites, we found that the ant-EFN mutualism in castor bean gets stronger from sub-tropical to tropical latitudes. Investment in mutualism by plants and visitation by ants increased from higher to lower latitudes. Further, latitude significantly explained ant community composition. However, contrary to the predictions of the BIH, standing herbivory increased with latitude, perhaps because plants invest less in biotic defence at higher latitudes. To our knowledge, our study is the first to test for the patterns predicted by the BIH for an ant-plant interaction in the Paleotropics. Results from our study can also help inform sustainable pest control practices for R. communis since India is the world's largest producer of castor oil.
